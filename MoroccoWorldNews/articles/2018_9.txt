Rabat – Heavy rains fell across the province of Guelmim, a city in southern Morocco, often called Gateway to the Sahara, on Friday, have caused exceptional flooding in the city, and reportedly material damage, but no human casualties so far.  A video on YouTube shows a young man surfing the flooded street on a mattress before he fell down. According to a source from the scene, the people of the Saharan city lived in a state of panic, fearing to live again the same scenario of the floods of 2014, which cut off the city from the rest of the world and claimed the lives of dozens of people.

Rabat – Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell is satisfied with the Moroccan-Spanish cooperation against terrorism. Borell commented on the cooperation between the two countries in a statement to the press on the sidelines o the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday. Borrell said that cooperation between Spain and Morocco against terrorism “is an example to follow for other countries to address this scourge, because it is a cooperation that is beneficial for both parties.” The Spanish official described his talks with Nasser Bourita as “constructive and positive.” Morocco’s security services assisted several European countries, including Spain in fighting the scourge of terrorism.  Borrell added that the meeting covered several other issues, including migration to challenge the flow of undocumented migrants in Spain. The official also commended the collaboration between Spain and Morocco in the management of migratory inflows. Spanish former interior minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said in February 2017, that cooperation with Morocco is “fundamental” in combating terrorism, and human and drug trafficking.

Manama   –  Bahrain’s minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifah, said on Saturday that his country supports Morocco’s “serious and credible” efforts to find a political solution to the issue of the Moroccan Sahara, based on the autonomy initiative and related Security Council resolutions, and within the framework of the Kingdom’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Bahrain also supports Morocco against Iranian plots and Tehran’s “blatant interference” in its internal affairs, Sheikh Khalid ben Ahmed al-Khalifah said in a speech to the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly. In addition, the minister noted that his country remains committed to contributing to a more prosperous future for the peoples of the world and recognizes the importance of alliances in ensuring regional security and addressing risks that affect the stability, development and prosperity of nations, particularly in the Gulf region.

By Ihsane Elidrissi Elhassani Rabat – “The adoul (notary) examination results for the year 2018 were unveiled July 21; 299 women candidates passed, making up 37 percent of the 800 successful candidates.” Behind this seemingly anodyne announcement hides one of the most controversial and bold decisions of King Mohammed VI of Morocco, a decision made on January 22, 2018, in his religious capacity as the commander of the faithful to allow women to become adoul. The profession until then had been reserved to men. The Supreme Scientific Council, the highest religious authority in Morocco, concluded that women could practice the profession of adoul, based on the legal provisions relating to testimony and the rules of the Maliki School of Islamic thought, the religious doctrine adopted in Morocco. As work began on the reform of Law 16.03 governing the adoul profession, controversy arose. In its text, there is no explicit provision limiting the profession to men, but some consider allowing women to be adoul would be inconsistent with Sharia. Others believe that it is a step forward for women in society. The decision and the journey to reach it opened an age-old debate surrounding the ability of women to be competent witnesses and plunged the country into a jurisprudential crisis, bringing to the forefront glaring contradictions and discrepancies.  Debates on the subject ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous as the intellectual, psychological, and physical abilities of women were put on trial. A quick search on the internet gives a taste of some of the reasons invoked to justify the perceived inherent inability of women to be competent witnesses: “forgetfulness.”  One celebrity scholar, an “improvised” neuroscientist, explained that men have a gland in their brain which women apparently lack that allows them to be able to speak, listen, and remember information at the same time. The scholar had to announce in the middle of his explanation that he had forgot the name of the gland. Adoul, the plural of adl, is a word engraved into the Moroccan psyche as the two religious men who conclude marriages. They work in tandem because two are needed for a testimony to be valid in certain instances. The word’s literal meaning is “just,” a shortening of the full phrase, “shahid adl,” or a “just witness.”  “Shahid adl,” or adoul as it is commonly referred to in Morocco, is not a profession or function that finds its roots in religion. In the Qur’an, it is used as a description of the qualities that a judge or a witness should have.  Even if the profession of adoul in Morocco borrowed its name from the Qur’an, it is in essence a legal, not religious, profession. Somehow the solemn aspect of the adoul’s traditional gear, age, and often white beards, combined with the ceremonial aspect of the role, caused confusion. The religious marriage in Islam does not require the blessing of a religious figure. The conditions that make a marriage conform to Sharia or not are consent, witnesses, and a dowry. It is not very different from what is recognized in the West as a civil marriage. It is simply a contractual agreement. If the bond between husband and wife meets the legal requirements, the two can exchange property and share marital assets. The religious validity lies in meeting the contract’s requirements. There is no other religious protocol, and certainly no blessing from any religious figure. Adoul can perform several tasks, such as drawing contracts, including contracts of marriage and divorce settlements; making certification; approving wills; and adjudicating inheritance. So why was the profession of adoul off limits for women in Morocco, especially since women can take office as judges, public notaries, lawyers, and expert witnesses? Even more absurd, the adoul job classification is “court aide or assistant,” and by law, it is lower in hierarchy than a judge. Even if the adoul is a liberal profession, the adoul is auxiliary to the court and could report to a judge which could be a woman. Further, a woman lawyer can opine on a marriage contract drawn by adoul; a woman judge can issue a judgment on the validity of a marriage contract, drawn and witnessed by adoul; and a woman expert witness can be called to testify on facts surrounding a contract drawn the male adoul. On the surface, the function of adoul is based purely on legal abilities, and Moroccan women were allowed to practice all sorts of legal professions decades ago. It is surprising to learn that what stood as a hurdle on the way of women and the adoul profession is simply the testimony component. Testimony (shahada) is an attestation with regard to a right of a party against a third. So why can’t women testify? Why can’t they be trusted with firsthand knowledge of something? Why is their perception of things deemed inherently flawed? Can’t they remember what they perceive and retell it?  The only verse of the Qur’an that evokes the gender of a witness and has been interpreted by some as equating the testimony of two women to that of one man, is the verse about debt. In Surah 2, verse 282, it says “Call upon two of your men to act as witnesses; and if two men are not available, then a man and two women from among such as are acceptable to you as witnesses.” The verse goes on to explain the reason for seeking testimony from two women in place of the testimony of one man, by saying “…so that if one of them should make a mistake (errs), the other could remind her.”  There has never been a unanimous opinion as to the religious stance on the value of women’s testimony. Some scholars categorized the verse as a recommendation or merely instructional and without legal import. Others opined that the recording of debts, witnessing, and all other matters dealt with in the verse may be categorized as obligatory. Hence, in financial documents, two men or one man and two women are needed. Some Muslim countries adopt this rule across the board and equate women’s testimony to half that of men’s as a general matter. Opinions also diverge on whether women’s testimony is not accepted in all matters including marriage, or whether the prohibition is confined to matters of punishments for serious crimes. There are some views claiming that all Muslims can be witnesses, with a few exceptions. The divine guidance makes no claim that a woman’s testimony is worth half; in any case, it is only a recommendation. It would be for the court judge to decide what kind and whose evidence will be enough on a case by case basis. Regarding the prophetic narration that is used to prove the half-testimony status of women, there is some doubt surrounding its reliability, and above all, the narration cannot be used in all general cases because it relates only to financial matters.  Some scholars have engrossed themselves in studies emphasizing the biological and psychological differences between men and women, thereby attempting to derive evidence from divine revelation to support their opinion. It seems that women’s natural tendency to be forgetful, to fall into error, to be cajoled or to be forced to give false testimony are connected to women’s inherent inequality to men, and the predominance of cold and wetness in their physical constitution.  Psychology was not spared as a justification either: mental fragility, temperament, and what women lack prevents them from submitting their testimony on such subjects as land boundaries, marriages, or divorces.  Some scholars chose the flat rejection route, believing the rule does not need an additional sanction over and above the law of God as revealed in the Qur’an. The divine command sufficed to give the rejection of women’s testimony momentum and a sacred orthodoxy.  The debate surrounding the numerical value of witnesses’ testimony, including the probative value of women’s, is not unique to Morocco or to the Muslim world. In civil law, the process of proof rested fundamentally on a numerical system. A single witness to a fact was not sufficient; specific numbers of witnesses were in certain cases required. The weight to be given to each witness’s testimony was measured and represented in numerical value, even by counting halves and quarters of a witness. Common law used the numerical rule in perjury. In Roman law, the general rule was that one witness alone was insufficient. The ecclesiastical law developed the numerical principle freely and elaborated many specific rules as to the number of witnesses necessary in various situations. The rules surrounding testimony were a natural reflection of the fixed popular probative notions of each period of time, notions that saw the value of a witness increased, decreased, or neutralized depending on the social ranking, slavery, freedom status, or gender. Women’s testimony, too, obeyed the popular belief which excluded women or attributed a lesser numerical value to their testimony.  The legal life experienced a multitude of stages including the divine, the formal, and the intellectual stages, but the transition from one stage to the other did not occur abruptly and immediately. Now the principle of evidence is largely acknowledged to be unsound and deleterious, nonetheless a form of history worth examining. The flaws that were attributed to women proved to be valid for women and men. The world realized long ago that the palest ink is better than the best memory and has moved from the oral tradition to the written one, minimizing the need for witnesses.  What is on trial in Morocco is not the testimony per se, but women themselves. This is the common denominator for all the topics involving women’s rights in Morocco. An overwhelming sense of deja vu reminds the public of when the family code was reformed, the first woman MP, the first woman minister, and when women were allowed to serve in the police forces. They were trials with prejudice and one goal: establish women’s inferiority. So many theories were called upon, the tutorship of men over women, women’s financial dependence on men, and the right of women to half of the inheritance that men are entitled to. The reasoning seems to be done in total abstraction from the real context; it is completely theoretical and does not take into consideration the new factors.  Forgetfulness was debated as if we were still stuck in the oral tradition, and the agreement of the parties cannot be recorded in writing. Then there was the erroneous perception of the adoul as a religious figure giving religious weight to the marriage.  Stripped from the dogma, adoul is a legal profession established by law, classified as auxiliary to the court. To practice as adoul, you need to meet the eligibility criteria, including having the appropriate degree, succeeding in a competition, and completing training.  The functions of adoul are set by law. On drawing contracts of marriage, the adoul do not need to have a supernatural memory because they have written contract templates. Recording the spouses’ identities when they present their ID cards, filling the dowry amount and the date of the contract and authenticating the signatures are hopefully things that a graduate male or female with lengthy training can do.

By Isabella Wang Rabat – Just over a year has passed since the first Australian embassy was established in Rabat. MWN interviewed Australian Ambassador Berenice Owen-Jones, revealing the progress in relations and the pioneering woman behind it.  When Berenice Owen-Jones came to Morocco as the first Australian ambassador, she was faced with a void. While the diplomatic relationship between Morocco and Australia had been established in 1976, there was in fact very little in Morocco to show this tangibly. There was no prior diplomatic post, and the relationship lacked infrastructure: no embassy, no chancellery, not even a database or contact list to provide a launching point. Reflecting on the beginning of her ambassadorship, Owen-Jones reminisces with incredulity, “When I landed here in July here last year, there was nothing.” Before her ambassadorship, Owen-Jones had envisaged Morocco as a country of wonderment and beauty. Like the conventional perceptions of the country, her ideas of Morocco were based on the symbiosis of fantasies and travels.  She outlined, “I first came to Morocco a couple years ago and went to Marrakech. Morocco had this aura. I fantasized about Morocco; a lot of people do really. So I was delighted to be able to go on this trip.” But with Owen-Jones’ ambassadorship came dramatic shifts in her sentiments towards the country. Wonder transformed into determination and action, as Owen-Jones sought to uncover the many intricacies of Moroccan culture, society, and politics and pioneer the previously anemic Morocco-Australia relations. Owen-Jones’ goal was unequivocally simple: to overcome the “tyranny of distance” which will always be an inescapable fact in the relationship between Morocco and Australia. Her efforts in the first year of her ambassadorship have underscored that surmounting the distance is certainly possible.  The ambassador notes, “I felt a bit like an explorer planting the flag in a new country, and that was quite exciting, and it was really up to me to work out the scope of the relationship, to make those networks.” Setting upon her diplomatic mission, Ambassador Owen-Jones has uncovered a new terrain of diverse relationships and projects in Morocco as she establishes bilateral relations through a multitude of fronts: from the chiefly political and parliamentary fronts to the educational and economic.  Owen-Jones, alongside her counterpart, Moroccan Ambassador to Australia Karim Medrek, have organized a parliamentary dialogue between Morocco and Australia. Together they have forged a Morocco-Australia parliamentary friendship group to ensure that each country’s legislative institutions exchange and share views on bilateral relations, both on the regional and international level.  Indeed, this month marks the visit of El Habib El Malki, speaker of the House of Representatives, to Australia, a further step in advancing and promoting parliamentary cooperation.
 Over the past year, Owen-Jones has also fortified Australia’s dialogue with Morocco on counter-terrorism. She notes the many efforts which define Australia and Morocco’s agreement on the issue, “We are already working with Morocco on counter terrorism in the Global Coalition against Daesh [ISIS] and Global Forum against Terrorism. Basically, we share the same goals in those forums. We share the same view the transnational nature of terrorist threat requires comprehensive, cooperative, and united approach at all levels.” Looking to Morocco as a paragon of counter-terrorism, sharing expertise is particularly significant for the ambassador. With the July 2017 terrorist plot targeting an Etihad flight departing from Sydney coming just before her ambassadorship, Owen-Jones stresses that counter-terrorism is an integral facet to bilateral relations.  She lauds the ability of Morocco to combat terrorism and prevent radicalization through a multi-pronged approach, admiring that Morocco’s counter-terrorism policy integrates “a security dimension while helping to promote economic growth and social and human development; preservation of religious and cultural identity, whilst strengthening rule of law.” Yet, the ambassador is nevertheless anticipating the progress to come. She outlines imminent plans to bolster strategies on counter-terrorism, “Our ambassador for counter terrorism [Paul Foley] is coming to Morocco in a couple of weeks to attend a countering violent extremism conference in Marrakech in prisons actually, and we will organise a bilateral cause.” Owen-Jones’ past year as ambassador has seen her lead the frontier of relations in the business and economic sector. She notes, “I’m very pleased that the relationships on the business and commercial fronts are well on track.” She stresses the positive efforts of the Australia-Morocco Business Council in Marrakech, a platform for Moroccan and Australian businesses to discuss investment opportunities and market dynamics.  Since 2008, Australia has had economic representation in Morocco; the Australian Commission for Trade and Investment (Austrade) had appointed Osama Alaoui as the representative in Morocco.  The ambassador had sought to extend such ties. In 2017, Australian investment in Morocco was booming with AUD 150 million financing the mining sector and $110 million in agriculture.  In February, she co-chaired in Morocco Austrade’s 6th “Australia unlimited” event. The event sought to showcase, particularly to the many Moroccan attendees from the political, economic and business world, what Australia can offer in trade and investment. But the ambassador envisions more for bilateral relations. With a strong steely look her in eyes, she affirms, “I’d like Australia to see Morocco as a partner choice in the region and vice versa.” These are not the only plans for the ambassador: She now ambitiously focuses upon opening Australia to the rest of Africa. Afro-relations is a terrain rarely traversed in Australian politics.  But Owen-Jones hopes that the relationship between Morocco and Australia can bring further diplomacy and greater interactions in the region. She praises Morocco’s exemplary efforts with Africa, “Morocco is very influential in Africa. There is a depth of knowledge not just of Francophone Africa but all of Africa. And this is under the leadership of the King.” In pioneering relations with Morocco, she hopes that she will be able to dispel Australians’ misconceptions and ignorance about Africa. Her newly minted diplomatic post is the first of a greater outreach by the Australia government.  As outlined in the Foreign Policy White Paper, Australia now looks towards Africa for greater relations. Ambassador Owen-Jones will be at the vanguard of this mission, as she insists on the need for greater awareness about Africa in Australia. To truly understand Africa is to both recognize the prosperous continent as a whole while also acknowledging the unique identities of the 54 states.  Only last month on August 29-31, Australia held its 16th Africa Down Under Conference, which sought to foster awareness of Australian interests in African mining, energy, and agribusiness. The conference was the central pillar to Australia’s “Africa Week,” which comprised satellite events, such as the Australia-Africa University Network Forum and the Australian Africa Infrastructure Conference, all with the aims of creating a dialogue between Australia and Africa.  The ambassador speaks proudly of the growing investments, as she lists the many manifestations of the thriving relationship. “There are currently 170 ASX listed companies, operating in 35 countries in Africa; 2-way goods and merchandise trades have reached 7.6 billion AUD in 2017.” With the significant progression of Australia-Moroccan relations, certain issues nevertheless remain uncharted territories. Western Sahara is undoubtedly one of them.  When asked about Australia’s stance on Western Sahara, Owen-Jones is neutral and diplomatic, reiterating precisely the statement of Australia, made in the United Nations: “Australia recognizes the Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory in accordance with UN classifications and we encourage all parties to dialogue on the issue.” She further outlines Australia’s neutrality, “We continue to urge all parties to support and continue all efforts to reach a lasting and peaceful political settlement for the Western Sahara. How we do that? We support UN efforts to find a settlement for the Western Sahara and we encourage progress towards referendum, commend the continual efforts of MINURSO and the UN Special Envoy Horst Kohler to resolving the conflict.” Yet the ambassador’s demeanour changes when questioned about Australia’s trade ties with Morocco and Western Sahara. When questioned about the controversial phosphates trade, imported from Morocco, yet sourced from Western Sahara, she disagrees adamantly.  She insists that Australian companies, like Wesfarmers, have ceased imports, and that less than 2% of the phosphates come from the Western Sahara territory.  In 2015, Australian company Incitec Pivot imported 63,000 tons of phosphate worth $7.48 million from the region, making it the world’s sixth largest importer of phosphates from Western Sahara.  Only earlier this year in March did Lee Rhiannon, a senator from the Australian Greens party further question the company’s imports of Western Saharan phosphates: “The most significant resource exported by Morocco from Western Sahara is high-quality phosphate rock for agricultural fertiliser. Australia’s Incitec Pivot Ltd—IPL—purchases this fertiliser. Two other Australian fertiliser manufacturers have actually withdrawn from the trade since 2010. IPL has ordinarily received three shipments annually with a total value of A$14 million.” Rhiannon’s statements came with a reprimand for Morocco and its claim on Western Sahara.  The inconsistencies in Australia’s discourse on the Western Sahara dispute reveal a need for greater exploration of the issue. With the Western Sahara issue, prominent on the Moroccan agenda, a comprehensive and consensual position would enable a more accurate assessment of Morocco and Australia’s trade relationship and forge a more genuine and realistic dialogue.  Questions also loom for Australia-Morocco relations after the tumultuous shifts in Australian politics at the end of August. With a relaxed and nonchalant tone, the ambassador assures continuity: “It’s business as usual.” But Australia has been more sceptical.  Susan Rimmer, Australian Research Council Future Fellow of Griffith University has addressed her concerns over the momentum of Australia’s foreign policy under the new leadership of Prime Minister Scott Morrison. She critiques, “Morrison’s foreign policy credentials are slim and his interest in foreign policy is low, not rating even a mention in his first speech to the nation as PM.” Critical for Morocco’s Islamic identity, Scott Morrison’s views on Islam are dubious; a 2011 shadow cabinet leak revealed that he had urged his party to capitalize on the electorate’s anxieties concerning immigration and Muslims in Australia.  Yet, the trajectory for Australia-Morocco relations is nevertheless optimistic. Ultimately what upholds the very integrity of Australia-Morocco relations is humanity.  For Owen-Jones, the relationship between Morocco and Australia must transcend just economic figures and a public façade of official visits and diplomatic hand-shaking. Her ambassadorship seeks to truly interact and change the individual lives of Moroccans, particularly those in rural areas, who may be marginalized from access to resources.   The ambassador’s eyes brighten slightly, and a wave of joy tinged with concern sweeps her face as she outlines the development funds under way. Project SOAR is a program aiming to empower girls through academic support, education and empowerment coaching. While Morocco has established the legal equality of women in the family code, and the status of women is undoubtedly improving, there are still problems of illiteracy and gender equity, particularly the high dropout rate of girls from school in rural areas.  With specific support provided by the Australian Direct Aid Program, Ambassador Berenice Owen-Jones has championed the cause, visiting one of the program’s efforts in Essaouira, the “Girl Leaders Club.” Reflecting on her time, Owen-Jones says, “There is still a lot of work to be done. The fact that the embassy has been able to help in that way, but in a very tangible way is fantastic.” The tangible impact of her ambassadorship is integral to Owen-Jones’ aims. She repeats in awe, “You can see it, the light bulb moment within them,” as she refers to the tremendous rewards of empowering the more marginalized populations of Morocco. Such experiences extend further to the humanitarian work of Australian NGO “Red Goes Faster.” In the remote villages of the Merzouga region in eastern Morocco, the organization provides wheelchairs to disabled children, while also establishing the infrastructure to fit such wheelchairs according to the standards of the World Health Organization.  Wheelchairs unlock a whole new realm of movement and possibility for the children.  “It’s an extraordinary thing to do because we’re making a real difference to the lives of these children” she says, later showcasing the myriad of photographs depicting her time with the children.  Looking back on the formidable year that has passed, I ask Owen-Jones about her proudest achievements. After outlining the many projects, visits, and obstacles of her ambassadorship, she pauses before noting, “Being a bit of a trailblazer. It’s a new embassy and I’ve set it up.” Her eyes gleam, unapologetically proud. Trailblazer. It is certainly an apt title.

Rabat – The UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara has invited Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front for talks in Geneva. According to AFP, the talks are scheduled to take place on December 4-5. Horst Kohler sent letters to Morocco and the other parties, calling on them to give his a response by October 20. According to a diplomatic source cited by AFP, the talks will come in the form of a roundtable where Morocco, the Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania would decide on the framework of future negotiations. Read Also: Western Sahara: Kohler Meets Algeria, Mauritania FMs at UN During his briefing to the Security Council on August 8, Kohler expressed his intention to invite to invite the parties and neighboring countries Algeria and Mauritania to direct talks in late November or early December.  Kohler made it clear then that the talks would not touch on substantive issues, but would allow the parties to discuss a general framework for future negotiations.  Morocco maintains its firm position on the Western Sahara conflict, considering its proposed Autonomy Plan as a realistic and serious solution to end the dispute over the region. Morocco has repeatedly stressed that there can be no solution to the conflict without Algeria’s involvement.  The North African country strongly refuses to hold talks with Polisario, arguing that it “does not have any freedom or independence to make a decision without getting back to Algeria.”  Morocco has repeatedly called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict. Morocco’s demands were renewed in a speech by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. El Othmani also condemned the “tragic” situations of Sahrawis “held” in the Tindouf camps, in the westernmost province of Algeria. However, Algeria has refused any direct participation in the political process, claiming that the conflict should be solved between Morocco and Polisario. Earlier this week, Kohler met with Algeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister Abdelkader Messahel and Mauritania’s foreign minister, Ismail Ould Al Sheikh. Kohler’s meeting could be a move to push Algeria to join the discussion table to reach a political solution to the conflict.

Algeria has always refused to let the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to conduct a census to determine the exact number of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. On Friday, UNHCR issued a statement in which it confirmed that the official figures used for humanitarian aid for the camps “remain unchanged.” The statement added that its “official planning figure for the most vulnerable Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf camps in Algeria remains 90,000.”

Rabat – Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu welcomed Ahed Tamimi, the Palestinian teen who served eight months in prison for slapping an Israeli soldier. The symbol of the Palestinian struggle visited the Bernabeu at the request of Real Madrid. The visit took place yesterday a few hours before a game between Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. Tamimi visited Spain along her father to participate in several political events. She met with Real Madrid’s current senior manager and former forward Emilio Butragueno. Tamimi also received a Real Madrid jersey with her name on it. The Palestinian activist was freed from Israel’s HaSharon prison on July 29. The Palestinian girl was convicted of assaulting an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier. Real Madrid’s move received criticism from Israel’s foreign ministry spokesman, Emmanuel Nahshon. The official took to his twitter to criticize Real Madrid on Sunday. Ahed Tamimi está promoviendo violencia contra ciudadanos israelies. @realmadrid – recibir una terrorista que incita al odio y a la violencia es algo que no tiene nada que ver con los valores universales de fútbol. https://t.co/DGN2NDWTMx — Yoav Katz ?? (@YoavKatz) September 29, 2018  Nahshon wrote that “Tamimi is not a peaceful fighter but an advocate of violence and terror.” He added that Real Madrid “encourages aggression (…) Today, I a not going to the Bernabeu,” he added. Ahed Tamimi no es una luchadora pacífica sino una defensora de la violencia y el terror. Las instituciones que la recibieron y festejaron alientan indirectamente la agresión y no el diálogo y el entendimiento que necesitamos.

Rabat –  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed in a statement issued Friday that the official figures used for humanitarian aid planning for the Tindouf camps remain unchanged. “UNHCR would like to confirm that our official planning figure for the most vulnerable Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf camps in Algeria remains 90,000,” it said in a statement posted on its official website. Denying Figures Put Forward by Algeria and ‘Polisario’, UNHCR Confirms Consistent Position on Assessment of Humanitarian Aid in Tindouf and calls on member donors to ensure that the humanitarian aid destined for the Tindouf is commensurate with the estimated needs of the population. “UNHCR will continue to rely on these figures until a full-fledged registration exercise is carried out. In the meantime, these figures remain an estimate of needs in the camps pending the outcome of an inter-agency vulnerability assessment. UNHCR calls on donors to ensure that humanitarian assistance is commensurate with the estimated needs,” it added. In this way, UNHCR denies the biased figures conveyed in recent weeks by Algeria and the “Polisario” and reaffirms the imperative of registration in accordance with its mandate and successive Security Council resolutions since 2011. UNHCR’s statement strengthens Morocco’s consistent position calling for the census and registration of the populations of the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – Austria’s foreign affairs minister Karin Kneissl surprised the UN General Assembly today as she began her speech in Arabic. After greeting delegations, Knessl explained why she chose to begin her address in Arabic. “Arabic is one of the six languages of the United Nations,” she said. The Austrian official added that she studied Arabic at “the UN in Vienna. It is a beautiful and important language and part of the Arab and ancient civilization,” she said. The diplomat received applause from the General Assembly. Meanwhile, Algeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel delivered his speech in French. Several news outlets criticized Messahel for his choice to address the General Assembly in French. Algeria’s Movement of Society for Peace allegedly describing his choice as “ a violation of national sovereignty and violation of the constitution.” According to Arabic RT, Messahel’s move is an evidence of “the lack of sincerity of decision-makers in their frequent talk about patriotism.”

Washington DC – Republican Congressman Joe Wilson, along with his colleagues Carlos Curbelo (Republican) and Democrat Gerry Connolly, introduced a first-ever bill in the U.S. Congress at the House of Representatives, in which they reaffirm the relationship between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Morocco. Wilson and his colleagues also condemned the collusion between the separatist movement of the polisario and Hezbollah, as well as Iran’s destabilizing aims in North Africa and beyond. “The Kingdom of Morocco was the first country to formally recognize the United States in 1777 and remains a strong ally and partner for peace in the Middle East and North Africa,” stresses Congressman Joe Wilson on his official website, while condemning the recent actions of the polisario, a terrorist organization funded by Iran. The bill criticizes Iran for providing “monetary and other forms of material support to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, which the United States has designated (…) as a foreign terrorist organization,” pointing to the destabilizing aims of Iran and its ally Hezbollah in North Africa that go against the national security objectives of the United States. The bill also reaffirms support for the Moroccan autonomy plan, which it describes as “serious, realistic and credible,” and which represents a path forward to satisfy the aspirations of the Sahara populations to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. The text calls on President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the Ambassador to the United Nations, to assist the United Nations in supporting a peaceful agreement to the Sahara conflict that is consistent with the United States position, which has repeatedly described the autonomy plan as ” serious, realistic and credible.” In his first reaction to the submission of the draft bill, Moroccan minister of foreign affairs, Nasser Bourita, said that this move reaffirms the strong relations between Morocco and the United States. “This Resolution is a powerful reaffirmation of the U.S.-Morocco relationship, which has existed for hundreds of years. Our strong economic and security partnerships are critical to maintaining peace and prosperity around the region. We look forward to continuing our counterterrorism work with the United States and challenging any efforts to destabilize the North Africa region,” Morocco’s foreign minister, said in a statement to Morocco World News. If the bill becomes law, it would provide support to Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. But before a draft bill reaches the House floor and is adopted into law, it goes through a complicated process and long debates inside Congress committees and subcommittees. As per US Congress rules, draft bills introduced by members of Congress are referred to the Speaker of House, who places it on the calendar of the committee to which it was assigned. If members of Congress don’t act on the bill, it is “killed.” Once a draft bill is adopted by the House of Representative it is sent to the office of the President for signature. A draft bill becomes law after it signed by the President or if the latter does not sign it while Congress is in session.

Rabat – In a meeting with Dutch foreign minister, Morocco’s Foreign minister has reiterated outright refusal of Netherlands’ interference in Morocco’s Rif events. Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita handed his Dutch counterpart Stef Bloc a letter in response to his remarks in Dutch Parliament. Bourita met Bloc at the UN headquarters Friday, September 28, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. In April, Bloc warned Moroccan-Dutch activists to be careful when visiting Morocco because when they are in Morocco, police consider bi-nationals as Moroccans only. Bloc made his remarks in a parliamentary session in the Netherlands in answer to a Dutch MP’s question about the Moroccan court’s decision to sentence Moroccan activists to up to 20 years in prison. Bourita emphasized in his yesterday’s letter that Bloc’s act cannot be accepted by Morocco “both in form and content.” The act “constitutes a flagrant negative position taken against the Kingdom it that it contains some false facts, inadequate terms, erroneous assessments of facts and inappropriate reflections,” the Moroccan minister said according to state-owned news agency Maghreb Press Agency (MAP). The Moroccan foreign minister stressed that Morocco “has no lessons to receive from anyone and that the Kingdom was able to strengthen its institutions which are the basis and guarantors of its stability.” In July, Bourita commented on the Netherlands’ remarks saying, “I have made it clear that the Rif’s Hirak is a strictly internal affair and is by no means an object of diplomatic discussion.” He added that Morocco respects the decisions of Dutch courts, and therefore, “they must respect ours.” On Tuesday, June 26, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced Hirak Rif activists to 1 to 20 years in prison. The activists were arrested for their involvement in protests that rocked Al Hoceima in 2016 and 2017. The activists had been detained for protesting against social disparities in Al Hoceima in 2016 and 2017.

Rabat – Cristiano Ronaldo is firing back at German magazine Der Spiegel.  Der Spiegel has published the testimony of a 34-year-old American who accused the football star of raping her at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.  This is the first time that Kathryn Mayorga opens up publicly about her “story.” She claims that the Portuguese footballer raped her in 2009, after which he had her sign a confidentiality agreement and payed her $ 375,000.  The superstar is refuting the charges, claiming to have had “consensual” intercourse with her. He appealed to a lawyer in Germany and attacked the weekly Der Spiegel for the publication of the article. Juventus striker has also reacted to the rumors on social media. Ronaldo commented on charges of raping during a live Instagram.  “It’s a lie. She wants to become famous thanks to my name. These situations are part of my job,” said the football player. These accusations first surfaced a year and a half ago, but Kathryn Mayorga’s name only appeared recently.  Last year, Ronaldo called the revelation “journalistic fiction”, letting the media know that the sexual relationship had been “agreed.” However, according to Kathryn Mayorga’s lawyer, they have a document challenging Cristiano Ronaldo’s version, claiming that the victim had said “no” and “stop” several times.

Rabat- DGSN’s open days, themed “National Security, Citizen Police,” have opened the door for better communication between the Moroccan police and public.  The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) event at Bab Jdid square in Marrakech started on September 26 and is continuing until Sunday, September 30.  The event has welcomed both tourists and citizens in the ocher city.  So far, the open days have succeeded in bringing the public and police together for DGSN to become open to its social circle, inform the public of the missions of the various security units and corps, and show their advanced equipment.  From how the police detect fake passports to how they deduce causes of death in crime scenes, DGSN members have explained their work to the public in live action.  DGSN has conducted 56 simulation exercises, involving the cavalry, police dogs, biker brigades, a musical troop, the infantry brigade, and rapid reaction forces, in addition to parades and educational tours around the region for the benefit of school children.  Entertainment programs and 29 stands have also been set up during the open days to teach the public about the police force and scientific support.  At the opening of the event, the DGSN police commissioner in the Marrakech-Safi region said that the event mirrors a progressive change in the directorate’s strategy, moving from its first open days in Casablanca in 2017 to a culture of open doors to more communication on security action. The event has set its sights on completing 10 conferences to answer the public’s questions  on various security-related issues and the national strategy to combat terrorism and cybercrime, including more informative sessions, such as how DGSN conducts DNA analysis. Many attendees have given positive feedback about the event, both online and in interviews with Moroccan television channels. They expressed excitement and eagerness to learn about DGSN’s next displays. “I came to this event to discover the missions of the directorate, so that I and all youth can become active citizens in terms of security. The citizen should also collaborate with [DGSN] for the sake of national security,” one bystander commented in an interview with Moroccan channel 2M.  Attendees can get information about the event’s programs from brochures and posters on site or the mobile application “JPO Police.” DGSN organized its first open days on September 14-16, 2017, in Casablanca’s International Fair under the theme, “National Security: Commitment and Loyalty.” Around 80,000 visitors, Moroccans and foreigners alike attended the first event. Hamid Bdri, police chief of Anfa district in Casablanca, said the first event in 2017 said came as a response to “those claiming that there is a gap between citizens and police.” “What is published in the media or what is said on social media gives the impression that there is a gap … We should lift all the hurdles that prevents citizens getting access to security services because those services are now a constitutional right,” he stated.

Rabat – The minister of energy  has shared that Morocco mined 35.11 million tons of minerals and precious metals in 2017, earning MAD 56.5 billion in revenue. In 2016, mines produced 28.92 million tons, and mining investments amounted to MAD 32 billion. Mining production, 90 percent of which is phosphates, made up 10 percent of GDP and 20 percent ??of Morocco’s exports. Morocco also mines gold, silver, copper, zinc, and cobalt. Minister of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rebbah shared the figures Thursday, September 27, at a panel. Rebbah was speaking at the panel on “Mineral Resource Exploitation in Africa” in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. According to the minister, the mining sector created 41,000 direct job positions in 2017. In its latest industry trend analysis, the BMI research group ranked Morocco’s mining sector as the second most attractive market in the MENA region, after Saudi Arabia, with an overall Mining Risk Reward Index (RRI) score of 56.3 out of 100. The main actors in the mining sector in Morocco are the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development, public institutions, and the Federation of Mineral Industry (FDIM). Morocco, Rebbah said, has a national strategy for developing the mining sector of phosphates and non-phosphates.  The integrated strategy aims to reduce production costs, increase mining and chemical production capacities, and double phosphate production capacity. The strategic vision of the phosphate sector, which aims to strengthen Morocco’s leadership position, has received MAD 200 billion from the government, Rebbah added. According to a 2017 report by BMI, Morocco accounted for 73.5 percent of the world’s 68 billion tons of total phosphate reserves.  Morocco has over 50 billion tons in proven phosphate reserves. In the non-phosphate mining sector, Rebbah stated that Morocco has ambitious goals for 2025 to develop the sector.  The objective is to triple the sector’s turnover, multiply investment tenfold in exploration and mining research, and double job positions. The panel in Ouagadougou was organized as part of the third week of mining activities of West Africa (SAMAO). Its objective is to provide business opportunities to public and private sector actors to attract investors for mining and sustainable development.

Rabat- Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi has finally spoken about the controversy over Darija (Moroccan Arabic). Amzazi, who was the guest of the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) Forum on Wednesday, said that the case of Darija in school books is “permanently closed.” He added that the decision followed the controversy that erupted from the use of a few words in Darija, an unwritten dialect, in school books. “There was no intention to introduce the Moroccan Arabic into school books,” Amzazi said. On September 5, as children went back to school, photos of texts from schools books with a few words in Darija went viral on social media. Words like “baghrir” (Moroccan pancake) and “brewat” (sweet treats) sparked outrage among the public. Both the Ministry of Education and the government came under intense criticism. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani weighed in, saying Darija cannot be used in education because only two official languages are recognized by the Moroccan Constitution: Arabic and Tamazight (Berber). At the forum, Amzazi spoke about education reform and the need to increase efforts to promote student attendance. The minister said that the current rate of children enrolled in preschool education is 49.6 percent, more than 748,000 students. The new reforms included the opening of 4,000 new pre-school classes in public primary schools to accommodate 100,000 additional children. The ministry aims for 67 percent of children in the eligible age range to be pre-schooled by 2021. The ministry is also planning to train 65,000 new teachers to promote the quality of education. Amzazi noted that the Tayssir Program, which gives social support and funding, is benefiting 706,359 students. The program’s purpose is to decrease the school drop-out rate. According to the minister, when it was first created in 2008, the program had 87,795 beneficiaries. He added that the program reduced the dropout rate by 57 percent. Amzazi also wants to reduce school hours from 30 to 27 hours per week for the next school year.

Rabat – Dressed in black, football fans of Moghreb Tetouan are mourning the death of Hayat, the 20-year old woman killed by gunfire from the Royal Moroccan Navy while she was on a migrant boat on Tuesday. “We will sacrifice our soul and blood for you Hayat,” chanted the protesters after the game as they marched in solidarity with the 20-year old woman. Hayat Belkacem received a deadly gunshot while she was in an undocumented go-fast boat trying to cross the Mediterranean to the El Dorado. Her death infused indignation in many Moroccans who denounced the navy’s action to open fire on migrants.  Several videos of today’s protests went viral on social media. Protesters condemned the navy’s action through angry slogans. Some of the protesters cried “the people want to give up their nationality,” while others called on the government to hold Hayat’s “killer” accountable.  Morocco’s law enforcement announced earlier this week that an investigation was opened to determine the circumstances of the incident. Recently, hundreds of Moroccans have been attempting to reach Europe through risky routes. Some of them have even filmed their sea journey in undocumented migration boats while attempting to cross Morocco to southern Spain.  According to official statistics from the government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, 7,100 Moroccans attempted to reach Europe in 2018. The official said that Morocco is increasing efforts to combat immigration networks “which continue to develop their methods.” While figures of undocumented immigrants differ from a source to another, the Spanish Ministry of Interior has given an estimate of the number of undocumented Moroccans who entered Spain between 2016 and 2018. According to the ministry’s statistics, the number of Moroccan undocumented migrants who arrived in Spain between 2016 and 2018 is estimated at 10,104. The Spanish Ministry of Interior also indicated that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.” Melilla’s Minister of Social Welfare Daniel Ventura said that the military service has actually caused youth emigration from Morocco to the Spanish enclave. El Faro Melilla quoted on September 22, Melilla’s Minister of Social Welfare Daniel Ventura’s, who linked the surge of Moroccan migrants to Spain to the Mandatory Military Service. Ventura said that since the ministerial council approved the compulsory military service bill, minors have escaped to Melilla to “evade it.” Others did not hesitate to show support for Morocco’s neighbor, chanting “viva Espana!” Some of the protesters even carried the Spanish flags.

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita met with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Thursday.  The officials’ bilateral talks took part on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, which opened on September 18. The meeting was held on the eve of the Security Council meeting on Western Sahara. The Security Council is due to hold a number of meetings next month as it prepares to renew the mandate of the United Nations mission in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO. Morocco strives to secure Russia’s support for its strategy to include Algeria fully in the UN-led political process aimed at finding a mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara dispute. Morocco stresses that the Polisario- the breakaway movement that claims to represent the Saharawis and wants to establish an independent state in Western Sahara- is not master of its destiny and the only way to achieve a political solution to the conflict if for the United Nations to admit and includes Algeria in the negotiations. Nothing has filtered so far about the topics discussed during the meeting. Bourita also met with the foreign ministers of several countries present the UN, including Denmark, Chile, Cyprus, Vietnam, Indonesia and Poland. During his participation in the UN General Assembly, the Moroccan diplomat also held talks with Under-Secretary-General and the Head of the United Nations Office for Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT), Vladimir Voronkov.

Rabat- A viral video of PJD Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim holding hands with a young woman has awakened controversy over Yatim’s unfaithfulness.  The 28-second-long video has circulated social media networks since Thursday evening and shows Yatim holding hands with a woman who appears to be in her late 20s while walking down a street in Paris, France. An individual,  asserting that he heard from Hassan Badani, “a person close to the Justice and Development Party” (PJD), shared a Facebook post on Thursday night, claiming that Yatim had already proposed to the lady in the video and is awaiting divorce papers to end his current marriage. Badani claimed that Yatim’s friends, family, and some of his PJD colleagues all attended his engagement ceremony to the woman, who is allegedly a 30-year-old Moroccan psychotherapist and nurse.  The 62-year-old minister has been accused of being in a polygamous marriage.  In July, Yatim expressed disgust at the rumors that he had taken a second wife and condemned the act of polygamy, reiterating that he would never engage in it, no matter the circumstances. Polygamy is not an uncommon issue among Moroccan ministers; the former minister in charge of relations with the Parliament and civil society, Habib Choubani, and Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid are both pro-polygamists with two wives. In 2012, Morocco announced its commitment to applying the “ban on polygamy.” According to the 2004 Moroccan Family Code, a husband must obtain his wife’s consent before marrying another woman. The text reads: “The judge shall not authorize polygamy unless he has verified the husband’s ability to guarantee equality with the fist wife and her children in all areas of life, and there is an objective and exceptional motive that justifies polygamy.”

Rabat – The UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, has taken advantage of UNGA to meet Algerian and Mauritanian representatives.
 This week, Horst Kohler met with Algeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, which opened on September 18 in New York. The meetings could be a move from Kohler to convince Algeria to join a potential negotiation table to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco has repeatedly called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict and agree to join talks. Read Also: UN: El Othmani Addresses Algeria, ‘Tragic’ Sahrawi Situation in Tindouf Besides Messahel, Kohler also met Mauritania’s foreign affairs minister, Ismael Ould Al Sheikh. However, Kohler did not meet with Morocco’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, creating speculation. Kohler knows Morocco’s demands and position on the conflict. Bourita and other Moroccan officials, including Morocco’s permanent representative at the UN, Omar Hilale, have recalled Morocco’s position as well as the genesis of the regional dispute in numerous meetings. Read Also: Bourita Meets Trump in New York on Eve of SC Meeting on Western Sahara The most recent call came from Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, who addressed Algeria’s reluctance in his speech before the participants of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday.
 El Othmani also denounced the “tragic” situations of Sahrawis “held” in the Tindouf camps. Morocco has asserted that no solution in Western Sahara can be found outside Morocco’s sovereignty. Observers in Morocco and elsewhere are wondering why Kohler did not meet with the Moroccan minister in New York. 
 Read Also: Bolton Is Unlikely to Change US Position on Western Sahara According to World News co-founder Samir Bennis, Kohler’s meeting with the Algerian and Mauritanian foreign ministers have been a common practice for the past 10 years. He explained that UN personal envoys “traditionally take advantage of the high level of General Assembly to hold meeting with as many stakeholders as possible.”  Bennis dismissed the claim that Kohler has snubbed the Moroccan delegation or rejected to hold a meeting with it, since Morocco is the main concerned party and nothing can be achieved without its contribution.  One cannot speculate whether Morocco “refused to hold a meeting with the UN envoy or  Kohler did not request a meeting with Minister Nasser Bourita. Moroccan diplomats are the only ones who can know for certain whether there has been an attempt by Kohler to meet with the Moroccan foreign minister or not.” Bennis argued that perhaps because  Kohler knows Morocco’s principled position about the way forward, he did not feel the need to hold another meeting with the Moroccan officials.  “Morocco is fully aware that Morocco won’t agree to sit down with Polisario representatives as the separatist group does not have any freedom or independence to make a decision without getting back to Algeria,” he said.  Bennis went on to add that it is “common knowledge that it is Algeria that hosts the Polisario, it supports it at the diplomatic, financial and military level. Without this support since 1976, we would not be talking about the Polisario at this juncture.”  He added, “Morocco no longer wants to be beating around the bush and wants the UN and the international community to get serious about the Algerian responsibility and its role in prolonging the conflict. Only then can we envision a potential political solution to the conflict.” “If Algeria is just an observer in the conflict, how can one explain its refusal to let UNHCR conduct a census of the population of the Tindouf camps?” Samir concluded.

Rabat – Moroccan international football player Achraf Hakimi has impressed his coach, Lucien Favre, in his debut with Germany’s Borussia Dortmund.  In his first game, the Atlas Lion scored the third goal of the match, making his coach very proud of him. Dortmund dominated Nuremberg (7-0), on the fifth day of the Bundesliga, Wednesday, September 26. Will Hakimi become a key player in the German club?

He has a great future and a lot of potential to improve,” said Favre during a press conference. “He has great qualities. He is fast; he knows how to dribble, and he is comfortable in the one to one confrontations. It was very good for his first match,” he added.

Rabat – Amid an intense row between PJD and RNI, the PPS head has called on the coalition parties to answer youth’s demands instead of the ongoing quarrel. The secretary-general of the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS), Nabil Benabdellah, commented on the tragedy of the 20-year-old woman killed by gunfire from the Royal Moroccan Navy on a migrant boat on Tuesday. His comments came at the opening of the summer university of the PPS youth on Thursday. PPS is part of the government coalition, along with the Justice and Development Party (PJD) and the National Rally of Independents (RNI). Benabdellah, the former minister of housing, called on the government to deal with social events with “the necessary seriousness and overcome the marginal conflicts of some political components.” Benabdellah referred to the recent tension between PJD and RNI as representatives from both parties have traded critical remarks following RNI member Rachid Talbi Alami’s comments about the PJD. Alami, who is the minister of sports and youth, accused the PJD of “imitating” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and of “wishing to destroy the country.” PJD’s secretary-general deputy Slimane El Omrani responded to the accusation, describing Alami’s statements as “irresponsible and dangerous.” PJD member Abdelaziz Aftati called on RNI to withdraw from the government, a call that angered the secretary-general of RNI, Aziz Akhannouch. But for Benabdellah, it is surprising how there is conflict at a time when priority should be given to social issues. According to a statement from PPS, Benabdellah believes that “Morocco is living in a difficult situation, and that there is a growing gap in youth migration.” The statement added, “He stressed the need to be aware of the danger threatening Morocco, which could lead to dire consequences for the country.” He also conveyed his condolences to the family of the 20-year-old girl who was shot dead. Prior to the RNI-PJD conflict, PPS had its own flare-up with PJD after the dissolution of the water secretariat in August. The water department was run by PPS member Charafat Afilal. The argument escalated to the point Benabdellah threatened that the party might withdraw from the government since they had not received any prior notice of the decision to remove the water secretariat. The department was removed at a request from Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, the secretary-general of the PJD.

Rabat – A zebra has given birth in Rabat’s National Zoological garden. The female baby zebra was born after a one-year gestation to a zebra pair received from the Hannover Zoo in Germany in 2012, said the Rabat Zoo in a statement.  “This is the fourth birth of a Grant’s zebra, following those recorded in 2014, 2015 and 2016, which are the result of the adaptation of this species to its environment and the close management of the animals by veterinary teams and zootechnics, particularly in terms of care and health supervision,” the statement said. The Grant’s zebra is one of six subspecies of the plains zebra. It is characterized by its wide and well-marked stripes, and though it is the smallest of the plains zebras, it can reach between 1.2 and 1.4 meters in height and weigh about 30 kilograms at birth.  The Rabat Zoo has had around 100 births of more than 35 different species since the beginning of the year, following actions carried out under the ex-situ species conservation program. In June, Rabat’s zoo received a certificate of excellence from travel website TripAdvisor for the third time. Thanks to visitors’ positive reviews and high ratings, the zoo, along with its gardens, has become one of the most acclaimed attractions in Morocco, according to TripAdvisor. The zoo’s visitors have granted it an average rating of 4.5 out of five stars, and 88 percent of the ratings are positive, in recognition of the consistency and quality of services provided to visitors. Established in 2012, Rabat’s Zoological Garden has entertained approximately 4 million visitors, according to the state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat- Family and friends of Hayat, the young woman who died from navy gunfire while on a migrant speedboat, said their last goodbyes at her funeral on Wednesday. Hayat Belkacem, a 20-year-old woman received a deadly gunshot while aboard a Spanish go-fast boat trying to cross the Mediterranean, somewhere between M’diq and Fnideq on Tuesday.  News of Hayat’s tragic death shook her neighborhood, Jebel Dersa, in Tetouan, and infused indignation in many Moroccans who condemned the Moroccan navy’s action. Videos posted by Moroccan media show the sorrowful atmosphere of Hayat’s funeral. Crowds of people, friends, family, and neighbors cried as they  gathered around her house, consoling each other in shared sadness.  Many of the people repeated, amid hysterical cries, “What did she do to deserve death?” and “May God avenge the person who killed Hayat.”  In an interview with Moroccan news outlet Hespress, Hayat’s mother wept and said that her daughter’s dream was to migrate and find a job to support her family.  Hayat’s mother said that she sacrificed her education and dropped out of college, Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Law, to save her family from poverty. “She left at six in the morning; she said farewell to me and told me, ‘Pray for me.’… If only [the shooter] brought her back to me instead of killing her.”

Hayat’s parents say they are in a dire financial situation, raising five children, including Hayat.  Hayat’s father told the press that he did not know of his daughter’s plan to migrate to Spain until he received the news about her death on Tuesday night. He called on the government to compensate their family for Hayat’s death. Three other Moroccans on the boat, Lahabib (26), Hamza (25), and Mouad (32), were wounded by the gunfire. They are currently being hospitalized in M’diq-Fnideq prefecture. The shooting of a migrant boat, controlled by a Spanish national, also sparked the anger of Prince Moulay Hicham, a first cousin of King Mohammed VI. He took to his Twitter to convey his concern about the “social crisis.” “The incident, that cost the life of at least one Moroccan woman among the candidates for undocumented immigration in the waters of M’diq-Fnideq is tragic. This is a new facet of [Morocco’s] social crisis,” the prince wrote. He added, “We are witnessing a protest that goes from land to sea.” For the prince, “Border protection is a national duty, and without a doubt, the Royal Navy has respected the laws in force, but this is a military intervention in a protest action. In the past there has never been such an armed intervention against an illegal boat. Why this time?” Lately, Morocco has employed stricter methods of combating irregular migration to Europe, especially in the north. Police also blocked hundreds of Moroccans trying to leave for Europe from a beach in Martil, near Tetouan, on Saturday night, September 22, which led to protests calling for “free immigration.”

Rabat – After a series of tweets against Morocco 2026, the president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation now has Moroccan fans scratching their heads. On Thursday, Turki Al Sheikh wrote a Facebook post announcing his unwavering support for Morocco to replace Cameroon as the host of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. “In my capacity as President of the Arab Football Federation, I announce my full support for the brotherly Morocco in hosting the African Nations Championship instead of Cameroon,” said Al Sheikh. He also announced that he would offer any help if his “brothers from Morocco asked me to do so.” A campaign against Cameroon maybe? Throughout the competition between Morocco and the joint North American bid for the 2026 World Cup, Al Sheikh posted tweets hinting that Saudi Arabia would support its “strongest” Western ally in the vote to host the massive tournament.  Al Sheikh brought up the politics of Morocco’s neutrality in Saudi Arabia’s standoff with Qatar in regards to the vote, a mixture of politics and sports that did not sit well with Moroccans. But since Al Sheikh’s country was not part of the bid, Moroccans swallowed the remarks as South Africa also brought politics to explain their choice not to vote for Morocco’s bid. However, US President Donald Trump threatened countries to vote for the North American bid. In one of his controversial tweets, Al-Sheikh wrote,  “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. The adviser then initiated a campaign against Morocco’s bid, convincing other states to vote for Saudi Arabia’s “strongest” ally instead. Politics has become an entrenched part of sports. It was highly engaged in the 2026 World Cup, when both Saudi Arabia and South Africa explained their choice to vote against Morocco for political reasons. Several Moroccan officials have explained that Morocco does not have an agenda to host the African competition or replace Cameroon as host. The president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, expressed anger about Cameroon’s unreadiness to host the African cup since most of the projects designed for the competition were not completed yet. In August, Ahmad said, “I am not sure Cameroon is ready to host the AFCON.” Al Sheikh’s new position is also puzzling, as it comes amid rumors of tension in Moroccan-Saudi diplomatic ties. One day after the World Cup vote (June 15), Morocco decided not to take part in a meeting of communication ministers from countries in the Coalition Supporting Legitimacy in Yemen on June 23 in Saudi Arabia. Morocco has been supporting the Saudi-led coalition in the war against Houthis in Yemen. Later, Saudi King Salman chose to spend his summer vacation in Neom in Saudi Arabia instead of his traditional Moroccan destination: Tangier. Both moves opened doors for speculation on a potential diplomatic rupture between the two countries. However, King Mohammed VI sent an invitation to the Saudi King in August through his tourism minister, Mohamed Sajid. King Salman also conveyed greetings to the Moroccan King emphasizing the ties of “fraternity linking the two royal families and the solidity of historical relations between the two peoples.” In another message to Saudi Arabia, King Mohammed VI expressed his pride over the diplomatic bonds between the two countries on Saudi Arabia’s 88th National Day.

It took the intervention of the police to calm the player and the owners of the club, reported El Mundo. The striker finally paid the bill, accepting a “small” discount of €1,000. Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, El Haddadi represented the Spanish national under-19 team and under-20 team. He made a brief appearance on the pitch as a substitute at an international game against Macedonia in 2014. His appearance then ruined his chances to represent the Moroccan national football team, according to FIFA eligibility rules. During his youth, the footballer played for several Spanish clubs, including Atletico Madrid, FC Valencia, and Rayo Majadahonda.

Rabat – Germany has been elected to host the Euro 2024 football tournament after winning out over the rival bid from Turkey. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin made the announcement at the headquarters of the European football’s governing body in Nyon, Switzerland, on Thursday, September 27. Germany was elected because it presented a safe proposal over the riskier Turkish bid that offered a chance to explore new terrain. In a report, UEFA stated that Germany had many advantages on its side, from stadiums to infrastructure and hotels, to assure a successful tournament. The report outlined concerns about Turkey’s hotel accommodation, infrastructure, and human rights. It was the fourth time that Turkey has competed for and lost the right to host the tournament after bidding to host 2008, 2012, and 2016 tournaments.  After announcing the winner, UEFA’s president added: “The procedure was transparent. The voting was democratic. Every democratic decision is the right decision so I can only say I am looking forward to seeing a fantastic Euro in 2024.” The ambassador for the German bid, former Germany captain Philipp Lahm said, “We have amazing stadiums, fans who love football, first and foremost we have people who love celebrating with other Europeans.” Euro 2024 will take place in June and July, bringing together the best 24 teams in Europe, with 51 matches to play. Berlin will host the final match. The other matches will be spread over Cologne, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich, and Stuttgart.

Rabat – Engineering and technology group Sener will start final testing of Morocco’s Noor III solar power plant in Ouarzazate to prepare for commercial operation. Sener completed the first synchronization of the Noor III plant to the Moroccan grid in August. “With these milestones, Sener starts the last phase before the plant’s commercial operation and final delivery to the client” by the end of 2018, Sener wrote in a statement Wednesday, September 26. Noor III is a 150 megawatt thermal tower plant which spans 750 hectares and is expected to supply 500 gigawatt hours per year. Noor III plant is part of the Noor project in the Sahara desert, 10 kilometers northeast of Ouarzazate, in central Morocco. “Once operational, it will mark a turning point in the [solar power station] (CSP) sector worldwide,” said Anas Raisuni, Sener’s regional managing director in Morocco. Raisuni reaffirmed that “Noor Ouarzazate III synchronization is the last milestone before delivering the plant to ACWA and MASEN. With its visionary investment in solar power, MASEN has secured a clean, sustainable and manageable power supply for Morocco, while developing the national industry in a cutting-edge sector as CSP.” The Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN) has been managing the solar complex project along with ACWA Power, as part of Morocco’s Noor Solar Plan, the leading solar energy project in the MENA region. The Noor project has three phases and four parts: Noor I, Noor II, Noor III, and Noor IV. Noor CSP plants can store solar energy in the form of heated molten salt which will allow the plants to produce electricity into the night.  Sener stated it used its own central receiver tower and molten salt heat storage technology to design and build Noor plant III.  The central receiver with the molten salt storage system will allow Noor III to supply clean energy to 120,000 households and save 130,000 tons of CO2 per year.  According to Power Technology, both Noor II and Noor III plants will help offset 533,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. “The high performance of this technology … allows to manage the solar energy in absence of solar radiation and respond to the grid’s demand,” reads Sener’s statement. The molten salt storage enables Noor III to produce electricity for 7.5 hours without the sun. Noor III “is composed of a solar field of 7,400 heliostats HE54 that point the Sun radiation towards a receiver located on the top of the tower, at a height of 250 m.” The HE54 heliostat was designed and patented by Sener. It has a greater reflective surface of 178.5 square meters with a precise solar hydraulic tracker system. Heliostat is an apparatus containing a movable mirror, used to reflect sunlight toward a predetermined direction. Sener was founded in 1956 and has more than 2,500 professionals in its centers in Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa.  Sener has been involved in 29 solar plants in Spain, the US, South Africa, and Morocco. Sener’s solar plants have an installed capacity of more than 2,000 megawatts and more than 1 million tons of CO2 emissions a year. In 2017, the group’s operating revenue exceeded €766 million.

Rabat – Moroccan youth are eager to know whether Parliament will pass the debated bill on mandatory military service. If passed, all Moroccan youth aged 19 to 25 would have to spend 12 months in military service unless they are exempted for a convincing reason. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said on Thursday, September 20, that the government would discuss the mandatory service “this week.” However, the government has given no indication that Parliament has considered it as of yet. When a ministerial council announced that it approved the draft bill in August, it sparked confusion among the public. The only indication mandatory service was in discussion came just two days earlier in the council’s agenda. A cure-all for youth issues King Mohammed VI, who abolished conscription in 2006, gave a royal statement supporting the military service, emphasizing that the mandatory service would aim to promote patriotism in youth. The statement followed the King’s continuous calls for the government to offer youth a good education and employment opportunities to fully empower and integrate youth to contribute to Morocco’s development. Read Also: Law on Mandatory Military Service May Come into Force at the End of 2019 The government has been touting reforms to end growing dissatisfaction and social disparities in the country. Now the government asserts military service will “inculcate the spirit of citizenship in young people as part of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship.” While some citizens described the government’s argument as not “convincing,” political analyst Moulay Hicham Mouatadid told Morocco World News that the return “to the collective consciousness of the nation is paramount, provided that the spirit of citizenship prevails over inequality and social disparity.” Rumblings of discontent Social disparities have caused demonstrations from the north to the south of Morocco. While the southern provinces decried a lack of drinking water in April, Morocco’s north witnessed protests against unemployment and a lack of medical facilities in the Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017. Jerada, an eastern city near Oujda, also saw massive protests against risky mine work. All the protests put the government under pressure, and the monarch expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of the implementation of the development model. Read Also: Mandatory Military Service Might Not Include Moroccan Binationals Mohammed Cherkaoui, a professor of Conflict Resolution at George Mason University in Washington D.C, remains skeptical that military service would solve the social crises in Morocco. The professor commented on the government’s statement that the military service aims to “promote patriotism.” Cherkaoui told MWN the statement “remains vague and reveals a deliberate move to make one tree prevent the view of the entire forest.” Cherkaoui speculated, “The decision remains a default tool of managing the acute crisis of Moroccan polity. While struggling with Rif and Jrada protests, controversial sentences of activists and arrest of journalists, resilient Boycott Movement, and other aspects of deepening social malaise,” he said. According to Cherkaoui, “Certain centers of power in Rabat thought the military service could be an ‘innovative’ strategy of containing the multi-layered crisis and shifting the public discourse.” The professor also questioned whether the bill would mitigate social inequality in the country. Better than unemployment? At the end of the 12-month training period, young people who completed the service would receive payment, according to Article 5 of the bill. Article 6 of Bill 44.18 on mandatory military service also promises to reward conscripts with grades according to the Royal Armed Forces’ current hierarchy standards. The bill may also call conscripts with technical and professional skills to fulfill specific missions within the military administration after completing the training. But will conscription solve high youth unemployment? Read Also: Draft Law on Mandatory Military Service Stirs Backlash in Morocco A need for more transparency For some, the proposed bill came as a “shock” rather than a way to promote patriotism in youth. “The decision of mandatory military service is a shock to most young people because it came in an extreme manner without any discussion or participatory approach,” Abdellah Nizar, an activist, told  MWN. Nizar is also a member of Morocco’s Forum of Modernity and Democracy. Nizar’s remarks supported the arguments of Morocco’s Istiqlal (Independence) party, which called on the government to use a pedagogical approach to correct “negative stereotypes” which make the military service appear like a “mechanism for discipline and punishment or for the suppression of energies and the spirit of initiative and creativity” among youth. The party also called on the government to communicate with people. According to Nizar, mandatory service may bear fruit if the government issues a full package with reforms in all sectors. However, he believes introducing military service to end all social problems is not the right decision. Patriotism or escalating conflict? On the other hand, Hicham Mouatadid said the military service has benefits: “the honor of defending the Moroccan homeland, the contribution to peace in the world, [and] participation in the effort of the development of their country.” He said that military service is one way to ensure “national cohesion, a formative and professional measure, and above all a duty of defense of the nation.” Nizar agreed that patriotism entails both rights and duties and that “there can be no rights without duties.” However, Nizar told MWN, “We cannot talk about patriotism” because Morocco lacks the “most basic rights.” “In the democratic world as a whole, we find youth at the forefront and in the most prominent positions in all sectors because those countries provide them with the possibilities and opportunities for success and did not question their patriotism,” he said. Professor Cherkaoui, however, sees the government’s move to re-introduce compulsory service as a mobilization for potential developments in the Western Sahara conflict. Bringing back military conscription “presupposes a would-be escalation of the Sahara conflict, and the State needs to secure additional forces by training male and female young citizens on how to bear arms, a classical overplay of the card of patriotism,” he said. Cherkaoui, who is also a former member of the United Nation’s Panel of Experts, added that some people believe that this “is not a far-fetched hypothesis if we consider the temporality of the decision three months before the UN Security Council decides the fate of the MINURSO peacekeeping force.” However, Cherkaoui acknowledged that others would disagree and respond, “Various geopolitical indicators contest the validity of such a hypothesis.” To keep youth at home Could conscription keep more young Moroccans at home? Over the summer, many Moroccan youth attempted to cross the Mediterranean in flimsy boats to reach the Eldorado. El Khalfi said on Thursday, September 20, that Morocco accounts for 13 percent of undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018 (7,100 Moroccans). Pictures of potential migrants waiting for boats to cross from Morocco to Spain have gone viral on social media. Nizar said Moroccan youth do not hate their motherland, but they leave because “the state did not provide them with the possibilities and opportunities for success.” He believes that participation in the development of the country requires involvement and facilitation of access in all sectors. “It is not a year in the army that will make young people grow and develop their country!” he concluded. ‘Can not this “better life” be granted to Morocco?’ On Friday, Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami said that Moroccans should be able to find a better life in their motherland instead of putting their lives in danger through undocumented emigration. “Can not this ‘better life’ be granted to Morocco or are there things that prevent this?” El Khalfi asserted earlier this month that Morocco has “great job opportunities,” emphasizing the government’s determination to fight migration networks. Melilla’s Minister of Social Welfare Daniel Ventura said that the military service has actually caused youth emigration from Morocco to the Spanish enclave. El Faro Melilla reported on September 22 Ventura’s remarks that since the ministerial council approved the compulsory military service bill, minors have escaped to Melilla to “evade it.” Renowned Moroccan philosopher and researcher Ahmed Assid told Morocco World News that youth interpret the government’s military service proposal as “punishment.” Assid is also a signatory of a statement against mandatory service, which was issued on August 25 by a Facebook group called “Moroccan Rally against Compulsory Military Service.” The statement called on the government to give priority to education, health, culture, and employment, as provided for in Article 33 of Morocco’s Constitution. From the group’s point of view, military service cannot help solve young people’s issues. “It remains merely a patchwork solution that shows the inability of the state to solve basic problems,” the statement reads. On September 20, El Khalfi said that if passed in Parliament, the military service bill might come into force as early as the end of 2019.

Rabat – The inhabitants of informal housing in Ain Sebaa and Sidi Moumen slums claim that police demolished their housing and expelled them by force without any notice.  Several inhabitants, who say they are living in the streets after being expelled from their houses, said they would drop their Moroccan nationality and go into political exile. They argued that police and auxiliary forces in Casablanca showed up to demolish the informal housing without notice and prevented them from getting their clothes and belongings. The demolitions occured last week. The final demolition came at dawn on Saturday, September 22. Inhabitants were surprised by the demolition, claiming that they did not receive any notice. As shown on viral videos on social media platforms, inhabitants clashed with authorities and refused to leave their homes. Speaking to Le Site Info, one inhabitant stated, “Children are prevented from accessing school, as they are residents in slums.” “When the authorities showed up at 4 p.m., we thought that we are in Palestine receiving strikes from Israel,” declared another resident. Residents said that they have nowhere to go. They said it is impossible to rent in Casablanca, especially because of their low income and the high price of rent.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani promised that Morocco is increasing efforts to eliminate tuberculosis before 2030. The Moroccan official spoke about fighting the disease at a high-level meeting at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, September 26. He said that Morocco is committed to fulfill the UN objective to eliminate the infectious disease. The North African country made an 88 percent increase in the rate of early diagnosis, while the world average is only 61 percent. The fight against the disease requires health to be made the center of “all policies” through the adoption of a comprehensive and participatory approach, El Othmani asserted. According to El Othmani, the approach should be in line with the Moscow Ministerial Declaration to end tuberculosis. According to El Othmani, whose statements were published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the tuberculosis treatment success rate has increased by 87 percent. He also said that between 1990 and 2016, the number of tuberculosis cases in Morocco decreased by 30 percent, and the mortality rate decreased by 63 percent. Tuberculosis, also known as TB, is an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It affects the lungs and other organs of the body. The TB Alliance notes that tuberculosis is “found in every country in the world. It is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide.” El Othmani also touted Morocco’s further reduction in the mortality rate due to tuberculosis by 12 percent, compared to 3 percent globally, between 2016 and 2017.

Rabat – Belgium’s Jewish Museum in Brussels paid a memorable tribute to guest of honor, the Moroccan human rights activist Aicha Chenna. The prominent activist was greeted by the applause of a full audience who sang “Aicha” by Cheb Khaled, performed by Moroccan singer Maria Naciri.  Chenna founded the Feminine Solidarity Association as part of her struggle for over 30 years to guarantee a dignified life for single mothers. The Moroccan ambassador to Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Mohamed Ameur, honored “an extraordinary lady”, “a woman of heart and conviction” with an “exceptional” trajectory, who has been working hard for more than half a century to improve the cause of women and children in Morocco. “Morocco is engaged in a dynamic of irreversible reforms,” said the ambassador. The mayor of Brussels, Philippe Close, noted the universal nature of the fight led by Chenna, noting that the treatment of single women affects all societies in the world. Close highlighted the importance of the actions promoted by Chenna’s association “to give visibility to the excluded and voiceless.” After her tribute, Chenna answered questions, sharing about her career and the different stages of her fight. Aicha Chenna was born in 1941 in the medina (walled city) of Casablanca. She spent her childhood in Marrakech and returned to Casablanca in 1953.  The activist studied at the French Foch school and the Lycée Joffre high school, before joining, in 1960, the State School of Nursing where she obtained a state diploma. The 77-year-old feminist found the Feminine Solidarity Association in 1985 to help single mothers integrate into the job market by offering them professional training in different fields.  The association believes that, by enabling the women to achieve financial and social autonomy, they could be free. Today, Chenna is a leading civil society activist defending women’s and children’s rights, notably those living in precarious social conditions. Chena’s hard work has paid off as she was rewarded over the years for her continuous work of defending the marginalized.  In 1995, she was given the Human Rights Prize of the French Republic in Paris, before being awarded in 1999 the Grand Atlas Award for Cultural Services of the French Embassy in Rabat. She also won the OPUS Prize 2009, a $1 million humanitarian prize similar to the Nobel prize winner in November 2009 in Minneapolis, United States. In 2013, Chenna was named Knight of the Legion of Honor by France for the 51 years she spent helping Morocco’s single mothers.  In 2015, the activist won the World Bank’s Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) Award for the MENA region. The award is given to individuals for their outstanding contributions in the field of social accountability. The following year, she was crowned International Woman of the Year at the Monte-Carlo Woman of The Year ceremony.

Rabat – Morocco’s commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation is a strategic choice that shows its firm devotion to world’s peace and security, as well as its attachment to the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, said, on Wednesday in New York, Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita. Convinced that nuclear weapons are neither a guarantee of security nor an assurance of stability at the regional and international levels, Morocco remains committed to multilateralism for a general, complete and irreversible disarmament, with a view to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons, Bourita told a high-level meeting to promote and commemorate the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, organized on the sidelines of the 73rd UNGA. Insisting on the need for mobilization to take concrete measures for the total elimination of these weapons, the minister recalled that the Kingdom of Morocco, being a State party to the totality of the multilateral instruments in force concerning weapons of mass destruction, has actively participated in the UN Conference on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, as Vice-President representing the African region, and voted in favor of its adoption. Bourita said that the present international context and the growing challenges make it a pressing need to work towards achieving nuclear disarmament and the complete and irreversible elimination of nuclear weapons. “To do this, the international community must preserve consensus, rehabilitate the virtues of negotiation and multilateralism, and promote the rule of law and transparency,” he said. Morocco is convinced “that the consolidation of a multilateral approach and international cooperation are fundamental elements for providing universal and effective responses to global threats,” said Bourita, adding that “the existence and the proliferation of nuclear weapons pose a great threat to international peace and security.”

Rabat – Morocco’s ministry of foreign affairs shared a picture showing Moroccan minister of foreign affairs and cooperation, Nasser Bourita alongside American President, Donald Trump, and his wife, Melania Trump. The picture was taken following a UN meeting about drug trafficking entitled “Global call to action on the world drug problem.” This is the first official picture of a Moroccan minister with President Trump since he took office on January 20, 2017. It is unclear whether the Moroccan ministry of foreign affairs had scheduled a meeting with the American President. Regardless of the length or formality of the meeting between the Moroccan official and the US President, it takes a special significance for Moroccan public opinion, since it comes on the eve of Security Council meeting devoted to Western Sahara.

Washington D.C – During Morocco’s participation in the UN General Assembly and a few days before the Security Council’s meeting on the Western Sahara issue, Saad Eddine El Othmani, Morocco’s head of government, made a faux-pas that is likely to cause an unnecessary headache for Moroccan diplomacy. On the first day of the general debate, which started on Tuesday, September 25, El Othmani, representing King Mohammed VI, met an official from Kosovo. Kosovo is a state that declared its unilateral independence from Serbia in 2008 and still does not enjoy the recognition of the UN because of Russia’s opposition. Read Also: El Othmani Attempts to Rectify Tweet on Unnecessary Meeting with Kosovo Official at UN A rushed response is a bad response El Othmani’s meeting with the Kosovar official was a faux-pas for two reasons: First, El Othmani was ill-advised when he rushed to post a tweet in Arabic about his meeting with Kosovo’s foreign minister without being sure under what conditions a non-member can enter the UN headquarters’ premises during the high level debate of General Assembly. The head of government initially asserted that he met “an official from Kosovo who participates in the work of the UN General Assembly.” Perhaps because of his rush, El Othmani did not recall that Kosovo, as a non-member state of the UN, cannot participate in the UN General Assembly. Only UN members can take part in the UN General Assembly. The head of government should have waited a bit and weighed his words before tweeting. He could have said that he met with a Kosovar official “who was present at the UN Headquarters on the sidelines” or “on the occasion of the UN General Assembly.” Otherwise, he could have simply refrained from posting such a useless tweet. Smiles for the camera, denials for Twitter Perhaps because El Othmani realized the sensitivity of his meeting, he published another tweet in English: “A gentleman from Kosovo imposed his presence. We have not discussed bilateral relations neither establishing contacts. Morocco’s position is constant. Morocco does not recognize Kosovo and has no relation with it.” El Othmani sought to absolve himself of any diplomatic faux-pas by asserting that the Kosovar foreign minister imposed his presence on him and that they discussed no bilateral issues. However, El Othmani did not realize that the delegation accompanying the Kosovar official had taken a photo documenting the meeting between the two parties. The picture showed that the official did not impose his presence on the Moroccan official, but rather showed El Othmani smiling and speaking comfortably with Kosovo’s minister of foreign affairs. Perhaps El Othmani’s kindness and his good temper prompted him not to reject the Kosovar official’s request to meet for a few minutes. However, the heavy responsibility the head of the government is entrusted with does not require him to be kind and naive. It requires him to show rather wisdom, shrewdness, and caution to avoid any blunder that could affect the country’s strategic interests. Such a meeting could cause problems for Moroccan diplomacy and force Morocco to do damage control to avoid the spillover effects from such an ill-considered act. Read Also: Bolton Is Unlikely to Change US Position on Western Sahara   What did the head of government achieve from that meeting, and what was the rationale behind it, especially while most heads of state and government are at UN Headquarters? Instead of meeting with the Kosovar official, he should have sought to meet with a representative of one of the countries that Morocco might need to strengthen its position on the Western Sahara issue. On the other hand, El Othmani’s advisers should have alerted him to the sensitivity of the meeting and the problems it could cause Morocco, or at least have advised him to refrain from tweeting about it. Moroccans have simply to put themselves in other people’s shoes. If we feel angry when a state official meets with a Polisario official, we should be aware that a meeting between a Moroccan official and a Kosovo official could raise eyebrows in Serbia and Russia—especially since El Othmani’s meeting, however informal it might be, came shortly after the Moroccan foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, met the Serbian president on September 12. During that meeting, the Serbian president reiterated his country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. How would Morocco react if a Serbian official, or any official from other countries with which Morocco has cordial relations, met a representative of the Polisario Front in the UN headquarters lobby? The scenario would likely upset Morocco at the official level and could provoke a violent reaction from Moroccan public opinion. Although Kosovo is a country with its own national identity, history, religion, identity, and language, everyone knows that Morocco will not recognize Kosovo as long as the Western Sahara question is on the UN agenda and while Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, rejects any international recognition of Kosovo. Despite Kosovo’s efforts to obtain a seat at the UN since its independence from Serbia, it has not succeeded in achieving its ultimate objective to obtain the UN’s recognition. Neither the pressure exerted by the European countries and the US, nor Kosovo’s membership at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, nor the recognition of its independence by more than 100 countries were instrumental in helping it secure UN recognition.  As long as Russia supports Serbia, Kosovo’s membership within the UN will remain unachievable. Perhaps what makes Kosovo’s mission almost impossible is that the admission of any country to the UN passes through a Security Council recommendation to the UN General Assembly. Furthermore, any of the security council’s five permanent members can use their veto power to prevent that recommendation from reaching the UN General Assembly. For historic, ideological, and political reasons, Russia is Serbia’s main supporter. In addition to its strong opposition to secessionism and its relentless defense of the territorial integrity of its allies, one of the main factors behind Russia’s continuous defense of Serbia’s territorial integrity lies in the fact that it is Russia’s last foothold in the Balkans after the former Yugoslavia’s disintegration. Therefore, any encroachment on Serbia’s sovereignty is a violation of Russia’s strategic interests. It remains to be seen whether El Othmani’s meeting with Kosovo’ FM will affect Morocco’s bilateral relations with Serbia. But one thing is sure, Dr. Othmani should remember that in all his actions, in all his statements, and in every step of his daily routine, he does not represent himself, but represents a state and an entire people. The head of government is considered the second man in the state after the King, especially when he is on an official mission to represent the King in the UN General Assembly. Therefore, he would be well advised to watch every word he posts on social media and shares with the media and reduce his presence on Twitter. Samir Bennis is the co-founder of Morocco World News.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI has sent a message to the Women in Africa Summit, calling for further efforts to empower African women. On the occasion of the second annual Women in Africa (WIA) summit, September 27-28 in Marrakech, the King addressed several points on the empowerment of African women, not only as a “fundamental human right” but also a “necessity” for the socio-economic development of the continent. The monarch wrote in his message, delivered by royal advisor Abdellatif Menouni: “Despite the significant improvement in women’s conditions in Africa, it must be admitted that there is still a long way to go.” The King stressed that more efforts should be made to see more women in decision-making positions and “make the most of their ever-growing role as entrepreneurs and business leaders” in Africa, particularly women from “disadvantaged backgrounds.” To ensure their integration in the African economy, the King suggested that the women should be able to benefit from “innovative financing mechanisms”  and have access to safe, sustainable technology.  “In Africa, a continent which seeks to join the ranks of emerging powers, there is a great need for innovative, targeted initiatives as well as concerted efforts to make sure those initiatives create long-lasting impacts.”  “Our continent needs to use an approach combining innovation and integration,” the King stated. The sovereign said that any obstacles hindering the success of women are “a stumbling block impeding the continent’s development.” The King drew attention to the “outstanding” achievements of African women, saying “Luck plays no part in [their] achievements.” They are “in fact, the result of … an ever-growing participation in the job market” leading to increasing numbers of women in the political, economic, and social fields. King Mohammed VI enhanced the role of Morocco’s 2011 Constitution in promoting gender equality, describing it as a “paradigm shift” that “establishes the principle of equality between women and men in terms of rights and freedoms and calls for efforts to achieve parity.” The King believes that “no country, economy, business or society can tackle today’s challenges, nor ensure optimal use of its resources and energies, without the full involvement of women.”  Under the theme, “Looking at Africa with confidence, believing in its talents,” the 2018 Women in Africa event is hosting 500 participants from at least 70 countries. The first session of the summit in 2017, themed, “Investing for better governance with African women,” brought together 400 participants, including international experts. The symposium hosted conferences, master classes, and collaborative workshops. The meetings discussed various topics such as agriculture, energy, entrepreneurship, finance, water, and nutrition. Established under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, Women in Africa is the first international platform meant to support African women leaders and “boost their visibility within the continent and internationally,” according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The King’s promotion of gender equality and women’s empowerment is embodied in his several initiatives, such as the training and integration center for women and youth in Tit Mellil in Mediouna Province, in the Casablanca-Settat region, inaugurated in June. The project, carried out by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity cost MAD 9 million. It is part of the King’s vision for youth and women and his willingness to ensure the integration of young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Morocco’s dedication to women’s empowerment can also be traced in the new historical law criminalizing violence against women, and the country’s participation in international symposiums working for the same cause, such as  UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). This year, Morocco has also appointed 299 women as public notaries (adoul), accounting for 38.37 percent of candidates passing the test in July. Of the 18,948 who took the test on May 6, 7,632 were women. Public notaries in Morocco, similar to lawyers, typically handle the paperwork for a multitude of transactions, including the sale of property, marriage contracts, and commercial contracts. The event is significant as previously only men were allowed to be public notaries, seen as a religious position.

Rabat – The secretary general of RNI, Aziz Akhannouch, found the PJD’s response to Rachid Talbi Alami “unacceptable.” Tension has escalated between the two coalition parties. After the critical remarks of the deputy of the National Rally of Independence (RNI), Mustapha Baytas, Akhannouch also responded to the Justice and Development Party (PJD). Akhannouch said that his party was “surprised by the exaggerated and unintelligible reactions that targeted a member of the political bureau of our party,” referring to remarks from PJD about RNI Youth and Sports Minister, Talbi Alami. Read Also: RNI: ‘PJD Doesn’t Decide If We Should Stay or Leave Government’ Akhannouch, who is both the secretary general of RNI and the Minister of Agriculture, responded to PJD in a written note reported by local news outlets today. According to Akhannouch, Alami was “exercising his right to express the economic choices that our country could follow or avoid.” On Friday, September 21, Talbi Alami criticized the PJD indirectly in a speech at the summer university of RNI youth in Marrakech. During his address, Alami said that the PJD members are “imitators” of Turkish President Erdogan. He also accused PJD of wishing to “destroy the country.” In response, Slimane El Omrani wrote a Facebook post in response to Alami’s accusations. El Omrani denounced Alami’s remarks as dangerous and irresponsible. Read Also: El Othmani Tells PJD to Ignore Alami’s Statements Against Party PJD member Abdelaziz Aftati had called on Alami to submit his resignation and urged RNI to withdraw from the government coalition. RNI did not hesitate to respond; Deputy Baytas wrote a long comuniqué criticizing El Omrani. “We do not need to remind [PJD]” that RNI “are in the government by a sovereign decision.… And we do not wait for you or some of your brothers to decide for us when we continue or withdraw from the government,” said Baytas. For his part, Akhannouch repeated his statement that the party was “very surprised,” because “at the moment we believe that the homeland must be prepared to face the challenges” that the country is going through “at a moment when we are all called upon to respond to the royal appeals made by two fundamental speeches,” referencing King Mohammed VI’s speeches. He added, “This is the debate that some have chosen to drag us to!” On Tuesday, the PJD secretary general and Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani called on PJD members to ignore Alami’s statements after his deputy, El Omrani, responded to RNI.

Rabat – Wednesday’s shooting on a migrant boat by the Moroccan navy angered Prince Moulay Hicham, a first cousin of King Mohammed VI. The prince took to his Twitter to share his concern about the “social crisis.” “The incident, that cost the life of at least one Moroccan woman among the candidates for undocumented immigration of M’diq-Fnideq is tragic. This is a new proof of the social crisis,” the prince wrote. Read Also: Moroccan Navy Opens Fire on Migrant Boat He added, “We are witnessing a protest that goes from land to sea.” pic.twitter.com/4jhfeARxG4 — Hicham Alaoui (@HichamAlaouiSW) September 26, 2018  On Wednesday, the Moroccan navy shot and killed a 22-year-old woman aboard a Spanish go-fast boat. Read Also: Moroccan Killed in Navy Shooting is 22-Year-Old Woman Police arrested the Spanish national who was captaining the boat and injured at least three other Moroccan migrants through the gunfire. For the prince, “Border protection is a national duty, and without a doubt, the Royal Navy has respected the laws in force, but this is a military intervention in a protest action. In the past there has never been such an armed intervention against an illegal boat. Why this time?” An anonymous source from Moroccan authorities told Chamal Post that the boat did not respond to the navy’s warning, so the navy resorted to gunfire. The government opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the incident. Police also blocked hundreds of Moroccans trying to escape for Europe from a beach in Martil on Saturday night, September 22. On the same night, videos of many Moroccans wishing to migrate protesting appeared online. Several videos, which have been widely spread on social media, feature Moroccan minors in northern coastal cities waiting for boats to take them to their dreamland: El Dorado. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said on September 20 that there is a decrease in the attempts of undocumented migration. He said in a press conference that Moroccans account for 13 percent of migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018. El Khalfi said that Morocco has great employment opportunities. Minister of Sports and Youth Rachid Talbi Alami asked on Friday, September 21, whether it is impossible “to find a better life in Morocco” instead of taking risky routes to reach Europe. “It is not the migration of these young people to neighboring countries that is a problem, but the way they try to immigrate, which puts their lives in danger. “Can not this ‘better life’ be granted to Morocco or are there things that prevent this?” Figures of undocumented immigrants differ from one source to another.  In August, Spain’s Ministry of Interior released a report estimating the number of Moroccan undocumented migrants who arrived in Spain between 2016 and 2018 at 10,104. The ministry also emphasized that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain.

Rabat – Morocco will host a forum for skilled Moroccans in Canada in the aeronautics industry to involve them in the industrial development of Morocco. Morocco’s Delegate Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad (MCMREAM) will organize the “First Forum on the Mobilization of Skilled Moroccans from Canada in Aeronautics” on October 5, in coordination with the Moroccan Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy. The forum will receive 200 participants, including a delegation from Aero Montreal, Moroccan members of the Aero Mac, Canadian experts in the aeronautics field, investors, institutional managers, and technical and financial partners. Aero-Montreal is a strategic forum in Canada which brings together leaders of the aerospace sector in Quebec belonging to educational institutions, research centers, and professional associations. Aero Mac is a network of skilled Moroccans in aeronautics in Canada. The overall objective of the forum is to mobilize Moroccan expertise in Canada.  The forum also aims to highlight investment opportunities in Morocco, particularly in aeronautics; to identify future talented aeronautical engineers; and to match them, along with future managers, with industrialists in the sector. The event will also be an opportunity to develop mechanisms for the transfer of aerospace technology to Morocco. #MCMREAM hosts 05/10/2018 #Moroccancompetencies in #Canada in #Aeronautics in coordination The #Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment, and the Digital Economy in partnership with #AEROMONTREAL &amp; #AEROMAC#Morocco#Maroc#Aerospace pic.twitter.com/bTgi1b4WC8 — Ministère MCMREAM (@MCMREAM) September 21, 2018  The forum will be part of a “business mission” by representatives from the Aero-Montreal to visit companies and training institutes in Casablanca and Tangier. The business mission will begin October 1 and end in October 5. The forum will take place on the final day of the mission, October 5, in Skhirat, near Rabat. The mission aims to promote Canadian companies’ investment in Morocco in the field of aeronautics and to strengthen the transfer of technological knowledge to Morocco through exchanges between Moroccan and Canadian universities and training institutions. MCMREAM has been working to promote the involvement of skilled Moroccans abroad in the industrial development of Morocco. The ministry has created a strategic partnership with Canada’s Aero-Montreal network in coordination with the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy. Morocco needs aerospace engineers Moroccans residing abroad (MRE) have a high socio-economic development potential for Morocco.  According to a study conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2016 of 2.6 million MREs in OECD countries, 500,000 have higher education degrees, 7,000 are doctors, and 50,000 are international students. Since the launch of Morocco’s industrial acceleration plan in 2014, employment in the sector has grown by 55 percent, local integration has increased by more than 70 percent, while the number of companies has increased by 10 percent per year. Morocco has 130 operational companies in aeronautics. Morocco’s needs for engineers to support the growth of the aerospace industry will increase in the years to come. According to MCMREAM, the aeronautical sector in Morocco currently employs 15,000 people. According to a recent briefing of the US’s export.gov, “The aerospace industry in Morocco plans to double its capacity and number of operators and create 23,000 new jobs by 2020. “Morocco boasts nearly 11,500 aviation professionals, of whom 50 percent are women.” Morocco an ideal host for aeronautics To achieve its ambitions, Morocco needs to attract 100 new investors. In its 2018 Investment Climate Statement, the US Department of State wrote, “Morocco enjoys political stability, robust infrastructure, and a strategic location, which are helping it emerge as a regional manufacturing and export base for international companies.” On July 17, the aviation outlet AIN listed many economic locations in Morocco which provide an important platform for Morocco’s growing aviation sector. These include Casablanca’s Aeropole Nouaceur and Midparc free zones, in addition to Tangier, Kenitra, Oujda, and Salé, which have aerospace facilities. “The Casablanca Free Zone in Nouaceur is a designated Industrial Integrated Platform (P2i) with special support for investors in the aerospace sector,” wrote the US’s export.gov.’s briefing. According to Midparc, Morocco hosts many international aviation companies, such as Boeing, Dassault Aviation, EADS Aviation, Ratier Figeac, and Safran. “Bombardier’s Moroccan facility today produces wing components, slats, ailerons, winglets, flaps, fuselage parts, fuselages, nose extensions, doors, floors, nacelles, and subassemblies for various programs of regional aircraft and business jets,” a Moroccan Bombardier spokeswoman told AIN. Bombardier is the world’s third-largest aerospace and transportation manufacturer, based in Montreal. In 2014, the company built an aerospace-manufacturing facility in Morocco. According to Morocco’s  foreign exchange office, the Moroccan aviation industry’s operations reached  more than MAD 9.78 billion at the end of November, 2017, compared to MAD 8.42 billion in 2016, an increase of 16.3 percent. In late 2017, “Boeing and RAM announced orders for four 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $1.1 billion at list prices. RAM’s fleet consists of 737s, 767-300ERs, 787s, and a 747-400”, AIN reported.

Rabat- Nasser Bourita has said, during the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), that the number of global terrorist attacks decreased by 20 percent in 2017. Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita and his Dutch counterpart Stef Blok co-chaired the 9th GCTF Ministerial Plenary Meeting on Wednesday in New York, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Bourita pointed out that the number of terrorist attacks in the world was estimated at 10,900 attacks in 2017 which caused the death of 18,488 victims, down 20 percent compared to 2016.  Bourita stated, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), that member countries must take effective measures against the “misuse” of online social networks to promote extremist propaganda. “Our approach must remain strategic, with a long-term perspective that goes beyond territorial victories to face the foundations of terrorist and extremist ideologies,” he said. Bourita also warned of the threat that repatriated fighters and their families represent, calling for “extreme and continued vigilance” to detect actions such as incitement of people to carry out terrorist attacks. Bourita said that more attention should be paid to regions such as the Middle East, North Africa, South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The five regions were the target of 93 percent of the attacks in 2017. The GCTF meeting produced two new GTCF documents for two current initiatives on fighting homegrown terrorism and handling the returning families of terrorist fighters.  Morocco and the US will co-lead an “Initiative on Improving Capabilities for Detecting and Interdicting Terrorist Travel through Enhanced Terrorist Screening and Information Sharing.” The initiative was agreed on during the meeting.  The terrorist travel initiative aims to help countries combat terrorist travel through the use of “Advance Passenger Information (API), Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, watchlists, and biometrics.”  Morocco and the US have been allies in combating terrorism, especially within the framework of GCTF. In its newest Country Reports on Terrorism, the US Department of State praised Morocco’s efforts to combat terror threats globally, reiterating that the North African country has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” In January 2018, the US Department of Defense gave Morocco arms equipment worth $18 million to reinforce the country’s special forces units combating terrorism, in light of the threat ISIS poses to North African countries. The US allocated $60 million as security assistance to allies in the MENA region. Meanwhile, the US and Germany will co-lead the initiative to “Counter Unmanned Aerial System Threats” to raise awareness of the “growing” threat that drones pose and make plans to tackle those threats. According to the US Department of State, “Both initiatives will produce a set of non-binding good practice documents for endorsement at the GCTF Ministerial in 2019.” The GCTF is a apolitical and multilateral counter terrorism platform launched on September 22, 2011, in New York.  The objective of GCTF is to develop a strategic approach to counterterrorism and prevent the violent extremist ideologies supporting terrorism.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has spoken about Algeria’s “historical”  and “political” responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict. El Othmani addressed the conflict in his statement at the 73rd session of the United Nations annual General Assembly on Tuesday, September 25. El Othmani condemned the “tragic” situation of Sahrawis “held” in Tindouf camps, in the westernmost province of Algeria, across the border from Morocco. El Othmani renewed Morocco’s call for a “full and uncompromising demand” by the international community to “urge” Algeria to shoulder its full responsibility in the conflict and to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to fulfill its mandate to conduct a census of the population living in Tindouf camps. Throughout the year, Morocco has been calling on the United Nations to conduct a census in the territory. Morocco also wants the UN to investigate allegations of systematic embezzlement of the humanitarian aid sent to Sahrawis living in the camps. For its part, Algeria has contested that it needs to be involved in a political solution, saying the Western Sahara conflict should be solved only between Morocco and Polisario. Morocco’s diplomacy reads Algeria’s responses as a way to keep the conflict ongoing. In August, Morocco’s permanent representative at the UN, Omar Hilale, said that Polisario is a “mere tool of Algeria, and everyone knows it.” He also explained Morocco’s expectations, asserting that the issue requires “dialogue” more than “negotiations.” According to the Moroccan diplomat, there can be no solution to the four-decade-long issue if Algeria does not participate. In his statement to the participants of the General Assembly, El Othmani reiterated Morocco’s active role in the UN. He said, “Morocco has been always an active member of the United Nations and an official in the international community and will continue to believe in the principles of the organization and trust in the effectiveness of multilateral action.” He also explained that Morocco “fully supports the initiative launched by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, in the area of peacekeeping and peacebuilding.” Africa always on Morocco’s Agenda El Othmani also discussed Morocco’s responsibility towards Africa. He said that “Morocco has made its relations with the African continent one of the top priorities of its foreign policy.” El Othmani mentioned King Mohammed VI’s vision for the continent, saying that the monarch “is keen to propose an African vision for every issue on the international agenda and to contribute to supporting African and international efforts to win the peace and development bets, and good governance. “ He added that Morocco is also determined to shoulder its responsibilities in mobilizing “efforts to maintain security, peace and stability” in Africa as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has expressed satisfaction with the African mobilization and commitment to peacekeeping. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani read King Mohammed VI’s peacekeeping message to the participants of the high-level meeting on Action for Peacekeeping on Tuesday in New York. The meeting took place on the sidelines of the ongoing 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly. The King started his message by expressing Morocco’s determination to take part in actions that seek to ensure peace in Africa. He also explained that Morocco serves the reforms of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the United Nations. “It is very satisfying to see such African mobilization for peacekeeping. Not only does peacekeeping concern Africa, but our Continent is also deeply committed to it,” said the King. Morocco has deployed hundreds of Moroccan peacekeepers in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). “The Kingdom of Morocco is convinced that this initiative, which has brought us together today, will make it possible to reaffirm, at the highest level, the international community’s commitment towards Africa,” said the King. The King also recalled that Morocco welcomed the Action for Peacekeeping since its launch as it forms a “key component of this reform.” Speaking about Morocco’s purpose in joining the peacekeeping initiative, the monarch explained that Morocco “fully supports” the initiative. Morocco believes that peacekeeping is “one of the most useful tools at the disposal of the international community.” The King also emphasized the need to observe three principles of peacekeeping operations. First, he noted the principle of respecting “sovereignty of states, consent, [and] impartiality.” Second, he said the mandates must be realistic and adequately funded. Finally, he said, “Crisis resolution must remain the ultimate goal of peacekeeping operations.” The King concluded his message, commending the UN’s reforms and supported peacekeeping operations. He also called on UN members to offer “appropriate support” to the African Union and African countries. “This is an investment in the future, for global stability hinges on stability in Africa.”

Rabat – Moroccan radio stations are not the only ones to boycott Saad Lamjarred.  The famous Tunisian radio station Mozaique FM has also decided to stop airing the Moroccan singer’s songs after he went back to jail over rape accusations. “This decision was decided following the verdict of the court of Aix-en-Provence to lock Saad Lamjarred for another case of sexual assault against a young French woman in a hotel in Saint-Tropez,” the station explained on its website. Lamjarred went back to jail Tuesday, September 18, following a decision by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal in southern France reversing his release. The prosecutor’s office in Draguignan had appealed his release under judicial supervision. The Tunisian station’s decision follows some Moroccans similar choices. HitRadio and Radio 2M have both distanced themselves from Lamjarred.  Moroccan station Chada FM has continued to air the pop star’s songs, despite his return to jail pending trial in the rape case. “We do not intend to exclude the musical productions of the Moroccan artist from the programming grid of the station because the case is not clarified yet and the French judiciary has not pronounced judgement, and assuming that the accused is innocent until he has been sentenced,” said Chada FM in a statement shared on Facebook. Moreover, the Moroccan station said it “encourages Moroccan art and music especially in the case where it concerns the younger generation.” The 33-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday, August 26, in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from a young French seasonal worker. Lamjarred is still awaiting trial in a 2016 rape case in France.

Rabat – Throughout Morocco’s participation in the UN General Assembly, King Mohammed VI has addressed several messages to symposiums on the sidelines. The King underscored through a new message the importance of education and Morocco’s commitment to promote the quality of education during a roundtable on “The power of education in preventing racism and discrimination: the case of anti-Semitism.” The symposium took place on Wednesday in New York on the sidelines of the General Assembly, which opened on September 18. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani read the King’s message to the participants of the symposium. The sovereign also emphasized the role of education to achieve cultural interaction and cohesion between religions. “Through this equality education, our children must be taught history, using, to this effect, a wide range of historical sources and narratives and shedding light not only on humanity’s glorious moments, but also its darkest hours,” the King said. The King also asserted that Morocco is a land of all religions, emphasizing the presence of multiculturalism and peaceful relations between people of different faiths in the North African country. “Morocco, where Arab-Islamic, African and Judeo-Christian civilizations have long mingled, honors an immutable tradition of moderation, coexistence and mutual understanding,” the King said. He added that Jews and Muslims “rub shoulders on a daily basis, mutually enriching one another and learning from their respective upbringing.” The King said that mosques, churches, and synagogues “exist alongside one another in Moroccan cities.” For the King believed the image should have positive impacts on children. “This is the legacy we want to bequeath to them, and this is the message of peace we have come to deliver by giving education the special, rightful place it deserves.” According to the Pew Research Center, Morocco ranked 183rd out of 198 countries in 2016 for “government restrictions on religious freedom.” The King’s message on education and religion followed Morocco’s promises for reform to solve education problems, including the school drop-out rate. The King has emphasized the importance of education and vocational training in most his recent speeches. On his address to the nation on the eve of Throne Day, July 29, the monarch gave special notice to education. The King ordered the government to “give strong impetus to school enrolment programs and combat school dropout.” The King also called on the government to implement the Tayssir Program as a social measure which could make education reforms bear fruit. “The above measures are designed to ease the burden on families and to provide them with support to make sure their children continue to attend school and training programs,” said the King.

Way to go Achraf Hakimi! Rabat – Moroccan international footballer Achraf Hakimi made an impressive debut with Germany’s Borussia Dortmund.  In his first game, the Atlas Lion scored the third goal of the match with the German club against Nuremberg, on the fifth day of the Bundesliga, Wednesday, September 26.  Dortmund dominated its opponent (7-0).    The 19-year-old football sensation signed a two season-long loan from Real Madrid  to Borussia Dortmund in July.  Before joining the German club, Hakimi had a great season with his club Real Madrid. He became the first Moroccan footballer to win the Champions League. Hakimi made his official debut at the Santiago Bernabeu in October 2017. He has since become one of Morocco’s most important players, proving his worth alongside the Atlas Lions during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Earlier this summer, the Atlas Lion was nominated for the prestigious distinction of Golden Boy 2018 by Italian outlet Tuttosport. The outlet unveiled its list of 100 football players competing for the trophy. Nine African players, including Hakimi, are on the list. The winner will be announced in October. In February, CIES Football Observatory ranked the international footballer among Europe’s “50 most promising under-20 footballers.”

Rabat- A group of blind people have broken into the headquarters of the Ministry of Family and Solidarity, threatening to burn themselves alive. Several blind men participated in the break-in, organized by the National Coordination for the Disabled, Unemployed Degree-Holders, early Wednesday morning in the ministry’s headquarters in Agdal, Rabat. Around 6 a.m., the men climbed to the rooftop of the building and began a sit-in. They carried signs and chanted slogans decrying the “injustice,” “lies,” and “false promises” from the PJD minister in charge of family and solidarity, Bassima Hakkaoui, who had said that their requests were being processed. The protesters were carrying bottles of fuel and even threatened to burn themselves alive if their calls to be employed and for “dignity” and “better living conditions” were to be ignored again. A video of the incident has circulated on social media, showing the protesters in a sit-in on the ministry’s rooftop.

One of the protesters said in a statement to Moroccan electronic news outlet Hespress: “the blind people have reached a point where it’s either ‘to be or not to be.’” “It is especially after the promises of the head of government and the minister of family and solidarity,” he added, calling for an “immediate” and “radical solution” to their problem, or they would choose death. “Where is Hakkaoui now? Where is Bassima Hakkaoui who is still asleep when many blind people are at the ministry ready to sacrifice their lives?” one of the protesters shouted. No administrators or employees at the ministry were in sight.  Bystanders questioned: “How did the blind men break into the ministry’s headquarters?” The National Union of Associations working in the field of Mental Disability in Morocco (UNAHM) also reportedly intended to organize sit-ins in front of the Moroccan Parliament in Rabat this month. UNAHM sought to protest the hardships of many special needs individuals in the country because of their delayed admission to universities and lack of integration in the job market. According to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), higher levels of education correspond with lower employment prospects. The percentage of unemployed university graduates is over 22 percent, a figure that has doubled in the last five years and is expected to keep increasing in the coming years to 50 percent. “The number of degree holders increased from 43,000 in the last five years to 120,00 this year,” said Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi. The research group BMI has forecasted that high unemployment will prevail throughout the next decade due to the expanding workforce, unmet demand for technical positions, and a decline in traditional high employment sectors. For unemployment to decline, Morocco would need to create 115,000 additional jobs each year and maintain all current employment opportunities, to remain steady at the current workforce participation rate of 47 percent. The worrisome unemployment figures have prompted the government to adopt a national program to increase employment possibilities and relevant trainings for young graduates.

Rabat – The UK minister of state for security and economic crime is in Morocco to meet senior officials and discuss cooperation. According to a statement from the British embassy obtained by Morocco World News, Minister Ben Wallace will also observe Morocco’s security arrangements “at a key tourist destination,” due to the increased numbers of British tourists who fly to Morocco each year. Wallace is on an official visit September 24-27. The minister will visit Rabat, Casablanca, and Marrakech. Before his visit to Morocco, Wallace said that Morocco is a country “with which the UK has a long history and shares many common outlooks and interests.” The minister will also meet senior officials to “continue discussions on our countries’ cooperation in tackling a range of security challenges,” reads the statement. Wallace’s visit also followed “the successful” opening of strategic dialogue between Morocco and the UK, which began in July in London. During the event, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and his former counterpart Boris Johnson signed an agreement outlining the conditions for the establishment of British schools in Morocco. Wallace said that the strategic dialogue would be an “opportunity for us to share experiences and approaches with one another, enabling us to work together even more closely to confront the security risks that we both face.” On September 13, Morocco’s Ministry of Tourism said that  7 million tourists visited Morocco in the first seven months of this year, representing a 7 percent year on year increase.

Rabat – Inspired by the world’s peacemaker, King Mohammed VI paid homage to the late Nelson Mandela on Monday. The monarch addressed a message to the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit held at the UN headquarters in New York. After his greeting to the participants of the summit, the monarch said that the whole world “admires” Mandela for his “strength of character, his concern for vulnerable people and his fight, throughout his life, against discrimination and inequality.” According to the King’s message, read by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, Nelson Mandela was the “embodiment of an unshakeable faith in the virtues of dialogue, peace and tolerance.” The Nobel Peace Prize winner fought hard for justice, equality, and peace. He also dreamed of an end to people’s struggles and injustice in the world. The King recalled the friendly relationship Mandela had for Morocco and the support the North African nation gave for the African leader. The monarch said that Mandela “had sincere affection for my late father His Majesty King Hassan II.” He said that the affection was “mutual” as Morocco provided “unconditional” support for African liberation movements. The King then recalled that Mandela lived in Morocco between 1960 and 1962 “where he received the Kingdom’s support for his legitimate struggle.” The background given by the monarch aimed at underscoring “the convergence of two courses of history and the sense of a common commitment” rather than reminding “everyone of Morocco’s leading role in providing support to Mandela,” he said. The King also said that Mandela is among the African leaders “who were committed to humanist values and lofty principles.” In his long address to the Nelson Mandela Summit, the King spared no efforts to describe Mandela as a hero. Mandela died in his home in Johannesburg, South Africa, on December 5, 2013. The King said that Mandela showed dialogue and negotiation can be pursued.  “Unfortunately, however, even when peace was within reach at times, we often let the occasion slip,” regretted the monarch. In 1995, Mandela publicly paid tribute to Morocco in a speech, thanking King Hassan II and his minister for African affairs for supporting him with funding, training, and weapons for his struggle. The King did not hesitate to respond to the requests of Mandela. According to Mandela, the King “understood my mission very well.” He added that the King asked him what “arms do you want, and where should I deliver them.” Referring to the world’s loss, King Mohammed VI concluded his message saying, “We find his absence so unbearable that we prefer to celebrate his birth—one of those births that are honored worldwide. Another birth that humanity owes to Africa.”

Rabat – Morocco’s head of government has tweeted about an “informal” meeting he had with the Kosovar foreign minister at the UN headquarters. In New York for the 73rd UN General Assembly, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani tweeted in Arabic about his meeting with a Kosovar official. “During a tea break in the lobby of the headquarters, and without a predetermined date, an official from Kosovo who participated in the work of the General Assembly joined me,” El Othmani wrote in Arabic on September 25. The General Assembly is meeting September 18 to October 5 at the UN headquarters in New York. Along with Kosovo, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Northern Cyprus, and Taiwan are not members of the UN. The five self-proclaimed countries are blocked from joining the UN because they are claimed by other countries. El Othmani, who did not mention the official’s name or position, tweeted one hour after the Kosovar foreign minister, Behgjet Pacolli, had shared a picture of them on Twitter.  While El Othmani said he had not discussed bilateral relations with Pacolli, the latter said the opposite. “Fruitful discussion at UNGA with Morocco Prime Minister Saadeddine Othmani on Kosovo’s relations with Morocco and our willignes [sic] to establish diplomatic relations so that we can work on all spheres of common interest,” Pacolli tweeted. Samir Bennis, cofounder of Morocco World News and political analyst, questioned the rationale behind the tweet and the meeting itself. El Othmani “should have refrained from sharing his useless tweet,” Bennis wrote. In an apparent attempt to ward off any controversy following his meeting, the Moroccan head of government shared another tweet in English. “During a breake [sic] with my délégation [sic] a gentleman from Kosovo imposed his presence . We have not discussed bilateral relations neither establishing contacts .Morocco’s position is constant. Morocco does not recognize Kosovo and has no relation with it,” he tweeted. Pacolli posted a picture on his Twitter account showing him sitting along with El Othmani and two others. El Othmani said Pacolli “imposed his presence” to meet him. However, the picture shows El Othmani smiling and paying attention to Pacolli. “The publication of this information is likely to raise eyebrows in Serbia and Russia, especially as this meeting, though unexpected and informal, comes a short period of time after Moroccan officials met with their Serbian counterparts,” Bennis added. Morocco does not recognize Kosovo, a region that broke away from Serbia and declared independence in 2008, because Morocco opposes secessionism and defends the territorial integrity of states. Chinese news outlet Xinhua reported on September 12 that Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita said his country “did not and will not recognize the unilaterally-declared independence of Serbian southern province of Kosovo, as the country opposes any unilateral act, and ‘understands Serbia’s worries because its own territorial integrity is endangered.’” Bourita’s statement came when he visited Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria to strengthen diplomatic ties and bilateral cooperation with Balkan countries. “Mr. Othmani represents a nation and an entire people and is considered the second man in the state after the King. Therefore, he must be careful about every word he chooses to publish,” Bennis wrote.

Rabat – The French court rejected Tariq Ramadan’s release request, Tuesday, September 25, after new evidence was presented.  Ramadan was asking to be placed under judicial supervision, to be given back his Swiss passport, and to pay bail of €300,000. The Islamic scholar, who fully denies the charges against him, has been in jail for seven months in France over rape accusations by two complainants.  AFP reported that according to sources close to the case, Ramadan’s version of events was contradicted by an examination his phone and computer. The evidence was handed to the magistrates Monday, September 24.  The intimate messages sent by Tariq Ramadan to the second complainant seem to indicate that the Islamic scholar lied about the nature of their relationship. Ramadan has repeatedly denied having any kind of relationship with the second complainant. The document shows that he remained in contact with her until December 2009. However, Ramadan confessed a few months ago to five extramarital affairs. None of them were among the complainants, according to him.   After the refusal of the investigating judges to release him, a bail judge still has to decide within three days of Ramadan’s request. At the end of October 2017, two women filed complaints against the professor, accusing him of having raped them. One accused him of having raped and beaten her during their only meeting in a hotel in Lyon in 2009 and the second accused him of having abused her in a hotel in Paris in 2012.  However, the first complainant’s story was contradicted in July by her brother, who showed investigators pictures of her celebrating his wedding on the night she claimed to have been raped. In June, a third woman filed a complaint against the Islamic scholar with a similar story in Geneva, Switzerland. If the charges are confirmed, the scholar will face up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person, since the second complainant is disabled.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs wants to know the number of preachers who use social networks.  The ministry issued a statement on Monday, calling on its regional delegates and the Higher Council of Ulemas (scholars, imams, and preachers) to count the imams who use Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google Plus. In another statement shared by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the ministry explained why it wanted the information. The ministry noted that the mission of ulemas has been and “will remain to communicate with citizens.” According to the ministry, technology “is a major asset when it is used widely, in the respect of the regulations of the nation and in accordance with the provisions of the legal texts which govern the function of the ulema and imams and in accordance with the guide of the imam and the preacher.” The new statement added that the ministry will encourage anything published by the imams in harmony with the law to explain the precepts of Islam. However, the ministry will not tolerate any “publication incompatible with these rules and commitments will be notified by the religious institution without giving rise to any measure.” The ministry added that it will take measures “when the offense persists” and if the author is hypocritical, saying one thing inside the mosque and another thing outside the mosque.   Article 25 of the Moroccan Constitution provides that “the freedoms of thought, of opinion and of expression under all their forms are guaranteed.” It remains to be seen if any imams will be censured for expression on social media.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) hopes to  build relations between police and the public for “more combat against criminality.” DGSN issued a statement today, informing citizens about their strategy “of proximity, communication and interaction” to reinforce the public’s confidence in Morocco’s security organs. The strategy aims to ensure security and protection for the public. The statement added that the strategy relies on a participatory approach based on “better governance and adaption to the real needs of the public in terms of security, opening up to the citizens and consolidating a relationship with them.” DGSN’s Open days event, which began today in Marrakech, falls within the framework of the national security strategy to inform the public of security units’ missions. The event is also intended to ensure a sense of communication between the public and the national police. The first open days event took place in September 2017 in Casablanca. It received 80,000 visitors in three days. According to the statement, DGSN has started creating a police security structure dedicated to communications. The facility will have some 20 cells in constant interaction with the media. Another initiative touted by the statement is the revitalization of the hotline (19) with the view to “respond quickly to citizens’ expectations to improve speed of police intervention.” DGSN, according to the statement, wants to preserve “bonds of trust with citizens.” Attendees can get information about the event’s programs from brochures and posters on site or the mobile application “JPO Police.”

Rabat- While firing on a migrant boat trying to cross the Mediterranean between M’diq and Fnideq, the Moroccan navy killed one of the migrants, a 20-year-old woman. The young woman, identified as “Hayat B,” reportedly died at the scene after she took a deadly shot while aboard a Spanish go-fast boat. The boat was controlled by a Spanish national. Moroccan electronic news outlets based in the north, Chamal Post, reported that the woman had lived in the Jebel Dersa neighborhood in Tetouan and attended the Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Law campus in Martil, a town on the Mediterranean. Three other Moroccans on the boat, named as Lahabib (26), Hamza (25), and Mouad (32),were also wounded in navy gunfire and are currently being hospitalized in M’diq-Fnideq prefecture. Chamal Post reported that a “special source” from Moroccan authorities said the migrant boat did not respond to the navy’s warnings, so the navy resorted to gunfire.  The incident is the first known time that the Moroccan navy has fired at a migrant boat. Authorities justified the navy, saying the migrants were not “clearly visible,” and that the Spanish helmsman was arrested, pending an investigation. Lately, Morocco has become strict with attempts at irregular migration to Europe, especially in the north. Moroccan maritime police stopped hundreds of Moroccans trying to escape for Europe from a beach in Martil on Saturday night, September 22. A video of the incident shows migrants franticly making their way back to the shore to escape police. Disappointed, many Moroccans wishing to migrate protested that night, chanting the slogan: “The people want free herga [irregular migration]!” Police have also deployed security barriers at the entrances to northern cities like Tangier and Tetouan to stop migrants from leaving for Europe. According to a statement from Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH) on Monday, security services in Tangier and other northern cities and towns like Martil have arrested young Moroccans and sub-Saharans trying to escape to Europe. They then transported the migrants back to their home cities under strict supervision. “Hundreds of young people in Martil flood to the town’s shores with the hope of migrating irregularly across the Mediterranean,” ONDH emphasized. Moroccans account for 13 percent of the undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018 (7,100 Moroccans). The Spanish Ministry of Interior indicated that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.”

Rabat – After 13 years absence, French-Moroccan comedian Jamel Debbouze will be back in Casablanca. Debbouze will present his new show “Maintenant ou Jamel” October 19-20 for the first time in the white city’s Al Amal complex, at 8:30 p.m. The tickets are available online on Ticket.ma.  Organized by Moroccan radio station NRJ Maroc in partnership with Kissman Morocco, Debbouze’s show will be performed in Morocco for the first time, according to Yabiladi.  “NRJ Maroc is proud to organize Jamel Debbouze’s latest show in Casablanca, a great artist and a big star,” said Hakim Chagraoui, CEO of Radio Planet, a company holding the exclusive license from NRJ in Morocco in a press release. He promised “a great success” for the show.  The actor of “Aladdin” has already presented “Maintenant ou Jamel,” directed by Mohamed Hamidi, in France.  After six years absence, Debbouze has made a successful comeback on his favorite playground: the stage. Close to his audience, the 42-year-old comedian talks about his fears, his role as a father, and his career. The committed artist mocks some political figures, such as Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, while also discussing subjects like racism and terrorism. The Paris native has starred in many movies, including the historical movie, “Days of Glory,” which he also co-produced in 2006. Debbouze also inaugurated his own comedy club in 2008, opening opportunities for amateur stand-up comedians.  Every year, the comedian organizes “Marrakech du Rire,” which serves as a “link between cultures,” uniting hundreds of stand-up fans for the world’s premier Francophone stand-up comedy festival in Marrakech.

Rabat – As tension continues between coalition parties, RNI has responded to a censuring statement from PJD Deputy Secretary-General Slimane El Omrani. Morocco World News received the response of the deputy of the Rally for National Independence (RNI), Mustapha Baytas, today. The RNI member addressed his response to El Omrani, who had condemned critical remarks about the Justice and Development Party (PJD) from RNI Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami. On Friday, September 21, Alami said that PJD members are “imitators” of Turkish President Erdogan. He also accused PJD of wishing to “destroy the country.” El Omrani described the statements as dangerous and irresponsible. In response and on the behalf of the political group, Baytas accused the PJD of attacking RNI members. Baytas recalled that PJD members Abdelali Hamiddine and Abdelaziz Aftati had attacked RNI members. The statement added that Aftati had “described” RNI members as “the cartels of dirty money.” He said, “People know and understand the meaning of cartels.” Baytas accused the PJD of using language with “religious symbolism to exercise a kind of domination on people’s minds, which raises the question again about your inability to practice politics without getting back to religion and emotions.” Baytas went on to add that RNI members “do not need to remind [PJD] that they are in the government by a sovereign decision. … and we do not wait for you or some of your brothers to decide for us when we continue or withdraw from the government.” RNI, which is run by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch, is part of the government coalition. Following Alami’s comments about Erdogan on Friday, PJD member Abdelaziz Aftati had called on Alami to submit his resignation. Alami “must submit his resignation from the government, and also his party needs to withdraw.” Baytas also complained that PJD accused RNI of “blocking” former head of government Benkirane from forming a government. King Mohammed VI dismissed Benkirane in 2017 in the midst of a five-month political deadlock to form a government. PJD’s El Omrani said Alami’s remarks went “beyond” criticism “without the need for any interpretation, or else who do you refer to with your words?” Head of Government El Othmani, who is also secretary general of the PJD, issued a statement on Tuesday after his deputy’s response calling PJD members to ignore Alami’s statements. He said, “A party meeting will consider the matter.”

Rabat – Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), has kept the dirham’s permissible exchange rate within 2.25 percent of the set rate. In a press release after their third quarterly meeting on Tuesday evening, September 25, BAM reviewed the economic situation and its macroeconomic forecasts for the next eight quarters. The bank decided that the current level of permissible fluctuation from the main interest rate, 2.25 percent, is still appropriate and should remain unchanged. The bank forecasted a decrease to 3.5 percent and 3.1 percent in the economy’s growth rate in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The growth rate in 2017 was 4.1 percent. “For the first quarter of 2018, the latest national accounts data showed a deceleration in the annual growth from 3.5 percent to 3.2 percent, with value-added agricultural production declining from 14.8 percent to 2.5 percent,” the central bank said.  The growth in production of non-agricultural activities has improved from 2 percent in the first quarter of 2017 to 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018, and it is expected to continue rising.  Value-added agricultural production is expected to increase by 5.1 percent overall in 2018 compared to 2017. Assuming 2019 has a normal agricultural season, production will fall by 1.6 percent next year. Non-agricultural activities are expected to continue to increase, with a growth of 3.3 percent in 2018 and 3.7 percent in 2019. At the end of 2018, inflation is expected to hold steady at 2.1 percent. In 2019, it is expected to decrease to 1.2 percent. Bank Al-Maghrib forecasted that Morocco would have a foreign currency reserve of MAD 240.8 billion by the end of 2018, up by 1.2 percent in comparison to the end of 2017. The reserves are sufficient to pay for 5 months and 5 days of imports.  Regarding monetary market interventions, BAM injected, during the week of September 13-19, MAD 69.8 billion into the monetary market to control dirham fluctuation.  During the same period, the dirham depreciated by 0.42 percent to the euro and appreciated by 0.45 percent to the dollar.

Rabat – Moroccan international footballer Nordin Amrabat is tired of sitting on the bench.  According to several Saudi Arabian outlets, the Atlas Lion is thinking about leaving Al Nassr Riyadh due to continual conflict with his coach, Jose Daniel Carreno, about his game time. The 31-year-old football player expected that he had been recruited to be a key player, not a substitute.  Amrabat signed a three year contract with Al Nassr in July for a €3 million salary per year.  The former Watford FC player already expressed his disappointment last week after a game with his Saudi football team. “I came to participate in the club’s tournament, not to serve as a substitute. This is the second time the coach has made this choice and I have to see what he will decide for the next matches,” said Amrabat.  Will Amrabat leave Al Nassr during the winter trade? According to the Saudi media, Herve Renard’s player has already received an offer from an Italian club.  Amrabat made a great impression during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The “warrior” or “the man of the match” between Morocco and Portugal, as he was called by his Moroccan fans, caught the attention of the international press with his during Morocco’s games against Iran, Portugal, and Spain. During his youth, Amrabat played for the Union of European Football Associations’ champions league with PSV Eindhoven, who at the time were champions of the Dutch football league. His rich football resume has since seen him play for Turkey’s Kayserispor, Watford, and now Al Nassr.

Rabat – The Algerian Islamist party (MPS) has asserted that the closure of the Moroccan-Algerian border was “an unacceptable political, economic, cultural and social mistake.” In an interview with Algerian news outlet TSA, the party’s chairman, Abderrazak Makri, urged Morocco and Algeria to reopen the border, currently the longest closed border in the world. Makri said the decision to close the borders must be “reviewed.” On Wednesday, September 19, the politician said that both countries share a “common destiny, because we are the same people.” He added that there is “no convincing reason” to keep the border closed. Algeria decided to close the border in 1994, when Morocco imposed visa regulations on Algerian visitors in the wake of a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asi hostel in Marrakech. Morocco lifted the visa requirement in 2004. But the border has remained closed. In his interview with TSA, Makri said that the Western Sahara conflict has “nothing to do with this issue.” Throughout the years, Morocco has called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict and to engage in the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. Algeria, however, which hosts Polisario members on its land, has refused, claiming that the issue should be solved between Polisario and Morocco only. “It’s an illogical mistake,” said the politician about the border. On Thursday, Moroccan Ambassador to Italy Hassan Abou discussed the circumstances of Algeria’s refusal to open its borders on the sidelines of a festival of Mediterranean journalists. The Moroccan diplomat speculated that Algeria “closes its borders with Morocco because it is not prepared for integration, contrary to the propaganda it tries to convey.” He said that Algeria’s decision hampers the Maghreb integration project. The closure of the Moroccan-Algerian border has concerned activists for years. Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported that both Moroccan and Algerian activists marched on July 22 to the border “to call on the authorities of both countries to open the border.”

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy has opened fire on a go-fast boat attempting to transport a dozen undocumented migrants to Spain. On Tuesday, September 25, the navy detected a speeding boat between M’diq and Fnideq, towns on the Mediterranean, trying to take migrants to Spain.  According to Medias24, the gunfire killed one woman and injured three others. Moroccan police arrested the Spanish national captaining the go-fast boat. The resort to violence sparked fear among Moroccan parents because many minors and adults take risky ways to reach the El Dorado. Several videos shared on social media show Moroccan migrants filming their undocumented voyage. The government has claimed that it is increasing its efforts to fight migration networks. Following Thursday’s government council, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that at the end of August 2018, 54,000 attempts of migration were aborted in Morocco. El Khalfi said that Moroccans account for 13 percent of undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 6,000 Moroccans arrived in Spain by sea in 2018 as of September 9.

Rabat – A new issue of Languages and Linguistics has been published as Morocco is battling over the language in school books. The Languages and Linguistics journal, edited by Moha Ennaji of the International Institute for Languages and Cultures in Fez, published its Issue 41 last week. The issue reviews scientific contributions on the structures of standard Arabic and Tamazight (Berber). It also presents research on sociolinguistic and pedagogic problems in the teaching of these languages, offering the findings of experiments in language pedagogy. In one article, Koussaila Alik from Mouloud Maammeri University in Algeria deals with the place of word borrowing in relation to the development of the Tamazight vocabulary used in schools in Algerian and Moroccan textbooks. The article analyzes in detail, with examples, the issue of loan words and the different types of borrowing and their origins.  Also in the issue, Mohamed Yeou of Morocco, Kiyoshi Honda of Japan and Shinji Maeda of France report three experiments investigating the phonetics of the Tamazight dialect of Figuig in eastern Morocco. For standard Arabic, Hassan Souali of Mohammed V University analyzes the different categories of complex verbs from a theoretical point of view. In his article, Abdellatif Elmattad of the Institute for Studies and Research on Arabization studies the theoretical aspect of standard Arabic vocabulary and its development for computing purposes.   Also dealing with technology, Abdelhakeem Kaseem of Deakin University, Australia, deals primarily with how modern technology can support and enhance the learning experience of foreign language learners in general and standard Arabic learners in particular, by creating an environment rich in opportunities. He writes that technology allows learners to develop and enhance their language skills in an interactive and authentic learning environment.  In his article, Boudris Belaid of the Center for the Formation of Education Supervisors in Rabat argues that the teaching of Tamazight to primary school students is characterized by a combination of the contributions of specialists in language, education sciences, and community actors.  The issue comes out during a national debate on the use of Darija in classrooms. There is tension in public opinion about whether to emphasize Arabic, Tamazight (Berber), French, or Darija (Moroccan or Algerian Arabic), a spoken dialect which is a hybrid of the three languages. Starting in pre-school, students in Morocco and Algeria must learn more than one of the languages, which can become a real linguistic jumble.  The first official language in both countries is standard Arabic, but few children grow up speaking it. Most speak Darija as their mother tongue and are often confused on their first day at school. The second official language is Tamazight, the tongue of about half of Moroccans and a quarter of Algerians. It was only officially recognized in 2011 by the Moroccan state and in 2016 by the Algerian government—but there is a disagreement of which alphabet to use, and no one can agree on which of its six dialects to teach. The Moroccan and Algerian francophone elite prefer the language of Moliere, and most send their children to French schools. The Algerian education minister, Nouria Benghebrit, advocates the introduction of a fourth language in school, Darija, which fuses the other three and is the mother tongue of most Algerians. In Morocco, a few, like Noureddine Ayouch, have recently called for the introduction of Darija in primary schools, and the Ministry of Education allowed the insertion of Darija expressions in new school books this year. An increasing number of anglophones in both countries even want to wipe the slate clean with English. Most conservative people and parties have risen against the introduction of Darija in school books in Morocco. Although Moroccans love “baghrir” and “harcha” for a snack, they loathe to see the Darija words in school books. Moroccans and Algerians also love popular culture, theater, and songs in Darija, but they prefer to read and write in standard Arabic or French.  The common argument against Darija is that it tends to vary from region to region and across North Africa and the Middle East, claiming, for example, that a Lebanese would not know what “3lash,” a word for “why,” means. There are many communication hurdles using colloquial Arabic across the Arab world, but they may not be as large as many people think.

Rabat – In the midst of PPS-PJD tension, the ruling party is facing a feud with another party in Morocco’s government coalition: RNI. On Friday, September 21, National Rally of Independence (RNI) member and sports minister Rachid Talbi Alami indirectly criticized the Justice and Development Party (PJD) at the opening of RNI’s Summer University in Marrakech. Referring to the members of the PJD, Alami said that “imitators” of Turkish President Erdogan “attacked” RNI members and wish to “destroy the country.” In response, PJD Deputy Secretary General Slimane El Omrani described Alami’s statement as “dangerous, offensive and unacceptable.”  In a long Facebook post, El Omrani said that Alami’s words “were not limited to only criticism of some stances against your party” which he said would be understandable.  El Omrani said Talbi’s statement went “beyond” criticism “without the need for any interpretation, or else who do you refer to with your words?” El Omrani recalled the conditions of the coalition’s charter. The charter stipulates the need for “ensuring cohesion of the majority and non-abuse of parties” in the government “without preventing the right to constructive criticism.” He then asked whether Alami’s words were a personal position or official. “Is it the position of the party? it must be clear.” PJD member Abdelaziz Aftati called on Alami to submit his resignation from the government. He told Turkish outlet Anadolu Agency that Alami “must submit his resignation from the government, and also his party needs to withdraw.” He added, “I am surprised by a member of the government who attacks its president.” He also condemned Alami’s interference in the “affairs of a country, which is a friend to Morocco.” He said, “The offense was against the state of Turkey, which respects Morocco and has no inferior problem with its national issues.” Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, who is secretary-general of the PJD, called on the members of the parties not to “respond to the statements of Mr. Rachid El Talbi El Alami concerning the party, after the response of his deputy brother Soulimane El Omrani.” A statement from the PJD said a party meeting will “consider the matter” and give a response. The two parties competed fiercely in the 2011 parliamentary election, in which the PJD, led by former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, won the majority of seats. Alami’s criticism follows a recent argument between PJD another coalition party, the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS). In August, a royal decision to remove the water secretariat, run by PPS member Charafat Afilal, angered the party.  The department was removed at El Othmani’s  request PPS members, including the head of the party, Nabil Benabdellah, threatened to withdraw from the coalition. The two parties held several meetings to reconcile. On September 15, PJD announced it had close ties with PPS during its national council. “We are clinging to our alliance” with PPS, said El Othmani. He added that differences between the two parties “do not mean that we will abandon our partnership.”

Rabat – The president of the Ghana National Poultry Farmers Association has appealed for Moroccan poultry professionals to invest in Ghana.
 Morocco’s Interprofessional Federation of the Poultry Sector (FISA), organized a business to business meeting in Ghana’s capital, Accra, in collaboration with Morocco’s Autonomous Export Control and Coordination Establishment (EACCE) to promote poultry and Moroccan expertise. “Moroccan professionals in poultry sectors are invited to invest in Ghana to seize business opportunities offered by the country,” said Victor Oppong Adje, president of Ghana’s poultry association. According to Oppong Adje, Ghana has several opportunities for Moroccan professionals, including a high demand on finished products—eggs, chicken flesh, and chicken lunchmeat, and an emerging market. Ghana also has cheap raw materials, such as corn and soy, which are the main feed for poultry. Oppong Adje also touted low taxes, saying, “Ghana also offers tax incentives and customs facilities to investors who want to launch projects in the poultry sector.” Ghana’s poultry market imports 95 percent of its frozen chicken from the US, Brazil, the EU, and South Africa. Ghana annually imports 150,000 tons of poultry meat, and wants to take advantage of Moroccan expertise to develop a local sector. “This collaboration must be done in stages,” said the president of FISA, Youssef Alaoui. “We can start by installing hatcheries for chicks, pending the establishment of a complete sanitary facility.”

Rabat- The border city of Oujda has decided to demolish Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s abandoned childhood house. Oujda Mayor Omar Hajira summoned the consul general of Algeria in Rabat, Hicham Kimouch, to communicate the decision to tear down the house, which is in danger of collapsing on nearby residents. Hajira stated that the region had collectively considered abolishing the house in 2017  but could not proceed due to the absence of the house’s original owners, reported Moroccan news outlet Barlamane. Bouteflika, along with his mother and siblings, lived in the house in the 1930s before they moved to another house in the area. The house sits in the populated neighborhood of Cheqfan in Oujda’s old medina (walled city). Born in 1937 in Oujda, a city in northeast Morocco on the Algerian border, Bouteflika became president of Algeria in 1999. In his youth, Bouteflika participated in the Algerian war against French colonization between 1954 and 1962, serving as an officer in the National Liberation Front (FLN) and the National Liberation Army (ALN). Bouteflika’s health has deteriorated since he suffered a stroke in April 2013. Despite his advanced age and health issues that prevent him from appearing in public, the president won the 2014 presidential election, his fourth consecutive victory.    The election, however, sparked controversy after many politicians deemed the outcome “fraudulent.” In April 2018, Algeria’s ruling party, the National Liberation Front, called on Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term in the upcoming 2019 election. Following the sacking of Algerian senior military figures this summer, Adalberto Agozino, an Argentinian analyst wrote an article, titled “Algeria is heading for new electoral fraud.” The analyst wrote that Algeria is purging the army and police in order to “ensure the success” of the next presidential election. Agozino also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead the country and fulfill presidential duties.

Rabat – Heated disagreements accompanied the new school-year start as Arabic dialect terms appeared in the official 2nd grade textbooks, reigniting controversy over the ailing education system. The Moroccan education system has been relentlessly striving for reform and empowerment since the closing decades of the last century. Today, the intellectual and the layman all know the troubles of the public school and the corruption crippling the colossal system of education and training. The organization of schools and vocational institutes, colleges, universities, and training bodies with both private and public ownerships under the control and supervision of delegations, academies, and councils is very complicated. They belong to either joint or independent ministries, making the education sector a complex fabric to figure out. Added to this is the constant change of high-ranking education officials, which automatically yields inconsistent and incongruent policies of education. The gloomy picture gets darker as corruption finds safe shelter and spreads like a contagious plague in an already critical state of affairs. The imperfections of Moroccan public education are many and varied. Yet, the question of language remains unaddressed seriously and unsettled over the reform attempts and the occasional policies. Language variation, supposedly an asset to any nation and source of pride and diversity, has become a blight on the path to re-innovating the system. Interestingly, however, after the serious argument over whether Arabic or French should take over as a means of instruction, another controversy surfaced due to the boom of the English language worldwide.  Some contended that English is undeniably the best medium of instruction and must be the first foreign language of any country. Moroccan debate over the past years has rested on whether French or English should be the channel of instruction in public schools and universities of the nation, as is the case in many private institutes. In this tense rivalry between powerful languages, a notorious voice appeared advocating for the integration of Darija (Moroccan Arabic), an unwritten dialect, in education. While most Moroccans overlooked the idea with sarcasm and underestimation in its early beginnings, the newly updated curricula for 2018 first primary school years have included Darija words with illustrative pictures in the midst of Arabic lessons.  The words were written and pronounced as if they are common Arabic terms. The pictures and words of food items from Moroccan cuisine caused, first, surprise, before it grew, like a snow ball, into public outcry and indignation on social media. The “virtual” discontent was further provoked by more fabricated pictures and texts alluding to social degeneration and disrespect of Morocco’s cultural identity. One example included a girl taking off her pants to urinate in the open air; another had a boy and a girl initiate a relationship. The fake images and texts were later identified. Some social media users not only blamed the public for blind consumption and baseless accusations of the Ministry of Education, but also supported the insertion of such words in textbooks, claiming that Arabic is not a sacred language.   Despite the linguistic diversity in Morocco, in education at least, Darija has never been mentioned to be used or empowered in all the preceding official reform plans. Neither the National Charter for Education and Training nor the Emergency Plan nor, lately, the Strategic Vision 2015-2030 have endorsed any promotion of Darija, while all the main languages have been maintained with differing degrees and variable importance.  Over the last years, the only tense debate following the monarch’s 2014 discourse on language-in-education review took place in the Higher Council for Education Training and Scientific Research (HCETSR) on whether French or English should be the first foreign language and medium of instruction in secondary and tertiary education’s scientific and technical streams. While some saw a probable radical shift to English, French has been announced to continue to be the medium of teaching in the advanced schooling phases. While many voices and bodies denounced the gradually eclipsing role of standard Arabic in schools, Darija was not even deemed worthy of discussion. Yet, subtle efforts for the promotion of dialects in educational use started decades ago in the era of foreign occupation, not only in Morocco, but in many comparable Arab and Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Tunisia, and Syria. It was primarily meant to undermine the Arabic language: the indispensable tool of Muslims’ religious practice as well as a symbol of historical and cultural unity and identity among Arabs and Muslims. Recently, the wave in Morocco advocating for Darija has been revived and is being fueled by notorious activist and businessman Noureddine Ayouch. He is a member in the HCETSR, a priceless opportunity for him to influence educational decisions of momentous eventual impact on education. Yet, claims that Ayouch is behind the insertion of dialect terms in the new curricula remain only plausible allegations. For academics and intellectuals, such as El Ouadghiri and El Aroui, the issue is unquestionable and Darija is not liable to fulfill education or scholastic roles, not only due to its nature, but also because the other languages, especially Arabic, being the prime tool of instruction in primary school, are far more adequate and useful.       Irrespective of the issue in question, the hustle and bustle which took place on social media reveals insightful indicators on the fabric and the mode of thinking of the Moroccan society. Lack of respect for opposing views, lack of critical thinking, and poor media savvy have imbued Facebook interaction in the opening weeks of September 2018. Mutual accusations among members of society, circulation of fake posts without ascertaining credibility, and imprudence to react were common traits among numberless Facebook users. This status quo prevented readers from finding objective and rational analyses and caused considerable doubt. The controversy, again, brought to debate the duality of public and private schooling in Morocco. Most of the discussion implied an endorsement of private schooling as a redemption for the masses, without regard to the degrading purchasing power of Moroccan households and the escalating private school fees. Quality teaching in private schools is not only becoming more and more unquestioned, but also unthinkably approved and recommended by the educated as well as the layman. Today’s poor public education, coupled with greedy private schools and thoughtless households sacrificing their basic needs for their children’s private schooling, renders the image dramatic and does not give any signs of an auspicious future. Citizens are becoming defenseless victims of inadequate education modes as well as their shallow thinking and irrational decisions.  All the noise Darija caused is only a small aspect of education. Real education should overcome the imperfections of available offers to provide in-home education and parental scaffolding that seeks to make children into intellectuals, decision-makers, leaders, and, mainly, thinkers.   These skills cannot necessarily be built by any school irrespective of reputation or service, but only require educated wise parents who look farther than a few “strange” words in their child’s school book.

This trophy is also for my family, without whom I would not be the player and person that I am.” Modric is the first player other than Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi to win the FIFA award since Kaka won it in 2007. On August 27 2012, Real Madrid announced the signing of Modric for €30 million, replacing Mesut Ozil.

Rabat – Algerian authorities have blocked retired soldiers from entering Algiers, preventing them from protesting for their demands. The former soldiers have camped for several days in Haouch El Mekhfi, a region in Boumerdes 30 kilometers east of the center of the Algerian capital. Authorities, according to El Khabar news paper, called on the protesters to remove the camps. Photos of the soldiers have gone viral on social media, featuring thousands of protesters marching to the Algerian capital. Algeria mobilized a large number of policemen to block the main roads to the capital to prevent protesters from reaching Algiers, according to Algerian news outlet TSA. Info Trafic Algerie wrote earlier today, “Traffic is paralyzed in both directions at the eastern entrance of Algiers because of a demonstration of retired soldiers.” The organizer of the demonstration, Marawan Bassaf, told the New Arab that 20,000 former  soldiers gathered for the demonstration on Sunday. “This is our chance to pressure authorities to carry out our demands. We call on the president to not abandon the people who fought against terrorism in this country,” Bassaf told the news outlet. The retired soldiers are calling on the government to increase their pensions. Some of the veterans fought in the civil war in the early 1990s. The civil war was an armed conflict between the Algerian government and Islamic groups. According to the New Arab, the soldiers have been demanding benefits for disabled troops, including housing and health care. In response, the Algerian military shared a statement accusing demonstrators of “spreading seeds of doubt” and “attempting to mislead public opinion,” according to the New Arab. Authorities have prohibited all protests in Algiers since 2001. Throughout this year, Algeria saw a significant shift in power as the interior ministry sacked several senior military figures for alleged involvement in corruption and drug trafficking. However, one Argentinian analyst said that the purge of leadership is in order to “ensure the success” of the next presidential election in early 2019. Algeria’s ruling party, the National Liberation Front, called on Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term in the election. Argentinian analyst Adalberto Agozino questioned Bouteflika’s ability to fulfill presidential duties. “Algeria’s constitution establishes a maximum of two five-year presidential terms, but President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81 and wheelchair-bound since 2013, will stand for a fifth consecutive term in elections without any international oversight,” he said. Last week, former French ambassador to Algeria Bernard Bajolet also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead. He said that Bouteflika is kept alive “artificially.”

Rabat – The Moroccan minister of foreign affairs is leading a delegation to New York to take part in the United Nations annual General Assembly. The 73rd session of the highest organ of the UN opened on September 18 and will run until early October. On the sidelines of the assembly, Nasser Bourita will hold bilateral meetings with representatives of several countries. Bourita’s agenda started with a meeting with Moussa Faki, chairman of the African Union Commission. Bourita also met the Indian minister of foreign affairs, Sushma Swaraj. The agenda of the General Assembly today includes a session for presidents, prime ministers, and leaders of delegations to make statements. US President Donald Trump kicked off the UN General Assembly with a speech on combating drug trafficking. Trump said, “Illicit drugs are linked to organized crime, illegal financial flows, corruption, and terrorism.” Local news outlets reported today that King Mohammed VI ordered Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to represent Morocco in the General Assembly in New York. El Othmani is expected to deliver a presentation on peace and stability. The assembly is also an opportunity for sports diplomacy. The minister delegate to the minister of foreign affairs, Mouhcine El Jazouli, took part in the launching ceremony of “NBA AFRICA” on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Monday. During the meeting on sport and economic development in Africa, Jazouli invited members of the NBA to visit Morocco and to promote basketball to young people through the opening of an NBA school.  AU talks at UN Since the return of Morocco to the African Union in 2017, Morocco has presented its vision and reforms to develop and promote the African body. On Monday, Bourita said that Morocco has previously called for an effective reform of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the AU to achieve peace in Africa. Morocco took a seat on the AU’s PSC in January during the 32nd ordinary session of AU’s Executive Council in Addis Ababa. “It imperative to proceed with an effective reform of the CPS, the main pillar of the African Peace and Security Architecture” to achieve greater flexibility and to “promote a new governance of peace and security issues,” said Bourita. The minister made his remarks during a ministerial debate at the African Union Peace and Security Council under the theme “the state of peace and security on the continent and the steps taken to promote African solutions to African problems.” He added, “The diagnosis of the security situation in our hemisphere is unambiguous and, despite the progress made, much remains to be done to achieve peace in Africa.”

Rabat- El Othmani has arrived in Al Hoceima for the National Road Congress and examine all socio-economic projects in the region. A ministerial delegation including Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim, Minister of Equipment and Transport Abdelkader Amara, and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi are also attending the congress’s 10th session, September 24-26. According to the state-owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the congress is an opportunity to address region’s challenges in financial development. El Othmani’s visit is focused on the Al Hoceima “Manarat Al Mutawassit” development program involving the 148-kilometer Taza-Al Hoceima Expressway, which consists of three phases. The expressway, which cost MAD 135 million, is in its final phase of construction and is scheduled to be completed in January 2019. Other road projects include the construction of seven roads between Targuiste and Cala Iris and five between Issaguen and Khlalfa. The projects are expected to be finished by the end of 2019. The road projects will help improve Al Hoceima region’s socio-economic conditions and road safety, according to Amara. The “Manarat Al Mutawassit” regional development program is jointly financed by the Ministry of Transport and the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region. A total budget of MAD 6.5 billion has been allocated for the program. Water programs to increase the supply of potable water are also part of “Manarat Al Mutawassit.” The head of Morocco’s National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) in the Fez region, Mohammed Berkia, announced in June that the office is adopting projects through 2035 to improve the potable water supply in Al Hoceima. Berkia noted that the projects will cost an estimated MAD 714 million. The government has budgeted MAD 900 million for the project, which will launch by the end of the year. The projects  include the treatment of seawater to be preserved in a tank with a capacity of 2,000 cubic meters. To increase water supply in the rural areas of the Rif region, 13 new dam reservoirs will be built at a cost of MAD 330 million. The implementation of the Al Hoceima “Manarat Al Mutawassit” program got off to a slow start, and a strategic vision was never integrated and shared by all stakeholders, according to the Court of Auditors.  The court noted that most stakeholders at both central and local levels were significantly delayed in carrying out their duties for the Al Hoceima program. In October 2017, the King sacked several ministers and high officials who operated in the previous government lead by Abdelilah Benkirane over the program. Protests erupted in 2016 in Al Hoceima to condemn social disparities following the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima. In 2017, authorities arrested hundreds of protestors in the movement, known as the Hirak Rif, and 54 activists were sentenced from 1 to 20 years in jail in June. The activists have appealed, and their appeal is pending.

Rabat – In its annual report, CESE found that in 2017 “inequalities are increasingly experienced as injustice” by Moroccan society. Morocco’s Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CESE) drew up its 2017 annual report on economic inequalities, social inequalities, and gender imbalances. The report also gave recommendations to tackle inequality in Moroccan society.  The 2017 report states, “The social movements recorded during the recent period have shown that poverty, youth unemployment, exclusion and inequalities are increasingly experienced as injustices by the population.” In Morocco, income poverty “has declined significantly, but the proportion of people affected by multidimensional poverty remains high,” reads the report. The report stated that inequalities still have significant impact on the country’s social cohesion. The words “inequalities” and “disparities” appeared more than 130 times in CESE’s 190-page report. Public’s intolerance toward inequality is increasing and citizens have become more aware of their rights and have been expressing more dissatisfaction, needs, and expectations. In February, King Mohammed VI said in a message to the participants of the third parliamentary forum on social justice, “It has become clear that our [development] model, which contributed to countless tangible economic and social achievements, is no longer able to respond to citizens’ growing demands and needs.” To illustrate “citizens’ feeling of frustration,” the report stated that the rate of subjective poverty, which was around 45 percent in 2014, significantly exceeded the rate of monetary poverty, at 4.8 percent. According to the CESE report, Morocco has made progress in the number of people living with monetary poverty, which decreased from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 4.8 percent in 2014. In 2014, the poverty line in Morocco was set at an annual expenditure per capita of MAD 4,667 in urban areas and MAD 4,312 in rural areas. However, in Morocco economic disparities assessment  can only be made indirectly through differences in annual expenditures per inhabitant. Morocco’s statistical apparatus does not enable it to measure income disparities, the report noted. Young people suffer the highest unemployment rates, with an unemployment rate of 26.5 percent in 2017, compared to 10.2 percent as the national average. The rate exceeds 40 percent among young people in urban areas. The exclusion of young people in employment is due, according to the report, to the fact that the job market favors people with experience, and there is a mismatch between training and employment opportunities. The report also mentioned discriminatory and unjust behaviors such as corruption and nepotism as contributors to a system where merit is less important and to young people’s lack of confidence in the labor market. According to a 2014 survey by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), approximately 64 percent of people surveyed estimated that inequality had increased in Morocco, and only 7 percent thought that inequality had declined. The highlighted figures represent, according to CESE, “a weak capacity of the economic, social, institutional, and political environment to meet the expectations of large sections of the population and to improve their living conditions.” Disproportionate exclusion from the labor market also impacts women, whose unemployment rate was around 14.7 percent compared to 8.8 percent for men in 2017. The report explained the inequality in employment towards women by cultural discrimination and social stereotypes. The increasing use of social media and electronic press is another factor which contributed to changing citizens’ attitudes towards inequality, especially among young people.  The report said that internet and social media have enormously contributed to citizens’ awareness and public mobilization because social media has become a space for free expression and raising debate and issues of common interest to society. The report added that access to the internet has allowed citizens to make comparisons between their own standard of living and that of other sections in society, especially comparison between social classes, between different regions, between sexes, and comparisons of living conditions with those abroad. The other element of change that has made social and regional inequalities even more intolerable is the ineffectiveness of social mobility mechanisms for large segments of the population. The dissatisfaction climate among certain segments of society “is linked to the weakening of the meritocracy and the failure of traditional social elevators, such as equitable access to employment, equal opportunities, quality education for all,” wrote the report. The report cited HCP’s figures on intergenerational mobility, published in 2013, which showed that only 35 percent of people aged 35 and over experienced upward social mobility compared to their parents, while the others experienced stagnated or decreased mobility. Women and rural dwellers have more difficulty rising in social hierarchy due to discrimination. According to the report, upward social mobility is attained by more men than women (43.7 percent to 17.9 percent) as well as urban dwellers than rural people (51.1 percent to 14.8 percent). On the other hand, downward mobility concerned more women (61 percent) than men (24.1 percent), and rural women (44 percent compared to urban women (19.3 percent). CESE proposed recommendations covering priority areas of action to reduce inequalities in Morocco’s society. CESE recommended that “the strengthening of social justice, accountability, good governance, the fight against corruption and all forms of abuse, should be put in parallel with an in-depth action to redress existing economic, social, and regional inequalities.” CESE is an independent constitutional institution that King Mohammed VI set up on February 21, 2011. The council provides advisory services to the government and the two houses of Parliament. It also gives its opinion on the general orientations of the national economy and sustainable development. Nizar Baraka, former finance and economy minister and secretary general of Morocco’s Istiqlal (Independence) party, is the president of CESE.

Rabat – The Iranian embassy cultural attaché has left Algeria. Moussawi’s departure followed rounds of accusations from both Algerian activists and Moroccan officials.  Algerian activists and officials had called on the Algerian government to expel Moussawi for his alleged “dangerous and suspicious” actions in the country. After Morocco cut diplomatic ties with Iran on May 1 over Hezbollah-Polisario alleged collusion, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita accused Moussawi of “having the power to fund the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.” “[It’s] our understanding that he’s more powerful than the ambassador himself and his connection(s) are the strategic advisors to the Supreme Guide to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” said Bourita in an interview with Fox News in May. Moussawi announced his departure from Algeria in a Facebook post on Sunday. He thanked Algeria and commended the “good cooperation we received from the official and popular circles.” Several Algerian activists had accused the cultural attaché of spreading Shia ideology among youth in Algeria. The Baghdad Post reported in May that Moussawi succeeded in recruiting “thousands of Shiites in Algeria as their number increased from around 3,000 Shiites in 2013 to nearly 100,000 by the end of 2017.” Moussawi arrived in Algeria in 2015. The former adviser to Algeria’s Ministry of Religious Affairs, Idah Falahi, told Asharq Al-Awsat that he urged the Iranian diplomat to resign from his position in order to protect the public interest. “I think it has become necessary for the cultural attaché at the Iranian Embassy to be relieved of his duties and position,” he said Falahi also questioned Moussawi’s movements and actions in the country. Asharq Al-Awsat also reported that Iran is seeking g to indoctrinate and hire Algerian Shiites “who travel to Iraq on religious visits to the holy city of Karbala.” The news outlet quoted Algerian MP Abdurrahman Saidi, who believes that Iranian efforts seek to establish a “regional Shiite movement called ‘Maghreb Party,’” as reported by the Middle East Institute. Morocco has expressed about the alleged threat that Iran poses in the Middle East and Africa through its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. In a recent interview with US media outlet Breitbart News, Bourita said that Iran wanted to develop a presence in Morocco. “Today they are repeating the efforts in other North African countries. They attracted some of our youth by giving them scholarships,” he said. Bourita said that Morocco first severed ties with Iran in 2009 when Rabat noticed suspicious actions from an Iranian cultural attaché. According to Bourita, the Iranian diplomat used to visit “small cities of Morocco making what he was calling book festivals. He was giving books. He was present in every small city.” Moroccan authorities also said that the Iranian diplomat had been attempting to convince Moroccan youth to favor Shia Islam as practiced in Iran.

 The boycott, launched on April 20, targeted three companies with large market shares for high prices in the Moroccan market: Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone, and Afriquia Gaz. Significant financial loss for Centrale Danone
 The main actor in the Moroccan dairy sector, Centrale Danone, experienced the largest loss. The company suffered a net loss of MAD 115 million in the first half of 2018 in comparison to a net gain of MAD 56 million during the same period in 2017. The dairy company found itself forced, in the face of angry boycotters, to reduce the quantity of milk it purchased from farmers and release more than 800 employees working under interim contracts.

The company broke its silence less than two weeks into the boycott and launched consulting campaigns with consumers in Casablanca, Marrakech, Rabat, Meknes, and Agadir, to collect proposals from consumers in order to find a compromise on a price for milk. The campaigns ended by reducing the price of 1 liter of milk from MAD 7 to MAD 6.40 to satisfy and meet the purchasing power of consumers. Centrale Danone is a subsidiary of the multinational French company Danone, managed by Emmanuel Faber. Faber visited Morocco in the midst of the boycott to attempt to reconcile with consumers. Sidi Ali’s sales drop by 87% Oulmes Mineral Water, known for its subsidiary Sidi Ali, has netted only MAD 9.74 million in the first half of 2018, down 87 percent from net earnings in the first half of 2017. 
 A dominating shareholder of the bottled water market with 72 percent of the market, Sidi Ali attributed its high prices to the government’s high taxes. Sidi Ali said it paid MAD 657,072,912 in taxes, which includes VAT, water resource utilization fee, a local domestic consumption tax, the environmental tax and tax mark fees. The 2017 tax burden represented an increase of 9.8 percent in comparison to 2016. The tax paid to the Oulmes locality was MAD 99,056,958, while the water abstraction fee was MAD 48,288,916. Oulmes pointed out that Sidi Ali’s profit margin, after deducting all expenses, is 7 percent, or MAD 0.40 per liter. According to the company’s data, released in fiscal year 2017, its profits exceeded 195 million, a growth of 16 percent compared to 2016, which generated MAD 165 million in profits.  The former president of the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM), Miriem Bensaleh-Chaqroun, owns Oulmes Mineral Water company and its subsidiaries, Sidi Ali; Ait Atlas; Bahia; and carbonated water, Oulmes. The company distributes its products in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Afriquia Gaz continues it’s silence  Afriquia Gaz’s net profits are not available, as the company is not on the stock market and not responsible to release any financial data. Afriquia Gaz and other fuel companies have raised their profit margin since the liberalization of fuel prices in December 2015 under Abdelilah Benkirane’s government. An MP in the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD), Omar Balafrej, strongly criticized national fuel companies and called for the government to retrieve the amount that customers paid above the previously regulated price since liberalization. The minister of agriculture and fisheries, Aziz Akhannouch, owns Afriquia Gaz, which is part of the holding group, Akwa Group, founded by Akhannouch’s father. Akhannouch strongly defended Centrale Danone during the boycott but did not speak out about his own company. The Moroccan government, under Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, said that the boycott would discourage foreign investors. Official data show that during the period of August 2017-2018, foreign direct investments fell to MAD 14.6 million, according to El Othmani.   The boycott has raised calls to set a cap on fuel, dairy, and mineral water prices to meet Moroccans’ purchasing power and reactivate the regulatory body to open the field for competition and combat companies with large market shares.

Rabat- After Moroccan maritime police stopped hundreds of Moroccans on Martil beach trying to leave for Europe, some protested to demand the right to migrate. When a migrant boat approached a beach in Martil, a town on the Mediterranean near Tetouan, on Saturday night, September 22, to pick up undocumented migrants hoping to leave for Europe, maritime police made a surprise appearance. A video of the incident shows migrants franticly making their way back to the shore to escape the authorities. Disappointed, many Moroccans wishing to migrate protested that night, chanting the slogan: “The people want free herga [irregular migration]!” Morocco has become strict with undocumented migration, especially in northern regions.   Authorities in northern cities have deployed security barriers to stop irregular Moroccan migrants from leaving for Europe. According to a statement from Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH) on Monday, security services in Tangier and other northern cities and towns like Martil have arrested young Moroccans and sub-Saharans trying to escape to Europe. Authorities transported the migrants back to their home cities under strict supervision. “Hundreds of young people in Martil flood to the town’s shores with the hope of migrating irregularly across the Mediterranean,” ONDH emphasized. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has said that “at the end of August 2018, 54,000 attempts of emigration were aborted in Morocco [compared to] 39,000 during the same period of 2017.” Moroccans account for 13 percent of undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018 (7,100 Moroccans). The Spanish Ministry of Interior indicated that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.”

Rabat – Matteo Guendouzi has made it clear for everyone he wants to play for France.  Despite all the efforts by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and coach Herve Renard, the football player born in France to a Moroccan father and a French mother has no interest in becoming an Atlas Lion, crushing the hopes of all his Moroccan fans to see him wear the red and green colors.  “I’ve always played in the French youth team, so putting on the A des Bleus jersey is one of my goals, it’s a dream in the back of my mind,” he said in an interview with French outlet l’Equipe. “I’m focused on what I have to do with Arsenal, it is important for me to continue to progress, I am only nineteen years old, we must not forget it, the rest will follow if I am good,” he added.  The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has worked hard to convince Guendouzi for a year and a half.  It all began in 2017, when FRMF and Herve Renard called Guendouzi to join the national team. At the time, Guendouzi’s father stood up the French coach, who was supposed to meet him during his stay in Paris. Renard and FRMF decided to give it another shot this year. Al Massae reported that Guendouzi’s father was invited to Morocco for the game between the Atlas Lions and Malawi. Originally from the town of Berkane, the father simply replied that the decision was up to his son. Last week, several English media outlets reported that Renard flew to England to watch Guendouzi play with Arsenal and discuss with him a possible future with the Lions.  Guendouzi, who transferred to Arsenal this year, has made headlines for his good start with the club as a midfielder. The 19-year-old footballer was trained at PSG between 2005 and 2014 before continuing his training and becoming a professional. The French-Moroccan  evolved with the second league French club from 2014 to 2018. He played 26 games with the professionals (8 in Ligue 1, 18 in Ligue 2).

Rabat – While the primary school drop-out rate in urban areas is 1.1 percent, it is 5.7 percent in rural areas. In response to allegations that the drop-out rate of 5.7 percent in the 2017-2018 school year had doubled compared to the previous year, the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training explained in a press release that the rate only concerns rural areas. The urban drop-out rate of 1.1 percent represented 38,740 students. For the secondary school, the drop-out rate reached 12 percent nationally—183,218 students. The supervising ministry claimed that the drop-out rate in 2017-2018 did not double from the previous school year. However, the ministry did not clarify what the drop-out rate was the previous year.

The ministry called for citizens and the media to check “the veracity and accuracy of data related to the education system before publishing.” To combat the school drop-out rate, the minister of national education, vocational training, higher education, and scientific research, Said Amzazi, presented his strategy to King Mohammed VI on Monday, September 17. The strategy aims to increase the number of children accessing schools by consolidating the “Tayssir program” (Facilitation program) that gives financial support to parents to formally enroll children aged 6 to 15 in schools. Amzazi also promised a new generation of a vocational training centers that should meet economic needs. He urged all stakeholders and concerned parties to contribute to the projects to address the challenges that education is experiencing.  By 2024-2025, the minister aims to reduce the drop-out rate in primary schools from 5.7 percent to 1 percent in rural areas, and in secondary schools from 12 percent to 3 percent nationally.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has addressed a congratulatory message to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on his country’s 88th National Day. The King expressed his “profound pride” in the bonds of sincere fraternity and mutual esteem “which bind us personally and unite our two royal families.” The King also expressed pride in the level of relations existing between the two countries, based on fruitful cooperation and active solidarity. The monarch also expressed his determination to work to reinforce bilateral relations to reach “higher levels” between the two countries. In August, the monarch invited Saudi Arabia’s King Salman to visit Morocco. The invitation was conveyed through the Moroccan Hajj delegation in Mecca. King Salman also sent his greetings and esteem to the King and the Moroccan people, emphasizing the ties of “fraternity linking the two royal families and the solidity of historical relations between the two peoples.” Saudi-Moroccan relations strained? Some citizens and analysts speculated that there was tension between the two countries after Saudi Arabia’s decision to vote for United 2026 in the 2026 World Cup host vote in June instead of Morocco. Saudi Arabia angered Moroccan football fans further when it campaigned against Morocco’s bid in favor of the North American dossier before the vote. Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis between the Saudi coalition and Qatar incensed the general sports authority chairman of Saudi Arabia, Turki Al-Sheikh. Al Sheikh took to his Twitter to blame Morocco for losing Saudi Arabia’s favor because of its neutrality. Al Sheikh tweeted, “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. Also increasing speculation of tension was King Salman’s decision to summer in Neom in Saudi Arabia, instead of Morocco. Known for spending his summer holidays in Morocco, the Saudi King summered in Neom to inaugurate a project to create more job opportunities in the technology sector and tourism. Morocco also decided not to participate in a meeting of communication ministers from countries in the Coalition Supporting Legitimacy in Yemen on June 23 in Saudi Arabia. Morocco’s Minister of Communication Mohamed Laaraj said that the country decided not to attend the meeting due to a “busy agenda.” The decision came a day after Saudi Arabia voted for United 2026.

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred is getting support from his loyal fans in the midst of charges over two rape allegations.  Following his return to jail on September 18, the Moroccan singer’s fans launched an online petition asking his former lawyer, Eric Dupond Moretti, to come back and “save Saad’s future.”  “Saad Lamjarred, the Moroccan popstar, needs the help of Maitre Dupond Moretti, to get out of the claws of the trap in which he fell, on behalf of all the fans, we ask you to sign this petition which will be addressed to this illustrious lawyer. Our heartfelt thanks,” wrote the initiator of the petition.  Launched a week ago, the petition has been signed by more than a thousand of Lamjarred’s fans.  Dupond Moretti had announced his withdrawal from Lamjarred’s first rape case in France after the Moroccan singer was accused of a second rape. French authorities arrested the 33-year-old singer in Saint Tropez in southeastern France on Sunday, August 26, after police received a new rape complaint from another woman. The pop star was then released under judicial supervision, but prohibited from leaving France or contacting the complainant. In addition, the singer was required to pay bail of €150,000. Eric Dupond Moretti told Moroccan news outlet Le 360 that he is no longer a member of the Moroccan singer’s defense team. However, he refused to explain why he dropped the case. King Mohammed VI had appointed the lawyer to defend Lamjarred when he was arrested in France in the first case for violence and rape in October 2016. According to a source close to the singer, who spoke with Al Yaoum 24, the lawyer decided to stop defending Lamjarred because he did not the lawyer’s advice. Dupond Moretti had advised Lamjarred to be as discreet as possible, but the singer appeared on social media, taking pictures with fans, and released new music.  The Moroccan singer is still awaiting trial following the accusations of Laura Prioul from 2016.

Rabat- Authorities in Morocco’s northern cities have deployed security barriers to stop irregular Moroccan migrants from leaving for Europe. Morocco’s new strict approach to countering undocumented migration has borne fruit.  Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH) stated Monday that security services in Tangier and other northern cities and towns like Martil, have arrested several young Moroccans and sub-Saharans trying to escape to Europe.

ONDH wrote: “Security services have organized campaigns to stop dozens of young people at the entrances of the tourist cities in the north.” ONDH stated that authorities transported the migrants back to their home cities under strict supervision. As a strategic gateway between Africa and Europe, Tangier has witnessed an influx of hundreds of migrants. The observatory emphasized in its statement that “hundreds of young people in Martil flood to the town’s shores with the hope of migrating irregularly across the Mediterranean.”  Authorities have not yet made an official announcement concerning the new strict measures against irregular migration in the northern cities. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, September 20, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said, “At the end of August 2018, 54,000 attempts of emigration were aborted in Morocco [compared to] 39,000 during the same period of 2017.” Moroccans account for 13 percent of undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018 (7,100 Moroccans). According to El Khalfi, 8,2000 Moroccans attempted to migrate to Europe in 2017. He added that Morocco is increasing efforts to combat immigration networks “which continue to develop their methods.” Spain has reactivated an agreement concluded with Morocco in 1992. The agreement allows Spain to deport migrants to the kingdom. On August 23, Spanish authorities implemented the agreement, sending back 116 migrants to Morocco who had successfully crossed the fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. The Spanish Ministry of Interior indicated that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.” Every year, hundreds of migrants take the risky sea route or cross controlled fences to reach the closest European country with the belief that they could lead a better life. Mohamed Daadaoui, a specialist of North African politics at Oklahoma City University, said that the “Moroccan youth are all too eager to take the risk of crossing [to Europe] given the dire socio-economic situation in Morocco.  “Their prospects for jobs and economic empowerment have not improved, especially in the Northern part of the country,” he stated. The head of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), Nabila Mounib, had a different take on emigration. Mounib said in a press conference earlier this month that it is the “monopolization” of the country’s wealth that causes young Moroccans to choose to emigrate or migrate. Be it high-qualified Moroccans emigrating with the belief that “their country does not encourage scientific research” or unemployed Moroccans seeking jobs abroad, it is all due to “monopoly” and “theft” in the country, Mounib stated.

Rabat – Morocco continues to be the muse of the biggest names in the fashion industry, and Roberto Cavalli is no exception.  The Italian brand, led by the Englishman Paul Surridge, presented a collection on Saturday, September 22, inspired by the desert of the North African country, during the fourth day of Milan Fashion Week.   The hallmarks of Roberto Cavalli – artisanship, handcraft, sensuality. #RobertoCavalliSS19  #MFW An angelical @felicenova for #RobertoCavalli by creative director #PaulSurridge A post shared by  Roberto Cavalli Official (@roberto_cavalli) on Sep 22, 2018 at 9:51am PDT  Roberto Cavalli’s models walked in a feminine, versatile, and dynamic collection for spring-summer 2019, bringing up to date the ingredients that made the success of the house Florentine. Alluring outfits, luxurious materials, and craftsmanship were remixed in a more sporty and modern style.   Embroideries have a sensitivity to the body, to its needs. #RobertoCavalliSS19 by #PaulSurridge A post shared by  Roberto Cavalli Official (@roberto_cavalli) on Sep 22, 2018 at 11:46am PDT  “I recently traveled with my team to Morocco. I wanted to mix the tradition of ornamentation, an important element of the vocabulary of the Cavalli house, with those of Moroccan craftsmen,” explained Surridge to AFP.   Women's collection Spring Summer 2019 Fashion Show Livestream at robertocavalli.com, Saturday September 22nd, 12:30 PM CET ~ #RobertoCavalliSS19 A post shared by  Roberto Cavalli Official (@roberto_cavalli) on Sep 20, 2018 at 9:21am PDT  The Moroccan touch can be found in sequins finishing dresses and in jackets with traditional Amazigh (Berber) rugs with fringes and silver sequins.The animal motif, dear to Roberto Cavalli, is always present. The biggest fashion brands, and luxury in particular, love to take inspiration from Morocco for their creations. In recent years, everyday objects, some shunned by Moroccans, have fed the imagination of creators. This is the case of Nike, Puma, or even Gucci who borrow warm colors and motifs from the Moroccan culture for their collection. Recently, the French luxury brand Balenciaga chose to sell an expensive and luxurious version of the traditional Moroccan slipper, also known as “babouches” in French and “balgha” in Darija (Moroccan Arabic). On its website, Balenciaga offered a square-toe mule in either black or red leather for MAD 5,118. However, in the souks and medinas (walled cities) of Morocco, the traditional shoe is sold for between MAD 50 and 70, which Moroccan people have reminded the brand on social media. Social media users have slammed Balenciaga, accusing the Frenh enterprise of a “scam” and “cultural appropriation,” mocking their lack of imagination.

Rabat – Residents of Sale are expressing outrage toward criminality after a young man was murdered on the street. On Saturday, September 15, two men chased down and knived a young man in Sale, Rabat’s sister city across the Bouregreg River. In her testimony, the mother of the victim said that her son was always receiving threats from the suspects. She said they had already informed her that they would kill him. She added that she tried to talk to them and to convince them to refrain before. However, one of them told her, “We will kill him.” The mother said that she even talked to one of the suspects’ fathers. The father told her that his son is “not good. If he said he will kill then he will kill.” The tried to flee to Rabat, but the suspects ran after him with knives and murdered him when he could no longer run. The suspects violently cut and hit the young man with their knives, killing him in the Al Qaria neighborhood of Sale. Police arrested the two men, who showed investigators in front of a crowd how they murdered the young man. As they were showing authorities how they killed him, the crowd started chanting, “Death penalty!” The murder caused Sale residents to storm Al Qaria and protest criminality in the area. Protesters carried banners saying: “We want a Sale without criminality.” Protesters also called on King Mohammed VI to intervene and ensure safety, good health services, and more security in the city. Some people said that security authorities are doing a “good” job. The issue, according to protesters, is corruption in courts. Although police may arrest perpetrators of crimes, when it comes to prosecution, authorities may “play in files” and release suspects for bribes.

Rabat – More than three months after Minister of Governance and General Affairs Lahcen Daoudi resigned, he is still on the job. Daoudi still performs his ministerial duties and participates in government activities. In an interview posted online September 18, a journalist from Moroccan news outlet Horizon TV asked Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid about Daoudi’s resignation. Ramid described the journalist’s question as “bizarre.”  The minister explained that each institution requires resignations be accepted, including the monarchy. He added that the practice is common in all institutions, including in administrations and newsrooms. He explained that when an employee submits a resignation request, all concerned parties have to approve it. In response, the journalist said, “Ok, it is clear, the resignation of Lahcen Daoudi was refused.” Ramid did not comment on the journalist’s conclusion. Daoudi submitted his resignation in June after citizens and his political party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), heavily criticized him for participating in a protest with Centrale Danone employees against the boycott of their company for high prices. Since the launch of the boycott against three prominent companies in April, Daoudi angered boycotters by defending dairy company Centrale Danone and saying in May that the boycott was going on for “no reason.” Daoudi said then that he resigned to protect PJD. In an attempt to explain his participation in the protest, Daoudi said that it was “unplanned” and that he walked into the sit-in while arriving at Parliament for a parliamentary committee meeting. Following the protest, PJD published a series of statements condemning Daudi’s participation in the protest. The party described Daoudi’s move as “unreasonable” and “inappropriate.” To date, King Mohammed VI has not approved Daoudi’s resignation request, as required by the Moroccan constitution for it to be effective.

Rabat – Following the finalization of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, the European Parliament’s agricultural committee has shown its support for the agricultural deal. In a notice, AGRI recommended the approval of the Moroccan-EU deal on agriculture. AGRI said that the new agricultural agreement reinforces the legal basis for preferential trade and provides a “stable and indisputable framework” for trade with “an important EU partner.” The notice was addressed to the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade (INTA). Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported on Saturday that INTA has already discussed the “strategic importance of the relations between Morocco and the European Union.” Earlier this month, INTA discussed a draft resolution to explain the benefits of the agricultural deal in Western Sahara. INTA will table the draft for a vote in early December in the INTA Committee. The draft argues that the agreement offers job opportunities and environmental development in Western Sahara, particularly in the cities of Dakhla and Laayoune. The draft followed a visit from members of the INTA committee in early September to Western Sahara to evaluate the development efforts in the region and the benefits of Morocco-EU agreements on local inhabitants. The EU and Morocco finalized the fisheries deal on July 24. Authorities anticipate that the agreement will be a new step, providing new spirit in strategic Morocco-EU relations. However, before entering into effect, the fisheries agreement must pass through the European Parliament and receive approval by all 28 EU member states. The committee called on the EU and Morocco to “restore good trade relations quickly and to make progress in the negotiations for the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area.’

Rabat – With many undocumented Moroccans migrating to Europe, the Moroccan youth minister has said Morocco has “enough assets to provide spaces suitable” for Moroccan youth. Journalists asked Minister Rachid Talbi Alami about emigration from Morocco on the sidelines of the opening ceremony of the second annual University of Independent Youth on Friday, September 21, in Marrakech. The minister of sports and youth told the press, “It is not the migration of these young people to neighboring countries that is a problem, but the way they try to immigrate, which puts their lives in danger.” Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi spoke about migration on Thursday in the press conference after the government council’s weekly meeting. He said, “At the end of August 2018, 54,000 attempts of emigration were aborted in Morocco [compared to] 39,000 during the same period of 2017.” According to El Khalfi, Moroccans account for 13 percent of undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2018 (7,100 Moroccans). He added that 8,2000 Moroccans attempted to migrate to Europe in 2017. The official said that Morocco is increasing efforts to combat immigration networks “which continue to develop their methods.” According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 6,000 Moroccans arrived in Spain by sea in 2018 as of September 9. In the same period in 2017, up to September 10, 2,683 Moroccans arrived in Spain, according to IOM. Talbi Alabi said that Moroccan youth trying to immigrate are looking for a better life. “Can not this ‘better life’ be granted to Morocco or are there things that prevent this?” He added that Morocco has potential to offer youth a better life and opportunities. “But this energy and these opportunities are not well exploited to give good results,” Talbi Alami concluded. On Tuesday, Secretary General of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) Nabila Mounib said that Moroccans emigrate to seek job opportunities due to “monopoly” and “theft” in Morocco. She said the situation also prevents youth from voting and that 70 percent of Moroccans prefer not to vote because they see no point in it. Figures of undocumented migrants differ from a source to another.  In August, Spain’s Ministry of Interior released a report estimated the number of Moroccan undocumented migrants who arrived in Spain between 2016 and 2018 at 10,104. The Spanish Ministry of Interior also indicated that more than 250,000 undocumented Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.”

Rabat – Hostility may ratchet up again between Royal Air Maroc and its pilots in the Moroccan Association of Airline Pilots union (AMPL). Local media reported on Saturday that the crisis between RAM and AMPL may continue as pilots voted against an agreement introduced by the state-owned air carrier and the union in mid-August. In July, the company experienced a wave of protests from pilots who were calling for a pay raise. The pilots also called for the reestablishment of a school of aviation in Morocco after the closure of RAM’s training center for pilots in 2014. The protests resulted in the delay and cancelation of more than 12 flights a day for nearly a month. RAM and AMPL said that they reached an agreement in mid-August to end the crisis. The deal aimed to focus on recruitment to end the shortage of pilots. RAM noted that the company-funded training center for pilots “is no longer a priority.” The deal entailed that “recruitment needs will continue to be satisfied through partnerships with foreign training institutions.” The agreement also gave pilots four days off monthly, in addition to the traditional two days off per week, a pay raise, and a grant to pay a third of pilots’ training fees. However, of the 426 members of the AMPL, 359 pilots voted against the agreement. On September 18, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani inaugurated the Moroccan Private Aviation Academy (MAPA) in Benslimane, near Rabat. El Othmani said that the project is set to meet the growing needs of the aviation industry. The school will offer training to pilots and aviation maintenance technicians to address the shortage. According to El Othmani, Africa will need some 4,900 pilots in the coming years, as well as a large number of technicians. The project benefits from government assistance.

Arthur Perrault, a fugitive priest accused of child sexual abuse who fled New Mexico in 1992 has been extradited from Morocco. FBI agents assumed custody of Perrault from Moroccan authorities on Thursday, September 20, and extradited him from Morocco to the US to face federal child sexual abuse charges in New Mexico. “Bringing Arthur Perrault back to New Mexico took a lot of patience and perseverance, but the FBI and our partners were determined to make sure he faced justice,” said FBI special agent in charge James Langenberg.  Moroccan authorities arrested Perrault on October 12, 2017. He was arrested “on a provisional arrest warrant issued based on the charges in the indictment,” the US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico announced Friday, September 21.  Perrault, 80, was a Catholic priest who served in New Mexico’s Archdiocese of Santa Fe from 1973 to 1992. “The FBI located him in Morocco last year. He was working at an English-language school for children and subsequently fired, according to authorities,” reported news outlet KOB. Perrault had been living in Tangier and working at the American Language Center there since he left the US in 1992. According to the US Attorney’s Office, Perrault is “charged in a seven-count indictment with engaging in acts constituting aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact with a minor under the age of 12.” Count 1 of the indictment stated that Perrault committed sexual acts on a child under the age of 12. The indictment alleges that Perrault repeatedly sexually abused a minor victim at the Kirtland Air Force base in New Mexico and at the Santa Fe National Cemetery in New Mexico in 1991 and 1992. “The indictment alleges a profound breach of trust by an individual who was widely perceived as a mentor to young people and a respected figure in the community,” said US Attorney John Anderson. Although Perrault is accused of acts committed many years ago, the “indictment should make clear that the U.S. Attorney’s Office will pursue justice for victims despite the passage of time or the many miles this defendant sought to put between himself and these alleged offenses,” Anderson added. Perrault was scheduled to first appear before US Magistrate Judge Karen Molzen on Friday afternoon. On Friday, Perrault pleaded not guilty to the seven charges brought against him, according to KOB. If found guilty, Perrault could face a maximum penalty of a lifetime imprisonment. Following Perrault’s extradition, the FBI Albuquerque office in New Mexico, which investigated the case, recognized the effort of the Moroccan government. “The extradition of Perrault is the result of close cooperation between these investigating agencies and prosecutors, the Morocco Ministry of Justice, Moroccan law enforcement authorities, the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs, and the FBI Legal Attaché in Morocco,” reads the US Attorney Office’s statement.

Rabat- Moroccans have condemned the violence committed against a Sub-Saharan migrant in Nador, as shown in a new video. “Here is how Sub-saharan migrants are treated,” the Moroccan association for human rights captioned a video posted to its official Facebook page. The video shows a group of policemen violently handling a sub-Saharan African migrant at a police station in the city of Nador, in the northeastern Rif region.   The human rights association claims that the migrant was ill and had requested to be taken to a hospital when the policemen forced him out. The video, which dates to September 11, has provoked angry reactions from Moroccans who described the act as “cruel” and “racist.” It is not the first time that sub-Saharan migrants received similar treatments and complained of violence. On July 8, a fire blazed among the belongings and camps of sub-Saharan migrants in a park in front of Ouled Ziane bus station in Casablanca, following gas bottle explosions. The camps were home to dozens of undocumented sub-Saharan African migrants. The incident occured only a few hours after a fire broke out in camps of sub-Saharan migrants in Fez. Although authorities did not announce an official cause of the fire, some sub-Saharan migrants in Casablanca claimed that drug-addicted “hooligans” in the region had tried many times to set their camps on fire. “Those unsober hooligans come to our camps, but we don’t chase them away because we don’t have the right to because it’s their country,” a migrant said to Moroccan news outlet Hespress. “We are strangers here, so we can’t bother them,” he stated. In November 2017, violent clashes between sub-Saharan migrants and a group of Moroccans broke out in the area, resulting in a fire in the same park of Casablanca. Hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants arrive in Morocco each year. Some attempt the perilous crossing from the North African country to Europe, especially Spain. In 2017, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) assistant high commissioner for protection, Volker Turk, told Morocco World News that Morocco is now establishing itself as a destination for refugees and migrants. “Morocco remains a transit country for refugees and migrants, it is also fast becoming a country of destination,” said Volker. Morocco, however, has been calling for more lasting solutions to end the struggles faced by migrants.

Rabat – With Ibrahim Ghali and his “boss” Bouteflika suffering health problems, El Tiempo has warned that Polisario and Algeria are afraid of what could happen. El Tiempo published an article about Ghali’s health challenges on September 20 under the title “Concern about the Risk of Death of the Polisario Chief.” The news outlet reported that “in Algiers, the mobilization of the presidency and the intelligence services are at their highest alert.” El Tiempo’s conclusion was shared by an international analyst and a former French official. Former French Ambassador to Algeria Bernard Bajolet also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead. He said that Bouteflika is kept alive “artificially.” Earlier this week, the Alternative News Agency of Argentina published an article by Adalberto Agozino who analyzed the political earthquake in Algeria’s military. The analyst interpreted Algeria’s sacking of military officers as a way to “steal” the next election and questioning Algerian President Bouteflika’s ability to run for a fifth term as president. For Algeria, the Spanish media said the country “fears the worst” as the leader of the front was transferred to a hospital in Algiers. It also said that Algeria is concerned about the death of the “so-called straw man” of the Algerian regime in the Western Sahara conflict. According to El Tiempo, Ibrahim Ghali is suffering from Hepatitis C and “Bouteflika’s “public appearances are very sporadic.” Bouteflika suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013. El Tiempo concluded that Bouteflika will run for a fifth mandate. However, the president has to “present himself. Otherwise, it would be a jarring note.”

Rabat – Queen Rania of Jordan has presented Edraak K-12, her educational platform for children in the Arab world.  She released it at a press conference Monday, September 17. Edraak K-12, which caters to school-aged children throughout the Arab World, is an expansion of Edraak.org, the leading Arabic Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform for adult learners. Through her new project, the wife of King Abdullah II aims to democratize modern teaching methods and offer children in the region alternatives in the Arabic language on her platform. “We started by launching math materials for grades six to twelve, but we are not stopping here because our students deserve much more than this,” she said. “Today, the internet is replete with e-learning resources that students around the world can utilize in conjunction with their core school curricula as means for revision, practice or learning support. Unfortunately, most of these resources are in English, and hence Jordanian and Arab students are likely to miss out,” she added.  Queen Rania explained that the students will be able to learn a lot on the platform which is easy to access via phone or tablet. With MOOCs, children can watch lessons with school curricula and assess their knowledge through exercises.  “I urge parents and teachers to introduce their children and students to the world of online learning and encourage them to capitalize on the K-12 platform. After all, it was built for them,” she explained.  Several firms were present at the press conference, including Samsung, which donated 100 tablets to help promote the platform.

Rabat – The former French ambassador to Algeria, Bernard Bajolet, has questioned Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s ability to lead. French news outlet Le Figaro published an interview with Bajolet on Thursday. Bajolet spoke about his experience as an ambassador in Algeria. The former French representative also served as head of the General Directorate of External Security (DGSE). When asked about Algerian-French diplomatic ties, Bajolet said that he believes in an “evolution by small steps for two reasons.” The first reason for Bajolet is the Algerian sentiment towards the former colonial power and how Bouteflika figures into that. “The first is a generation problem. The Algerian nomenclature, issue or heir to the Algerian war, still needs to legitimize itself by exploiting feelings towards the former colonial power,” he said. France had colonized Algeria for nearly 130 years.  The North African country has been experiencing political tremors as the Algerian president ordered the dismissal of several senior officials before the next election. However, for some, Bouteflika is an “artificial president.”  Bajolet’s second reason questioned Bouteflika’s ability as a president. “The second reason is more cyclical: President Bouteflika, with all the respect I feel for him, is kept alive artificially. And nothing will change in this transition period,” he said. Bajolet’s criticism followed similar remarks from an Algerian journalist and activist, Layla Haddad. In June, the journalist published two videos in which she criticized the Algerian government, Bouteflika, and his brother and advisor Said Bouteflika. The first video was recorded at the European Parliament’s studio in Brussels, which angered the Algerian embassy in Belgium. In the video, the journalist described Bouteflika as a “heap of flesh.” In the second five-minute video, Haddad said, “I had asked your brother Said to show compassion and to release you. A feeling tells me that you wish to withdraw and that you are waiting for a favorable moment.” She added, “Reality is an intense darkness for Algerian people because of a group of criminals who became decision-makers after your illness,” referring to Bouteflika’s debilitating stroke in 2013. Argentina analyst Adalberto Agozino also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to run for a fifth term in the 2019 election. He also interpreted the purge of Algerian military officers as a way to clear obstacles before the election. “Algeria’s constitution establishes a maximum of two five-year presidential terms, but President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81 and wheelchair-bound since 2013, will stand for a fifth consecutive term in elections without any international oversight,” explained Agozino.

Rabat- Nabila Mounib has said that the “monopolization” of the country’s wealth causes young Moroccans to choose to emigrate. During a press conference on Tuesday, the head of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) Nabila Mounib questioned Morocco’s pathway to democracy. Be it high-qualified Moroccans emigrating with the belief that “their country does not encourage scientific research” or unemployed Moroccans seeking jobs abroad, it is all due to “monopoly” and “theft” in the country, Mounib stated. Mounib referred to elections in Morocco, saying that 70 percent of Moroccans prefer not to vote because they see no point in voting, knowing that the elections will only “breed thieves” and “corrupt” individuals. Mounib also addressed the prison sentences given to Hirak activists, saying: “How is it reasonable that we get punished because we demand our rights?” The politician called on Moroccans to stand together and demand the release of the activists sentenced from 1 to 20 years in prison. Hundreds of Moroccans already rallied in protests in cities across the country, including Casablanca, Rabat, and the northern city of Nador, to denounce the “heavy” sentences. Mounib maintained that Morocco deserves a “real democracy” rather than a “fake” one, stating: “We cannot keep watching when the country is at such a disadvantage.”  According to a study by Moroccan job portal, ReKrute, 91 percent of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and younger are tempted to work abroad, in search of better work conditions and quality of life, including health care and comfort. The study suggests that motivations vary on an individual basis, as many Moroccan companies fall short of employee expectations and do not put strong efforts into winning back the qualified people who have left for other countries like France and Canada. Moroccan news outlet Medias24, indicates that Moroccan physicians and doctors, in particular, experience tough working conditions domestically—being underpaid and under-equipped—which prompts them to emigrate. Many young Moroccans put their lives at risk to cross the Mediterranean to the closest European country with the belief that they could lead a better life. According to a report by Spain’s interior ministry released in August, 10,104 undocumented Moroccans arrived in Spain between 2016 and 2018.  The Spanish Ministry of Interior emphasized that more than 250,000 irregular Moroccans are currently living in Spain, with close to 5,000 identified as “unaccompanied minors.” Mohamed Daadaoui, a specialist of North African politics at Oklahoma City University, said that the “Moroccan youth are all too eager to take the risk of crossing [to Europe] given the dire socio-economic situation in Morocco.  “Their prospects for jobs and economic empowerment have not improved, especially in the Northern part of the country,” he stated.

Rabat – The Moroccan mining group, Managem, has presented a feasibility study to Gabon’s government for the Eteke gold mining project. The Gabonese Minister of Equipment, Infrastructure, and Mines Christian Magnagna received Managem-Gabon corporation officials on Wednesday to examine the Eteke gold deposit project and the renewal of the Bakoudou deposit mining agreement. During the meeting, Toumi hoped for a quick launch of the project under a win-win partnership between Managem and Gabon. “We have finalized the feasibility study and we hope that the project will start in the coming years,” said Toumi. “We discussed the next stages with the government member to finalize the last discussions around the partnership in order to move toward its realization,” he added. For Magnagna, the government is building high expectations on the attractive project in terms of rentability for both the Moroccan mining corporation and Gabon as well as developing the Eteke area. “The government wanted to ensure that in the feasibility of this project, all dimensions have been taken into account,” said Magnagna. The Eteke deposit has a five-year production capability estimated between 1 ton and 1.5 tons of gold annually. For the Bakoudou deposit, Managem’s grant was renewed for three additional years. However, the group is pledged to finance projects, as part of its social responsibility, for the Bakoudou population. “Even if the mining stops today, the corporation’s social responsibility is still engaged. It is this responsibility that [Managem board members] wanted to reaffirm this morning to the government member, with the presence of Lekoko department population,” said the Bakoudou population.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, inaugurated the Moroccan Private Aviation Academy (MAPA) on Tuesday in Benslimane, near Rabat. The inauguration of the aviation school followed a wave of protests from pilots of the state-owned airline, Royal Air Maroc (RAM), in July. The pilots called for the reestablishment of a school of aviation in the country after the closure of RAM’s training center for pilots in 2014. In his statement to the press, El Othmani said that the school will meet the growing needs of the aviation industry. The school, which is the work of a Moroccan-Jordanian partnership, will offer training to pilots and aviation maintenance technicians. According to El Othmani, Africa will need some 4,900 pilots in the coming years, as well as a large number of technicians. According to the head of government, 20 percent of the students in the first class are of foreign nationalities, mostly from African countries. The project falls within the framework of King Mohammed VI’s recommendations to offer vocational training for youth. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the government will assist the academy “in the sense that this project is in harmony with the industrial acceleration plan that places the automotive and aeronautical center at the forefront.” El Othmani also promised that the government will give the necessary aid to investors, “particulaty operators in promising sectors and integrating technologies of the future, in the light of the real needs of employment at the national, regional and international levels.” The official also expressed satisfaction that MAPA received the national license for airline pilot training and the EASA European Approval for Aircraft Maintenance Technicians.  For his part, Mohammed Fayyad Khawaldeh, managing director of the Royal Jordanian Air Academy (RJA), said his company’s commitment to the project, launched in 2016, took into account Morocco’s dire need for pilots and technicians “with regard to the extension of the activities of the national airline Royal Air Maroc.” The school expects to attract 300 students from Arab and African countries annually and cost $6 million.  In July, the Moroccan Association of Airline Pilots (AMPL) complained about the absence of training centers for pilots. AMPL President Amine Mkinsi suggested that RAM could have skipped its pilot crisis if it had opened a training center. “Its reopening is a necessity because even on the international market, pilots have become a rare commodity and therefore expensive. The proof is that in 2017, the RAM wanted to hire 86 foreigners and only 26 of them accepted the offer,” he said.

Rabat- Morocco is preparing to open a new border post with Mauritania at Guelta Zemmur in the country’ southeastern provinces. The border post would be the second between Morocco and Mauritania. The only current border post is in Guerguerat, in the far southwestern part of Western Sahara. Guelta Zemmur sits 250 kilometers southeast of Laayoune on Morocco’s defense wall in the Western Sahara, approximately 20 kilometers west of the border line with Mauritania. Morocco’s Minister of Equipment Abdelkader Amara announced preparations for the project during an interview with the National Society of Radio-Broadcast and Television (SNRT). The announcement comes during the visit of Mauritania’s foreign minister, Ismail Ould Cheikh, to Morocco, to mend ties and strengthen cooperation between the two countries. Ould Cheikh began his two-day visit to Morocco on Thursday, September 20. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation explained that Ould Cheikh’s visit is to increase cooperation between the countries, the state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Moroccan and Mauritanian officials have held several meetings to boost economic cooperation and trade. The meetings were also set to discuss the situation in a neighboring Maghreb country, oil-rich Libya. Libya is facing geographical and political divisions with vying governments and the presence of multiple terrorist groups. The Mauritanian foreign minister’s visit to Morocco is a step to warm the cold diplomatic relations between the countries over sensitive issues, such as Western Sahara. From 2012 until late 2017, Mauritania had not had an ambassador in Rabat. In December, the country appointed Mohamed Lemine Ould Aboyeas as its new ambassador to Morocco. The move came two months after the Moroccan ambassador to Nouakchott, Hamid Chabar, was approved and accredited by Mauritania. The tension between Morocco and Mauritania escalated in December 2015 when Mauritanian authorities raised the Mauritanian flag in the city of Lagouira, which Morocco considers part of its territory. Frosty relations persisted even after Morocco sent a high-level delegation to Mauritania’s capital, Nouakchott, on December 12, 2015, requesting an explanation for the flag-raising incident.

Rabat – The government spokesperson discussed the mandatory military service bill at Thursday’s press conference after the government council. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the military service bill might come into force at the end of 2019. He explained that the bill will be debated in a Parliament session this week or next. “It will be discussed, as any other law in the first place; the changes will be presented and approved before forwarding it to the second chamber etc…. So it is assumed that this law should enter into force at the end of 2019,” El Khalfi said. The government announced its decision to propose bringing back 12-month compulsory military service in August. Bill 44.18 on mandatory service concerns young people aged 19 to 25, both men and women.  The decision surprised Morocco’s youth. However, some experts welcome the idea as they see it as a move to help youth contribute to the development of the country. Moulay Hicham Mouatadid, a political analyst, told Morocco World News, “The return of compulsory military service for our young people in Morocco is wise justice for the future of the country.” He added, “This return to the collective consciousness of the nation is paramount, provided that the spirit of citizenship prevails over inequality and social disparity.” However, many activists contested the move by creating a Facebook group  called “Moroccan Rally against Compulsory Military Service.”  The group explained that their rejection of the bill “came because of the government’s total lack of clarity on the bill’s real objectives.” They added that conscription cannot be proposed and implemented in such a short period. Morocco first introduced 18-month military service on June 9, 1966, in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months in 1999. But in 2006, King Mohammed VI abolished mandatory military service. On September 4, Morocco’s Istiqlal (Independence) party called on the government to practice pedagogical efforts “to correct negative stereotypes” which made the military service appear like a “mechanism for discipline and punishment or for the suppression of energies and spirit of initiative and creativity” among youth. The party also wanted the government to hear from people and communicate with them to hear their suggestions.

Rabat – The #Masaktach campaign on social media asking radio stations to stop broadcasting Saad Lamjarrad’s songs has not worked on Chada FM.  Despite Lamjarred’s return to jail pending trial in a rape case, Moroccan radio station Chada FM has not boycotted the 32-year-old singer.  “We do not intend to exclude the musical productions of the Moroccan artist from the programming grid of the station because the case is not clarified yet and the French judiciary has not pronounced judgement, and assuming that the accused is innocent until he has been sentenced,” said Chada FM in a statement shared on Facebook.  Moreover, the Moroccan station said it “encourages Moroccan art and music especially in the case where it concerns the younger generation.”  Chada FM’s decision generated a lot of reactions. Some applauded the radio’s decision while others were surprised and shocked.  A Moroccan activist and president of the Alternative Movement for Individual Freedoms (MALI) association, Betty Ibtissam Lachgar, has harshly criticized the radio’s decision.  “This station of verbal diarrhea participates OPENLY in the culture of rape and vomits its misogyny to the faces of all victims of sexual violence #Masaktach,” she said. Unlike Chada FM, Moroccan radio station 2M have cut off the pop star’s hits from its station  Moroccan journalist Samira Sitail confirmed on Twitter that 2M radio does not promote the singer’s songs because of his trouble with the French judicial system. The Moroccan singer went back to jail Tuesday, September 18, following a decision by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal in southern France after the prosecutor’s office in Draguignan appealed his release under judicial supervision. The 33-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday, August 26, in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from a young French seasonal worker. Lamjarred is still awaiting trial in a 2016 rape case in France.

Rabat – The Ministry of Education is shifting its focus from the controversy over Darija (Moroccan Arabic) to combating drop-out rates. Said Amzazi, the minister of national education, vocational training, higher education and scientific research presented his strategy to King Mohammed VI on Monday, September 17. The focus of his address was based on the recent speeches of the King, which were delivered for Throne Day and the Day of the Revolution of the King and the People in the last two months. In his speeches, the King recommended that the government increase efforts to combat the causes of children dropping out of school. Amzazi emphasized that the new programs to promote education in Morocco take into account the recommendations of Morocco’s “Strategic Vision of the 2015-2030 Reform: for a School of Equity, Quality and Promotion.” The program will cover several axes that aim to ensure access to education for all youth. The program also wants to consolidate the “Tayssir Program” (Facilitation program) that seeks to provide financial support to increase student enrollment in primary school. Tayssir is set up to give parents cash payments to formally enroll children aged 6 to 15 in school. Amzazi also discussed the implementation of a program to generalize and develop preschools. Like Tayssir, the preschool program aims to increase school enrollment and reduce dropout rates to improve the education system. In July, Amzazi said that the development of preschool education requires an annual budget of MAD 3 billion. Through the generalization program, Amzazi says he wants to reach a school enrollment of 100 percent in preschool by 2027-2028. In his address before the King, Amzazi said that he wants to reduce the rate of school drop-outs from 5.7 percent in rural areas primary schools to 1 percent by 2024-2025. He added that he wants to also shift the number of drop out which is 12 percent in secondary schools in both rural and urban areas to 3 percent for the 20244-2025 school year. Amzazi also promised reforms in terms of training and youth employment in the education field. He proposed the creation of a new generation of vocational training centers. The centers, according to Amzazi, should meet the needs of economic actors while complying with regional development plans. Amzazi also urged all stakeholders and concerned parties to contribute to the projects as part of a collective and national effort to promote education and curb the ongoing crisis in the field. Monday’s education ceremony marked the participation of Morocco’s Princess Lalla Khadija in an official ceremony. The ceremony also marked the signing of three agreements with other government institutions, including the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Office of Vocational Training and Labor Promotion (OFPPT), and the Ministry of Sports and Youth.

Rabat – Morocco and India have signed an air services agreement to develop their civil aviation sectors. Mohammed Sajid, Moroccan minister of tourism and civil aviation, and Suresh Prabhu, minister of commerce and industry and civil aviation, signed the agreement on Wednesday, September 19 in New Delhi, India. “This signing will open up new horizons of cooperation to build strategic partnership links between Moroccan and Indian air services,” Sajid told state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Sajid was on a three-day working visit to India at the head of a large delegation. According to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation, the agreement will enable “greater air connectivity between India and Morocco and will enable the airlines of each side to enter into code share with airlines of other party, as well as provide greater freedom in mounting direct flights.” “India is a very big country. However, there were low numbers of foreign tourists from India to Morocco in recent years. We have a lot of similarities with India in terms of culture and development,” said Sajid Monday. In 2017, India received only 8,000 Moroccans while 21,850 Indian tourists travelled to Morocco. The North African country aims to double the number to reach 40,000 Indian tourists in 2019. During Sajid’s visit, the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) and the Moroccan Agency for Tourism Development (SMIT) signed an MoU to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in the field of tourism.  The MoU will promote tourism between Morocco and India and promote the exchange of bilateral expertise. Moroccan Minister of Tourism Sajid also announced on Monday, September 17, the opening of a new tourism office in India’s New Delhi. “The office will help us understand what Indian tourists are looking for. The office will not only serve as a platform to promote tourism but also give professional information to various stakeholders,” Sajid said.

Rabat – German giant automobile manufacturer Volkswagen is set to construct an assembly plant in Morocco. According to Africa Intelligence, the company “is putting the finishing touches to a business plan for “the establishment of an assembly plant in the country.” The website added that representatives of the company have recently been in contact with Moroccan branches of “several international banks with a view to negotiating potential financing.” Morocco has been hoping to attract international investments, especially in the automobile industry. According to the website, Morocco has been trying to convince Volkswagen to establish itself in the North African country since 2011. “Industry minister Moulay Hafid Elalamy (“MHE”) tried everything he knew to convince the group to come in 2015,” wrote Africa Intelligence. Morocco has two international automobile companies producing cars in the country, a Renault plant in Tangier and PSA (Peugeot Citroen) plant in Kenitra, near Rabat. The industry minister aims to increase Moroccan automobile production to one million vehicles a year by 2025. The minister said in April: “We are going to exceed MAD 100 billion of export sales which is expected by 2020, but I will take a new bet and raise the bar to MAD 200 billion export with a production capacity of one million vehicles by 2025.”  In 2017, Morocco produced 345,000 passenger vehicles, overtaking South Africa, which produced 331,000, as the continent’s biggest producer, according to a report by IOL. The report stated that South Africa, traditionally the continent’s leading car-producing country, is intimidated by Morocco’s growing production capacity in the automotive sector. In 2017, Morocco’s automotive industry recorded a turnover of MAD 70 billion compared to MAD 40 billion in 2014. The minister said that the automotive sector created 83,845 new positions between 2014 and 2017. Volkswagen had already established itself in North Africa in July 2017 with a “simple kit assembly site” in Algeria, according to African Intelligence.

The 26-year-old dancer is set to release, with the help of Morocco-based group Fnaire, an Arabic version of the Indian song “Dilbar,” the soundtrack from John Abraham’s “Satyameva Jayate” movie.  “It is a huge deal for both Morocco and India because this is the first time we will be getting Indian culture and Moroccan culture together artistically and musically and this has been my goal as well, to bring them together,” said Fatehi. “As Dilbar has become a huge hit internationally, including in the Middle East, we have taken the song and re-composed it, written Arabic and Moroccan lyrics and recorded me singing with Fnaire. This is my debut as a singer, and Fnaire will be rapping with me in the song,” she added.  Morocco-based director Abderrafia El Abdioui is directing the music video.

Rabat – Algeria has decided to suspend police protection in all French representations in the North African country, including the embassy. Algerian news outlet TSA quoted an unidentified source who confirmed that the measure was applied to all French official buildings in Algeria, including the residence of the ambassador, and consulates in Oran and Annaba. Since the 1990s, foreign representations in Algeria have a permanent Algerian police presence, according to the news outlet. TSA analyzed the Algerian move, saying that it could be a response to a similar action from France. “This decision by the Algerian authorities would be a response to a French decision, about a week ago, to no longer affect police protection in front of the Algerian Embassy in Paris,” said the news outlet. The decision came amid Algeria’s purge of senior officials ahead of the next election. Algeria defended the sackings as a way to hold corrupt people responsible.  On Tuesday, the defense ministry of Algeria sacked Major General Abdelkader Lounes, commander of the Algerian Air Force. A day before the sacking of Lounes, the ministry announced the dismissal of Mohamed Zanakhri, the ministry’s secretary-general, at the request of Bouteflika. An Argentinian analyst, Adalberto Agozino, interpreted the sweep as a way to clear obstacles before the election for President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term. The analyst wrote that Algeria is conducting a vast purge within its army and police in order to “ensure the success” of the next presidential election. The move also followed Macron’s acknowledgment that his country applied a system that enabled “torture” during Algeria’s independence war against the French. Emmanuel Macron, who has become the first French president to recognize French abuses during the independence conflict, made his remarks when he visited the widow of a French pro-independence activist last week. Gulf News reported on September 14 that Macron asked for forgiveness from the widow of the activist. The independence war claimed the lives of more than 1.5 million Algerians after nearly 130 years of colonization.

Rabat- Morocco is taking part in the seventh special session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in Kenya. Morocco’s secretary of state for sustainable development, Nezha El Ouafi, is representing the country at the conference taking place from September 17- 21 at the UN Environment Programme headquarters in Gigiri, Nairobi, Kenya. A special ministerial segment was held on Wednesday, September 19. El Ouafi, who is also vice president of AMCEN, said during the session that Africa “needs to invest in innovative solutions to change its development pathway in a sustainable way.” El Ouafi stressed the need to implement “new and smart” approaches to solve the African continent’s environmental issues. Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Environment Keriako Tobiko, who spoke on behalf of the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, challenged ministers to suggest means to improve Africa’s natural resources. “I challenge you to come up with ways of enhancing the wealth from our rich biodiversity in forests, rangelands, wildlife and marine resources,” he stated.    The special session primarily discussed issues to take center stage at the fourth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-4) scheduled for March 2019. The AMCEN conference is also considered a preparation for the 14th  Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD-COP14) to take place November 17 to 29 in Egypt. More than 50 government representatives and environment ministers who attended the session have pledged to overcome environmental challenges. Environment experts, representatives of African civil society, partners, and media are also part of the AMCEN conference seeking to invest in “innovative solutions” to “overcome environmental challenges facing the continent,” according to the UN. Ministers agreed to develop common positions on various priority issues to “speak with one voice” during the 2018 UN biodiversity conference in Egypt. The African ministers also considered the preparation of a Pan-African action agenda responding to land and ecosystems’ degradation challenges. The session maintained that the outcomes of COP24 should reflect “the spirit” of the Paris climate agreement signed in 2016. “The outcomes should balance between the agreements elements related to action, support and transparency. Adaptation and finance should be core elements for effective operationalization of the agreement,” emphasized the UN report on the conference. Ministers agreed to participate in the third Inter-Ministerial Conference on Health and Environment in Libreville, Gabon, from October 9 to 12. The conference is themed “Health and environment strategic alliance: a catalyst for action on the Sustainable Development Goals in Africa.” Morocco has been building a green economy, benefiting from natural resources that are both clean and renewable. Morocco’s policy includes the ban on the production, marketing, and use of plastic bags, given their negative impact on the environment. Morocco also adheres to the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to unite the world under a single climate change agreement for the first time in history. Renewable energies, whether wind or solar, allow Morocco to reduce its energy dependence, according to statements by Morocco’s ambassador to Panama, Oumama Aouad, at a March conference on “Public Policies to Preserve the Environment.” Thanks to solar stations NOOR I and NOOR II at Ouarzazate Solar Power Station, Morocco is expected to account more than half of its energy consumption with renewable sources by 2030.

Rabat – Heetch, the famous French mobile app that provides drivers for transportation, is now available in Rabat.  After successfully launching in Casablanca in November 2017, Heetch extended its services to the capital on September 17. For its first run in Rabat, Heetch began with a fleet of 200 taxi drivers. In Casablanca, the application has become established in less than a year, with a large network of partners and a fleet of 4,000 taxi drivers. “This choice has been carefully considered, since Rabat is the capital of the country and the second largest city in the Kingdom,” said Teddy Pellerin, co-founder of Heetch, in a statement issued to MAP. Rabat and the city of Sale together make the country’s second largest metropolitan area. Heetch has ambitions to extend its services all around the North African country. “We are happy to accompany the spread of Heetch to other cities in Morocco,” said Sadik Boujaera, deputy secretary general of the National Union of Taxis (UNMT). In addition, Heetch developed the “Fiddek” label thanks to a partnership with UNMT, in which Heetch is under the supervision of UMT.  The “Fiddek” label guarantees criteria related to the cleanliness and the quality of service.  The Heetch application, which is downloadable on iPhone and Android, will allow users to be both geolocated and informed in real time of the progress of their drivers.  Heetch hopes to provide legal, safe, reliable, and user-friendly mobility. Heetch was a French start-up founded in April 2013 by Teddy Pellerin and Mathieu Jacob.

Rabat – Days after UNDP ranked Morocco 123rd in human development, King Mohammed VI chaired a ceremony launching the third phase of Morocco’s human development plan. The third phase of the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) was launched September 19.  It will focus on improving infrastructure and social services, supporting the country’s most vulnerable, increasing incomes for youth, and supporting human development for future generations, according to Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, reported state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The program’s vision, according to MAP, is “to secure sustainable social and human development.” The third phase, Laftit noted, will abide by the new policy of decentralization to ensure more efficiency.  The UN Development Program’s Human Development Index for 2018, released September 14, ranked Morocco’s human development at 123rd out of 189 countries, with a score of 0.667 out of 10. The score is a slight improvement over Morocco’s score in 2005 at the time of INDH’s launch, at 0.572. The launch also comes after a change in leadership at INDH. On August 24, the King appointed a new head, Mohamed Dardouri. The previous head, Nadira Guermai, had been leading the program for nine years. INDH was originally launched on May 18, 2005. INDH’s past activities During the ceremony, the interior minister presented a report on INDH’s activities from 2005 to 2017 to King Mohammed VI. INDH’s second phase, from 2011 to 2015, cost MAD 17 billion. It was financed by the general state budget (55 percent), local communities (33 percent), public establishments (6 percent), and international aid (6 percent), according to the body’s website. INDH allocated the largest portion of the second phase’s budget, MAD 5 billion, to “territorial upgrades” for people living in rural and mountainous areas. The program selected 3,300 benefiting villages, accounting for approximately 1 million people. INDH claims it provided health support, education support, road work, electrification, and potable water to the rural populations. INDH also says it funded urban social inclusion projects (MAD 3.4 billion), rural poverty alleviation (MAD 3.1 billion), employment supports (MAD 2.8 billion), and programs for the most vulnerable populations (MAD 1.4 billion). The launching ceremony was accompanied by the signing of a framework agreement to support schooling and decrease dropout rates among rural populations. The agreement was signed by Laftit and Minister of Education Said Amzazi. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani also attended the ceremony.

Rabat – The US Department of State has once again praised Morocco’s efforts to combat terror threats globally. In its newest Country Reports on Terrorism, the department reiterated that the North African country has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” The overview of the report featured Morocco’s efforts to dismantle small terrorist cells which have alleged ties with ISIS. This week, Morocco’s Central Bureau for Judicial Investigation (BCIJ)  arrested one individual suspected to have ties with ISIS in Syria and Iraq and other former prisoners convicted of terrorism and extremism. “During the year, authorities reported a decrease in the number of terrorist-related arrests (186) for the first time since 2013,” noted the overview of the report. Morocco modernized and upgraded its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime, especially following Marrakech’s terror attack in 2011. Morocco introduced the BCIJ in 2015 which has monitored security threats across the country and assisted foreign security agencies to combat terrorism. Morocco’s international security cooperation is well recognized. In the report, the US department said, “Following the August attacks in Barcelona, Morocco assisted the Spanish investigation and promised to expand cooperation to track terrorists of Moroccan origin radicalized abroad.” The overview also shows the cooperation between Morocco’s security agencies. The BCIJ is the main body in charge of counterterrorism cases. However, both the General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) work to conduct border inspections in airports to detect threats. “Law enforcement officials and private carriers worked regularly with the United States to detect and deter individuals attempting to transit illegally and to address watchlisted or mala fide travelers,” read the report. The report also features the role of  Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR).  According to the report, the Moroccan army “are taking tangible steps to protect critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks, control and protect logistical hubs, and ensure readiness to prevent or respond to a catastrophic chemical, biological or nuclear terrorist attack.” The overview also pointed out the number of terror cells dismantled in cooperation with international security bodies and BCIJ throughout the year. In March, BCIJ dismantled a 15-member cell operating in 10 cities. The cell was reportedly planning to undermine internal security through explosives set in sensitive places in the country. The head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khaime, said in June that Morocco’s model against terrorism aims not only to fight terrorism, but also to fight its sources and to “deconstruct radicalization” in order to limit violent ideologies. People convicted of having a terrorist background can face 10 years or more in prison, depending on the seriousness of the offense. In April, Morocco hosted the annual African Lion exercise, marking the presence of senior US armed forces members, and partners from 15 countries, representing Africa, Europe, and North America.

Rabat – American film director James Gray will chair the jury of the 2018 Marrakech international Film Festival (FIFM) November 30 to December 8.  “The Marrakech Film Festival is a unique place where the language of cinema brings together people from all over the world. It is an immense honor to be named president of the jury and to return for the third time in this great festival,” said the filmmaker in a statement issued Wednesday by the organizers. Born in New York, the 49-year-old artist grew up in Queens but studied at the Film and Television School of the University of Southern California.  Gray made his film debut in 1994 at the age of 25 with “Little Odessa,” a critically-acclaimed film that won the Critics’ Prize at the Deauville Festival and the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.  He was named the same year to the Independent Spirit Awards for the Best First Feature Award and the Best Screenplay Award. His second film, “The Yards,” was selected to show in the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, just as “We Own the Night” in 2007.  In his latest film, “Two Lovers,” nominated for the Césars, James Gray teams up for the third time with actor Joaquin Phoenix. The romantic drama, set in Brooklyn, also stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Isabella Rossellini. “Two Lovers” was selected to show in 2008 at the Cannes Film Festival. Gray has collaborated with the biggest names in Hollywood such as Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Charlize Theron. Since its inauguration in 2002, the FIFM has welcomed notable cinematic personalities, including Francis Ford Coppola, Charlotte Rampling, Martin Scorsese, and Marion Cotillard.  Last year, Marrakech’s festival was cancelled “in order to allow the festival to advance in its mission not only to promote Moroccan cinema, but also to open up to other cultures,” said the organizers in a statement.

Rabat – Amid increasing migratory pressure on Spain, Donald Trump gave Spain his opinion on how to curb undocumented movements. Trump suggested that the Spanish government should follow his policies regarding migration and build a wall across the Sahara desert. Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell shared Trump’s suggestion at a lunch event in Madrid earlier this week, according to the Guardian. When Borrell argued that the Sahara stretched for 3,000 miles, Trump responded, “The Sahara border can’t be bigger than our border with Mexico.” Trump and his wall promise has sparked a concern since his US election campaign in 2016. Trump vowed that he would build a “big beautiful wall” across the US-Mexico border, which is 2,000 miles long. In June, Trump received international backlash when the US government separated migrating children from parents, some asylum seekers after crossing the border. Some parents were sent to jail while their children were held in foster care as “unaccompanied minors.” The border issue was also a concern in the United 2026 World Cup joint bid between the US, Canada, and Mexico. Fans and international media wondered how the US would manage the issue of borders as a host of the 2026 World Cup. The Spanish government has not yet commented on  Trump’s suggestion, but, a spokesman for the foreign ministry confirmed the foreign minister’s remarks about the conversation, but said, “We won’t be making any further comment on the minister’s remarks.” In recent months, Spain has been complaining about the surge of undocumented migrants who take hazardous journeys to reach the Eldorado. A report from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) shows that 77,555 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in 2018. Out of those, 33,611 came through Spain. The report shows Spain as the leading destination for migration in 2018. Spain has outpaced, according to the report, Italy and Greec, with over 43 percent of all undocumented migrations from the Mediterranean in 2018.

Rabat – Former head of government and businessman Mohamed Karim Lamrani, died Wednesday night, at the age of 99. Lamrani was born in 1919 in Fez and became a wealthy businessman in Morocco. Lamrani served as an economic advisor to the Moroccan government. Lamrani held the position of head of government three times: from August 6, 1971 to November 2, 1972; from November 30, 1983, to September 30, 1986; and from August 11, 1992, to May 25,1994. In 1967, he was appointed general director of Morocco’s OCP Group, one of the world’s largest phosphate producers and exporters. A successful businessman and politician Although Lamrani had never stepped foot in school, he became a successful wealthy businessman and politician. “I was born to do business and in the world of business,” Lamrani said in an interview with Ramzi Sofia, a famous Iraqi journalist. Sofia conducted an interview with Lamrani when he was head of government between 1992 and 1993, but it was published in 2014 in the newspaper Al-Ousboue. Sofia had lived in Morocco since 1975 and written in many Arabic newspapers. He also wrote many books, including two about King Mohammed VI. For Lamrani, success is to know how to seize the best opportunity which will change one’s life completely. “I was a man who seized life opportunity and moved towards wealth. My wealth opened chances for me to go into politics and high positions.” Despite being a prime minister in the governments of the late King Hassan II, Lamrani said, “I never neglected my business and I even transformed French colonial companies into Moroccan ones. ‘The best politicians are businessmen’ Lamrani believed that businessmen are the most fit for politics and that they can bring economic interest to their country. When Sofia asked Lamrani how he managed to enter politics even though he was a man of money and economy, Lamrani responded: “There is no single businessman who is not fit for politics and public affairs.” “I can tell you with all credibility that the best politicians are businessmen, because these people think about the financial interests of the country above all and they know how to bring money to the state budget.” Lamrani believed that the quality of the economy is an integral part of the stability of states. According to Sofia, Lamrani’s most important asset was his friendship with some of the old French businessmen, who not only made him speak their language fluently and acquire their ways of behavior and thought, but who also gave him useful techniques to succeed in his projects.  Lamrani was an independent politician with no political party orientation.

The Day of Ashura will follow on Thursday, September 20, the 10th of Muharram. Muslims intending to fast on both the 9th and 10th of Muharram fast Wednesday, the 19th, and Thursday, the 20th of September 2018. Jews fast on Yom Kippur, the 10th of Tishri, from the evening of September 18 until sunset September 19. Thus, both Jews and Muslims this year will fast on the same day, September 19.  Since the Islamic calendar is totally lunar, and the Jewish calendar is lunar adjusted by solar requirements, the months of Muharram and Tishri only over-lap a few times each generation. “When the Prophet arrived in Madina in 622 CE, he found the Jews (yahûd) there fasted on (what we Muslims count as) the 10th of Muharram, and so he asked them the reason for their fasting on this day. They said: ‘This is a blessed day. On this day Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemy (in Egypt) and so Prophet Musa fasted on this day giving thanks to Allah.’ “The Prophet said (comparing his exodus from years of persecution in Makka to the Jewish exodus from oppression in Egypt): ‘We are closer to Musa than you are.’ Thus, he fasted on that day and commanded Muslims to fast on this day.” The explanation comes from a hadith, traditional story of the prophet, told by Bukhari. Some Christian missionary Islamophobes often claim that since Jews do not fast on Passover, the Jewish holy day that celebrates the exodus from Egypt, this hadith proves that Prophet Muhammad cannot be a true prophet. This claim is absurd. The Torah states very clearly that in celebrating this blessed day when God saved the Children of Israel from their enemy, the whole Jewish nation should for seven days refrain from eating any yeast-filled baked grain. The only permitted grains must be unleavened: “For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day (of Passover) you are to remove the yeast from your houses. Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from (the People of) Israel” (Exodus 12:15). Since the fast of Yom Kippur is a total fast like Ramadan, Jews do not usually call this seven day anti-leavened restriction a fast, but Catholic and Orthodox Churches still refer to any religious dietary restriction such as meatless Good Friday as a fast. Medina’s Jews seem to have done so also. Just as the rules of Ramadan and Yom Kippur fasting in Islam and Judaism are very similar, the theme of Yom Kippur and Ashura are very similar. The prophet said: “For fasting the day of ‘Ashura, I hope that Allah will accept it as expiation for (sins committed in) the past year” (Muslim, 1976). The Torah tells Jews in Leviticus 23:27 that on the 10th day of the month of Tishri: “You should do no work throughout that day. For it is a Day of Atonement on which expiation is made on your behalf before the Lord your God. Indeed, any person who does not practice self-denial (fasting) throughout that day shall be cut off from his people.”  In addition to the self-denial alluded to above, we are also told in Leviticus that on this day the high priest would perform sacred rites in the Holy Temple in order to achieve expiation of the people’s sins. In rabbinic literature, Yom Kippur is the culmination of the Ten Days of Repentance following Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. To the rabbis, this period marked the beginning of a spiritual trial for the souls of all the People of Israel.  The 10 days of repentance could then be seen as a time for self-examination, and Yom Kippur marked the climax when God, the true judge, would decide the fate of all of Israel as individuals and as a community, and hopefully inscribe them into the Book of Life. The rabbis follow through on the biblical theme of self-denial in their discussions of the daily pleasures from which one must abstain on Yom Kippur. Among them are (just like Muslims during Ramadan) eating, drinking, bathing, and anointing oneself, wearing leather-soled shoes (at the time the most comfortable option), and sexual relations. It has been said “Prophets are paternal brothers (sons of one father by co-wives). Their mothers [mother tongue, motherland, and religious community—Umma comes from um, mother] are different; but their religion (from the one and only God) is one.” In light of that, we should always try to harmonize scriptural statements; rather than try to make them contradictory. As the Qur’an states: “Say, ’We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their Descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the [other] prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [submitting] to Him’” (Qur’an 2:136).

Rabat- The minister of employment, Mohamed Yatim, has once again attracted controversy after he said that Moroccans can live on MAD 3,000 per month. During a “talk with the press” interview on 2M channel on Sunday, September 16, Yatim stated that “Moroccans can live on [the minimum wage].” The minimum wage, known as SMIG, is set at MAD 3,000 per month. Yatim went on to contradict his previous statement, saying: “Moroccans can live on SMIG, but they still need more than SMIG. SMIG is the minimum; if the [salary] is below the minimum, then it would be a problem.” The minister continued: “At the end, Moroccans can manage their affairs; however, it is our duty to improve their financial situations.”  Yatim’s statements received sharp criticism and angry reactions on social media. Moroccans were also reminded of the PJD minister in charge of Family and Solidarity, Bassima Hakkaoui, who said in January that Moroccans can live on MAD 20 per day. “Those who earn 20 dirhams a day are not considered poor,” she stated, basing her statement on the High Commission for Planning’s report which showed that the number of poor people in Morocco has declined from 10 to 4 million people. In Morocco, minimum wages are significantly lower than the survival baseline, or what could be described as a living wage, according to a report by Oxfam International released in January. The richest 10 percent of Moroccans have a standard of living 12 times higher than the poorest 10 percent, a gap that has not decreased since the 1990s, said the organization. It is not the first time that Yatim’s statements sparked controversy. When asked in May by a journalist about his stance as a Moroccan citizen on the ongoing boycott of three companies with reportedly high prices, Yatim replied, “I am a minister and not a citizen. You are asking me [about my stance] as a minister now. If I were a citizen on the street you would not ask me.” The minister said that the boycott “does not concern” him as a member of the government. “Some [people] believe that I am for or against the boycott. I am not for nor against this issue. I am an official and this concerns citizens,” he added. Yatim’s statements tipped social media users over the edge, as they rose to attack him on Facebook and Twitter, writing things like: “What were you before?”; “We will not forgive those who supported you in your election campaign”; and “We have discovered now that you are a minister and not a citizen on the street.” Yatim apologized to Moroccans, writing on his Facebook page that he was proud of being a Moroccan. He clarified his earlier statement, saying: “I would like to reiterate what is meant by this statement, which is more than three weeks old. This is to remind the journalist at the time that he asked me as a minister, and that he would not have asked me if I was a citizen walking in the street.”

Rabat – Algeria’s purge of military officers has made headlines recently. An Argentinian analyst interprets the sweep as a clearing of obstacles before the election. The author of the article, called “Algeria is heading for new electoral fraud,” Adalberto Agozino, provided his analysis for Alternative Press Agency on Algeria’s sacking of senior military figures at this specific time. The analyst wrote that Algeria is conducting a vast purge within its army and police in order to “ensure the success” of the next presidential election, which will take place in early 2019. In April, the Algerian ruling party, the National Liberation Front, called on Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term in the election. In response, Agozino questioned the Algerian president’s ability to fulfill presidential duties. “Algeria’s constitution establishes a maximum of two five-year presidential terms, but President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81 and wheelchair-bound since 2013, will stand for a fifth consecutive term in elections without any international oversight,” explained Agozino. Agozino also questioned whether the international community will “turn a blind eye” to Bouteflika’s candidacy, which will occur in the absence of international observers. He added that the Algerian regime is currently using the policy of “extreme intimidation” in order to subdue whoever is against Bouteflika’s candidacy. The analyst also said that authorities are exercising pressure, threatening all who are against the regime’s move with prison. As evidence, Agozino wrote that authorities confiscated the passport of Nasser Boudiaf, a son of the late former Algerian head of state Mohamed Boudiaf and a possible presidential candidate. The move, according to the author, is to prevent Nasser from reaching the “El Mouradia” palace. The author also recalled that political activists of opposition movements, including the “Muwatana” (citizenship) movement, are also facing pressure for criticizing the political regime. According to Agozino, members of Muwatana, which was created in 2017, were “harassed, persecuted in their street acts and imprisoned.” And the same pressure was faced by human rights NGOs and trade unions “whose activities suffer all kinds of legal restrictions and their leaders are frequently subjected to rigged lawsuits.” The author also discussed the paradoxical interests of Algeria and its unwavering support for the separatist Polisario Front in the Western Sahara conflict with Morocco. Agozino said that while Algeria is interested in supporting the separatists against Morocco’s sovereignty, the country “fights by legal and illegal means its Amazigh (Berber) minority that constitute between 20 and 30% of the total population of the country.” While Algeria is determined to support Polisario, it has been reluctant to engage in the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict of more than 40 years in Western Sahara.

Washington D.C. – As the UN General Assembly approaches, there have been many reports in Moroccan media concerned that Morocco’s position on Western Sahara will be threatened by the appointment of John Bolton as US national security adviser. The main cause of the fear of many observers lies in Bolton’s past positions on the issue—whether when he was an adviser to the former US personal envoy of the secretary-general, James Baker, or when he was the US ambassador to the UN between 2005 and 2006. It is no secret that Bolton was one of the few US officials who expressed more than once his support for the referendum of self-determination to find a solution to the Western Sahara conflict. He was also one of the main supporters of the Baker-I and II, in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Both plans envisaged an interim period of five years during which the territory would be under Moroccan autonomy, followed by a referendum of self-determination.   Bolton’s firm support for the holding of a referendum of self-determination caused many to believe that Bolton is a staunch supporter of Polisario.  However, Bolton’s support for the referendum did not stem from his support for the establishment of an independent state in Western Sahara, nor from his belief in the legitimacy of the separatists’ claims, but from his keenness to ensure that the UN plays its role effectively and avoids prolonging the conflicts on its agenda. The US official is notorious for not believing in multilateral institutions and for his lack of belief in the role that the UN is supposed to play in maintaining international peace and security. Bolton firmly believes that the UN peacekeeping missions in many parts of the world often fail to reach the political outcome for which they were initially created. For this reason, in one chapter devoted to the Western Sahara in his book “Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America At The United Nations And Abroad,” Bolton called for the termination of the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO), because it had failed to fulfill its mandate.  “MINURSO had failed in its central mission to conduct a referendum and was now actually an obstacle to Morocco and Algeria dealing with each other,” Bolton said as he was describing the details of a meeting he held about the issue in June 2006 with over thirty American diplomats.  Bolton was convinced that “Morocco was never going to agree to a referendum where independence was a real option.”  “Since it was clear that Morocco had no intention of ever allowing a referendum, there was no point in a UN mission to conduct one. Instead, and typically of the UN, MINURSO seemed well on the way to acquiring a near-perpetual existence because no one could figure out what to do with it,” he said.  Bolton stressed that the move could push Morocco and Algeria to work more seriously to find a solution to the dispute. A striking point in his position on the Western Sahara issue is his firm belief that Algeria is a major party to the conflict. Although many people are concerned over the direction the Western Sahara issue might take under the presence of John Bolton in the Trump administration, Morocco can use its position as a “card” to achieve one of the goals it has sought for years: to change the MINURSO mandate and limit it to the observation of the ceasefire agreement, to reduce its civilian staff, and to obtain official recognition that Algeria is a major party to the conflict. Regardless of Bolton’s personal position on the Western Sahara, he cannot impose his position on the Trump administration. Bolton Cannot go it alone  The United States is not a dictatorship where one person can take the whole people hostage to his own convictions or beliefs or make decisions on a whim without due regard for the strategic interests of the whole nation. Decision-making in the US is a very complicated process that is not based on the personal orientations of individuals but on the strategic and supreme interests of the country. In addition, the White House is not the only institution that has a say in decision-making. The State Department and the Department of Defense also play a major role in determining the orientations of America’s foreign policy and its priorities.   The best evidence to this is what happened following the outbreak of the Gulf crisis in June 2017. While the US president was quick to align himself with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, the State Department and the Department of Defense strove to keep the crisis under control and prevent any harm to the US’ strategic interests in the region.  They both also maintained their neutrality over the crisis and called on all parties to reach a political solution. The position of the two departments prompted the US president to review his position on the crisis and to take a position in line with the US’ strategic interests.  Given the characteristics of and the strong relations between Morocco and the US and the role that Morocco plays in maintaining strategic balance in North Africa and the Sahel region and in the fight against terrorism and religious extremism, it is highly unlikely that the US administration will take an anti-Moroccan stance on Western Sahara.  Even if Bolton tries to advocate for putting pressure on Morocco, he would most likely be opposed by the State Department bureaucrats. He himself admitted in his book that one of the main obstacles he faced during his tenure as US ambassador to the UN in 2005-2006 was the opposition of the State Department bureaucracy to any move that might endanger Morocco’s stability or upend the status quo.  Giving new impetus to bilateral relations The meeting of the top diplomats of both countries on Monday, September 17, could not have been more timely. During the meeting that Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita and his US counterpart, Michael Pompeo, held in Washington, D.C., they announced their determination to give new impetus to bilateral relations by holding the fourth session of the US-Morocco Strategic Dialogue next year. There is no reason to fear about the inclusion of the question of Western Sahara in the Security Council’s agenda this month, which coincides with the US presidency of the council. The motive behind the inclusion is not to put pressure on Morocco or weaken its position, but to ascertain the progress of the personal envoy of the secretary-general since the adoption of Resolution 2414 in April. The inclusion of the Western Sahara question in the council’s agenda comes one month before the Security Council’s meeting to decide on the renewal of the MINURSO mandate, which expires on October 31. This inclusion is also in keeping with the provisions of Resolution 2414, which “requests the Secretary-General to brief the Security Council on a regular basis, and at any time he deems appropriate during the mandate period, on the status and progress of these negotiations under his auspices, on the implementation of this resolution.”  In addition, it has been customary for the United Nations secretary-general to present his report, titled “The Situation in Western Sahara,” about a month ahead of the Security Council meeting to renew MINURSO’s mandate. The inclusion of the conflict in the agenda of the Security Council during the month of September follows the same procedure and carries no political message against Morocco.  If anything, the timing of the Moroccan foreign minister’s meeting with his American counterpart sends a clear message that the US position on Western Sahara is constant and will not change with the change in US officials. It also conveys that the US still believes that Morocco’s autonomy plan is a realistic solution that can help the parties reach a final solution for the Western Sahara issue.

Rabat – EBRD has launched a business program for women in Morocco to empower women entrepreneurs and strengthen the North African country’s economy. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) launched a “Women in Business Program” which “aims in its initial phase to reach at least 200 women entrepreneurs, through both financing and advisory services,” wrote EBRD in a statement Tuesday, September 18. The EU will give important support to the program to fund advisory services and provide guarantees to EBRD’s partner banks. EBRD will give Morocco’s banks BMCE and BMCI €35 million in a five year loan for the initial phase: €20 million to BMCE and €15 million to BMCI. The objective is to bolster women-led small and medium-sized enterprises “with a focus on entrepreneurs outside of Morocco’s main commercial centers,” reads the statement. EBRD’s managing director for the southern and eastern Mediterranean region, Janet Heckman, signed the loan agreement with BMCI and BMCE banks at a launch event in Casablanca. Morocco’s Minister of Solidarity, Women, Family, and Social Development, Bassima El Hakkaoui, and the deputy head of the EU delegation to Morocco, Alessio Cappellani, also attended the event. According to EBRD’s statement, only 50 percent of formal women-led firms in Morocco have a bank account. Since its launch in 2014, the Women in Business Program has supported 35,000 women entrepreneurs across the EBRD regions with over €450 million in cooperation with more than 30 financial institutions. Since 2012, EBRD has invested over €1.5 billion in 41 projects in Morocco. The bank also provided more than 380 local companies with technical assistance. On September 6, EBRD granted a €16 million loan to Varroc Lighting Systems Morocco, the Moroccan subsidiary of India’s Varroc company. EBRD’s loan is expected to create 100 jobs between 2018 and 2024.

Rabat – Following his meeting with Mike Pompeo, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita met three US senators in Washington, D.C. Senator Ted Cruz posted pictures of himself and the Moroccan official on Twitter on Tuesday, September 18. “Glad to meet with Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita at my DC office today.” The Moroccan official visited the US to discuss means to “end Iran’s support for terrorism and counter its malign influence in the region.” Commenting on his meeting with senators, Bourita told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the aim of the talks with the US senators is “maintaining contacts with influential members of the Senate, including on financial and military cooperation, but also on the national question.” He added that the senators described the partnership with Morocco as “valuable for the United States, or even unique in the region.” Cruz had long supported Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. The senator shares Morocco’s concern as he sees Iran as a threat to US stability. Glad to meet with Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita at my DC office today. @MarocDiplomatie @USEmbMorocco pic.twitter.com/GlvHoPr09K — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) September 18, 2018  As both countries perceive Iran as an enemy to the stability of the region, Bourita sought cooperation with the US through senior officials to take measures against the alleged threat posed by Iran. In an exclusive interview with US news outlet Breitbart News, Bourita shared concerns that Iran is attempting to increase its presence in North and West Africa. During the interview, Bourita also explained how Iran interfered in Morocco’s internal affairs. “They tried to develop a presence in Morocco. Today they are repeating the efforts in other North African countries. They attracted some of our youth by giving them scholarships,” he said. Bourita’s concerns about Iran more broadly were echoed also by Cruz, who tweeted on October 23, 2017, that “Iran’s Hezbollah has been a force of terrorism across the Middle East &amp; Israel for over three decades.” Cruz, along with David Perdue and other US senators, expressed determination that their country should take urgent steps to sanction Iranian-controlled militias in the Middle East. The senators presented a terrorist sanctions act against Iranian proxies when declassified reports showed that Iran equipped and funded terrorist activities by its proxies, including Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba. The same accusation was expressed by Morocco on May 1 when the North African country cut diplomatic ties with Iran. Morocco accused Iran of interfering in its internal affairs, specifically in the Western Sahara conflict through Hezbollah. Morocco said that it has provided documents that showed Polisario-Hezbollah collusion, accusing the Iranian ally of training Polisario members. Morocco also said that Hezbollah provided the separatist group with military equipment. On Tuesday, Bourita also met Senator Lindsey Graham, who has also warned the US about the Iranian threat several times. In July, Fox News quoted Graham, saying that the US will “bring the Iranian regime down.” Bourita also met Senator Todd Young, a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT) has opened an office in New Delhi, India.  The Minister of Tourism, Air Transport, Crafts, and Social Economy Mohamed Sajid said the office will promote Morocco’s tourism opportunities.  The initiative aims to bring the Moroccan tourism product closer to the Indian market, which offers great opportunities in human capital and economic development, said the minister, on a three-day visit to India at the head of a large delegation. Morocco is preparing to put in place several measures to accommodate more Indian tourists in 2019. “China remains a better example. After the opening of an Office of the Moroccan National Tourist Office in 2015, the influx of Chinese tourists to Morocco has increased significantly to reach 120,000 visitors in 2017, with the goal of welcoming 200,000 tourists in 2018,” said an Indian government official. The director general of the Moroccan National Tourist Office, Adil El Fakir, believes that the inauguration of the ONMT office in New Delhi is an opportunity to conquer the Indian market, which has a population of 1.3 billion inhabitants. “Only 15,000 Indian tourists visited Morocco in 2017. This figure remains very low compared to the population of India and the level of bilateral relations. Our goal is to increase the number of Indian tourists in the coming years,” he said. A memorandum of understanding was signed earlier in the day between the Moroccan Society of Tourism Engineering (SMIT) and the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) to promote tourism investment and promote the exchange of expertise between the two countries.

Rabat – Algeria’s military earthquake continues. Seven months before the next presidential election, Algeria sacked another top military official on Tuesday. A statement from the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Tuesday the dismissal of Major General Abdelkader Lounes, commander of the Algerian Air Force. The ministry added that the chief of staff of the Algerian People’s National Army and Vice Minister of Defense Ahmed Said Salah will visit Algeria’s Air Command today. He  will take advantage of the working visit to appoint Hamid Boumaiza as the head of the air force. Since July, Algeria has dismissed several top military officials and prohibited them from leaving the country. The cause of Algeria’s move to dismiss more than five senior military officials is not clear yet. However, local media reported that the officials might be involved in a case of trafficking 701 kilograms of cocaine in May. News outlets also said that investigations are ongoing to determine whether the top officials are involved in drug trafficking and corruption. Yesterday, Algerian outlet Observ Algerie reported that authorities also confiscated the passport of former Algerian prime minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune. He has been ordered not to leave the country. The former official was allegedly dismissed for his public criticism of the Algerian presidency. Algerian businessmen had accused Tebboune of obstructing their activities.

New York – The Iranian rial is in free fall after the announcement that the US, having withdrawn from the JCPOA, will reimpose sanctions lifted after the conclusion of the nuclear deal. In addition, the withdrawal of foreign businesses, threatened by secondary sanctions, dealt a blow to the Iranian economy as well. Recently, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation warned the country’s banks against doing business with Iran. Morocco severed diplomatic relations with Iran on May 2, a week before the United States announced withdrawal from the JCPOA in response to Iran’s weaponization of the separatist group Polisario, which was being armed and trained by Hezbullah via the Iranian embassy in Algiers. Speaking in Bucharest, Romania, he expressed support for the Trump administration and its focus on Iran, and showed interest in additional cooperation with respect to tackling Iran and its various nefarious operations in West and North Africa. Despite these tough measures, however, the Islamic Republic seems to have developed other options for going around sanctions and saving its crumbling economy. An Iranian trade official told Iran’s PressTV that one potential option for continuing trade with Africa would include bartering oil products for gold. While China’s looking to exploit corruption in Africa in order to take control of ports and key infrastructure in a potential threat to sovereignty of multiple nations, for Iran, Africa’s growing entrepreneurial scene may provide future business opportunities. This, too, may be a solution for European and other foreign businesses who have had to withdraw from direct investments and other business ventures in Iran proper due to the threat of being frozen out of the US financial system. Renault, for instance, announced a possible shift of production to Africa, giving a glimpse at the next frontier in developing industries looking for cheaper options. Some vehicles will soon be available in South Africa.  Renault’s venture, however, may also signal continuation of potential clandestine cooperation with Iran, which has in greatly increased its public activity throughout Africa in the past two years. Doing business through local third parties may end up preserving some of the business initiatives developed at the conclusion of the nuclear deal. Shady deals with known European companies may only be one of the options for the regime’s self-preservation, however. Polisario’s past involvement in gold smuggling Despite the recent break up with Morocco, Iran may continue to utilize Morocco’s adversaries, such as Polisario, and other non-state actors, in its quest to evade sanctions. Polisario, known for its weapons and drug smuggling, may yet play a role in smuggling gold out of Africa, in exchange for getting a cut of the oil products (that could be refined elsewhere in Africa). Indeed, as late as March 2018, Polisario cells have been implicated in gold trafficking.  These cells were part of an international ring of gold prospectors based in a town in Northern Mauritania. They have accumulated a great deal of cash as a result of these illegal operations. This was not the first such incident. A year earlier, the Algerian army detained a group of Mauritanian prospectors based on allegations of gold smuggling; however, the Mauritanian authorities contradicted that version of events.  Polisario front members have been implicated in selling weapons throughout Mauritania, and linked to Al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb, and only months later, to Hezbullah. It is not hard to imagine that both terrorist organization could have been beneficiaries of the gold trafficking operations, and that some other cells may continue to operate in this capacity to date. Hezbullah’s role in facilitating gold trafficking Interestingly, Hezbullah’s role in gold trafficking goes far beyond these two incidents.  Lebanon is an important point of distribution for both legal and illegal gold trade from Egypt and West Africa onwards to Switzerland and South Africa for refinement, reaching nearly $1 billion worth of non-monetary gold in 2016. Gold has traditionally been a safe haven for times of uncertainty, but it also made the precious metal a highly desirable commodity for criminal networks. The chaotic situation and corruption in West African countries such as Togo, facilitated the likelihood of abuse for the various groups operating in that area. Gold trade routes from that vicinity have been subject to an ongoing four-year investigation by a watchdog. Togo is a non-exporting country which smuggled gold from Burkino Faso, where it was extracted by children and adults operating essentially as slave labor. Hezbullah is better known for its cocaine smuggling operations; in the past, it has been involved in the illicit diamond trade in Africa.  However, given the prominent role the organization plays in Lebanese domestic politics today, its direct role in facilitating these operations, perhaps through control of involved companies by affiliated families, is well worth a second look. After all, it has already been found that Lebanon has been protecting Hezbullah’s role in the cocaine trade in Latin America. Given the tough financial times, it is reasonable to believe that the government could also be complicit in covering up the organization’s involvement in African gold smuggling. Indeed, gold trafficking schemes are likewise popping up all over Latin America, often in connection with illegal gold mining and human trafficking operations, which are frequently linked to  narco-terrorist syndicates. Whether there is a Hezbullah connection is worth exploring. Despite the recent interest in the issue thanks to Iran’s comments on the record, there is nothing new about gold smuggling. In fact, despite getting less press coverage than drug and arms trafficking, gold has always been a very attractive vehicle for criminal enterprises because it facilitates the conversion of illicit goods into a “stable, anonymous, transformable, and easily exchangeable asset”. Likewise, the market is highly lucrative. It is also fraught with vulnerabilities that make it an easy target for smugglers. Why Gold is a Terrorist’s Best Friend in Money Laundering For instance, there is little oversight in the industry and unlike many other markets, no licensing requirements. Quite simply, gold is hard to track. Gold is particularly attractive to money launderers in cash-for-gold schemes because the high-volume, low-value transactions are easy to falsify and to commingle with other proceeds. In the past, for instance, third party gold smuggling syndicates used this method to launder proceeds of illegal drug sales. Because gold can be traded anonymously, transactions are hard to track and verify. How much gold is floating out there is anyone’s guess. The law enforcement, short of embedding itself in the criminal network, has limited ways to verify the identity of suppliers or buyers. Because gold is a global currency and is exchangeable worldwide, the same volume of gold can go through a variety of diverse criminal syndicates, further challenging the possibility of tracing the original source.  For instance, drug syndicates can pay their workers in gold. The gold is then bartered for other items, and the law enforcement may never know that there was anyone who ever got paid by that means. Likewise, investment in gold provides reliable returns for the criminals at a later date.  It gives the syndicate a greater ability to manage risks associated with volatility, due to the inherent stability of the asset. Gold is easy to smuggle and trade, both physically and virtually. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are subject to market fluctuate on the market, are subject to stringent oversight by governments, and scrutiny and outright bans by banks, gold is not considered inherently suspect. It can also be reshaped into everyday objects to avoid detection, and like drugs, can be transported through carriers, mules, which allows the syndicate to remain anonymous. The opportunities for generating profit through gold smuggling are multifold. They include large and medium scale mining, artisanal small-scale mining, and everything in between. One example of terrorists and drug dealers utilizing gold to finance their operations, included a narco-terrorist ring in Colombia,  which took control of a territory with a productive gold mine, extorting the owners with violence and forcing the community to transfer ownership titles to them. The same pattern can likely be traced elsewhere. Other means of turning gold into a profit may include recycling, smelting/refining, (smuggling to refineries is particularly lucrative), and assorted frauds associated with the misrepresentation of its value, whether towards unjust enrichment at the expense of the buyer or to earn tax credit. Retailing and investments are other means by which more enterprising syndicates can make a return on their gold trafficking or otherwise exploitation of the gold mines. There are numerous red flags to detect indicia of illicit activity, such as cash payments for high volume, origin in high risk areas,  transportation through high risk areas for no apparent reason,  and the use of front/shell companies. There are also red flags associated with potentially illicit mining activity, for instance, when licensed mines have rapid and inexplicable production decreases, mines are developed in prohibited areas, there is no compliance with local regulations, or when ethnic or other communities hire a third party for the entire operation of the mine. Iran’s Gas for Gold Scheme with Turkey Due to rampant corruption, West African countries may be easy targets for such forms of exploitation and trafficking. Some of the top beneficiaries of these gold smuggling operations have been India and Turkey. However, more recently, Turkey has turned to Iran to facilitate the gold smuggling operations, in turn, helping the Islamic Republic circumvent sanctions. The details of that complicated arrangement came out through the criminal trial of the Iranian-Turkish banker Reza Zorrab in the United States. Zarrab contributed to the process of circumventing sanctions, and was eventually found guilty in the New York courts.  He acted in concert with the formal deputy general manager of a state-controlled Turkish bank, and assisted in helping the sanctioned regime to the tune of approximately $1 billion. The scheme was an illustration of a conversion scheme. Iran sought to support its failing economy by converting its oil and gas products into cash. Zarrab, who claims to have had a plot to kill him on his hands, and who was also accused of rape, managed to take a nice cut from this lucrative venture. Ultimately, the gold trader implicated the Turkish president Erdogan in a money laundering operation which turned oil products into cash then onwards through his gold trading operations mainstream, giving Iran access to international markets. The scheme involved both gold trades and fake purchases of food, checking off many of the indicia of gold smuggling schemes described above. The trial, however, was merely a culmination of years of a lucrative operation. Before Iran and Turkey became allies by necessity, the two states were considered rivals for influence. In 2012, a Turkish official revealed that Iran was smuggling gold to evade economic sanctions.  It did so for at least six months with Turkey (and possibly other countries) by importing Turkish gold to pay for billions of dollars of energy sales in Turkey. Turkey, as one of the two biggest recipients of trafficked gold, in turn likely got at least some of its assets from the very West African countries where Iran and Hezbullah have been operational for years, possibly with the help of Polisario smugglers and Mauritanian intermediaries. After that revelation, US put pressure on the Turkish government to stop participating in the scheme; however, evidence shows that in 2013 the gold smuggling operations were ongoing.  The massive “gas-for-gold” sanctions-busting scheme continued well into 2014, and brought additional bad press to the ruling AKP party in Turkey; however, as the Zarrab case three years later showed, with all the bad press and pressure, Turkey and Iran continued the ongoing money laundering that benefited both of the corrupt regimes. Given that neither Erdogan nor the Islamic Republic ever bore any serious responsibility for this brazen criminality, it would not be shocking that the two countries have used the new direct land route from Iran to Turkey which opened in late 2017 to ease importation of gold and gas and oil to each other under the guise of humanitarian aid or ordinary trade. Iran’s Quest for Gold in West Africa Furthermore, there is evidence that Iran procured gold directly from its source. For instance, in 2014, a US-flagged plane in Ghana was found to have links to Iran. Ghana remains one of Iran’s top sources for gold. Ghana has gained notoriety for corruption and associated gold smuggling, and drug and arms trafficking activities.  Iran had put in focus on Africa, through its “Africa initiative“, which used humanitarian aid and Shi’a outreach as an influence campaign in poor and corrupt, mostly West African (and later North African) countries.  It had spent a great deal of money exporting its ideology through mosques and schools. In return, Tehran received political support from these governments, and access to gold in some of the producing countries. This outreach has strengthened after the 2016 attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which led to the rift between the two countries and their supporters in Africa. However, Iran’s interest in Africa has been ongoing for decades, though it waxed and waned over time. Under Rouhani’s predecessor, for instance, the interest took a more active and aggressive form. “Iran has made no secret of its desire to strengthen relations in Africa. Last April, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited three West African countries—Niger, a leading producer of uranium, Benin and Ghana. The trip to Niger raised speculation that Ahmadinejad was looking for sources of uranium for Iran’s disputed nuclear program, a major reason for the imposition of Western sanctions on the country. Iran’s gold rush is also an illustration of its ongoing adventurist rivalry with KSA in the Sahel.  That rivalry includes competition for access to natural resources, such as gold. For Iran, however, the quest for these resources is more than just about local dominance or internal enrichment. Building naval bases and training militias and proxy armies all over the world is not free. Exportation of phosphates from North Africa, gold, and other natural resources is necessary to fund all these activities. In February, Iran invited Ghana’s president to visit Tehran for what local news reports called discussions of “issues of mutual interests.” In 2014, the mysterious airplane in Iran was found to have ties to Ghana. Iran’s interest in Ghana was multifold.  Besides gold, the country also had a great deal of uranium. Uranium is frequently found in gold mines.  Furthermore, some of the uranium is actually a byproduct of gold mining.  The example of two Iranian advisers who recently went to Libya in a quest to procure additional uranium via Tunisia and met their end at the hands of unidentified assassins comes to mind.  At the time, while engaged in the nuclear negotiations, Iran was hoarding uranium for enrichment towards the development of its nuclear program. Was its interest in African gold merely yet another money laundering operation to sustain its economy and to enrich corrupt government official? Or was it always a public veneer for illicit purchases of uranium?  Likely, it was always some combination of both.  Indeed, Iran’s interest in gold was not limited to Ghana or to operations with Turkey.  In 2016, for instance, Iran received 13 tons of gold from another ally—South Africa—which likewise was helpful in evading sanctions. South Africa is one of the two places best known for gold refineries. In 2015, it was the world’s fifth largest producer of gold, particularly profitable because the government did not charge the value added tax (VAT) on it. Gold digging May Mask Search for Uranium for Iran’s Nuclear Program In fact, if not for South Africa’s gold reserves, Iran’s nuclear program would likely be nonexistent. South Africa and China are both emerging as two gold hubs, and coincidentally, two of Iran’s closest trading partners. So long as the collaboration continues, Iran will likely have free access to additional sources of gold. At the same time, South Africa is one of the biggest gold smuggling capitals in the world, with India and Turkey being two of the top consumers. Turkey, is in fact, the world’s fifth biggest gold consumer. Isolated incidents to this day show that Iran’s quest for illicit gold is ongoing. Most recently, one man in Iran was arrested for hoarding gold coins. How did he get them? Worth noting, however, is that Iran has internal ongoing gold mine exploration, largely with the help of the Australian mining companies.  If any gold is found, it is as likely to be trafficked out of the country for refinement abroad. Additional evidence of ongoing gold mining in Iran comes via a human rights abuse story, where a number of union workers who worked in those mines were sentenced to lashes for requesting to be paid. Whatever the profits of those mines, the workers hardly see a penny – where is it all going? Disgruntled and tortured miners likely would have some interesting stories to tell. However, if there is no gold to be found in Iran, the mines could be nothing more than a cover for gold trafficking to explain ongoing Iranian procurement of illicit gold and perhaps uranium. These connections and schemes point to a systematic operational commitment on Iran’s part to utilize gold as a means of evading sanctions, finance its other illicit operations at home and abroad, and potentially mask its continuous quest for uranium. For that reason, the Iranian official’s recent remarks pointing to Iran’s greater reliance on oil and gas for gold schemes, should be of particular interest to intelligence agencies, the law enforcement of African and other countries, and to governments interested in curbing Iran’s aggression. Iran’s schemes to evade sanctions never fully ceased. Now Iran will be shifting to other models such as gold trafficking, which generally attract less attention and are harder to prevent and to stop. This might be one of the many operations Morocco’s Foreign Minister referred when he appealed to the United States in combating Iran’s threat in North Africa. Increased use of smuggling means increased reliance on Hezbullah, Morocco’s nemesis Polisario, and other dangerous groups, which threaten stability and security of both US allies and US interests in the region. Integrating US and Moroccan defense policies to prevent Iran’s destabilizing activity and proliferation of international proxies should become one of the priorities in responding to the Islamic Republic’s expansionism.

Rabat – Will Younes Belhanda’s unpopularity in Turkey make him leave for the Emirates?  During the past few weeks, the Atlas Lion has been struggling to find his place in his club, Galatasaray.  According to Turkish media Habertuk, the 28-year-old midfielder will soon join the Emirati club of Al Ahli Dubai which has courted him for weeks. The transfer window will end October 2. The Emirati club is ready to offer €6 million to Younes Belhanda.  Having been set aside by his club, the Moroccan football player may seriously consider the offer.  Last week, the Turkish Football Federation punished Belhanda by suspending him for three games, after he was given a red card for violently kicking an opponent.  Following Galatasaray’s 4-0 loss in the same game, Belhanda faced angry fans in the airport who blamed him for the loss. One of the disappointed fans shouted at Belhanda: “Go home.” Irritated by the comment, Herve Renard’s player harshly insulted the fan in Darija (Moroccan Arabic). Belhanda’s insults were recorded, posted online, and the video soon went viral. During this summer, Belhanda was linked with several prestigious European clubs such as Crystal Palace, OGC Nice, and Borussia Dortmund. However, the football player has expressed several times his wish to stay with his club, saying that he is happy with life in Turkey.  The Moroccan star had impressed at Galatasaray last season, helping the team claim league triumph by providing ten assists and scoring three goals. Belhanda, who joined Galatasaray from Ukraine’s Dynamo Kyiv in 2017, is formally under contract with his current Turkish side until 2021.

Rabat – Iran has denied Morocco’s accusations that it has been attempting to expand its influence in North and West Africa. In a recent interview with Breitbart News, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita denounced Iran’s alleged attempts to expand its presence in Africa. In response, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi criticized the American media outlet, describing it as “one of the most extremist and racist neoconservative” outlets. He added that Bourita’s “claims … are more consistent with the current anti-African rule of the White House than a realistic view to issues in Africa.” Quoted by Press TV, the spokesperson said that his country has mutual respect for African countries. The official said that Morocco “makes hasty claims” rather than taking care of the “long-term interests of Morocco and its people in foreign relations.” Qassemi also echoed the claims Iranian proxy Hezbollah made that Morocco’s decision was made under the pressure of third parties. Morocco severed diplomatic ties with Iran on May 1, accusing the country of supporting the separatist movement of the Polisario Front through its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah. Both Iran and Hezbollah denied the accusation, claiming that Morocco is under pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia. In his recent statement, Iran’s spokesperson said that Morocco severed ties with Iran “two times in one decade,” referring to the first time when Morocco cut ties with Iran in 2009. According to Qassemi, the move shows that Morocco has “no stability in its foreign relations.” Moroccan authorities have said they believe that Iran has long-term plans to destabilize North and West Africa. “They tried to develop a presence in Morocco. Today they are repeating the efforts in other North African countries. They attracted some of our youth by giving them scholarships,” Bourita told the US media last Wednesday.

Rabat – After a French court returned Saad Lamjarred to jail, Moroccans have launched a social media campaign asking radio stations to stop broadcasting his songs.  The hashtag #Masaktach (I will not be hushed) has widely circulated on social media where people are denouncing radio stations for continuing to airing Lamjarred’s songs while he is facing rape charges. “Moroccan radio stations can make a meaningful gesture in condemnation of rape culture by removing accused serial rapist Saad Lamjarred from their airwaves. Which side are you on … #Masaktach,” wrote former Reuters journalist, Samia Errazzouki, on Twitter. She went on to tag Moroccan radio stations Hit Radio and Radio 2M. Moroccan radio stations can make a meaningful gesture in condemnation of rape culture by removing accused serial rapist @saadlamjarred1 from their airwaves. Which side are you on @HITRADIOMA @YBoumehdi @Radio2M #Masaktach #???????? https://t.co/tWwgqTqLVZ — Samia Errazzouki (@S_Errazzouki) September 18, 2018  “A big thank you for the #, the boycotts, and the messages of support and finally the justice!!! #Masaktach,” wrote Laura Prioul, the first French woman to accuse Lamjarred of rape, in 2016.  Un très grand Merci pour les #, les boycotts, les messages de soutien et enfin la justice !!!! ?? #Masaktach — Laura Prioul (@lora_s_life) September 18, 2018  The Moroccan radio HitRadio has decided to boycott Lamjarred’s songs. “As soon as his incarceration was pronounced today, we decided to stop broadcasting his songs on Hit Radio,” Younes Boumehdi, CEO of Hit Radio, told Medias24. Radio 2M has also distanced itself from Lamjarred. Moroccan journalist Samira Sitail has confirmed on Twitter that the Moroccan radio does not promote the singer’s songs because of his trouble with the French judicial system.  The singer of “Ghazali” has recently faced another boycott. The Moroccan singer’s named was ruled off the list of nominees in the All Africa Awards (AFRIMA) competition, which will take place in Ghana in November.  The organizers of the ceremony have recently decided to remove the artist’s name because of his rape charges. Lamjarred had been nominated in three categories: Best singer in Africa, best song in Africa for “Casablanca,” and best artist in North Africa. The Moroccan singer went back to jail Tuesday, September 18, following a decision by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal in southern France after the prosecutor’s office in Draguignan appealed his release under judicial supervision. The 33-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday, August 26, in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from a young French seasonal worker.

Rabat – The Moroccan minister of foreign affairs, Nasser Bourita, has once again addressed the reason behind Iran’s alleged support for the Polisario Front. Since Morocco announced its decision to cut diplomatic ties with Iran on May 1, the official has given interviews and analyses to local and foreign news outlets on why Iran supported the separatist group. It was not the first time Morocco severed ties with Iran.  In 2009, the North African country made the same move. In his recent exclusive interview with US news outlet Breitbart News, the official gave the outlet a document that showed “the vast contacts that have ensued between Hezbollah and Polisario Front commanders in Beirut and in Algeria since” November 2016, reads the interview. Bourita told Fox News in a previous interview that Hezbollah transferred military equipment to Polisario’s militia in the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria. The equipment included sophisticated missiles: the SAM-9 and SAM-11 surface-to-air missiles. In the interview with Breitbart, Bourita gave his analysis about Iran’s motives behind its proxy’s alleged support of the separatist group. Subsequently, Bourita explained why Morocco decided to cut ties with Iran in 2009. Bourita said Iran has long wanted to expand its presence in North Africa. Iran wants to ensure presence in Africa “They tried to develop a presence in Morocco. Today they are repeating the efforts in other North African countries. They attracted some of our youth by giving them scholarships,” he said. After Morocco accused Iran of collaborating with Polisario through Hezbollah, Algerian activists expressed animosity online towards an Iranian official, Amir Al-Moussawi, serving as the country’s cultural attaché to Algeria. Less than six days after Morocco cut ties with Iran, Algerian activists urged the Algerian government to expel Al-Moussawi. A former Algerian military officer, Nawar Abdel Malik, also speculated that Al Moussawi could be the cause of the new tension between Tehran and Rabat. “Since 2015, we have been warning Algeria of the Iranian embassy, but the Algerian authorities have ignored this, despite serious information we have presented in our campaigns against Amir al-Moussawi, because of his suspicious activities in a diplomatic crisis with Morocco,” said the former officer. Bourita said that Rabat also had an Iranian cultural attaché before they cut ties in 2009, “who has visited the small cities of Morocco making what he was calling book festivals. He was giving books. He was present in every small city.” The activities of the cultural attaché made the authorities question why the official would “promote” Iranian books. “And we noticed he was giving scholarships. We went from 10 people to 120 people [a year] who were given scholarships to study in Qom. From 2009-2016 we had no relations with Iran because of what they were doing with the scholarships.” The Moroccan government interpreted the activity of the Iranian cultural attaché as a way to “undermine government authority” by convincing Moroccan youth to favor Shia Islam as practiced in Iran. Bourita has also accused Iran of targeting youth in Europe. “They are targeting our diaspora in Europe, in Belgium in particular. There, because of the hesitation of Europe to manage Islam, they were left to themselves,” said the official. Tension between Morocco and Iran escalated in 2017 when the North African country arrested Lebanese Hezbollah financier Kassim Tajideen in Casablanca. In one of his recent interviews, Bourita said that the Moroccan arrest of the top Hezbollah financier changed the Moroccan-Iranian relationship. For Bourita, Iran represents a threat to the US and Israel as well as an “economic threat in Africa. This Mr. Tajideen who was captured in Morocco was laundering money in Africa. All the benefits to Iran from Hezbollah are being reinvested in Africa,” he said. He said that Tajideen was important to Iran, because he was “linking” Iran and its proxy with sub-Saharan countries, especially “West Africa.” The official said that when Morocco proved the alleged Polisario-Hezbollah collusion, Hezbollah members were ordered not to talk “with Lebanese accents but to be more discreet when they are coming” to Tindouf. Hezbollah threatens Moroccan embassy in Beirut In contrast to what Jeune Afrique reported earlier this month, Bourita said that the Moroccan embassy in Lebanon received threats from Hezbollah. “We had to relocate our embassy and bring our people back from Lebanon and move our embassy because it had been in [Hezbollah controlled] southern Beirut,” he said. Jeune Afrique quoted a source from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 11, who denied Morocco was forced to relocate its embassy from the Hezbollah-controlled area. The source said, “This move was planned for three years. In 2016, a commission had gone on site and budgets had been released to allow this change.” Bourita, however, said that Morocco was forced to relocate its embassy to a Sunni area of Beirut, and has asked “friends to protect our embassy.” Commenting on the Hezbollah-Polisario collaboration, Bourita said, “We think that what is happening with the Polisario is only part of an aggressive approach by Iran towards North and West Africa. We noticed before some activities in Senegal, in Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, even in Guinea Bissou [sic].” Bourita explained that this strategy aims to expand Iranian power in North Africa and West Africa. “Iran thinks that it has control and is proud to say that it controls four or five capitals in the Arab world.” He added that the country found Polisario an “attractive organization” to complete its mission. “Polisario has an advantage for Iran because they know the area. They are traffickers. The humanitarian aid [to Western Sahara] has been decreasing so they are smuggling many things, cigarettes, camels etc.” Bourita said that this is why the Polisario-Hezbollah collusion represents a threat for Africa. Looking forward to US-Morocco collaboration against Iran Bourita told Breitbart News about his visit to the US to secure support from the US for Morocco’s “efforts against Iran and Hezbollah,” he said. Bourita flew to the US recently and met US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on September 17. The two officials “discussed opportunities to expand our strong economic and security cooperation, including shared efforts to end Iran’s support for terrorism,” according to a statement from the US Department of State. In his interview with Breitbart, Bourita said that Morocco’s stability is tied to the Sahara.  “It is important for us to find a solution.” According to Bourita, the current and former US administrations find the Moroccan Autonomy Plan introduced in 2007 as a “credible, serious and realistic solution” to the Western Sahara issue. “What we need today is how to go from here. First, not to just have a diplomatic statement but to go from statements to acts. If you consider this plan as serious, credible and realistic what can you do to help concretely to advance it?” Bourita told the news outlet. The official also said that Morocco aims for more cooperation with the Trump administration in the business field.

Rabat – Moroccan football star Nordin Amrabat does not like to stay on the bench. On Friday, the footballer expressed dissatisfaction for being benched in Friday’s game with his Saudi football team, Al Nassr. “I came to participate in the clubs’ tournament, not to serve as a substitute. This is the second time the coach has made this choice and I have to see what he will decide for the next matches,” said the footballer. Amrabat joined Al Nassr of Saudi Arabia in July with a 3-year contract for a € 3million salary per year. Despite his anger over being a substitute in two games, Amrabat said that he is happy he joined the Saudi team. “I am happy to be here and happy with the love that fans have for me.” The footballer shared in a July 16 tweet that he was excited about his new club with social media fans after joining Al-Nassr Riyadh. “Happy and excited with my adventure. Looking forward to meet these amazing @AlNassrFC fans,” wrote the football player. Several other Moroccan football players chose to join Saudi clubs over the summer transfer season, including Karim El Ahmadi, who signed a two-year contract with Al Ittihad Jeddah in July.

Rabat – The verdict has been handed down for Saad Lamjarred.  The Moroccan singer is going back to jail today, September 18, following a decision by the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal in southern France after the prosecutor’s office in Draguignan appealed his release under judicial supervision.  The 33-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday, August 26, in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from a young French seasonal worker.  The pop star was then released under judicial supervision, but prohibited from leaving France or contacting the complainant. In addition, the singer was required to pay bail of €150,000. The singer is already facing a trial on charges of rape for a 2016 incident in France. Bachir Abdou’s son was previously arrested in France on October 26, 2016, for the sexual assault of Laura Prioul. The trial has not yet commenced. French authorities temporarily released the artist on bail under electronic surveillance on April 13, 2017, after he spent nearly six months in detention at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris.

Rabat – After dismissing senior military officials, Algerian authorities have confiscated the passport of the former Algerian prime minister, Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Quoting an unidentified source, Algeria’s Observ Algerie reported yesterday that the Court of Justice of Algiers ruled that the former official is not allowed to leave Algeria. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika sacked Tebboune in 2017 three months after he was appointed. The former official was allegedly dismissed for his public criticism of the Algerian presidency. Algerian businessmen had accused Tebboune of obstructing their activities. After he was dismissed, a source on condition of anonymity told AFP that Tebboune was fired as his “vision” did not comply with Bouteflika’s strategy. The source added that there were communication issues between the two officials.  Tebboune was replaced by Ahmed Ouyahia who had served as head of government three times between 1995 and 2012. Recently, Bouteflika ordered the dismissal of five top military officers, including Enad Nouba, Said Bey, Abderrezak Cherif, Boudjema Boudouaour, and Habib Chentouf. The officers are facing charges of the traffic of influence and abuse of power, Observe Algerie reported on Sunday. According to the news platform, investigations are ongoing and are connected to other investigations opened into several top officials suspected of corruption following the seizure of 701 kilograms of cocaine in May.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI has decorated Hicham Elfaquih, a teacher known as “super prof” at a presentation ceremony on education. During the ceremony on Monday at the Royal Palace of Rabat, the King honored Elfaquih with a royal decoration,“wissam of merit,” along with 18 other professors and officials from the Ministry of Education. Elfaquih wrote on his Facebook page on Monday: “Thank you, your majesty. Today, his majesty King Mohammed VI  bestowed me with a royal decoration of merit. I gift this wissam to my parents, siblings, and Elfaquih family.” 
Elfaquih is a teacher at Binti primary school in the capital of northern Rif region, Al Hoceima. Elfaquih’s positivity and kindness to children have won over many Moroccans who deem him an “exemplary” teacher who loves his job.  The school’s lack of resources did not discourage Elfaquih from doing the job he loves. The young man took the initiative to create a fun and comfortable environment for his students who had never left their villages before. Videos and photos of the young teacher circulated on social media in June, capturing the bonding moments between him and his students and showing how he transformed their lives with small but impactful gestures. Elfaquih painted the classroom with vivid colours to make school more exciting, organized excursions around the region, taught the students how to brush their teeth, bought them clothes, and hosted occasional classroom parties and educational activities that were unfamiliar to the students before. Elfaquih’s decoration took place only a week after the minister of education, Said Amzazi, received him on Monday, September 10, to congratulate him for his dedication to his job, granting him an honorary certificate.  The meeting was also an opportunity to discuss the conditions of schools and teachers in rural areas of the country, reported Moroccan news outlet, L’Economiste. Other educational figures who received the royal decoration include Mohammed Karakhin, teacher of mathematics at Rhmana High School in Benguerir, near Marrakech; Zahra Souibri, director of Imam Al Boukhari High School in Rabat; and Abdelmalek Zouhir, primary school teacher at Sidi Daoud near Oujda. The ceremony was marked by the attendance of King Mohammed VI’s daughter, Princess Lalla Khadija and Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan. Speaking before the King during the ceremony, Amzazi stated that the program is in line with the King’s speeches delivered for Throne Day on July 29 and on the Day of the Revolution of the King and the People on August 20. The program was “to present [the King with] the report and executive program on supporting schooling and implementing the reform of education and training,” reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). In his recent speeches, the monarch gave special notice to education. The King has ordered the government to “give strong impetus to school enrolment programs and combat school dropout” starting this academic year. The King also signed three partnership agreements. Mohamed Benchaaboun, minister of economy and finance, and Amzazi signed the first agreement on the development of the Tayssir program, boarding schools, and school cafeterias. The Tayssir program is provisional social measures which could make education reforms bear fruit. The second agreement was on the establishing of two vocational training centers in health professions in Rabat and Casablanca. It was signed by Benchaaboun, Amzazi, Minister of Health Anas Doukkali, and Loubna Tricha, director general of the office of vocational training and labor promotion (OFPPT). The third agreement, signed by Amzazi and Rachid Talbi Alami, minister of youth and sports, concerned “the establishment of integrated school programs ‘sport-study,’ and vocational training and higher education courses for athletes,” wrote MAP. The event also comes after the recent debate over including some Darija (Moroccan Arabic) words in Arabic school books.  The controversy started at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year, earlier in September. Citizens fiercely complained to the government and Ministry of Education for including Darija. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has said that the government might give up on the controversial school books.

Rabat – The US has made another cut to Palestinian aid, this time for programs supporting conflict resolution with Israelis. An official from the US embassy confirmed the news on Sunday, September 16. The $10 million for reconciliation initiatives involving  Palestinians, Jewish and Arab Israelis, will be redirected, according to Al Jazeera. “As announced in August, the administration redirected more than $200 million that was originally planned for programmes in the West Bank and Gaza,” he said. US President Donald Trump had previously cut aid this year when Palestine launched a boycott of the US peace plan after Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This month, the US administration ordered the closure of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington, D.C. In August, officials from the US administration also announced the cut of more than $200 million in economic aid for Palestine and all funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), pledging the aid for “high-priority projects elsewhere.”

Rabat – The Ministry of Education has started taking action against school books that caused controversy in Morocco recently. The Regional Academy of Education and Training of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region has removed all copies of a francophone schoolbook containing content that “violates divinity.” Pictures of a controversial text from the school book have gone viral recently on social media. The unidentified school used the book without asking for permission from the concerned parties. The content reads: “The little God took a piece of paper, color pencils, and he painted the world.” The text continues, “God started by creating the sky and earth. However, the sky was empty, and the earth too.” People condemned the text for belittling God. The text added to the backlash that erupted due to the use of some Darija (Moroccan Arabic) words in standard Arabic school books. The ministry sent a committee to investigate the case in the school. After investigation, the committee decided not to fire the pedagogical director of the school, according to a statement from the regional academy. The francophone school book was for the first year of secondary school. According to the statement, the content violates Article 4 and 8 of Law 06.00 on private school education as it is not part of the official programs authorized by the academy. The statement added that it has not received any request from the school to allow it use the controversial school book. Throughout this month, Moroccan parents and citizens expressed their concerns about the content and quality of education in Morocco. Including Darija in school books angered some people, calling on the government to remove all books that contain words in Moroccan Arabic, describing them as unuseful.  Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that he supported citizens’ stance, adding that the government is “ready to give up” on the school books. El Othmani has also slammed people who defend the use of Darija in education, including Noureddine Ayouch. Ayouch serves in Morocco’s Supreme Council of Higher Education. El Othmani made his position clear on the use of Darija in school books. In the first week of school, the official said that Darija cannot be used in education, emphasizing that “the official languages recognized by the Constitution are Arabic and Tamazight.” On Saturday, the prime minister also thanked citizens for their “strong stance” against the use of Darija in education. He said their position supported the position of the government.

Rabat – The tenth day of Muharram, the first month in the Islamic calendar, is no ordinary day for Moroccans and Muslims worldwide. Besides its religious significance, it carries many cultural stories. Sunni Muslims celebrate the day to commemorate the day when God created a path in the Red Sea to liberate Moses and his followers from Pharaoh. Some people honor the day by fasting on the 9th and 10th of Muharram.  The fast is optional and proceeds from the Prophet Muhammad’s fast on Ashura after arriving in Medina in 622 AD. He found that Jews fasted on Muharram 10 and asked them why. The Jews told Muhammad that they were commemorating the day God liberated the Children of Israel and Moses from Egypt at the Red Sea. Since that day, the prophet decided to fast and ordered Muslims to fast the day, too, as a means to thank God for his mercy and grace. Ashura: Music in the souks Ashura, which derives its name from the Arabic word “ashara” (meaning 10), is two days away. On September 20, Moroccans will celebrate every cultural aspect of the event. In Morocco, where the vast majority of the Muslim population are Sunnis, parents and children have unique ways to celebrate the day. If you are in Morocco in the early days of the month of Muharram, do not hesitate to venture into Moroccan souks, where you will experience another cultural aspect of the country. Throughout the first week of Muharram, Moroccan souks are adorned with all shades of colors reflected from handmade musical instruments typically sold for the event.   The instruments include the famous Moroccan taarija, a membranophone (drum) available in many sizes, shapes, and colors. Traditionally, parents buy the instrument for their children.  Some parents give their daughters taarijas painted in bright colors, while they give their sons a drum with two heads (tabla) or a darbuka (goblet drum).   During the celebration, children, especially girls, gather together in their neighborhood to play with their taarijas while singing traditional songs related to the event. Ashura: Foods to share Ashura is also a day when Moroccans show their hospitality and generosity. People who celebrate the day adorn their tables with various snacks, including nuts. The best way to enjoy the event is to walk through one of the traditional souks, where all kinds of dried fruit and nuts are sold. Among the offerings are almonds, raisins, dried bananas, sweets, walnuts, peanuts, pistachios, and other nuts. A variety of sweets, dried fruits, and pastries are all served throughout the Ashura week.  Fekkas is among the pastries that are common in Moroccan houses during Ashura.  Fekkas are well-known cookies made of almonds, flour, and raisins. Another kind of fekkas served at Ashura is krishlat, a miniature version of fekkas served spicy, salty, or sweet.  During the celebration, some families also give small packets full of nuts and krichlat to their relatives’ children.     Ashura is also an Eid, or holiday, for children as they receive multiple toys.   In some neighborhoods, some children will knock on neighbors’ doors to ask for treats. Instead of “trick or treat,” children say “haq baba Ashour” (share an Ashura treat). Like with Halloween, children carry a bag to collect goods from neighbors.   Shaaeila and Zamzam: Firecrackers and water-balloon throwing For the mischievous and adventurous, the eve of Ashura is the best part of the holiday. “Shaaeila” (flames) is part of the event’s rituals. On the eve of the big day, youth light fires and gather around to enjoy the bonfire while chanting Moroccan traditional songs. The ritual is not as common as it used to be because authorities have outlawed it, fearing potential damage. Although they are not authorized, firecrackers are also common in the celebration. Children buy small firecrackers and throw them to the ground everywhere to light them.   However, firecrackers probably come second as the favorite Ashura custom for Moroccan children. In the morning of the 9th day of Muharram, teenagers and children alike buy balloons and fill them with water to throw at each other. The ritual is called Zamzam day.  The word is derived from the holy water of Zamzam taken from Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Some Islamic scholars, however, have called on Muslims to stop the ritual as it came from non-Muslim origins. It is believed to be a rite with Jewish roots which was more common in the Mellahs, the walled Jewish quarter of cities in Morocco. Moroccan Jews are believed to have thrown a few drops of water on their goods as a symbol of coming prosperity.  Some threw water as a way to hope for a good rainy season in winter. Today, some Moroccans take the ritual too far, throwing more than just water on Zamzam day, even eggs.  Ashura for Shia Muslims is a mourning day In some Muslim countries, Ashura is commemorated very differently, especially among Shia Muslims. Some Shia Muslims take Ashura seriously and whip themselves to mourn the death of Husayn Ibn Ali, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who was killed in the Karbala Battle on October 10, 680, which corresponded to the 10th day of Muharram. The death of Ibn Ali is widely remembered by Shia as part of a struggle against injustice. How do Shia Muslims mourn the day? In some Shia cities, mourners will walk through the streets dressed in black, repeating chants. Others will perform passion plays to depict the death of Husayn Ibn Ali. Some beat and cut themselves with knives. The custom was not uncommon in Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Iraq, Bangladesh, and India. The ritual has been banned in Iran and Lebanon, but it is still performed in Bangladesh and India today.

Rabat – Moroccan filmmaker Nour-eddine Lakhmari’s movie “Burn Out” has been chosen in the pre-selection for Best Foreign Film at the 2019 Oscars.  According to the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM), the movie was chosen to represent Morocco by a selection committee chaired by producer Souad Lamriki, in line with the criteria established by the Oscars Academy, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has arrested 12 suspects with alleged ties to criminal and terror networks in Casablanca and Tangier. According to a joint statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), one of the suspects has ties with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Authorities said the list includes former prisoners convicted of terrorism and extremism. Today’s statement added that other suspects have criminal records for undermining public safety, drug trafficking, and kidnapping for ransom, and using knives for criminal purposes. BCIJ conducted the arrest in coordination with DGSN and DGST. The communiqué noted that members of the same criminal network attempted to storm an apartment in Tangier on Friday, causing the death of a person suspected of involvement in drugs, who fell from the seventh floor of the building. An investigation into the Friday incident enabled authorities to seize a range of items, including masks, gloves, knives, and shock-proof vest. Authorities put the suspects in custody for further investigations to identify the suspects’ possible links to other criminal networks. The operation followed a similar arrest of three suspects on September 6 who were active in Tetouan and Agadir. Police arrested the suspects for ties with ISIS. The security agency has carried out several operations dismantling terror cells with links to ISIS throughout the year. BCIJ staff arrested seven pro-ISIS extremists in July operating in central Morocco, near Agadir and Marrakech. In another BCIJ operation, police arrested four suspects on July 2 in four Moroccan cities. In response to terror threats, especially after Marrakech’s terror attack in 2011, Morocco modernized and upgraded its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime.

Rabat – The 91-year-old cafe in Tangier, Le Gran Cafe de Paris, has secured a place among Telegraph’s  list of “the 50 greatest cafes on earth.” The list delightfully described the place in a solo paragraph as a place to relax when you are not in a hurry to leave. “The Gran Cafe, gracing the corner across from Morocco’s French consulate since 1927, has plenty of seats outside, where locals chatter, watch the traffic and smoke (they smoke inside, too) over cafes au lait,” wrote the Telegraph. The Telegraph did not ignore the cafe’s host city: “It is natural that the city of rogues and writers, spies and sleazeballs should have a café culture.” The cafe is considered the most famous in the city, getting a “must visit” in Tangier on Tripadvisor for trip and tourist recommendations. The cafe’s charm is found in its simplicity as one of the first buildings outside the old medina (walled city) of Tangier. The cafe has long been a resting place for famous educated people, including US author Paul Bowles and the American visual artist and writer William Burroughs. The cafe hosted a scene in the Bourne Ultimatum movie starring Matt Damon in 2007. Inside the cafe, leather and wooden chairs match the beige wall paint and tables.  The color gives the cafe a classy Western look. The cafe serves cold and hot drinks, including the famous northern mint tea and cafe au lait. The list of the top 50 cafes on earth includes Caffe Reggio in New York,  Cafe Olimpico in Montreal, Caf La Habana in Mexico City and Fazil Bey in Istanbul.

Rabat- A video of French President Emmanuel Macron promising to provide a place to stay for a Moroccan student has gone viral on social media. Amid crowds, a Moroccan student complained about her inability to find accomodation to Macron. He was responsive to her request, asking if she had a student visa. The young girl, accompanied by a friend who was facing the same problem, said that it had only been a week since she arrived in France to pursue her higher education in electrical energy and automation at Saint Jerome University in Marseille. “Please, sir, we are pained.… We came here to realize our dream,” she pleaded. Macron promised the student to speak with concerned authorities on her behalf.   It was not the first time that a Moroccan woman sought Macron’s help in public. However, Macron’s previous interaction did not go as favorably for the Moroccan. An asylum-seeker approached the president in November 2017 during a charity event in Paris. Macron’s strict approach to her problem sparked mixed reactions.  When the woman told Macron that her sick parents were living in France, he said: “You can come visit them regularly, if you want.… If you are not in danger, you should go back to your country.”  The French president has always been strict when it comes to migration affairs. Justifying his strict immigration policy, Macron quoted the famous words of former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard in 1989: “We take our share, but we can not welcome all the misery of the world.” He added: “I cannot give French papers to everyone, otherwise how do I deal with all the people who are already here and who cannot find work?”  In the midst of concerns over the numbers of irregular migrants arriving in France, Macron will visit Morocco in November to discuss migration, among a range of critical issues in Morocco-France bilateral ties. In addition to the strong commercial and cultural—mainly linguistic and educational—ties between France and Morocco, the two countries have upgraded their security cooperation in recent months.

Rabat – UNDP has ranked Morocco 123rd in its 2018 Human Development Index (HDI) among 189 countries, down from 122 in 2016. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) published its 2018 update on September 14, presenting HDI values for 189 countries around the world, including 20 Arab countries, classified in four human development tiers. The UNDP’s statistics, which are based on 2017 data, showed that 59 countries ranked “very high” in human development, 53 “high,” 39 in “medium,” and 38 in “low.” Morocco ranks lower than Libya Morocco ranked “medium” in human development group with an HDI of 0.667 out of 1 (0.598 for women and 0.713 for men) after Egypt (ranked 115), Palestine (ranked 119), and Iraq (ranked 120). Algeria ranked 85th with “high” levels of human development with an HDI of 0.754. Lebanon (80); Tunisia (95); Jordan (95); and, despite its conflict, Libya (105) also ranked “high.”
However, Morocco’s HDI increased from 0.458 in 1990 to 0.667 in 2017, with an average annual HDI growth of 1.13 percent between 2010 and 2017—a rate much higher than the average in Arab states (0.51). Norway ranked at the top of the list in the global HDI rankings with 0.953, followed by Switzerland (0.944), Australia (0.939), Ireland (0.938), and Germany (0.936). Countries ranked at the bottom of the list are Burundi (0.417), Chad (0.404), South Sudan (0.388), the Central African Republic (0.367), and Niger (0.354). Morocco’s scores across longevity, education, income The HDI is a composite index which takes into account three basic components of human development: longevity, education, and income per capita.  The three dimensions concern the ability to lead a long and healthy life measured by life expectancy at birth, the ability to acquire knowledge—measured by mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling, and the ability to achieve a decent standard of living—measured by gross national income per capita. Morocco’s life expectancy at birth was 76.1 years (77.2 for women and 74.9 for men), higher than the average index in Arab states (71.5) and than that in Europe and Central Asia (73.4). Life expectancy at birth in countries with “very high” human development was 79.5 years. The average number of years of schooling held by people aged 25 and older in Morocco was 5.5 years (4.5 for women and  6.5 for men). The number was less than the average in Arab countries (7 years) and slightly more than the average country with “low” human development (4.7).  The statistics also showed that 28 percent of women and 34.8 percent of men aged 25 and older had at least some secondary education between 2010 and 2017. Gross national income (GNI) per capita, which also impacted the HDI in Morocco, was $7,340 per year. Women’s GNI per capita in Morocco is very low at $3,197 per year compared to men’s at $11,561. Morocco’s GNI per capita is lower than the average in Egypt ($10,355), Tunisia ($10,275), and Libya ($11,100).  Gender parity
The human development report covers four other composite indices to measure human development, such as the Gender Development Index which compares female and male HDI values and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) which highlights women’s empowerment. For the GII, Morocco ranked 119th for 2017 with 0.482 out of 1. Women hold 18.4 percent of the seats in Parliament. According to the report, “a low GII value indicates low inequality between women and men, and vice-versa.” For labor force participation rate for people aged 15 and older, women’s participation in the labor force is only 25 percent—a rate that is much lower than that of men (74 percent). At the Arab states’ regional level, the labor participation rate is 20.7 percent for women and 74.2 percent for men. In Europe and Central Asia, it is 45.5 percent for women and 70.3 percent men. Countries with “high” human development levels have a rate of 55 percent for women and 75.5 percent for men. The UNDP’s statistics presented other indicators including health outcomes, education achievements, work and employment, human security, and the status of fundamental human rights treaties.

Rabat – Amid the recent debate over Darija and Arabic, King Mohammed VI is expected to chair a meeting on education today in Rabat. The King is expected to receive Minister of Education Said Amzazi, who may present his education strategy for the coming days, sources told Moroccan news platform Media24. It would be the first official royal activity of the King in Morocco since his official working trip to the UAE. In his recent speeches, including the Throne Day speech, the monarch gave special notice to education. The King has ordered the government to “give strong impetus to school enrolment programs and combat school dropout” starting this academic year. Amidst the reforms pledged by the government, controversy erupted at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year due to the use of words in Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in school books for early education. The decision to include the words in Darija put the minister of education under scrutiny, as he emphasized that the use of Darija was “purely for education purposes.” The minister is also expected to give a thorough presentation today about his vision to improve education in the country. Medias24’s source added that several other issues related to education will be discussed, including school dropout rates and the Tayssir program on school enrollment support. In the Throne Day speech delivered on July 29, the monarch said that the Tayssir program is a provisional social measures which could make education reforms bears fruit. “The above measures are designed to ease the burden on families and to provide them with support to make sure their children continue to attend school and training programs,” said the King. The King’s other provisional measures include early childhood education, school transportation, school cafeterias, and boarding schools. The potential meeting today will also include discussions on the generalization of preschool education and the practice and learning of foreign languages, added the source to the news outlet.

Rabat – A Moroccan ambassador has addressed Algeria’s reluctance to open the Moroccan-Algerian border and the Maghreb integration project. The Moroccan ambassador to Italy, Hassan Abou Ayoub, discussed the circumstances of Algeria’s refusal to open its borders with Morocco on Thursday with Italian journalists. “Algeria closes its borders with Morocco because it is not prepared for integration,  contrary to the propaganda it tries to convey,” said the ambassador. The meeting, under the theme “The Mediterranean and the European Union: Challenges and political and economic stability,” was part of a festival of Mediterranean journalists. Commenting on the state of the Algerian economy, the ambassador said that Algeria “does not have the means to compete with Morocco and Tunisia in areas such as industry and agriculture. “Algeria has an inferiority complex and has no desire or ambition to work for Maghreb integration.” Algeria closed its borders with Morocco in 1994 when Morocco imposed visa regulations on Algerian visitors in the wake of a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni hostel in Marrakech. Morocco lifted the visa requirement in 2004. But the border has remained closed. The diplomat also compared the process of European integration with the Maghreb, saying that the lack of political dialogue and the freezing bilateral cooperation are the main factors in the failure of Maghreb integration. Reiterating Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict, the Moroccan representative said that the conflict is an obstacle to Maghreb integration as it is a “problem between Morocco and Algeria.” The official said the solution to the conflict relies on the involvement of Algeria in the UN-led political process. Algerian officials, however, have claimed that the conflict should be solved between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front only. Moroccan and Algerian activists marched on July 22 to the border “to call on the authorities of both countries to open the border.” Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported that the initiative received thousands of nods from citizens who supported the idea. In March, Algerian politician Mohcine Belabbas said that the border opening depends largely on the Algerian government. He added that the idea also requires “talks between the leaders of the two countries in order to establish cooperation on their security against the banditry and trafficking that have increased due to the closure.”

Rabat- The chairman of the council of ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina has started an official visit to Morocco to reinforce bilateral cooperation. The chairman, Denis Zvizdic, arrived on Sunday evening at Mohamed V Airport in Casablanca for a four-day visit to the country.  Accompanied by a delegation of businessmen, the chairman was received by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani; Minister of General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi; and the governor of the province of Nouaceur, Hassan Zitouni.  El Othmani noted in a statement that while Bosnia and Herzegovina and Morocco enjoy “excellent” political ties, they still need to grow their economic relations. El Othmani said that the visit primarily aims to reinforce economic cooperation, announcing that the Bosnian business delegation will hold talks with Moroccan companies to deepen trade between the two countries. Within the framework of the visit, Zvizdic will attend a working meeting on Tuesday at the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) in Casablanca. Moroccan-Bosnian relations have been strengthening,  reflected in the judicial, economic, and commercial agreements, and the mutual visa exemption for holders of diplomatic, service, or special passports agreed on in 2016. Morocco continues to attract international investment.  Quantum Global Research Lab recognized Morocco as a top-tier destination for economic investment on the African continent in 2017, in sectors such as information and communication technology (ICT), energy, infrastructure, and tourism.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has fired senior military officials and ordered the confiscation of their passports.  Alg24 reported that the list of dismissed military officials includes Menad Nouba, Said Bey, Abderrezak Cherif, Boudjema Boudouaour, and Habib Chentouf. The officials are allegedly facing charges of the traffic of influence and abuse of power, according to Observe Algerie. Authorities opened an investigation into the military officials. According to the news outlet, the investigation is part of others opened into several top officials suspected of corruption following the seizure of 701 kilograms of cocaine at the port of Oran in May. In August, the secretary-general of Algeria’s Workers Party, Louisa Hanoune, heavily criticized the Algerian regime. The politician condemned the “mafiaization of state institutions,” referring to the arrest of senior officials involved in cocaine trafficking. According to the politician, the scandal “reveals a mafiaization of state institutions already gangrenous by widespread corruption.”  Hanoune pointed out that Algeria lives in “political congestion,” expressing concerns over the next presidential election. The politician said that the election will take place in a “dangerous context” that might lead the country to the “unknown.” Many officials, especially from the Algerian ruling party, the National Liberation Front, called on Bouteflika to run for a fifth term in the 2019 presidential election. However, several local news outlets quoted officials, authors, and journalists expressing dissatisfaction with the Algerian political system. Bouteflika has been president of Algeria since 1999. In 2013, the head of state suffered a debilitating stroke.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has strongly criticized Noureddine Ayouch after his controversial remarks about standard Arabic. El Othmani said, “This person is irresponsible, he has no position in the state, nor in the government, nor in Parliament.” Noureddine Ayouch serves in Morocco’s Supreme Council of Higher Education. In recent weeks, parents in Morocco have condemned the use of some words in Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in school books for primary education. Ayouch generated a round of criticism for his strong defense of the use of Darija in Moroccan education. After receiving criticism from citizens and scholars for his beliefs, Ayouch called his critics “dogs.” “The dogs may bark, but the caravan moves on,” he said. In response to his controversial remarks, El Othmani said that Ayouch is not a member of Parliament and has no authority. “Yet he dares to say that dogs bark and the caravan goes by!” According to the head of government, what Ayouch meant by his remarks is “that Morocco will add Darija in education despite criticism.”  However, the government will not allow that, according to El Othmani. “It is us who should say the caravan goes by … please complete the statement, because I don’t want to finish it,” he said. El Othmani also thanked citizens for their strong stance against the use of Darija in education. He continued their stance supported the position of the government. For the prime minister, “the caravan of reform will work. The caravan of defense of the foundations will continue to the end. Only this caravan will work, but with the support of everyone.” The official,  who is also secretary-general of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), made his remarks during the PJD’s national council. El Othmani made his position clear on the use of Darija in school books. In the first week of school, the official said that Darija cannot be used in education, emphasizing that “the official languages recognized by the Constitution are Arabic and Tamazight.” In Saturday’s party meeting, El Othmani echoed his statement, saying that “those who call for the use of Darija in school books defend an anti-constitutional principle that is outside the strategy put in place by the Higher Council of Education and Training and outside the draft framework law that awaits its discussion in Parliament.” He reassured citizens that the government “will not allow the introduction of Darija in textbooks, today or in the future.” While El Othmani responded to Ayouch, Moroccan researcher and academic Khalid Jama criticized both the head of government and Ayouch for their disrespectful dialogue. The political analyst and journalist told Moroccan news outlet Ach Kayen,  “If those people cannot respect themselves and use this language, how are they expecting citizens to respect them and respect their decisions?” He added that  “no Moroccan patriot can respect those people, because they don’t deserve it.” Morocco World News could not immediately reach the academic for comment. As children across the country began the school year on September 5, citizens fiercely complained to the government and the Ministry of Education for including Darija. While El Othmani responded that the government might give up on the controversial school books, Ayouch fueled the backlash with his defense of the dialect’s use. Some citizens also launched a petition on Avaaz.org, calling on the government  to remove Ayouch from the education council. According to the signatories, the petition aims to suspend Ayouch’s plans “to destroy the principles and moral values and execute the Arabic language.” In his recent interviews with local news outlets, Ayouch said that Darija existed before classical Arabic and that Darija could curb the education crisis in the country. He also said that classical Arabic is not “sacred.”

Rabat – The Casablanca court has rejected the request of jailed journalist Taoufik Bouachrine for temporary release. It is not the first time that Bouachrine, who is awaiting trial on heavy charges of sexual assault, has requested and been denied temporary release. Last week, some Moroccan news outlets shared a series of leaked screenshots allegedly captured from the videos seized in the arrest of Bouachrine. The pictures, which show what appears to be the journalist with women in his office, were leaked after the National Gendarmerie Laboratory conducted a report to analyze the seized videos. The laboratory submitted its report to the court early last week. Mohamed Kerrout, one of the lawyers for the complainants told local media after Bouachrine’s latest hearing that the videos “are not fake,” according to the experts who analyzed them. However, the sharing of the alleged leaked photos angered Morocco’s Press Union, which issued a statement on Friday to condemn the act. According to the statement, which was obtained by Morocco World News, the media should be primarily concerned “with protecting the ethics and dignity of the people.”  The statement slammed the news outlets which shared the photos, stating that the press is not made for “profit.” Bouachrine is the director of one of Morocco’s major newspapers,  Akhbar Al Yaoum, and its online outlet Al Yaoum24. Police arrested the journalist at the headquarters of the newspaper in February. Among the charges Bouachrine faces are sexual assault, human trafficking, rape, and attempted rape.

Rabat – An analysis by Quartz shows that the majority of terror attacks in 2017 in the US were motivated by right-wing extremism. Analysts at Quartz used data collected by the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database. The database “counts cases where violence is used by non-state actors to achieve political, economic, religious, or social goals through fear and coercion.” According to the article, which was published in August, “Most attacks in 2017 were thought to be motivated by right-leaning ideologies.” The outlet added that out of 65 incidents, 37 terror events were linked to either anti-Muslim sentiment, homophobia, anti-government beliefs, xenophobia anti-Semitism, or fascism. The analysis tied seven attacks to “Islamic extremists, including the vehicle-ramming Sayfulo Saipov was arrested for in New York that left eight people dead.” Quartz linked the other 11 attacks to left-wing ideologies. The list of incidents reported in the analysis includes the August 2017 attack in Virginia, where a man deliberately drove his vehicle into a crowd at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. James Alex Fields, described by Quarts as an American neo-Nazi, was charged with second-degree murder after he drove the car at protesters in the rally, claiming the life of one resident and injuring at least 19 others.  Assaults on Muslims on the Rise The list of attacks included one on a gay bar in Puerto Rico and other attacks against mosques in Washington, Texas, and Florida. Extremism and radicalization linked to Islam have impacted views of Muslims. Muslims living in non-Muslim-majority countries have experienced attacks due to their religion. A Pew Research Center article published in 2017 reviewed FBI statistics, showing that assaults on Muslims in the US in 2016 had “easily surpassed” the previous modern peak of attacks on Muslims in 2001. The article showed that there were 127 reported violent crimes in 2016 experienced by Muslims compared to 91 in 2015 and 93 in 2001. Hate crimes not only affect Muslims, but also Jews, in the US.  Pew said that hate crimes targeting Jews in the US increased in 2016 to 684.

Rabat – The Justice and Development Party (PJD) has continued to address tension with its political ally, the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS). The ruling party, PJD, held an extraordinary meeting of its national council on Saturday and discussed PPS-PJD tension, among other topics. The tension between the two parties began when King Mohammed VI ordered the dissolution of the Secretariat of State in Charge of Water on August 20 at the request of the secretary-general of the PJD, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. PPS expressed anger over the move because the water department was run by PPS member Charafat Afilal. The decision shocked PPS members, who said they were not consulted before the move. Since then, relations between the two parties have been under pressure, with PPS Secretary-General Nabil Benabdellah announcing his party would withdraw from the government coalition. In an attempt to solve the issue, El Othmani and Benabellah held several talks after the removal of the water department. The latest meeting was on Thursday, when El Othmani and a delegation of his party visited Benabdellah to discuss relations between the two parties. The head of government renewed his commitment to maintain a good relationship with PJD’s ally during his party’s national council on Saturday. “We are clinging to our alliance” with PPS, said El Othmani. He added that differences between the two parties “do not mean that we will abandon our partnership.” A statement of the PJD quoted the head of government as saying that PPS “is a long-standing national party with the ability to take the right decision at moments of reforms and we respect its decisions as we have confidence in the continuation of this partnership.”  The meeting held on Saturday in Bouznika, 41 kilometers southwest of Rabat, also marked the presence of former secretary-general of PJD and former head of government, Abdelilah Benkirane. Benkirane also commented on the PPS-PJD tension. He said that the party has all the rights to be angry because of the water department decision. “But [PPS] is our ally and we are its ally, and we have not been united to stay in government, but to contribute to reforms.” Idriss Azami, president of the PJD’s national council also pointed out the importance of the partnership between the two parties, describing it as “strategic.” He said that partnership between both parties  is based on “joint action and partnership.”

Washington, DC — The recent ”inexplicable” rash of firings of scores of high-ranking military officials in the Algerian armed forces is nothing short of a coup d’état led by Vice Minister of Defense and chief of staff of the Algeria’s People’s National Army (ANP), General Ahmed Gaid Salah.  Fifty years after its independence, yet another general emerges as the undisputed leader of Algeria. Over the past few months, Algeria’s new strongman General Gaid Salah has orchestrated an unprecedented shake-up of his nation’s security apparatus with the firing of all but one head of the country’s military regions, the head of the national police, several generals and high-ranking officials within Military Intelligence. The firing of the chief of the National Police, General Abdelghani Hamel, was a master coup that gives Gaid Salah unprecedented power. General Hamel, a close friend and a confidant of the presidential clan, was considered by many as a pillar of the Bouteflika regime. Even more significant, right after the removal of Hamel, General Gaid Salah tried to sack General Bachir Tartag, another significant figure of the current regime. Media outlets close to the military circulated articles predicting the imminent demise of Tartag, the head of the DSS (Algeria’s powerful intelligence agency). However, no official announcement was ever made. With the termination of Hamel and the weakening of Tartag , Gaid Salah consolidates all the powers. In fact, he has used the debate over the suitability of President Bouteflika to run for a fifth term as a cover to fire unfriendly elements and assign close aides to key positions in the armed forces and security services. Additionally, he is in the process of drafting a list of names of loyalists who would replace a number of current Governors.  In his attempt to further intimidate his opponents, Gaid Salah has banned several of the dismissed generals from leaving the country. According to military sources cited in the Algerian press, general Nouba Menad, the powerful former chief of Gendarmerie Nationale ( a national police force that report to the military establishment) and the former heads of military regions I, II, IV and V  are barred from leaving Algeria. This strategy is a vehicle for the new boss to solidify his hold on power for yeas to come. The Vice Minister of Defense strategically chose the timing of Bouteflika’s medical visit to Switzerland to ram through his nominees. The partially paralyzed and seldom seen  President hardly seems in control of the events around him or able to manage such complex and calculated assignments. Gaid Salah’s supporters have been portraying these purges as an anti-corruption sweep in response to the seizure of a large cocaine shipment in the port the city of Oran. For the General, these changes are an attempt to de-politicize the ANP. In truth, with the removal of any potential rival and the assignment of loyalists to key security positions, General Gaid Salah has established a firm grip on the nation and silenced all opposition. He has decimated the Oujda Clan and sidelined Saïd Bouteflika, the President’s brother and a potential rival with presidential ambitions. Additionally, the chaos in Libya and the political uncertainty in Tunisia have emboldened Gaid Salah. He saw the region’s shifting geopolitics as an opportunity to ready his clan for power under a lame duck Bouteflika  5th term. Despite his likely success in re-electing Bouteflika as a President next year, Gaid Salah will remain vulnerable to social and political changes in Algeria and the Maghreb region. Although there is no genuine opposition to the military establishment, the gloomy economic forecast for Algeria has left many of its people bitter and disillusioned. Recent spate of terrorist  attacks and social protests have shown that Algeria faces real security and political  risks,  The ANP’s decision to back Bouteflika’s fifth mandate  is only exacerbating them. While fear of terrorism and extremism have historically forged a unified front in Algeria, a collapsing economy and the lack of a clear political agenda will likely fragment the opposition parties that have been “obeying” military orders. Proclaiming that the nation faces an existential threat from extremist groups backed by hidden hands (a term used in official propaganda to describe outside conspirators) who want to witness Algeria’s humiliation, the military backed Algerian regime continues to garner the blessing and the compliance of its citizens. As the General cleans house and prepare his troops for the “fifth term”, the International Monetary Fund has warned Algeria of dire economic consequences if the government does not implement real reforms. He may have the ANP under control but the rumblings of dissent in the country will, without a doubt, continue to grow.

Rabat – A new development plan proposes to establish a military buffer zone on the Algerian border in Figuig, eastern Morocco. However, local Figuigis have completely rejected the plan which will encroach on their land. The town’s 10,700 inhabitants were surprised that the new development plan for Figuig included a “military buffer zone.” According to the president of Figuig’s municipal council, the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) proposed the project “to allow military maneuvers and chasing [irregular migrants], to face external threats to Morocco, and to monitor any suspicious movement easily.” The new development plan would minimize the livable area and expand the military area in Figuig. Figuig, an oasis of date palms at the northwestern edge of the  Sahara Desert, is located in the far eastern region of Morocco, surrounded to the north, east, and south by Algeria. The town lies in the middle of a valley surrounded by hills and mountains that represent the continuity of the great Saharan Atlas. The oasis, which covers an area of approximately 25 square kilometers, consists of seven ksours (castles). The seven are called: Laabidate, Lamaiz, Hammam Foukani, Hammam Tahtani, Loudaghir, Ouled Slimane and Zenaga. The ksar or qsar, called “aghrem” in Tamazight (Berber), is a group of houses surrounded by a fortress and watchtowers. The majority of Figuig’s population are of Amazigh (Berber) origin and speak Tamazight, but most speak Arabic as well. Although the closest town to Figuig, Beni Ounif, is just seven kilometers south, it lies across the border with Algeria, which has been closed since 1994. Confined on three sides by the Algerian border and lacking governmental investment, Figuig has suffered from economic stagnation. The closure of the border isolated Figuig and helped to create intense emigration from Figuig to other Moroccan cities and abroad. A controversial development plan In 2015, the urban agency proposed a new development plan for Figuig. Three years later, the urban agency presented the plan to the local public in August this year. The plan includes a military zone, which would seize 610 hectares in a claw shape surrounding the city to the south, east, and north of Figuig. Approximately half of the land in the new military project is public property while the other half is private property. The plan was recently presented to the local public for inquiry for a one month period: August 1-30. During that period, the town’s inhabitants gave their proposals and remarks, revealing vehement opposition. According to remarks from Figuig’s municipal council, the project “includes areas where investment projects in the agricultural sector already exist and in which local residents and the expatriate community have invested.” The municipal council held a session September 6 to discuss and approve the proposals by local inhabitants and the council. Mohammed Hakkou, the president of Figuig’s municipal council, told Morocco World News that the development plan elicited opposition from 860 entities and people, of which 542 opposed the military project. The remaining oppositions concern other aspects of the development plan, such as roads and buildings. “Ninety-nine percent of the proposals were accepted and adopted by the commune. A report about it will be attached and sent to the urban agency,” he added. Before adoption, the new plan was developed in phases in which the urban agency, which runs the project, held consultations with concerned ministries and administrations, such as the Hydraulic Basin Agency, the forest and water ministry, and FAR. Figuig’s first development plan was launched in 1998 after the city was recognized as an “urban commune” instead of a rural area in 1992. Typically, development plans take years to come to fruition. Six years after the launch, in 2004, the plan was approved and implemented by a ministerial decree for a 10-year period. Military project’s consequences One reason residents oppose the military buffer zone is that it would prevent them from accessing their land. The president of Figuig’s municipal council explained that the military zone, if implemented, would be cleared of all obstructions, such as trees, palms, and buildings. Residents would not be able to enter the restricted zone without FAR’s consent. The areas that will be lost, both due to the military zone and due to inaccessibility, are very important to the town’s inhabitants and constitute part of Figuig’s heritage.   In 2011, the Figuig oasis was inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage Tentative List to be nominated to the World Heritage List. In the area surrounding the town, locals have cultivated hundreds of thousands of date palms. Dates are the town’s most important agricultural resource. Figuigi people inside and outside the city have invested a lot of money on private projects to cultivate the arid lands around the central palm grove.The project would affect the population’s economic activities and reduce the already limited areas available for any new construction.  In the new development plan, the area for real estate construction is limited to 8 hectares on the eastern side of Figuig, an area representing only 1.3% of the space the military plans to seize. This would limit the town’s ambitions for real estate investment to build private institutions, administrations, or development projects. The area of open ground in Figuig in which construction is forbidden, such as cemeteries and land next to valleys, covers three quarters of the city’s area. Samira Mizbar, a socio-economist researcher from Figuig, told Morocco World News: “Diaspora funds and development projects led by [local and international] associations have enabled the city to thrive and survive.” However, Mizbar stressed: “The intrusion of the army in the oasis town is going to ‘kill’ investment projects. Clearly, we are being pushed out of the city. Something which [we] will never [allow to] happen.” What about compensation? There are also concerns over the application of the Moroccan decree of August 7, 1934, which gives priority to military easements. Article 8 of the decree stipulates that “The establishment of easements does not give individuals any right to compensation.” However, the government does compensate for removed buildings and felled or limbed plantations such as trees or palm trees, according to the same article. In addition, the military has the right to remove any plantations which would hinder the establishment of the military zone. For Figuigis, preserving their land takes central importance, and they decisively refuse to be compensated in exchange for losing their land. “The most likely scenario would be compensation for these people. However, on the question of private property, the militarization of the city is totally and absolutely rejected,” said Mizbar. Aziza Jebbari, a local social activist engaged in the civil movement in Figuig, agreed with Mizbar, asserting that locals totally reject compensation because the land is part of their identity and could not be abandoned for money. More emigration “The problem of this military project is that it relates to the ‘collective memory’ of Figuig. For more than a century, Figuig has been regularly losing land with incredible acceleration [in loss] since [Morocco’s] independence,” explained the socio-economic researcher Mizbar. “One of the direct consequences of this loss of land has been massive emigration abroad in Europe, and to the US since the beginning of the 21st century,” she added.  According to statistics provided by the official website of Figuig, the 1960s marked the beginning of massive emigration from Figuig. Between 1960 and 1971, the total number of people who emigrated was 1,734 people and 3,162 between 1971 and 1982. Between 1975 and 1982, the number of people leaving the province of Figuig is estimated at 6,015 people, including 1,982 only from the town of Figuig, while 4,430 people left the oasis between 1982 and 1994. Figuig’s inhabitants aborted fence construction in 2016 Figuigis who want to change the course of the development plan can take hope from a previous instance when they shut down government plans for the border. In February 2016, the Moroccan government started building a fence for security reasons in Saidia, near Oujda, along the border with Algeria. The authorities stopped building the fence when it reached Figuig province. According to Mizbar, the authorities in Figuig province told her that Morocco “wanted to protect itself from the dangers of ISIS hidden in southeastern Algeria.” But local people expressed their discontent over the fence through street protests and social media. “Significant mobilization of the inhabitants of Figuig aborted the project of the separation fence,” said Mizbar. Authorities from the interior ministry in Bouarfa, 110 kilometers west of Figuig, informed the researcher that a royal letter arrived telling the local authorities to stop building the fence and leave Figuigi people in peace. Mizbar, however, noted that she had never seen the letter. Do Figuigis need military zone and maneuvers in the region? Local authorities, including the municipal council, asserted that they are not against security in the region, but they oppose the military project. While FAR reasons the military zone is necessary for security to counter external dangers, locals disagree. There is no need for military maneuvers, in Hakkou’s personal point of view, because Figuig’s inhabitants have always contributed themselves to the area’s security. In the last two years, local people helped in arresting 400 undocumented African migrants who crossed into Morocco from Algeria. Hakkou stressed that “local citizens were the ones who actually captured the illegal immigrants, and they are always protecting their town.” Researcher Mizbar also supports the position that the proximity of the border does not represent an imminent danger for Morocco. “At the macro-level, the Moroccan army claims that Figuig is a gateway for Algeria,” said Mizbar. For Mizbar, this is not true in reality. “If we look at the Mediterranean, many passageways have always existed before and after the [Moroccan] borders which often record smuggling operations.” Mizbar proposed that the Moroccan military should look for intelligence alternatives instead of a buffer zone. Since the issue concerns national security and border surveillance, Mizbar said: “The state should invest in new intelligence technology instead of preventing people from cultivating their lands, especially because the area is of an oasis nature which could turn to wasteland if it is not farmed.” Development plan has no economic plan Figuigis were hoping for economic support from the government. But according to local activists, the plan does not have any economic or environmental aspects. Aziza Jebbari, a local social activist engaged in the civil movement in Figuig, explained to Morocco World News what she felt was lacking. “While in the 21st century the world speaks about development, economy, and environment, these aspects were not considered in the development plan. There is an absence of an industrial zone in the development plan and absence of a zone for touristic investment to build hotels and guest houses. At the environment level, when palm trees will be removed, you affect the environment of the town and you kill the oasis’s identity.” Figuig’s municipal council preferred that the area remain open to agricultural improvements and investment, saying the economic activity “constitutes a shield against any danger, since the region has never presented any danger and has not engaged in any illegal activity.” ‘Figuig is a free land; the army must leave’ Local citizens have repeatedly protested across the city’s streets against the proposed military buffer zone, which would minimize the city’s livable area and expand the military area. Figuigis first marched in protest on August 25, three days after Eid al-Adha. Five other protest marches followed on the streets and ksours of Figuig. The aims of the protests were to promote awareness among the population of the dangers of the military project and to send a “disapproval” message against the project to concerned authorities. Many protestors shouted the slogan: “Figuig is a free land; the army must leave!”

MP Omar Balafrej of the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) party sent the minister of the interior a written question about the issue on September 6. “What are the measures that you intend to take to respond to the inhabitants’ expectations—to expand the vital area of the town and protect its oasis nature—and to do justice to them by retrieving their private lands seized by Algeria?” Balafrej turned the interior minister’s attention to “the suffering of the inhabitants due to Algeria’s control over the property of Figuig’s inhabitants, including trees and palm trees.” The town’s inhabitants have been deprived of using the lands they owned that are now on the Algerian side of the border since the 1970s, when they used to use them freely, Balafrej added.  Border issues: ‘The Algerian army advances’ Although Morocco’s border with Algeria is in the mountains above Figuig, the Moroccan military’s outposts are placed far from the border, closer to the 25 square-kilometer town’s population. Figuig peasants have some agricultural land located between the Moroccan military outposts and the border, an area that local inhabitants consider “an opportunity that Morocco grants to Algeria to enter their lands,” Hakkou said. He added that, years ago, local people had invested in their lands in Arja, north of Figuig, which Algerians claim as theirs because they allege “they are located before Algeria’s border with Morocco.” As a result, “Algerian soldiers often come to this place with their four-wheel drive vehicles.” For the socio-economist researcher Mizbar, “accepting the establishment of a buffer zone in the [Figuig] oasis is to accept the loss of land for the benefit of Algerians.” Mizbar implied that if locals could not use their land because of the buffer zone, they might as well lose their land to Algeria. The situation already exists, according to Mizbar. “While the Moroccan army takes refuge inside the Moroccan lands, the Algerian army advances.” On August 24, Mizbar met a peasant from Hammam Foukani who was filing a complaint to Figuig’s municipality about an incident. The peasant owns a garden in the zone where the military project is set to be established. When the peasant went to work on his garden in the morning, he faced a Moroccan military patrol which told him: “You cannot come here again, this zone has become military and you cannot have access to your garden.” The man protested but went back home. At the end of the day, when he went back to his garden, he found no Moroccan army there. Instead, he saw a group of Algerian soldiers standing in front of him, holding their lamps and laughing out loud. Then one of the soldiers fired his weapon toward the ground. The peasant objected to the action and said that he would not surrender because he had invested so much money in his land. Hakkou also noted another problem related to the military plan. “The military zone is 1 kilometer away from the town’s eastern borders with Algeria.” The area between the military zone and the border would possibly be rendered inaccessible. In this sense, Mizbar emphasized that “soldiers should go and defend the country at the borders.” Lost lands in the history of Figuig After Morocco’s defeat to France during the Battle of Isly in 1844, Figuig lost many lands due to the establishment of borders with Algeria. At that time, Morocco supported resistance to the French colonization of Algeria. “Following the defeat, Morocco was obliged to sign the Treaty of Lalla Maghnia in 1845 which redefined the concept of the border,” wrote history professor Driss Maghraoui in his book “Revisiting the Colonial Past in Morocco.” Omar Ouramdane, who has researched the history of Figuig, told Morocco World News that the treaty stated in its seventh article that Figuig’s southern border remained undefined since it was an uninhabited area, except for some oases and palaces along the valley of Zousfana and its surroundings, an area south of Figuig that is now part of Algeria. “The legal arrangement [of the treaty] permitted France on the Algerian side of the border to exercise a ‘right of pursuit’ into Moroccan territory. Further out into the Sahara, beyond Ain Sefra and the Figuig Oasis, the border was not even defined,” Maghraoui wrote in his book. “The area was considered a ‘no man’s land’ and was subject to much subsequent whittling in favor of the French,” he added. Local inhabitants at the time were freely moving to their farms along the Zousfana valley during the French colonization. They were also paying taxes on their palms to the French colonials, said Ouramdane. In October 1963, Morocco and Algeria fought the “Sand War” over the border. The war increased tensions between the neighboring countries for several years, but ultimately ended with no territorial changes. The war ended in February 1964 by the intervention of international parties, mainly the US, the Arab League, and the Union of African Unity, who arranged a ceasefire.
 After the Sand War, the Algerians began to tighten their grip on the oasis and confiscated Moroccan peasants’ land along the Zousfana valley, Ouramdane noted. When Morocco and Algeria delineated their borders in 1972, most of the land belonging to Figuig locals in the Zousfana valley remained on the Algerian side of the border and became Algeria’s property, he added. In the years since, Morocco-Algeria tensions have only increased, causing the border between the countries to be closed in 1994. As a result, the people of Figuig lost a considerable amount of their land and date palms. According to Ouramdane, Algeria seized more than 135,000 date palms and more than five square kilometers of?? plantation land. What next? The fate of Figuig and its remaining livable area now lies with the urban agency and government committees. A central committee will discuss the observations and proposals with Figuig commune, the urbanization department of the Oujda Prefecture, the urban agency, and the regional inspectorate of urbanization. If the project is approved, the minister of housing and urban planning will issue a ministerial decree to implement the project. According to the president of Figuig municipal council, this phase will not exceed a-one-year period for the project to come into force. In the meantime, Figuiguis inside and outside Morocco are strongly determined not to give up on their lands as they expressly reject the new development plan and its military buffer zone.

By Carlo Zanetti Rabat – In the past 100 years, the Catholic Church in Morocco has undergone a considerable transformation which had a significant impact on the role of St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rabat and the identity of its community.  The 10 minute walk between Rabat’s medina (old city) and Place al Joulane feels like a gradual, however remarkable, cultural transition—from the traditional Moroccan heart of the city to a considerably more Western atmosphere. The architectural style of the area, which almost evokes a 1970s’ European residential suburb, brings to light another crucial layer of Rabat’s history and identity: the French protectorate.  Besides the aesthetics of homes and offices, one building in particular could be considered a contributor to the French character of the area: St. Peter’s, Rabat’s Roman Catholic cathedral. In order to understand why, it is important to look back at the time of St. Peter’s construction.  St. Peter’s was built between 1919 and 1921. Rabat had already been the center of the French protectorate for almost a decade, and the Moroccan Apostolic Vicariate was about to be split into two. After the 1923 separation, the Vicariate of Tangier represented the areas under Spanish control, and Rabat covered the area controlled by the French.  Considering its history, the casual observer might suppose that, in addition to representing the Catholic Church in Morocco, Rabat’s cathedral might have also been built to symbolize French authority. After all, until the beginning of the protectorate, Christianity had played a marginal role in the history of Arabic Morocco.  According to the historian Oronzo Giordano, Christians arrived in this area most probably at the end of the second century, when the greater part of present-day Morocco was a province of the Roman Empire. Initially, Christianity became popular among local tribes, which interpreted its subversive, anti-hierarchical principles as the prerequisites for a potential alliance against the oppressive authority of Rome. When, however, the Roman Empire began its process of Christianization, the Berber tribes started opposing the religion.  After the arrival of the Arabs, some Christians remained, scattered in small communities under Spanish Franciscan or Dominican authorities. According to St. Peter’s archives, some Christians were enslaved in Morocco until the 18th century, when their captivity was abolished. The number of Christians increased considerably between the 19th and the 20th century, due to the growing interest of European countries in Morocco.  Given the marginality of Christianity within Moroccan history, the presence of a majestic Catholic cathedral in the heart of Rabat might be interpreted as more suggestive of a cultural symbol of France, than simply a religious one. When viewing St. Peter’s from the outside, several architectural elements give away the building’s “Frenchness.” The style could be described as an Art Deco revisitation of the French Gothic, mixed with Amazigh (Berber) and Arab artistic features.  St. Peter’s French Gothic component, though probably not as evident as that of Casablanca Cathedral, becomes more noticeable when looking at the layout of its facade, divided in three sections. The enormous rose window which watches over Place al Joulane; the majestic, rectangular belltowers which stem from the lateral sections of the facade; and the pinnacles on their top evoke medieval French cathedrals, such as those in the northern French cities of Reims and Amiens and, above all, Notre Dame of Paris. 
 In an interview with Morocco World News, the archbishop of Rabat, Cristobal Lopez Romero underlined how the colonial matrix of the cathedral must not be forgotten, but rather admitted with humility as a fault of the Church. “We are guilty,” Lopez Romero said, “of having been introduced here as part of the French occupation.” He then added, “While it is important to remember the role played by the Church in Morocco during the protectorate, it is even more necessary to communicate what we are now. It is no coincidence that they chose me, a Spanish Salesian, to represent what has historically been a ‘French archdiocese’: it’s the symptom of a need to state that we are here to represent the Catholic Church, not France. “If in the past you would only see French citizens coming out of St. Peter’s after Mass, now our cathedral is home to a beautifully diverse community of Ivorians, Spanish, Congolese, Cameroonians, French, Senegalese, and many other nationalities.” If the French past of St. Peter’s is best epitomized by its facade, its present is most poignantly represented by its community, mainly composed of francophone sub-Saharans. The same place where, until 1956, French occupiers used to worship, has been transformed, now belonging to a community whose majority come from countries which the same occupiers had colonized.  The identity of the cathedral’s community is a powerful symbol: it not only represents a victory over colonialism, but it also exemplifies the unifying role of Catholic “inculturation,” the process through which Catholicism adapted to the cultures to which it was introduced. In this respect, the work of the Church can be interpreted as antithetical to the cultural shaping promoted by the powers which brought it to Africa. The liturgical services at St. Peter’s are actually the product of two distinct inculturations. The first is the adaptation of the European church to the cultures of the sub-Saharan countries. The second is the combination of the diverse sub-Saharan cultures integrated with French traditions and contextualized within a Muslim-majority country. 
The cathedral’s sub-Saharan soul is on full display during the Holy Mass on Sunday morning. The almost entirely West African congregation stands up for an Afrobeat-like Gloria hymn, sung in French by the cathedral choir. The singers, all sub-Saharan, perform in white and blue robes while dancing and accompanying themselves with small percussion instruments. The service, in French, is led by Spanish Archbishop Lopez Romero. After the offertory hymn, sung in Lingala (a Bantu language mainly spoken in the DR Congo), the choir sings the traditional hymns of Sanctus and the Agnus Dei in Latin.  The powerful message of intercultural dialogue and communality, however, does not simply lay in the linguistic diversity: it is the context that makes the difference. The fact Europeans and sub-Saharans sing prayers together in each other’s native languages in a country where both communities are foreign is a proof of the unifying power of religion, a power that breaks cultural boundaries.
 It is not surprising that no Moroccans are part of this community. Although the state guarantees to everyone the freedom to “practice his religious affairs,” reports of Moroccans who converted to Christianity include stories of social harassment, ostracism by family, and employment discrimination.  For this reason, the Catholic Church avoids all forms of proselitism and does not baptize local Moroccans. Explaining the position of the archdiocese on the question, Lopez Romero said: “It’s a matter of priorities: ours is building the Kingdom of God (peace, justice, freedom, truth, life, love…). Baptizing Muslims here would put them in a very difficult situation, due to the social pressure and the rejection they would have to undergo. If someone feels a strong need to be baptised, it is always possible for him or her to go to another country and receive the First Sacrament [baptism] there.” As the archbishop confirmed, the Catholic Church has a good relationship with the Moroccan government. “The only Christians having problems with the law here are those who proselytize,” he pointed out. According to Article 220 of the Moroccan Penal Code, anyone who “employs enticements to undermine the faith” of Muslims or converts them to another faith could be imprisoned for up to 3 years. Lopez Romero went on: “The Catholic Church is not here with the aim of ‘recruiting’ new faithful. As I said before, our mission is building the Kingdom of God. To be able to do this, here like in any other part of the world, we contribute to the common good, fighting against poverty, violence, and discrimination. We aim to help everyone live their lives with dignity as children of God, which is what we all are. “In order to achieve these goals in Morocco, we are working on projects geared towards the education of younger generations, the emancipation of women, the abolition of child labor, and the integration of ethnic and religious minorities.” In an interview with MWN, Jean-Baptiste Gnahoua, an Ivorian member of the cathedral choir and coordinator of the local migrants’ association, spoke of how the church facilitates the integration of sub-Saharans in Morocco “The contribution of the church to our integration is, first of all, inspired by the words of the Gospel: tolerance, understanding, and respect of the neighbor.” He added, “The Catholic Church hears our voices, and helps us by putting us in contact with NGOs, such as Caritas [and others], which are committed to solve social, juridical, and cultural issues that affect minorities.”  Jean-Baptiste concluded, “Having difficulties integrating often leads to unemployment. The problem of unemployment affecting sub-Saharans, however, is not only due to racism, as it is often the consequence of complications with the bureaucratic regularization of the immigrants. Nevertheless, although things have improved in general, the cultural barrier between us and the locals is still a major obstacle to our integration.” Since a large number of sub-Saharans living in Morocco profess the Christian faith, the cultural barrier owes much to religious differences too. In addition to contributing to the acceptance of Christians, interreligious dialogue is a potential catalyst to the intercultural dialogue between sub-Saharans and Moroccans. The archbishop stressed the primary role which interreligious dialogue has within the mission of the Catholic Church in Morocco. “We need to sensitize all society,” he said, “to the fact that Christians and Muslims are not like Pepsi and CocaCola: we are not competitors fighting over supremacy; we are fellow believers, faithful brothers and sisters praying together for peace.”

Rabat – The head of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, has reiterated Morocco’s determination to bid to host the 2030 World Cup. During the general assembly of the federation on Saturday, Lekjaa said that Morocco has opened a new page with the head of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, following tension over the “unexplainable interference of FIFA’s administration” in the 2026 World Cup bidding process. He added that this new page is the fruit of Infantino’s recent visit to Morocco for the Throne Day ceremony on July 31. King Mohammed VI welcomed Infantino during the ceremony. Tension between Infantino and Morocco reached unprecedented levels this summer with many Moroccans accusing Infantino of seeking to sabotage Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup in favor of its North American rival (Canada, the US, Mexico). United 2026 won the right to host the World Cup on June 14 after securing 67 percent of the vote. Immediately after the vote, Morocco announced its determination to bid for the 2030 World Cup. It is still unclear whether Morocco will submit a solo bid or a joint bid with another neighboring country. Many speculate that Morocco is set to collaborate with Spain to host the massive tournament. Local media do not rule out the idea of a Maghreb bid, bringing together Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. The 2030 bid will be Morocco’s sixth attempt to convince FIFA of its ability to host the sport’s most celebrated tournament. Prior to his statements in the FRMF general assembly, Lekjaa said that there is no doubt that Morocco will compete to host the 2030 World Cup. However, the country has not yet decided on “co-hosts.” “The decision will be politically decided,” said Lekjaa when asked whether Morocco would present a joint bid with Algeria and Tunisia.

By Vera Sordini Rabat – Just around 60 kilometers west of Fez and 5 kilometers away from the Amazigh (Berber) and Roman remains of Volubilis, embedded in green hills and surrounded by olive groves and cacti, lies the town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun, Morocco’s spiritual capital.   But it’s remarkable history and significance within Moroccan culture is just the beginning of what makes Moulay Idriss a highly interesting tourist destination. Founded by Moulay Idriss I in the late 8th century, this inconspicuous village of 12,000 souls is still highly sacred to Muslims. In fact, thousands of Moroccans pilgrimage to Moulay Idriss each year commemorating its founder and his piety. Interestingly, until 2005 non-Muslims were not allowed to stay overnight in Moulay Idriss. The unwritten rule manifested in the lack of public lodging. In recent years, the town’s residents have made efforts to attract more tourists into their town, such as opening several hotels and guesthouses.  Despite the measures and the convenient option of connecting a visit to the town with one to the nearby ruins of Volubilis, Moulay Idriss cannot boast large numbers of visitors. Nevertheless, in recent years tourists seem to have discovered the qualities the town has to offer. Situated on Mount Zerhoun, Moulay Idriss Zerhoun owes its name both to the mountain and to its founder, Moulay Idriss el Akbar, a sixth-generation descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. Today, he enjoys the status as Morocco’s most revered wali (spiritual guide/ protector).   In the late 8th century Moulay Idriss left the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to escape the Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate. He fled all the way to Volubilis in Morocco, where he settled down and spread the religion of Islam by converting the local population.  He is now considered to be the founder and leader of Morocco’s first Islamic dynasty, called the Idrisid dynasty, which he ruled from 788 to 791. After Nekor, Barghawata, and Midrar, it was the fourth Muslim state in Morocco.  Some Moroccans say that poor believers can refrain from undertaking the Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, by making a pilgrimage (or five or six pilgrimages—it depends on who you ask) to Moulay Idriss. In the Arabic Maghreb, these are regarded as a favorable alternative. However, the pilgrimages should take place during the annual festival dedicated to the wali. Each year in August, Morocco witnesses its largest “Moussem,” a religiously-motivated pilgrimage common in the Maghreb and undertaken in honor of a wali. Thousands of faithful Moroccans make the spiritual expedition to Moulay Idriss every year. The pilgrim’s specific destination is Moulay Idriss’ tomb, the town’s core. As the mausoleum is a sacred place, non-Muslims are not granted access. For centuries, Moulay Idriss has succeeded in secluding itself from the outer, non-Muslim world. The ban on non-Muslim tourists staying overnight, which lasted until 2005, surely contributed. King Mohammed VI loosened the ban by decreeing that all visitors could enter the holy town. The move came within the scope of the King’s Western-Moroccan friendship plan and aimed to make Moulay Idriss better known in the Western world. Considering the popularity the town enjoys among Moroccans, it is curious that Moulay Idriss has remained largely isolated for so long and that a more liberal approach towards tourism did not happen earlier.  The fact that non-Muslim tourists were only allowed so recently helped to preserve the town’s charm. This is one of the advantages Moulay Idriss now offers to tourists.  Although the town is currently witnessing an increase of foreign visitors, who often also stay overnight at one of the many newly founded accommodations, the number of visitors is nonetheless still not overwhelming. Its remote position away from the major tourist hubs allows visitors to see Moroccan life undistorted by Western or other foreign influences. But one must walk through the streets of this small and yet so graceful Moroccan town in order to understand what makes Moulay Idriss so special.

Rabat- The EU Parliament has once again shortlisted Hirak activist Nasser Zefzafi for the Sakharov Prize. Zefzafi has been shortlisted among five other individual candidates from Germany, Syria, the US, Ukraine, and Canada. Also on the list are a group focusing on Afrikaaner rights in South Africa and NGOs saving refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean. Established in 1988 in honor of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought honors individuals and groups of people who have dedicated their lives to the defense of human rights and freedom of thought. The EU Parliament’s Group of the United Left nominated Zefzafi in hopes that the nomination would “raise the profile” of the Hirak case and “the demands of protesters,” as leftist MP Marie-Christine Vergiat stated. “With this nomination we want to show our solidarity with the Moroccan people demanding social justice, human rights and dignity … Mr Zefzafi is a spokesperson for the Hirak movement in Morocco’s Rif region. We demand the release of [Hirak] prisoners of conscience,” Vergiat said. The EU Parliament first nominated Zefzafi for the prize in 2017 after his father, Ahmed Zefzafi, toured Europe to campaign for his release. Moroccan authorities arrested Zefzai more than a year ago, and a court sentenced him to 20 years in prison on June 26, a sentence he is appealing, Ahmed Zefzafi spoke at the European Parliament to advance the cause of the Hirak Rif and raise awareness of the conditions of his son and others arrested with him. The parliamentary deputy promised Zefzafi’s father then that he would receive his son Nasser immediately after his release. In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak Rif activists. Zefzafi and three other activists received 20 years in prison for their participation in “unauthorized” protests. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.  The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the protests in 2016 and 2017. Following the ruling of the Casablanca court, hundreds of Moroccans rallied in protests in cities across the country, including Casablanca, Rabat, and the northern city of Nador, to denounce the “heavy” sentences. International NGOs and politicians, including Head of Government El Othmani, expressed solidarity with the activists. El Othmani regretted that his government could not intervene in the Hirak Rif case, because the judiciary is an independent authority. King Mohammed VI pardoned 184 Hirak prisoners on the eve of Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice), August 21. Nasser Zefzafi was not one of the pardoned activists. The Hirak case made international headlines and captured the attention of world leaders. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok remarked in a press briefing after his April meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita that the Moroccan government “had not been effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.” Blok also presented a report earlier this month to the Dutch Parliament, condemning the Hirak sentences, and commenting on King Mohammed VI’s royal pardon, which excluded Zefzafi. The critical comments led to conflict, and Nasser Bourita rejected, for the second time, the Dutch “interference” in Morocco’s domestic affairs, summoning the Dutch ambassador to Morocco.

The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) is an intergovernmental organization of 43 member states from Europe and the Mediterranean. The organization aims to ensure integration and stability in the Mediterranean region and to support socio-economic development by focusing on strengthening human development and sustainable development.  Maaninou started at UfM as the deputy secretary general for the business development and employment division at the UfM Secretariat in Barcelona, Spain, in July. Since the Mediterranean region has high rates of unemployment, the UfM’s business development and employment division engages in implementing specific projects and initiatives focused on business development, employment opportunities, and skills. Before obtaining the position, Maaninou was head of the economic studies division at Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation since November 2017. Between December 2012 and August 2015, Maaninou held the position of chief operating officer at Al Qudra Holding, a state-owned investment fund based in the United Arab Emirates. In January 2011, King Mohammed VI appointed Maaninou as general inspector at the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Maaninou spent seven years at the Moroccan National Tourism Office (ONMT) as director of operations in Rabat and New York. Maaninou also worked as consultant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and other Moroccan companies. The deputy secretary general holds an MBA degree in hotel engineering from the University of Toulouse in France. He also obtained a degree in management from the renowned Moroccan business school ISCAE in 2005.  Maaninou is not the only Moroccan to have worked in the MfU. Fathallah Sijilmassi was the UfM’s secretary general from March 2012 until March 2018.

Rabat- Customs police at Tangier Med Port have seized 28 kilograms of cannabis from an international transport truck. On Friday morning, police customs officers stopped a Moroccan national attempting to smuggle cannabis resin to Europe. Authorities reported that the drug trafficker concealed the cannabis in the walls of his vehicle.  The culprit was placed in custody under the supervision of Tangier’s public prosecution. Morocco’s war against drug trafficking continues in northern Morocco.  A similar arrest took place in April when customs police in the Tangier port seized 490 kilograms of cannabis. In another operation carried out in the same month, police seized 53 kilograms of cannabis in a shipping truck on its way to Spain. The authorities arrested the truck driver after X-rays revealed drugs concealed behind the vehicle frame and the engine cooling system. On August 25, authorities in the city of Tetouan arrested four suspects for involvement in an international drug trafficking network, seizing 376 kilograms of cannabis. Morocco’s report on the implementation of criminal policy announced in July that authorities recorded 85,000 cases of drug-related crimes in 2017. Drug cases resulted in the arrest of 74,573 suspects in 2012, while 88,179 suspects of drug-related crimes were arrested in 2016. Cannabis resin is one of the most exported drugs from Morocco and has continuously been the subject of seizures in recent years. The demand for the drug in Europe is very high due to its powerful and high-yield hybrid varieties. Morocco is the largest supplier of cannabis resin to Europe, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2014, 302 tons and 85 percent of all cannabis resin seizures in Spain were linked to Morocco. According to the UNODC World Drug Report of 2017, Morocco has the third highest cannabis resin seizures of countries worldwide. The country comes behind Spain and Pakistan.

Rabat– Moroccan social media users have shared a heartwarming photo of a mother carrying her son with amputated legs on her back to school. The photo, which has been circulating online since September 11, tells the story of a mother who shares her son’s dream to pursue his education, despite all of life’s difficulties.

The person who took the photo wrote on his Facebook account that the mother carrying her son Redouane Sahrawi captured his attention as he was heading home from work in Fez. “I asked her where she was going with [her son], she said she carries him to school every day, back and forth,” he said. The mother told him that the boy is in sixth grade, the last primary school year. “It was the most beautiful picture I have ever taken in my life, of a mother who strives for her son’s education, whose dream and hope is to educate her son.” The Facebook user concluded: “It is a moral for anyone who has a healthy body and mind.” Another commenter provided more details about Redouane’s condition in a post with the same photo, writing that Redouane suffered from meningitis when he was in the fourth grade and had both legs amputated.   Many Moroccans who felt inspired by the photo, paid respect to the mother, setting her as a role model for all mothers and promising to provide the child with a wheelchair to make his school days easier.

Rabat- Morocco’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, Omar Hilale, has become vice president of the Humanitarian Affairs Segment of ECOSOC. At the first meeting of the Bureau of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on Tuesday, chaired by the permanent ambassador of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the UN, Inga Rhonda King, the UN elected Hilale as an ECOSOC vice president for 2018-2019. The meeting was attended by the vice presidents of ECOSOC, Ambassador Tore Hattrem of Norway and Ambassador Teodoro Lopez Locsin Junior of the Philippines. The humanitarian affairs segment is a platform that “brings together UN Member States, UN organizations, humanitarian and development partners, the private sector and affected communities,” states the UN. Hilale’s election enhances Morocco’s role in humanitarian action and recognizes Morocco’s dedication to help those experiencing conflict or natural disasters.  Established in 1998, the segment has been in charge of all meetings and discussions of ECOSOC related to humanitarian issues. It has “affected people and other actors from a range of geographic groups on current humanitarian challenges.” The segment provides an opportunity to discuss the activities and issues of strengthening “the coordination of the humanitarian assistance of the United Nations.” The humanitarian segment meets annually in May and June, between Geneva and New York, to discuss ways to tackle the most urgent humanitarian issues. This year’s session, themed “Restoring humanity, respecting human dignity and leaving no one behind: working together to reduce people’s humanitarian need, risk and vulnerability,” took place June 19-21 in New York. According to Maghreb Arab Press, the 2019 session will meet in Geneva and will be marked by the adoption of the annual ECOSOC resolution on humanitarian aid, mainly for refugees. In May and June, King Mohammed VI sent 113 tons of aid for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Al Quds (Jerusalem), following the Gazan tragedy during protests against the US embassy move to Jerusalem. The food aid contained essential products and 5,000 blankets. Morocco’s army also built a field hospital in the Gaza Strip to serve Palestinian victims of the violence as well as the general population. The hospital is equipped to handle vascular surgery, abdominal surgery, pediatrics, traumatology, ENT, ophthalmology, and other medical needs. The field hospital has  97 staff, including 13 doctors and 21 nurses. A total of 25 tons of medicine were to be sent to enhance the hospital’s services. The operation was a symbol of the historical and humanitarian solidarity of King Mohammed V towards Palestinians.

DMG will provide Soluna with “hardware procurement, data center design, mining setup, remote hardware, and systems monitoring … in addition to all necessary support services,” Business Wire wrote. “I’m confident that our proven expertise in managing, operating, and developing end-to-end digital solutions for the blockchain ecosystem will complement Soluna’s unique approach,” said Dan Reitzik, founder and CEO of DMG. Wind, solar farms energy could increase desert rainfall, vegetation Researchers have found that solar and wind farms could actually bring rainfall and vegetation back to the Sahara Desert. A group of scientists from the University of Maryland (UMD) conducted climate and vegetation model experiments to study the effects of solar and wind farms. “Our model results show that large-scale solar and wind farms in the Sahara would more than double the precipitation in the Sahara, and the most substantial increase occurs in the Sahel, where the magnitude of rainfall increase is between ~200 and ~500 mm per year,” said Yan Li, a lead author of the paper. “As a result, vegetation cover fraction increases by about 20 percent,” he added. Safa Motesharrei, a UMD systems scientist and a lead author of the paper, stated that their model predicted that precipitation increases would result in “substantial improvements of rainfed agriculture in the region” while vegetation increase “would lead to the growth in production of livestock.” The study mentioned Morocco as one of the countries which has launched renewable energy projects in the region. “Solar and wind power projects in Africa and the Middle East are already underway, from Morocco to Dubai to Ethiopia, including over 200 GW of solar power planned by 2030,” said co-author Jorge Rivas. Large-scale renewable energy farms in the Sahara desert could provide enough energy to replace the fossil fuel energy used in the region for the short and long term. According to the study, such renewable energy farms would substantially reduce human-generated greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Speaking about climate change at the UN headquarters in New York on September 10, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recognized Morocco’s contribution in the rise of renewable energy in the world. “Morocco is building a solar farm the size of Paris that will power more than one million homes by 2020 with clean, affordable energy,” Guterres said.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Press Union has strongly condemned the leaking of screenshots allegedly taken from the videos seized in the Bouachrine case. A number of Moroccan local news outlets shared a set of leaked screenshots allegedly captured from the videos seized in the arrest of journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, who faces charges of sexual assault. Some of the pictures show what appears to be Bouachrine with women in his office. In response, Morocco’s Press Union shared a statement today to condemn the leak and the sharing of the pictures online. The union wrote that the “protection of human dignity, whether accused or victimized, is a right safeguarded by law.” The union added that it is the responsibility of the press to ensure protection for journalistic principles and to raise awareness among citizens. The statement also said that sharing the pictures of a sexual nature and leaked documents from the report, which was prepared by the National Gendarmerie Laboratory, “violates” the dignity of both the victims and the accusers. The publication of the extracts, according to the statement, is a “contempt for all parties” concerned, which undermines “the essence of the principles of ethics of the profession of the press.” The National Union of Moroccan Press, therefore, emphasized that the press should be primarily concerned “with protecting the ethics and dignity of the people.” The statement also slammed the news outlets which shared the photos, stating that the press is not made for “profit.” Bouachrine is still awaiting trial. He was arrested in February after several women filed complaints against him. Among the charges Bouachrine faces are sexual assault, human trafficking, rape, and attempted rape. On September 10, the National Gendarmerie Laboratory submitted a report on the videos allegedly showing Bouachrine engaged in sexual acts. The review of the videos was submitted the same day, when Bouachrine appeared before the judge. A lawyer of the complainants told local media after Bouachrine’s previous hearing that the videos “are not fake,” according to the experts who analyzed them. Bouachrine is the director of Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper and Al Yaoum24. Police arrested the journalist at the headquarters of the newspaper.

Rabat – Japan-based tea company Maruzen Tea has invested in Morocco to trade its tea in European and American markets. According to Japanese news outlet Mainichi, the company has become the first Japanese company to invest in Morocco to produce tea with a local entreprise. The news outlet added that the company has invested 20 percent of the founding capital for a joint venture with a local firm, Maruzen Tea Morocco (SARL). The company has launched preparations to construct a factory. The plant will be ready for a trial run in November. Quoted by Mainichi, the chairman of Maruzen said, “Not many people overseas know tea is a staple product of Japan. I want to improve the awareness of Japanese tea by establishing a presence in Morocco.” The objective of the project is to broaden the export route from Shizuoka, a city on the south coast of Japan. The choice of Morocco was not made randomly as the North African country represents for the Japanese firm an international hub for tea coming from Kenya and other countries. The project received support from the Shizuoka Prefectural Government as it serves as a means to promote Japanese goods internationally, according to Mainichi.

Rabat- The European Commission has proposed that EU member states be free to decide whether to “permanently apply summer or wintertime.”  The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed at the EU Parliament on Wednesday, September 12, that the continental organization end the seasonal clock change, which Morocco also uses, in 2019. “We all say in soap-box speeches that we want to be big on big things and small on small things. But there is no applause when EU law dictates that Europeans have to change the clocks twice a year,” Juncker said in his statement. “The Commission is today proposing to change this. Clock-changing must stop,” he said, suggesting that member states “should themselves decide whether their citizens live in summer or wintertime.” Juncker has said that the proposed change would be implemented on Sunday, March 31, 2019, as the last mandatory change to summer time. Then, it would be up to the member states who wish to permanently switch back to wintertime to do so on Sunday, 27 October, 2019. Changes would not be possible from then on. For a “smooth transition,” the proposal suggests that member states should announce their decisions by April 2019.  European Commissioner for Transport Violeta Bulc said that “this very ambitious timetable will allow citizens to reap the benefits without delay. We are now inviting Member States and businesses to make the necessary preparations to ensure a coordinated approach across the EU.” Juncker’s proposal strives to ensure that changes are coordinated between neighboring countries to avoid “fragmentation” and “safeguard the proper functioning of the internal market” which could arise if some member states kept Daylight Saving Time while others abolished it. The EU Commission’s proposal will pass through the European Parliament and the Council for their agreement, the EU said in a press release on Wednesday. Several member countries urged the EU to consider abolishing Daylight Saving Time, and many people across the world have signed petitions against Daylight Saving Time (DST).  A recent survey in the EU showed that 76 percent of people who participated in the study believed that DST is “negative.” The survey included 4.6 million participants and was conducted between July 4 and August 16. Three million of the participants were from Germany. Daylight Saving Time is also opposed in Morocco. In 2017, a group of activists launched a petition urging the government and the Parliamentary Council to abolish the biannual time change and maintain Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The signatories wanted the government to issue a law indefinitely suspending Daylight Saving Time in Morocco. They deemed remaining on GMT “appropriate with the country’s geographical location throughout the year.” Daylight Saving Time was first adopted during the first World War in the UK to give factories more daylight hours in which to operate, thereby aiding the war. According to the EU commission, abolishing DST will bring many positive changes to people and their business lives. “Citizens will no longer have to worry about adjusting their clocks. The changes were a source of confusion, as it is not self-evident when, and in which direction, the clocks should be changed,” the commission asserted. DST also represents a threat to health reflected in increased road accidents during time changes and lack of energy. The commission explains: “With an end to this system, the human body will also no longer have to adapt to the change in time.” Abolishing DST will also make planning easier in the energy and transport sectors, especially for overnight trains, says the commission. It will “simplify time-based applications. Despite having been one of the main drivers of the current arrangements, evidence suggests that today overall energy savings from changing the clocks are limited.”

Rabat – French fish canner Chancerelle will open a second €4 million plant in Laayoune, southern Morocco, for its Connetable sardine brand. The plant covers an area of 4,000 square meters and would employ 100 people, reported the French outlet Les Echos Wednesday, September 12. The French Chancerelle company, known by its main brand Connetable, has settled in the port of Agadir, Morocco, since 2009. The company’s plant in Agadir accounts for 15% of its turnover for exports. “This site will allow us to transform sardines as soon as the boats dock to maintain the cold chain and control their quality as quickly as possible,” said Chancerelle’s CEO Jean-François Hug. The process will consist of cleaning, eviscerating, and placing sardines in ice before transporting them by truck to the Chancerelle cannery in Agadir, according to the French outlet. Some 30 Moroccan fishing trawlers signed agreements with the French company to provide it with sardines. Chancerelle will provide trawlers ice necessary for the conservation of fish on board. Nearly half of the sardines processed and canned by Chancerelle are processed in its factory in Agadir, named Belma, which has more than 1,000 employees, added the French outlet. The company generated a turnover of €145 million in 2017 and 150 million manufactured boxes. According to Hug, Chancerelle hopes “to become the favorite brand of French canned fish” in 2018. To reach the goal, Chancerelle invested €3 million in 2017 and €6 million in 2018. The cannery has put in place a corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy, which now allows it to recover 90 percent of its waste. In addition to Chancerelle’s main production of sardines, the canning company also processes mackerel, cod liver, and tuna.

Rabat – The family of jailed journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, who faces charges of sexual assault, have allegedly fired British lawyer Rodney Dixon. Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported on Friday that Bouachrine’s family dismissed the lawyer, who had not made any progress in the case for three months. Other local news outlets also reported that another foreign lawyer of Bouachrine’s, Rachel Linden, disappeared at a critical time when an expert committee handed its report on the videos allegedly seized during the arrest of the journalist. The videos allegedly contain evidence of Bouachrine’s sexual misconduct. The journalist is facing charges of rape, violence, and human trafficking. Dixon had appealed to the international community in June to intervene in Morocco’s alleged disregard for Bouachrine’s most basic rights. Dixon had also accused the Moroccan judicial system of carrying out the desire of “some powerful people” in high offices who were nervous about Bouachrine’s reputation for objective investigative journalism. In response, a judiciary source closely following the case said such comments are “surprising and shocking” as they come from a lawyer who should know how an “ordinary criminal case” works.  The source sent Morocco World News a “detailed account of the due process regarding criminal arrest in Moroccan law” to “show that Moroccan authorities have never violated Bouachrine’s rights.” The source added that Dixon’s statement “is surprising and full of inaccuracies and lies.” Bouachrine is expected to appear before the court today again as his latest trial was postponed on September 10. The National Gendarmerie laboratory has submitted its results and analysis on the videos, allegedly of Bouachrine engaged in sexual acts. Police seized the videos during his arrest in February. Bouachrine is the director of Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper and Al Yaoum 24. Police arrested the journalist at the headquarters of the newspaper. Mohamed Kerrout, a lawyer for the complainants, claimed that the videos were not faked. The lawyer said that the experts found that “Bouachrine is involved in the crimes of which he is accused.” Today, a number of local news outlets shared leaked screenshots allegedly captured from the videos.  Some of the pictures show what appears to be Bouachrine with women in his office. Bouachrine is facing several charges, including the exploitation of people in need, and the abuse of power for sexual purposes—complaints brought by his coworkers.  The journalist is also suspected of other crimes, including violent rape and attempted rape.

By Stephanie Willman Bordat and Saida Kouzzi Rabat – The long-awaited Law 103-13 on the elimination of violence against women in Morocco went into effect this week.   Despite more than twelve years of diverse governmental and civil society efforts, the analyses from legal experts, international human rights mechanisms, and Moroccan NGOs have detailed the numerous shortcomings and deficiencies in the content of Law 103-13. Now that the law has been enacted, it is crucial to reflect on the reasons why the law falls short of basic human rights standards, and why it failed to incorporate the substantial input and propositions made by Moroccan civil society for improvements.  While some may point the finger at the Ministry of Family, Solidarity, Equality and Social Development, responsible for preparing the original Draft Law 103-13, it is important to not forget the other key actor in the legislative process – the Moroccan Parliament.   One of the legislative functions of the elected Parliamentary representatives – the deputies and the councilors – is to make amendments to Draft Laws (Article 83 of the Constitution).  Despite this, the House of Representatives only made some 28 minor amendments to the Draft Law before voting on it in July 2016, with only ¼ of the representatives present for the plenary vote.   After 18 months, the House of Councilors then passed Law 103-13 in plenary on January 30, 2018, with a quasi-absence of amendments to the Draft Law and only 1/3 of the councilors present for the vote. The Constitution ensures the rights of NGOs to contribute to the elaboration, implementation and evaluation of decisions and projects of elected institutions and public authorities, and of citizens to submit motions in legislative matters (Articles 12, 13 and 14). In the two years from when the Draft Law was submitted to Parliament for review in March 2016 to when it was passed in February 2018, women’s groups from diverse regions across the country, from large cities to small villages, conducted legislative advocacy directly to representatives in both houses of Parliament for much-needed amendments to the Draft Law.  According to the findings from our recent initial online survey of NGOs and activists across the country about their experiences, much work remains to be done to create true citizen-centered advocacy and transparency and accountability among representatives to the constituents that elected them. Although local women’s groups used a variety of communication forms to contact parliamentarians, including Facebook, phone calls, e-mails, letters, text messages and WhatsApp, 50% of respondents reported that they did not receive a response from parliamentarians they contacted.  Likewise, respondents expressed their opinions that the parliamentarians were seldom to not at all available (67%), and that they were not very or not at all receptive to issues of violence against women (62.5%). Women’s groups conducting direct legislative advocacy faced numerous barriers in their efforts to contact elected representatives.   83.3% of respondents reported that it was not easy or not at all easy to obtain the contact information for parliamentarians, relying primarily on ad hoc efforts to obtain such information through personal contacts.  In the absence of official, publically available contact information, women’s groups had to patch together themselves an incomplete contact list of representatives in a Shared One Drive document. 62.5% NGOs reported that it was not easy or not at all easy to obtain information on the steps in the legislative process, or of the timing of the reviews and votes on the Draft Law to follow it.  The parliamentary websites were often not updated in a timely manner for NGOs to be able to intervene effectively and efficiently, and consistent information from the parliamentarians themselves was often not forthcoming. Following the final votes on the law, NGOs also reported their inability to follow up on and hold the elected representatives accountable for their behavior, due to the unavailability of information on which representatives were absent for the vote, or on how individual members present voted.   The complete survey report is available online in Arabic here, in French here, and in English here.  These deficiencies illustrate the need for several measures to improve the accountability and responsiveness of elected representatives, and to promote real citizen-centered advocacy for the future, including: The lack of responsiveness to citizen input on Draft Law 103-13 is problematic for two reasons.  First, it prevented the law from reflecting the complex realities of violence against women on the ground, which will limit the law’s ultimate effectiveness.  Second, it risks fostering a lack of faith in elected institutions among civil society and the broader population, a dangerous sentiment to encourage indeed.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Industry and Trade has announced it dismantled another workshop producing banned plastic bags near Casablanca. A control commission dismantled the workshop on September 5, seizing 89 kilograms of plastic waste, 65 kilograms of crushed plastic, 167 kilograms of raw material (polyethylene), and 163 kilograms of completed plastic bags. The workshop was located in the rural village of Douar Ouled Moumen, in Benslimane (50 kilometers from Casablanca), reported the ministry on Thursday, September 13. Authorities closed the factory and confiscated all of its materials used to manufacture the banned plastic bags. The announcement is in line with a recent call by the president of the prosecutor general’s office, Mohamed Abdennabaoui, for royal prosecutors and public prosecutors to accelerate the fight against the illegal manufacturing and use of plastic bags. Authorities have repeatedly warned of the dangers plastic bags pose to the environment.  Despite the ban on plastic bag production in Morocco, some small factories have continued to produce them, two years after the adoption of Law 77-15 against plastic bags. The law made Morocco one of the first countries in Africa to impose a ban on plastic bags. In March, authorities seized nearly 2.96 tons of banned plastic bags intended for sale in a warehouse in Tangier. In July, a control commission closed a secret workshop manufacturing plastic bags in Douar Oulad Ben Omar, Oulad Ziane, near Casablanca. According to a review of control and support operations published by online outlet Medias24 in July, the Ministry of Industry recorded 3,826 offenses among 682,467 inspections it carried out. Approximately MAD 5 billion in fines was imposed in 757 judgments. More than 750 tons of plastic bags were seized in workshops and outlets, and more than 89 tons were collected at border inspection posts.

Rabat – In the midst of rising tensions, the PPS and PJD secretaries general met again to discuss relations between the parties and Morocco’s political situation. After repeated threats to withdraw from the government coalition, Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) Secretary-General Nabil Benabdellah received the head of government and secretary-general of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Saad Eddine El Othmani, yesterday. In a visit at Benabdellah’s house, both officials talked about their parties’ relations. PPS shared pictures of the meeting yesterday on Facebook, describing the gathering as “friendly.” Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid, a member of the PJD, also attended the meeting. The officials also posed for pictures. Tension between the two parties grew in August, when a press release from the Royal Cabinet announced the removal of the Secretariat of State in Charge of Water, run by PPS member Charafat Afilal. Following the decision, which came at the proposal of El Othmani, PPS expressed anger and pledged to withdraw from the government’s ruling coalition. PJD then shared a statement to announce the meeting on September 13. In the statement, PJD said that the party had already announced its determination to maintain the coalition with PPS. The statement also said that the meeting was to evaluate political and social reforms and “prospects for cooperation and partnership between the two parties.” In a statement to Le360 after yesterday’s meeting, Benabdellah expressed satisfaction. He added that he would inform the political office of his party of the content of the meeting.

Yesterday’s meeting was the second between the two parties over the crisis. The parties previously held an emergency meeting to discuss the move and find a solution to the rising conflict. Benabdellah told Le360 after the meeting that he talked with PJD officials for one hour. The socialist PPS and the ruling Islamist PJD party have been in a ruling coalition since 2011, following Morocco’s constitutional reforms when PJD won the majority of votes in the Parliament. The two parties have been good allies despite their different political visions.

Rabat –  Of the 14.7 million Jews in the world, 2,000 Jews live in Morocco and 8,500 in Iran. The Jewish Agency unveiled statistics of the world’s Jewish population on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, literally the “head of the new year,” celebrated on September 9. A total of 6.6 million Jews live in Israel, while 8.1 million live outside Israel. According to Haaretz, the statistics were calculated by Sergio Della Pergola, an Israeli expert on Jewish demography. The number of Jewish people allowed to immigrate back to Israel under the country’s Law of Return, which includes all children and grandchildren of Jews, is estimated at 23.5 million. Of the 8.1 million Jews who live outside Israel, 27,000 live in Arab and Persian countries. Morocco and Iran have the most, with 2,000 Jews and 8,500 respectively. However, some sources, such as the CIA World Factbook, put Morocco’s population of Jews at 6,000 as recently as 2010. Tunisia has 1,000, while fewer than 500 Jews live in each of Yemen, Syria, and Egypt. The US has 5.7 million of Jews, the most of any other country but Israel. The second largest Jewish population outside Israel is France with 453;000, followed by Canada with 391,000. Britain has  290,000 Jews, Argentina 180,000, Russia 172,000, Australia 113,000, Brazil 93,000, and South Africa 69,000. The Jewish Agency also announced that at least 100 Jews live in a total of 98 countries in the world. In the second International Conference on Intercultural and Interfaith Dialogue held on September 10-12 in Fez, King Mohammed VI spoke about interfaith issues in Morocco.  The King said that the choice of Fez to host the event is not a random choice as it “has always been a land of dialogue, peace, coexistence and spiritual fulfilment.” The King also lauded Morocco’s hospitality, emphasizing that Morocco has a unique model in the region. “Indeed, our history attests to a long-established tradition of coexistence on Moroccan soil—particularly between Muslims and Jews—and to openness to other religions,” said the monarch. The World Jewish Congress reported in February 2018 that Morocco has the “largest remaining Jewish community in North Africa.” Morocco has hosted Jewish communities since Roman days. After the Spanish Edict of Expulsion in 1492, some 20,000 Jews emigrated from Granada to Morocco. At their peak before Israel became a state in 1948, Jews in Morocco numbered over 200,000. Between Israel’s independence and Morocco’s in 1956, most of Morocco’s Jews emigrated from Morocco to Israel, Canada, and France.

Rabat- The European commissioner for enlargement and European neighborhood policy is visiting Morocco to reinforce the partnership between the country and the EU. Hahn is meeting with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, and Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun today in Rabat. The visit is an opportunity to enhance the EU-Morocco partnership in several spheres, and “review the EU’s commitment to support Morocco’s development programs,” the state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press quoted Hahn. According to Hahn, Morocco is a “major strategic partner in North Africa and the whole continent” for the European Union.  Hahn emphasized: “The two partners share many challenges and opportunities and it is important to explore together ways and means to move forward in this relation.” Hahn pledged to sign an EU-funded program to back small and medium-sized enterprises in Morocco as a token of the EU’s commitment to help with the development of Morocco. Morocco and the European Union share solid political and economic ties, represented in bilateral cooperation on migration, business opportunities, agriculture and fisheries. The EU allocated €807 million between 2014 and 2017 to assist in Morocco’s “equitable access to social services, democratic governance, the rule of law and mobility, as well as employability and sustainable and inclusive growth,” states the EU. In July, the EU commission allocated €90 million in extra funds to the EU Trust Fund for Africa, dedicated to three migration-related programs for North Africa to strengthen border management and protection of migrants in the region. One of these programs, which is worth €55 million, is dedicated to border management for Morocco and Tunisia.  It will support the efforts of national institutions in both countries to save lives at sea, improve maritime border management, and combat smugglers operating in the region, the European Commission said in a press release.

Rabat – The Melilla social welfare minister has announced that 86 unaccompanied minors crossed the Moroccan border to the Spanish enclave of Melilla. According to Europa Press, Melilla’s Minister of Social Welfare Daniel Ventura said on Wednesday that the number of minor migrants who managed bypass border controls and enter Melilla through the land border was 20.  Another 15 minors entered with Moroccan identification. The group includes children who arrived with a relative or another individual. Ventura also reported that five minors were smuggled in inside vehicles and trucks. Four others reached Melilla by swimming over from the Moroccan side, added Europa Press. Every day, migrants take risks to try to break into the Eldorado. Earlier this week, Spanish authorities caught two Moroccan migrants hiding inside the engine compartment of a tourist bus shortly after it had disembarked the ferry from Morocco. A video of their discovery went viral on the internet. Another video which made news headlines showed a Moroccan trying to get to Spain by hand-paddling his way across the Mediterranean  Sea on a tube. Both Spain and Morocco pledge determination to reinforce border security cooperation. Europa Press reported yesterday that two Spanish senior officials in charge of migration and security will visit Morocco Friday to reinforce “collaboration on migration.” The two Spanish secretaries of state, Ana Botella and Consuelo Rumi, will hold a meeting with Morocco’s migration and border surveillance manager, Khalid Zerouali. The meeting will take place in Essaouira, a coastal city north of Agadir, convening delegations from Spanish and Moroccan ministries of foreign affairs. Quoting the International Organization for Migration, the local news outlet reported that over 3,100 migrants have entered the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla by land since the start of 2018. The news outlet added that 25,000 others have landed in Spain by sea. Over 100 sub-Saharan migrants forced their way into Ceuta on August 22. The forced entry came after more than 600 migrants stormed Ceuta on July 26, the biggest successful storming since February 2017. Last Thursday, Morocco’s government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, reiterated that the North African country stands firm against human trafficking networks. “Morocco has taken another step of transferring migrants to other cities, and this is not a deportation operation outside the national territory.” He also estimated the number of foiled undocumented migration attempts at 65,000 in 2017.

By António Guterres Rabat – Since the shock of former United Nations’ Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s death, I have been reflecting on what made him so special. To my mind, it is simply this:  Kofi Annan was both one-of-a-kind and one of us.  He was an exceptional global leader — and he was also someone virtually anyone in the world could see themselves in: those on the far reaches of poverty, conflict and despair who found in him an ally; the junior UN staffer following in his footsteps; the young person to whom he said until his dying breath “always remember, you are never too young to lead — and we are never too old to learn.” Like few in our time, Kofi Annan could bring people together, put them at ease, and unite them towards a common goal for our common humanity.  There is an old joke: The art of diplomacy is to say nothing especially when you are speaking!  Kofi Annan could say everything, sometimes without uttering a word.  It came from the dignity and the moral conviction and the humanity that was so deep in him. He had that gentle voice, that lilt that made people smile and think of music. But his words were tough and wise. And sometimes the graver a situation, the lower that voice would get.  We would lean in to listen. And the world would lean in. And we were rewarded by his wisdom. Kofi Annan was courageous, speaking truth to power while subjecting himself to intense self-scrutiny.  And like his predecessor as UN Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, he had an almost mystical sense of the role of the United Nations as a force for good in a world of ills. All of this added up to a remarkable record of achievement. He pioneered new ideas and initiatives, including the Millennium Development Goals and the landmark reforms in his report, “In Larger Freedom”.  He opened the doors of the United Nations, bringing the Organization closer to the world’s people and engaging new partners in protecting the environment, defending human rights and combating HIV/AIDS and other killer diseases.  Kofi Annan was the United Nations and the United Nations was him. He was also my good friend.  We marched through life together in many ways. When the people of Timor-Leste were seeking self-determination, we worked together — he from the United Nations, and I as Prime Minister of Portugal — to support the peaceful resolution of their plight. When the UN Refugee Agency needed new leadership, Kofi blessed me with his trust in asking me to fill that role – and then provided unwavering support to protect and shelter the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.  Now that I occupy the office Kofi once held, I am continually inspired by his integrity, dynamism and dedication. To him, indifference was the world’s worst poison. Even after finishing his term as Secretary-General, he never stopped battling on the front-lines of diplomacy.  He helped to ease post-election tensions in Kenya, gave his all to find a political solution to the brutal war in Syria and set out a path for ensuring justice and rights for the Rohingya people of Myanmar. Kofi straddled many worlds, North and South, East and West.  But he found his surest anchor in his African roots and identity. The great Nelson Mandela, accustomed to being called Madiba, had his own nickname for Kofi, and called him “my leader”.  This was no jest. Kofi was our leader, too. When I last saw him not long ago at the UN, his bearing was how I will always remember him: calm yet determined, ready to laugh but always filled with the gravity of the work we do. He is gone now and we will miss him immensely. But I am sure of this — if we continue to lean in and listen hard, we will still hear the words and wise counsel of Kofi Annan. “Please carry on,” I hear him saying.  “You know what to do: Take care of each other. Take care of our planet. Recognize the humanity in all people. And support the United Nations — the place where we can all come together to solve problems and build a better future for all”.  Let us continue to heed that voice of grace and reason – that voice of morality and solidarity.  Our world needs it now more than ever. As we face the headwinds of our troubled and turbulent times, let us always be inspired by the legacy of Kofi Annan — and guided by the knowledge that he will continue speaking to us, urging us on towards the goals to which he dedicated his life and truly moved our world. António Guterres is Secretary-General of the United Nations.  Remarks delivered at the funeral of Kofi Annan in Accra, Ghana on September 13, 2018.

By Youssef Agdal Rabat – A Moroccan teacher and Fulbright Teaching Assistant at an American university offers his perspective on how elements of the American educational style can be applied in Morocco to encourage the pursuit of academic excellence. What makes uniquely human is their insatiable mission for improvement. Humans have a desire for problem-solving, collaborating to craft new solutions, and communicating their results. Innate within every human being is the ambition for greater efficiency, flexibility, awareness, artistry, independence, and spirituality. Despite the fact that every individual human being comes to this world endowed with the aforementioned abilities, if not maintained and trained, the abilities may not be fully realized due to the surrounding conditions or psychological constraints. The abilities must be repeatedly stimulated, demonstrated, and boosted in order for them to play their role. Actually, some of the best practitioners are those who find themselves obliged to think about ways to improve the Moroccan education system. These lessons would be best served if applied to the Moroccan education system. There are some difficulties that hinder Moroccan students’ progress, and the American education system has some simple but effective educational practices that enhance the American school. The dysfunction of the education system in Morocco has been scrutinized for decades, although it has always been considered a national priority. No one denies that remarkable progress has been made in terms of legislation, decentralization, and many other areas; however, research shows that the Moroccan education system still has serious problems, according to the Strategic Vision of Reform in Morocco (2015-2030), which was launched by the Higher Council for Education, Training and Scientific Research in 2015. The council listed the problems in a detailed report communicated by the National Assessment Authority in 2014 on the implementation of the National Charter for Education and Training 2000-2013. The list of dysfunctions included poor levels of cohesion between different parts of the system, high drop-out rates, poor language mastery, and low involvement in technology. Some impediments to the success of the Moroccan education system are harder to fix, including infrastructure and equipment budgets, working hours, student numbers, the length of educational programs, and misbehavior. Educators are aware of the necessity of planning appropriately to reform and establish a healthy education system. Through my experience both in Moroccan and American educational settings, I have learned practical tips for teachers and lawmakers that are believed to enhance students’ performance.  The course syllabus is one of the most important elements in education and can be crucial in preparing students for a positive outcome in the class. Every teacher should provide students with a syllabus on the first day of class. The syllabus is a real “contract between professors and their students, designed to answer students’ questions about a course, as well as inform them about what will happen should they fail to meet course expectations.” It is also a “vehicle for expressing accountability and commitment,” according to Oxford English Dictionary. The syllabus gives comprehensive details about the course: course objectives, student learning outcomes, course expectations and policies, assignment descriptions, evaluation processes, resources available to students, the instructor’s contact information and office hours, and the course calendar. Undoubtedly, all Moroccan teachers know how to construct a syllabus, but this important document is rarely shared with their students at the beginning of the semester. Students with the syllabus in hand know exactly what is expected from them and share responsibility for learning. It is essentially a contract between teacher and student as it assures that teachers and students start on the same page. In the words of Sharon Rubin, writing for the Chronicle of Higher Education, “The syllabus is a small place to start bringing students and faculty members back together.” Another aspect that is considered pivotal in the success of the teaching-learning process in the American education system is assessment, and more precisely formative assessment. The term “formative evaluation” was first used in 1967 by Michael Scriven, but it was American educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom who first used the term to distinguish it from the role classroom summative tests play: “Frequent formative evaluation tests pace the learning of students and help motivate them to put forth the necessary effort at the appropriate time.” Bloom resumes: “The appropriate use of these tests helps to ensure that each set of learning tasks is thoroughly mastered before subsequent learning tasks are started.” For instance, it is the responsibility of teachers to give feedback to students during the writing process, rather than only focusing on the final product. Being both a teaching assistant and a student in an American university opened my eyes to “real” formative assessment. This point is frequently discussed by Moroccan colleagues, and many agree that it is not fair to judge a student by the grade they get on the final exam. Final exams are a high-stakes assessment that is summative and not formative. Rather, teachers should assess the process and the efforts students make throughout the course of the semester or year. Students should be given chances to recognize their weaknesses and work on them, and to recognize their strengths and sharpen them. The final exam in one course at Emporia State University is only worth 15 percent of the final grade. The remaining 85 percent is divided into small percentages given to the other components of the course, such as reflections, writings, the final portfolio/project, quizzes, presentations, a mid-term exam, and preparation and class participation. Formative assessment ensures that students are engaged and participate during the whole semester, and it allows teachers to follow students’ progress the entire way. Reading and writing as preparation for class is another key strategy as class is generally a place for discussion, sharing and inquiry. Reading and writing before class improve student learning. The effect of prior reading is greater when the syllabus includes keywords and questions to guide students’ reflection on the material, according to several studies. On a daily or weekly basis, students should read and write reflections or online posts discussing their readings prior to class. The reflections are graded based on the previously provided rubrics and, usually, there is a due date and time. Preparatory reading for in-class discussion and grading increases students’ motivation to prepare for their classes and contributes to further learning. During the classes I took as a graduate student at Emporia State University, my colleagues and I had to put forth extra effort in reading and writing before class because we knew that we would both use our reflections and notes in class discussions and also be graded on them. The accumulation of those grades made a big percentage of the final grade.  In addition, many teachers have also wondered about the limits of students’ freedom inside and outside of class. There is a common misconception that students need to be controlled and directed by their teachers—one that still prevails in Moroccan education. This top-down classroom approach does more harm than good to the teachers and students alike. Such instructors endlessly gesture, advise, admonish, hover, suggest, and so on. These are relatively archaic practices that can actually be detrimental to students. In fact, “over-management causes more misbehavior than it dissuades,” said classroom management expert Michael Linsin. This pedagogical approach suffocates students to the extent that they lose the desire to make choices, solve problems, and explore their world. Students become less motivated and learning loses its joyful and adventurous qualities. Teachers should be courageous enough to challenge their entrenched mindsets and try new pedagogical approaches, despite things “always being done this way.” Teachers should retire the old, often useless, practices in order to establish a healthy environment for learning. Today’s students have different tendencies and preferences, and teachers should find ways to balance the need to guide and “control” students with the students’ ambitions to bring their skills and personality to class and improve them.  In practical terms, students’ freedom will be divided into two main types: performance freedom and basic freedom. The former  includes providing students with choices during class activities and also when doing homework, presentations, projects, and other activities. Students will be more interested in participating and performing when they feel their preferences have been considered and that they have space in the class environment. It is invigorating to have choices. To implement this skill in class, students should be allowed to complete homework and assignments by recording videos, painting, making graphs, building posters, speaking, creating cartoons, or using other “multimodal” formats. On the other hand, the second type of classroom freedom, basic freedom, comprises the daily practices that are also “normal” and “reasonable” outside of class. For example, some people argue that there is no reason why students are forbidden to wear hats in Moroccan classes nor do they understand why both teachers and students can not drink a beverage while discussing a lesson or taking a test. Through my experience in American classes, both as an instructor and graduate student, I noticed that when such trivial elements were allowed in the classroom, students felt relaxed and were increasingly more engaged and productive. Certainly, the Moroccan context is different, and many students, if given more freedom, would not respect the noble objectives of schooling. I believe that gradually allowing such practices,, within reason, will be a positive change that will build trust between the students and school environment. Students would be more relaxed and would therefore show up with their creative and unique ways of engaging in the class. Additionally, the use of technology is now a necessity in our classrooms. Marc Prensky, an American education consultant, names this new generation of high technology usage “digital natives,” noting that “our students today are all ‘native speakers’ of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet.” In addition, all people born before the beginning of the digital era are termed by Prensky as “digital immigrants.” Prensky introduced the terms in a 2001 article in which he affirmed that the contemporary decline in American education is due to the teacher’s failure to analyze and adapt to the needs of modern students, including their use and mastery of technologies. This situation also applies to Moroccan students, of which a great majority are digital natives. Today’s students, regardless of nationality, are more engaged when lessons and discussions are supported by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools. However, a large portion of our teachers are digital immigrants, and they need to work to master integrating technology in their classes. This is an important part of continuous professional development. The Ministry of Education should assume part of the responsibility and organize training sessions for teachers who need training in using ICT in class. Newtechnologies, as well as educational change, have always been connected to hopes for progress in teaching and learning. Once teachers learn how things work, the next step will be to use those tools the way they find appropriate depending on the subjects they teach, their tendencies, and their students’ preferences.  “Office hours” should also be adopted by both lawmakers in the Moroccan Ministry of Education and teachers in general. “Office hours” is a term used for the time professors and teaching assistants set aside outside of class to meet with students. These office hours are held at the same day, time, and location for the duration of the semester. During these hours, students can visit their professors and teaching assistants to discuss course material presented in class or any other related interests they have. They can ask for additional clarification or help, or they can get feedback on their work. Incorporating office hours effectively benefits both the student and the teacher in numerous ways. When teachers are available to students outside of class time, it is a wonderful opportunity for rapport-building and communication, which are important criteria in higher education evaluations. Attending office hours is not mandatory; students are expected to decide for themselves when they need or want to meet with their teachers. Office hours are scheduled to serve students in the first place, but there is no harm if teachers use those times to design lessons, correct students’ work, or write articles if no students come to talk to the teacher. Office hours can be held in person in the teacher’s office or even online via Skype or another method. Making office hours available to students allows them the opportunity to engage one-to-one with their teacher, to receive valuable feedback, and to have questions answered.  Finally, adopting “modeling” as an instructional strategy can make life easy for students, showing them how things work and how a “product” is built. Bert Bredeweg and Kenneth Forbus, education researchers, argue that “qualitative modeling provides a valuable way for students to learn.” Instructors should demonstrate the process by thinking aloud in class and dividing a more complicated task into smaller manageable segments, then start constructing their text, no matter what format it is. Teachers should also encourage students to look at different reliable “models” by asking them to make further research, share videos in class, or organize video conferences with other professors.  These recommended strategies provide a vision for fostering Moroccan teachers and students’ performance. These ingredients will create a nurturing classroom environment for both students and teachers. Implementing them will have a positive impact and assure satisfactory outcomes in the Moroccan education system.

Rabat – Spain and Morocco have only two options now as Portugal is allegedly not interested in a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup hosting rights. Portuguese sports news outlet A Bola reported that hosting a World Cup in 2030 is not part of the country’s plan. Spain and Morocco could now try their chances through solo applications or associate together to clinch the hosting rights for the World Cup. Spain and Morocco allegedly had hoped to present a trio bid with Portugal for the 2030 World Cup as FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that he prefers joint bids in July. Spanish outlet Cadena Se reported that Spain is planning to bid to host the tournament, but it remains to be seen whether Spaniards prefer a joint bid or a solo bid. According to Spanish news outlet AS, a joint bid with Morocco and Portugal is the Royal Spanish Football Federation’s preference. Moroccan media reported in August that Morocco asked Spain and Portugal to organize the tournament together. Royal Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales told EFE in August that there would be more cooperation between Morocco and Spain in terms of sporting events as Tangier hosted the Spanish Super Cup on August 12. The remark opened doors for speculation that both countries were preparing to announce a joint bid to host 2030 World Cup. On September 12, Infantino met Rubiales and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to discuss Spain’s willingness to host the 2028 European Championship. There are also speculations that the officials discussed a potential Spanish bid for the World Cup. While  Royal Moroccan Football Federation President Fouzi Lekjaa said that the country has not decided yet on a joint bid, Algeria and Tunisia welcomed the idea of a joint Maghreb bid. “With the sports infrastructure that was built, Algeria is ready to study a possible joint bid with Morocco and Tunisia for the organization of the World Cup,” Algerian Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Hattab said in July.

Rabat – Journalist and reporter Souad Mekhennet, a German national of Moroccan origin, may add another prize to her collection.  The British Academy nominated Mekhennet for the Al-Rodhan Prize for Global Cultural Understanding for her book “I Was Told to Come Alone: My Journey Behind the Lines of Jihad.”  Worth £25,000, the prize rewards and celebrates the best works of non-fiction that have contributed to global cultural understanding and illuminate the interconnections and divisions that shape cultural identity worldwide. Published in June 2017, “I Was Told to Come Alone” is a memoir where Mekhennet investigates Islamic extremism in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The 368-page memoir discusses the reporter’s personal experience as a Muslim reporter with a bicultural identity. As a Muslim, Mekhennet had access to some of the most wanted members of jihadist groups, including Al Qaeda and ISIS, who had refused to talk to Western reporters. Throwing aside any fears, she was frequently told to “come alone, not to carry any identification” and to “leave her cell phone, audio recorder, watch, and purse at the hotel.” The journalist’s memoir became the Washington Post bestselling book. In her memoir, the journalist gives detailed information about her assignments across the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa, to terrorism and extremist groups, including in Syria and Iraq. Earlier this year, she became the first Arab and Muslim to win the 2018 Ludwig Borne Prize, one of the most esteemed literary prizes in German-speaking countries. Last year, Mekhennet received the 2017 Daniel Pearl Award for Courage and Integrity in Journalism. Mekhennet, the first Muslim to win the Pearl award, was chosen for the same 2017 book.  The Moroccan journalist has worked for internationally renowned media outlets, including The New York Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, The Daily Beast, and German television ZDF. She currently works at The Washington Post. The Al-Rodhan Prize for Global Cultural Understanding “was founded and is generously sponsored by the international relations scholar Dr Nayef Al-Rodhan,” according to the British Academy. It was first awarded in 2013, and this is the first year that a shortlist has been introduced.

The last three winners were Timothy Garton Ash for Free Speech (2017), Professor Carole Hillenbrand for Islam: A New Historical Introduction (2016), and Dr Neil MacGregor for A History of the World in 100 Objects and Germany: Memories of a Nation (2015).

The winner will be announced at an evening ceremony held at the British Academy on Tuesday October 30.

Rabat – Prince Moulay Rachid represented King Mohammed VI today at the funeral of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who died August 18. Annan was buried in his native Ghana after a state funeral attended by world leaders at the Accra International Conference Center. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also attended the funeral. King Mohammed VI sent condolences to the family of the former secretary-general after his death. In his message, the monarch lauded Kofi Annan’s human qualities, saying he proved to be very competent in every diplomatic mission entrusted to him. The King also appreciated the unwavering commitment of Annan to world peace, which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize. Annan died in a hospital in Bern after a short illness, Switzerland. The official was born in Kumasi, Ghana, in 1938. A graduate from the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Annan completed his undergraduate work in the US, studying economics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1961. He also holds a master’s of science degree in management from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Annan served in many UN organizations across the world in the next 30 years: The UN Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa; the UN Emergency Force (UNEF II) in Ismailia, Egypt; and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva.

Rabat- Moroccan social media users have called for a boycott of the Jazz au Chellah festival in Rabat over the alleged killing of cats and dogs. Every year, the “Jazz in the Chellah” festival brings jazz lovers to Rabat’s archaeological landmark, the Chellah. But this year the festival has been caught in a controversy involving the killing of stray cats and dogs in Chellah. Some have alleged that the festival organizers ordered the killing of cats and dogs to “clean” the area from animals with rabies before the festival on September 12-16.  In response, administrators of the festival’s official Facebook page posted a photo of a cat sitting at the entrance of the necropolis, next to the caption: “Cats of the Chellah were the first to attend the first show of the festival’s 23rd version.”  The administrators denied the allegations, calling them “fake news.”    The post was not received well by the festival’s followers who threatened to boycott the festival, arguing if it was not true then “where did all the cats go?” Morocco World News contacted the festival organizers, but they declined to respond. A young animal welfare activist, Hajar Benallal, shared her story with Morocco World News, stating that she received a call from a friend who told her that some individuals put cats in cages and took them away, leaving only one kitten behind. Hajar, who has worked independently for seven years to help feed and neuter cats and dogs in Rabat, said that it should be the responsibility of the municipality to care for the animals. “How can we say it’s a muslim country while people shoot animals that can’t even defend themselves … Since they are born the only thing they know is fear and hunger, and people treat them so badly. I lost so many animals i was taking care of all those year,” she stated. “Instead of killing, shooting and poisoning cats and dogs,” she said, people should sterilize animals because it is “the only way to protect them but also eradicate rabies.” Hajar rues the lack of action from animal welfare organizations in Morocco, stressing that organizations should fight for laws to protect the animals. In addition to the new progressive laws in Morocco, such as the law on violence against women, the law on the protection of domestic employees, and the law against real estate fraud, could there be a law on the protection of animals in the future? Many Moroccans, including animal welfare activists, have repeatedly launched petitions calling for a law that criminalizes cruelty to animals across the country. The latest petition, launched by the Association for Vegetarians in Morocco, asserted: “Denying the average living conditions of animals will not improve those of humans knowing that as much [as] it is … a political case, it’s also a deontological one.” The petition concluded: “We demand immediate enactment of laws protecting animals in Morocco.” The petition was followed by hashtags on Facebook such as #boycott #Chellah, calling for an immediate boycott of the festival. Animal abuse in Morocco is not uncommon. Some of the recent publicized acts of violence took place in April, when dozens of stray dogs were shot in the coastal city of Agadir ahead of the FIFA task force visit to assess Morocco’s eligibility to host the 2026 World Cup. Photos and videos of the “gruesome incident” made international headlines, both shocking and angering people. Animals continue to be vulnerable to acts of violence, and there is not a law that punishes the abuse. It remains to be seen whether Morocco will enact legal punishments for cruelty and inhumanity towards animals.

Rabat – The Justice and Development Party (PJD) plans to hold an extraordinary meeting Saturday to evaluate the party’s progress after seven years in power. The meeting, according to a statement published by the party on Wednesday, August 29, is part of PJD’s preparation for the start of the political session. During the meeting, scheduled for Saturday, September 15, the party will examine its actions in Parliament, “as well as at the internal level related to supervision, training and communication.” Morocco World News contacted PJD to learn about its performance and expectations regarding the next election, but the party declined to answer. Since his appointment as prime minister in 2017, the secretary-general of the party, Saad Eddine El Othmani has been promising that the PJD would increase efforts to combat corruption, education problems, social disparities, and administration management issues. According to international indices and reports on corruption, Morocco has not yet made progress in fighting corruption. International NGO Freedom House said in its 2017 Freedom in the World report that  corruption in Morocco is “rife in state institutions and the economy,” adding that “despite the government’s rhetoric on combating corruption, it has a mixed record on enforcement.” When the PJD came to power in 2011, the Corruption Perception Index ranked Morocco 80th out of 183 countries, with a score of 3.4 out of 10. In 2017, however, the index featured Morocco ranked 81st with 40 points out of 100. King Mohammed VI reminds the cabinet of the irregularities and dysfunctions that hinder the country’s development and draw criticism in every speech he delivers to the nation. In the aftermath of the King’s speech on the anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People on August 20, the head of government renewed his promises, telling the government of the major issues that should be addressed. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in Morocco was $3,151 in 2017, only slightly up from 3,039.92 in 2011 when PJD came to power. Despite the positivity of the government’s economic vision, GDP per capita is practically the same. The unemployment rate has also seen no improvement: the number stood at 9.3 percent in the second quarter of 2018, ever so slightly down from 2011’s unemployment rate of 9.4 percent. The number shows a minimal difference in eight years. The latest reports from Morocco’s Court of Auditors have also contradicted El Othmani’s statements on the economic and social situation. In July, the head of government called on Moroccan citizens to stop “being gloomy and unrealistic” about the Moroccan economy. “Yes, there are problems, but there is no crisis, and the Moroccan economy is in good shape,” El Othmani said in a Parliament session on July 23. However, the recent reports of the Court of Auditors and Bank Al-Maghrib presented to the King on July 29, the eve of Throne Day, presented another story. In his report, Bank Al Maghrib Governor Abdellatif Jouahri emphasized that despite growth in the domestic economy last year, Morocco is still suffering an increase of unemployment. Once again, El Othmani reiterated that he took to heart the King’s recommendations, calling on the government to take all necessary actions to implement the monarch’s orders. In his recent speeches, the King said that despite the country’s achievements, there are still dysfunctions in Moroccan administration and education. The King also called on the government to work on the education system and empower Morocco’s wealth: its youth. In response to the King’s speeches, El Othmani promised that the King’s instructions will be fulfilled as he informed his government to make the monarch’s orders their guidelines. El Othmani even promised that the government would “revolutionize” the education system. Nevertheless, criticism ran wild recently, especially with parents sending their children back to school this month. Parents criticized both the cost of school textbooks and the content of primary school textbooks. The education ministry introduced Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in primary school textbooks and has received backlash from parents. Supportive of the monarchy, the party considers itself as a body that contributes to the development of the country. The party also aims to ensure “integrity, freedom, responsibility, justice and solidarity.” PJD, which received a simple majority of votes in the 2011 and 2016 elections (around 30 percent in 2016), however, has been criticized this year, especially by its supporters when some PJD ministers angered Moroccan citizens. With the emergence of the social boycott on April 20, 2018, and a protest movement in northern Morocco between 2016 and 2017, Moroccan citizens accused the party of having changed its ideology after gaining seats in the government. A primary example is the backlash after Lahcen Daoudi, a PJD member and the minister of governance, participated in a protest deemed against the demands of a boycott of three major companies targeting high commodity prices in Morocco. Daoudi joined a protest with Centrale Danone employees in front of Parliament to decry the boycott on the company. Citizens, however, felt “offended” and shocked to see a minister of the ruling party protesting “against the demands of citizens.” International media heavily reported on Lahcen’s participation in the boycott, with the Arab Weekly describing the boycott as the “biggest crisis” of the PJD “since the dismissal of Benkirane” as head of government in April 2017. In a Parliament session, one MP showed a video of Daoudi before he was minister, condemning “poverty” and high prices.  The MP asked Daoudi what changed since PJD gained seats after the election. The MP said that PJD ministers are responsible for the high commodity prices and the expensive cost of water, electricity, and train tickets. PJD officials have also received criticism for not intervening in a court’s decision to give heavy sentences to Hirak Rif activists, who were jailed for their involvement in the Al Hoceima Hirak Rif protest movement to protest social disparities. When Hirak activists were given sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years in prison on June 26, many Moroccans expected the government, especially PJD officials, to react to the heavy sentences. However most of them, including El Othmani, said their hands were tied as the judiciary is independent from parliamentary legislation. Moroccans must wait and see whether the cabinet will fulfill its promises to make Morocco a better place for youth and for the next generation to come. While the party does have loyal supporters, recent events, especially the boycott, caused Moroccans to ask whether the party is keeping its “justice and development” ideology. Some social media users, who voted for the PJD,  have even claimed that they will boycott the 2021 election. In the 2016 election, PJD won 125 seats out of the 395 existing seats in Parliament. PJD has 16 MPs who represent the party at the House of Councillors in Parliament. PJD also has 11 ministers at the cabinet level. In both elections (2011 and 2016), the party’s former leader Benkirane gained the trust of Moroccan citizens, promising more changes. Opposition parties accused Benkirane’s cabinet of failing to fulfill his commitments, but the “beloved” prime minister explained the delays, emphasizing that changes cannot be felt in a single political term and his goals were long-term projects. When the King sacked Benkirane in 2017 for delays in forming a government through coalition, the King appointed El Othmani, who promised to make his ministers work to serve the demands of Moroccan citizens. King Mohammed VI’s speeches, however, have contained more complaints than achievements. Ultimately, PJD’s achievements will be put to the test in the next election, in November 2021.

Rabat – Spain might try its chance to win the rights to host the 2030 World Cup. Spanish media outlet Cadena Se reported yesterday that the Spaniards are looking forward to bidding to host the massive tournament. But will Spain submit a solo file or a joint bid with its two neighbors: Morocco and Portugal. According to Spanish news outlet AS, a joint bid with Morocco and Portugal is the Royal Spanish Football Federation’s preference. In August, Moroccan media reported that Morocco asked Spain and Portugal to form a trio to host the World Cup. Officials from the three football federations allegedly met to discuss a possible joint bid. Several countries have shown an interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including England and a joint bid from South America: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. In August, Royal Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales told Spanish media that there would be more cooperation between Morocco’s football federation and its Spanish counterpart. Rubiales made his remarks after a press conference before the Spanish Super Cup held in Tangier on August 12. On Wednesday, FIFA boss Gianni Infantino and Rubiales met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to discuss Spain’s willingness to host the 2028 European Championship. Spain hosted the World Cup in 1982 and the European Championship in 1964. The last time Spain bid to host was with Portugal, eying the 2018 World Cup, a bid Russia won and hosted June 14 to July 15. Morocco’s determination to bid for the 2030 World Cup also made African neighboring countries curious about the experience. Recently, both Tunisia and Algeria welcomed the idea of a joint Maghreb bid. The idea also received applause from the leaders of the North African Football Union (UNAF) at a seminar held in August in Tunis.

Rabat – Salah Al Jassmi, the brother of Emirati singer Hussain Al Jassmi, had a lot to say about Morocco, and it was not good.  Al Jassmi spoke out about the arrest of his friend, Emirati singer Ayad Menhali, who was caught and arrested with prostitutes in a villa in Marrakech. Al Jassmi blamed Morocco for “encouraging” this kind of behavior.  Police intervened Saturday night, September 8, while the UAE artist was accompanied by 11 Emirati and Saudi people and about 30 Moroccan girls. On Monday morning, September 10, the judicial police referred some 41 people, including dozens of prostitutes and citizens of the Arab Gulf countries, to the royal prosecutor at the Marrakech District Court. In a viral video on social media, Al Jassmi was not keen on Morocco and especially the red city, which he considers as a city that “mainly welcomes tourists looking for late night parties, poker games in casinos and sexual relationships.” He went on, saying these tourists are not necessarily from Arab countries but also from Hollywood, looking for the same thing.  In addition, Al Jassmi accused Morocco of “tolerating this kind of practice.”  Al Jassmi’s video has sparked controversy among Moroccans who were not happy with the Emirati’s statement.  At least for internet users, Morocco is considered a sex tourism destination. A simple search on Google identifies many websites in which the kingdom is listed among the most popular destinations for sex, especially Marrakech.  Since the controversial release of Nabil Ayouch’s “Much Loved” movie about prostitution in 2015, a spotlight has been thrown on the issue of prostitution in Morocco. The Emirati singer’s case is just one among many. In Marrakech, hundreds of apartments, riads, and villas are dedicated to prostitution. In 2012, a senior Saudi army officer died of a heart attack in Marrakech while spending the evening with four Moroccan women in a villa in the Anakhil district. In the same year, three Britons were arrested in the company of young naked Moroccan women by a pool in a villa in Bab Ighli.

Rabat – Minister of Education Said Amzazi, taking El Othmani’s recommendations to heart, has held several meetings to explain the inclusion of Darija in school books. Amzazi held several meetings with officials within the Ministry of Education on Monday, September 10, according to Le Site Info. The aim of the meetings was to prepare explanations and answer citizen’ questions about the use of Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in school books. The debate around the use of Darija in Arabic school books is still raging one week into the start of the new school year. In the new Arabic primary school textbooks, some Moroccan traditional words were written in Darija. Pictures of school book sections were posted on Facebook, causing uproar among Moroccan society who rejected the use of Darija content. The inclusion of Darija in textbooks was confused by some Moroccans who spread photos on social media of fake school book pictures. The photos include some popular Moroccan children’s songs in Darija, transliterated into Latin characters, and sections with inappropriate content, such as innuendos and bad words. El Othmani neutralizes towards Darija Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani first reacted strongly, saying that Darija cannot be used in education “because first, the official languages recognized by the Constitution are Arabic and Tamazight.” The content of textbooks in Moroccan public primary schools are either in standard Arabic, Tamazight, or French. “We cannot admit expressions, sentences or paragraphs in Moroccan dialect in textbooks,” El Othmani told Maghreb Arab Press Sunday, September 9. However, El Othmani’s most recent public statements seem to contradict his position on the use of words and expressions in Darija. The head of government said Tuesday, September 11, in an interview with Le360 that the first priority should be given to educational reform, which could be interpreted as support for the new books. He stressed that no governmental officials had the intention to go as far as to make Darija “a language of school textbooks.” “The use of some words and expression in Darija is another debate between specialists to be decided on,” he added. Darija words could be left in new books  Although El Othmani said previously, “We cannot admit expressions, sentences or paragraphs in Moroccan dialect in textbooks,” he also said the issue “does not affect the essence of textbooks. It’s only about words not expressions, sentences, or paragraphs.” In contrast with his previous statement, the head of government said, “We have no problem to give up these school books after a potential consultation with concerned actors.” The official stated that some words in Darija could be used in textbooks. “If there is a need to use some words in Darija, we will use them just like we use the word ‘cinema’ which is not an Arabic word but a French and Latin word,” El Othmani said today. “We should discuss this issue sedately and in a scientific and objective manner for the benefit of Moroccan education and its quality,” he added.

Rabat – Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic received Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Tuesday, September 11. After the audience, the Serbian president told Moroccan press that he reaffirmed his country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Vucic also called for the strengthening of bilateral ties with Morocco in various fields. The meeting, according to the Serbian president, aimed to discuss issues of common interest. In June, Vucic expressed his country’s intention to give new impetus to the economic relations between Morocco and Serbia. During his meeting with Morocco’s Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki, the Serbian head of state said that he has “great esteem and consideration for Morocco.” M. Nasser Bourita a été reçu aujourd’hui au siège du Ministère #serbe des Affaires Étrangères par son homologue, M.

Both officials co-chaired a press conference to discuss the countries’ policies. The agreement followed two other cooperation agreements between Dacic and Bourita in March. The agreements, which focused on the fields of diplomatic training and culture,  were signed during Dacic’s visit to Morocco. Both officials also agreed to hold the second session of their joint committee which will focus on economic and trade cooperation. The joint committee is scheduled to meet before the end of the year in Morocco. Dacic expressed positivity over the joint committee, emphasizing that it should be held as soon as possible, with a view to developing economic ties. Morocco and Serbia want to forge ties in the fields of agriculture, energy, and technology. Dacic also reaffirmed his country’s support for Morocco’s integrity, saying that his country believes that the “the autonomy proposal [in the Sahara] submitted by Morocco falls fully and perfectly within this framework.” The Serbian official also expressed his gratitude to Morocco for its support of the territorial integrity of Serbia.

Rabat – Morocco’s OCP Group and Ghana’s Ministry of Food and Agriculture have signed an MoU to develop Ghana’s fertilizer value chain. The Ghanaian minister of agriculture, Owusu Afriyie Akoto, and the chairman of OCP Group, Mostafa Terrab, signed an MoU on September 7. The purpose of the agreement is to develop Ghana’s fertilizer value chain “as part of the Government of Ghana’s newly designed Fertilizer Expansion Programme (GFEP),” OCP announced Monday, September 10, in a statement. OCP Group is one of the leading exporters and producers of phosphate-based fertilizers in the world. The group’s revenue in the first quarter of 2018 reached MAD 9.7 billion, down from nearly MAD 10.9 billion in the same period in 2017. OCP Group and Ghana’s Ministry of Food and Agriculture will cooperate to improve the fertilizer value chain to provide “customized fertilizers at affordable prices to farmers.” According to OCP’s statement, the improvement of the fertilizer value chain will be made at the farmer level by “targeted farmer-centric and agronomic initiatives, providing appropriate inputs to farmers and supporting them with adequate training, soil mapping, field trials and fertilizer formula development.” The two sides will develop the fertilizer production sector in Ghana by exploring  “the feasibility of setting up a fertilizer production plant, that could combine natural gas from Ghana and phosphate from Morocco to produce customized high quality and affordable fertilizers.” The development of the fertilizer value chain will introduce “fertilizer blending” in order to produce “customized mineral fertilizers” which will comply with “soil- and crop-specific nutrient requirements.” If the implementation of the collaboration succeeds, officials estimate it will create job opportunities, reduce fertilizer prices, and increase farmers’ fertilizer consumption in Ghana, which is considered among the lowest in the world, according to the statement. In June, OCP initiated a national campaign in Ethiopia to assist the Ethiopian government in its agricultural plan. OCP and Ethiopia’s government planned to finalize a pilot zone of 100,000 hectares of arable lands by October 2018 to complete a thorough study of Ethiopia’s fertility level. OCP agricultural engineers stated that the results of the soil analysis will provide a clearer idea of the requirements for a more productive and sustainable agriculture in Ethiopia, especially for matching fertilizers with specific types of soil.

Rabat – Said Taghmaoui has affirmed to Morocco World News that he will not play in the next James Bond movie.  Several media outlets, including MWN, reported that the Moroccan-French actor claimed that he would play the villain in “James Bond 25.”  A Scottish newspaper reported having an interview with the “La Haine” actor, who said that British filmmaker Danny Boyle contacted him for Bond antagonist and that he had already auditioned for the role.  “I was cast by Danny Boyle, and just now he left the project, so of course there’s some uncertainty,” Taghmaoui allegedly said in his interview with the National. Following the news, Taghmaoui contacted MWN to dismiss the story. “It’s a fake news,” he said.  Born in France to Moroccan parents, Said Taghmaoui became a naturalized US citizen in 2008 and established himself in the Hollywood industry.

Rabat- Morocco’s Ministry of Culture and Communication has stressed that researchers must request government permission before excavating archeological sites. “No person is allowed to dig or conduct sea explorations … that may have historical, archeological or anthropological benefits for Morocco, or one that concerns humanities in general,” said the ministry in a statement on Tuesday, September 11. Abiding by Law 22.80 on the protection and preservation of Morocco’s cultural heritage, including historical buildings, antiques, and inscriptions, the ministry calls for researchers who wish to explore to request authorization at least six months in advance. People may submit an application to regional bureaus under the ministry’s supervision. Permits will be valid for one year with the possibility of extension. The validity of the permit may be renewed for longer periods of time by submitting a request three months ahead of the expiration date. If the permit expires while a researcher is in the process of renewal, the researcher can still receive the desired extension period, but must wait for the permit to be reauthorized. In the past, some individuals illegally excavated private property or state property in search of treasure or other materials of significant value. In 2017, groups of “treasure hunters” vandalized Gantrat El Fellous and Dar Oum Sultan, two historical sites in the rural commune of Ait Sibern between Rabat and Fez, according to national heritage management officials. Gantrat El Fellous is a historic bridge and an architectural monument built by the Almohad dynasty in the 12th century. The heritage director of the Ministry of Culture, Abdellah Alaoui, described the acts as “crimes against national historic monuments,” that “represent a great historical and architectural value which must be preserved.” The Ministry of Culture is promoting a draft law to significantly bolster the protection and preservation of Morocco’s vast cultural heritage. The ministry also emphasized the significance of Decree 2.17.664, which classifies the archaeological site Jebel Irhoud as an official national heritage site. Jebel Irhoud is where archaeologists discovered the oldest remains of Homo sapiens in June 2017. The decree gives the ministry significant oversight responsibility to protect the archaeological site as excavation work continues. The ministry expects the new policies for identifying, protecting, and promoting cultural resources to be a driving force for Morocco’s economic development, as well as an essential element of genuine sustainable development.

Rabat – Five months after Morocco cut ties with Iran, the Arab Quartet Committee has expressed support for Morocco’s position against Iranian interference. The committee, which is in charge of monitoring the crisis with Arab states and Iran, expressed solidarity with Morocco through a statement issued during its 9th meeting held in the 150th session of the Council of Arab Foreign Affairs in Egypt. In the statement, the committee addressed Iran’s alleged interference in Arab domestic affairs and condemned Iran’s alleged attempt to arm and train elements to destabilize Morocco. The committee said Iran’s action is part of its plan to “disrupt security and stability in the region.” The committee denounced the “continued” interference of Iran in internal affairs and condemned repeated “provocative statements by Iranian officials against Arab countries.” Morocco cut ties with Iran on May 1, accusing the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah of supporting the Polisario Front and training its separatist members in the Tindouf camps of Algeria. Since Morocco announced its decision, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has repeatedly stated that Morocco presented detailed evidence to Iran documenting Polisario-Hezbollah collusion. Several Gulf countries supported Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar. In May Qatar News Agency (QNA) quoted a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar in support of Morocco’s interest to preserve security and stability against all attempts to undermine its territorial integrity or to target its safety and that of its citizens. Qatar also stressed “the importance of respecting the principles governing relations between states, with respect for sovereignty.”

Rabat – Saudi authorities arrested an Egyptian expat, on Monday, September 10, after he filmed himself having breakfast with a woman.  The video, labeled as “offensive,” showed the woman feeding the man finger food.  lol Saudis are freaking out over this video of employees having breakfast together. The guy will probably be deported as he’s not Saudi and the girl might get fired. pic.twitter.com/ttY5sUBfHD — Anon (@dontcarebut) September 9, 2018  The footage went viral on social media, sparking controversy.  The man and woman are apparently colleagues. Saudi police also summoned their employer for breaking the rules that the workplace should not be mixed. Saudi media describe the expatriate as a man of Egyptian origin working in a hotel. The Saudi prosecutor general called the man to order with a tweet to respect “the values ??and traditions of Saudi society.” The sanctions incurred to the three involved are still unknown. Saudi Arabia could simply expel the foreign employee  dismiss his colleague.

The arrest comes at a time of reforms led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who lifted the ban on driving for women in June 2018.  For many years, the ban on women driving caused serious damage to the kingdom’s reputation at the regional and international level. Freedom to drive had been demanded for many years by Saudi women, who took to the streets in their cars in protest of the policy. Some of the activists were even arrested and jailed for defying the ban. The prohibition still had fierce support from Saudi officials and religious figures, who went as far as issuing religious edicts on the subject. Despite lifting the gender-based road restrictions, Saudi Arabia continue to have one of the most strongly gender-based systems of law in the world. Women are still severely restricted and must live under the supervision of a male guardian in their families in order to study, travel, or even to receive hospital treatment.

Rabat – Moroccan-Spanish football player Munir El Haddadi will probably never forget his 23rd birthday party.  Celebrating with his friends and family at a nightclub in Madrid, the FC Barcelona player did not expect to end his night arguing with the police.   Muchas gracias a [email protected] por los mensajes! 23???? A post shared by  Twitter: @Munirhaddadi (@munirhaddadi) on Sep 1, 2018 at 12:13pm PDT  According to Spanish outlet El Mundo, El Haddadi booked a private space at the nightclub to mark the occasion. His birthday party lasted seven hours, and he drank and smoked hookah with friends and family. When the nightclub produced a bill for €16,000, El Haddadi refused to pay, explaining that the sum did not correspond with what he consumed. It took the intervention of the police to calm the player and the owners of the club reported El Mundo.  The striker finally paid the bill, accepting a small discount of €1000. El Haddadi will have to leave the incident behind to focus on his season with FC Barcelona, which decided to keep him rather than loan him to another club.  The French sports secretary, confident of El Haddadi’s abilities, has high hopes to see him rise this season, despite the fact he sat on the bench for two seasons between 2015 and 2017.

During his youth, the footballer also played for several Spanish clubs, including Atletico Madrid, FC Valencia, and Rayo Majadahonda. 

Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, El Haddadi represented the Spanish national Under 19 team and Under 20 team. He made a brief appearance on the pitch as a substitute at an international game against Macedonia in 2014. His appearance then ruined his chances to switch sporting nationalities and represent the Moroccan national football team, according to FIFA eligibility rules.

Rabat – September 12, 2018, is a date to remember as Moroccan courts will officially implement Law 103-13 on gender-based discrimination. Six months after its publication in the official gazette in February, the law on the elimination of violence against women will go into effect, providing women the ability to file complaints of sexual harassment and giving severe punishment to harassers. The law will give prison sentences ranging from one to six months for people who sexually harass in public spaces, by use of words, acts or signals of a sexual nature for sexual purposes. The harassers will also be fined from MAD 2,000 to 10,000. Perpetrators of cybercrime, including broadcasting or disseminating a combination of false allegations, will face one to three years in prison and a fine ranging from MAD 1,000 to 20,000 if found guilty. The law will also include the establishment of a regional committee for female victims of violence at the level of the judicial district of each court of appeal. Moroccan women have expressed positive feelings about the law, which defines any act of violence and harassment as a crime. The Association Tahadi for Equality and Citizenship (ATEC) told Morocco World News it was satisfied and positive over the decision to implement the law. “12 September 2018 is a historic day by all standards for Moroccan women,” the statement said. While many see the decision to implement the law is a big step for women, some believe more work should be done yet. Bouchra Abdou, an activist, feminist, and president of ATEC told Morocco World News that women’ associations will ask for more explanations and details of the law. For the activist, the implications of the law are still vague; while the law was announced in the official gazette, it’s full text has not been published yet. Abdou noted that women do not know exactly what they should do if they are harassed. Minister of Solidarity, Women, and Family Bassima Hakkaoui said that it took the government six years of consultation and public debate to implement the law. According to the official, the law is based on four aspects of justice, according to international standards: preventive, protective, restorative, and solidarity. Void for vagueness? “Do we need witnesses for the law to be implemented against a harasser? We still don’t have a complete idea about how this law is going to work,” Abdou said. For Stephanie Willman Bordat, international human rights lawyer, the struggle does not end here. Asked if she is positive about the law, the human rights activist said that “the law is not made to be implemented,” but to amend the current law.  Bordat told Morocco World News today how the law has criminalized public harassment. “What the law basically did is create a couple of new crimes or it increased the prison time for the crimes that already existed. The problem is that for those to be implemented, the law has to include items related to the reporting and investigation and prosecution. In other words, to be implemented, the law has to put into place the implementing mechanisms.” According to the activist, the law should also facilitate the reporting procedure for women wishing to file complaints of gender-based discrimination. “It has to put systems and procedures for police to investigate, and it has to put in place procedures for prosecution to prosecute. And the law does not do anything like that. It says sexual harassment is a crime, but if you go to the police to say that ‘this guy was harassing me,’ there is no clarity in the law about what the police officer is supposed to do and about how they do the interview and investigation.” She added that law enforcement does not have the power to do their job “if they don’t have the obligation that they have to do that job.” ‘The law is so bad’ Commenting on the provisions against domestic violence, the activist said that the issue “was a crime before; that is nothing new. Rape and sexual assault were also crimes before.”  The activist also pinpointed the fact women do not file complaints against violence. Bordat said that only 3 percent of women who suffer it report rape. “The law does not change anything regarding rape crimes.” She also emphasized that a “response from law enforcement is necessary: otherwise, why would women go and report against those crimes?” The lawyer also criticized the lack of intervention of law enforcement in certain cases, like domestic violence. Bordat said that for police to intervene, there must be imminent threat of death.  “For police to go to a private home to investigate a domestic dispute, it has to be an imminent threat of death; [a] prosecutor can’t arrest abusers unless women bring a medical certificate of 20 days of incapacitation … None of that changed.” Bordat also addressed a message to women, recognizing that “there is still a long road ahead of us…. It is going to require ongoing advocacy. The law is so bad.” She added that concerned parties should monitor the law and how it is going to be implemented.   Sensitization campaign ATEC will launch a campaign to raise awareness on the danger of harassment. “The campaign includes direct sensitization meetings with citizens,” ATEC’s statement added. The campaign aims also to explain the law and its provisions in simple language for citizens.  The center will also provide citizens with brochures “carefully prepared to be accessible to all women, and posters designed for the same purpose will be featured in the city of Casablanca.” Tahadi plans to launch an online campaign, sending audio messages from Moroccan activists, authors, and citizens to raise awareness against harassment and to call on women to take the initiative to “quickly submit complaints against harassers.” In the audio clips Morocco World News obtained of human rights activists, feminists, and public figures, the primary message was to ask women to take a firm position against harassment and to break their silence to fight it. The continuation of a long struggle One woman already started to say no to violence. On September 6, a Moroccan woman in Casablanca filed complaints against three men for sexual harassment. The law on violence against women was originally set to take effect in August, but was delayed until today for unknown reasons. The law comes after widely-publicized cases of rape, harassment, and violence caused outrage among Moroccan citizens. The latest case to receive wide attention was Khadija’s. The 17-year-old said she was kidnapped and raped by more than 12 men for two months. Her alleged rapists also tattooed her body against her will, she said, writing their names on her skin. A similar case caused outrage in Casablanca last year when a group of teanagers physically harassed a young woman on a moving bus while other passengers did nothing.

Rabat – Will French-Moroccan actor Said Taghmaoui secure a role in the next James Bond? British filmmaker Danny Boyle contacted the 45-year-old Hollywood actor to embody the villain of “James Bond 25.” He already auditioned for the role. Taghmaoui assured the press that he could play 007’s antagonist well. However, Boyle abandoned the production of “James Bond 25” a few days ago, leaving Taghmaoui with uncertainties. “I was cast by Danny Boyle, and just now he left the project, so of course there’s some uncertainty,” he said in an interview with the National.  “We don’t know who the director will be, and the producers don’t know if they’re going to go Russian or Middle East with the baddie right now. I literally just received a message saying: ‘If they go Middle East, it’s you. If they go Russian, it’s someone else.’ It’s the story of my life. Always on that line between something that could change my life and something that disappears.” The actor, who played Moroccan-born Sameer (the World War I ally of Amazon warrior Diana in Wonder Woman), admits that his potential Bond role could be viewed as regressive. “I know that [Bond] could be seen as a big cliche, and I’m always fighting. I refuse so many roles because you fight to get something, you go and audition, and then in the end you have to refuse it because it’s just not good. That’s how you start your journey,” Taghmaoui said. Taghmaoui’s fate lies in the hands of series producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who are on the hunt for both their “big bad” and their replacement director. Born in France to Moroccan parents, Said Taghmaoui became a naturalized US citizen in 2008 and established himself in the Hollywood industry.  He was a professional boxer when he met French filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz and collaborated with him to write the successful movie “La Haine” with Vincent Cassel in 1995. His participation earned him a nomination for the French version of the Oscars, the “Cesars.” Taghmaoui appeared in several Hollywood productions including “G.I. Joe,” “Wonder Woman,” “House Of Saddam,” and “Lost.” In June, Taghmaoui joined the prestigious Oscar’s academy. He is the third Moroccan to become a voting member of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences, after Moroccan filmmakers Nabil Ayouch and Khadija Alami in 2017.

Rabat- Spanish authorities discovered two Moroccan migrants hiding inside the engine compartment of a tourist bus. After a three-day trip in Morocco, Spanish tourists stopped their tour bus in the mountains about an hour after arriving in Spain at Algeciras when the tourists heard voices speaking Arabic from inside the bus. The tourists informed the police, who discovered the source of the voices to be two Moroccan minors, Spanish news outlet La Razon reported on Monday. A video of the incident shows the two boys, exhausted and covered in engine oil, barely making their way outside the bus engine and lying down defenselessly on the ground. Spanish authorities placed the two undocumented migrants in custody, pending their admission to a temporary internment immigrant center. Recently, a video of a young Moroccan trying to get to Spain by crossing the Mediterranean sea on a tube went gone viral on social media. The young man was rowing just with his hands before he was saved by a Spanish fishing boat and offered a banana, water, and a jacket. Spain and Morocco are continuously cooperating to combat undocumented migration.  Morocco, a transit country for migrants, has thwarted more than 54,000 undocumented immigration attempts to Europe in 2018. In 2017, Morocco stopped more than 65,000 migration attempts to Europe, a number that is up from 32,000 the previous year, according to Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi. Moroccan authorities are also overseeing security at the Morocco-Spain border, where hundreds of migrants try to jump the high double fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta.  On July 26, more than 600 sub-Saharans successfully crossed the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. Dozens of migrants were injured along with border guards during the incursion.

Rabat- Passengers will no longer travel through the Tangier Moghogha Train Station starting Sunday, September 16. The National Office of Railways (ONCF) announced today that it will close Moghogha Station in Tangier for construction set to enlarge the railway, affecting the station’s building. All transportation services through Moghogha Station will be rerouted to the main station, Tanger Ville, instead. From Sunday on, Tanger Ville will be the hub for trips to Tangier Med Port, Casablanca, Fez, and Marrakech. The railway expansion is under the framework of ONCF’s projects to upgrade and increase the capacity of the railway network. The director general of ONCF, Mohamed Rabie Khlie, recently promised many benefits for railway customers, including an increase in the number of trains, capacity building of the lines, service improvement, and departure timing to reduce journey lengths. For his part, the minister of equipment, transport, logistics, and water, Abdelkader Amara, noted that Morocco is pursuing the dynamic development of its transport infrastructure “in accordance with the policy of major projects led by King Mohammed VI.” One of the major projects is Morocco’s high speed train, LGV, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2018. The LGV—which is the first of its kind in Africa—will link Tangier to Kenitra, a city just north of Rabat, with a travel time of only 1.5 hours. The LGV will also connect Tangier to Casablanca in 2 hours and 10 minutes, replacing  the current trip’s five hour minimum travel time. In a statement published by ONCF in July, Khlie said the railway network transported 38 million passengers and 30 million tons of goods in 2017. “MAD 6.3 billion of investments were made and a significant gain for the community estimated at MAD 2.5 billion thanks to the use of the railway,” he stated. In 2016, ONCF transported 39.5 million passengers and 28.2 million tons of goods. At the end of 2013, ONCF had a total of 3,657 kilometers of railways, of which 2,238 are electrified. ONCF also increased their freight traffic (including phosphates and by-products) from 25 to 32 million tons between 2009 and 2015 (up 27 percent), with a turnover rising from MAD 1.4 billion to 2.1 billion (up 50 percent). ONCF was created in 1963 and placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Equipment and Transport.

Rabat – The Moroccan navy has rescued 19 Moroccan people, including a woman and a child, in the Atlantic Ocean off Casablanca. The migrants were in a weak wooden boat and had been abandoned by their smuggler in the middle of the ocean, according to a statement by the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) general staff. The royal navy sent a rescue team after they located the migrants 32 kilometers off Casablanca at around 8 p.m. The statement said that the navy brought the rescued people back safely to the port of Casablanca. The makeshift boat, according to the statement, sank at the end of the rescue. Every year, hundreds of migrants, including sub-Saharans and Moroccans, take the hazardous journey across the Atlantic Ocean or the Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to reach the Eldorado. In June, the Royal Marine rescued 472 undocumented migrants, including 28 women and 27 teenagers. The migrants also included 3 children. Most of the migrants were men. The 472 passengers are among the latest in a growing number of men, women, and children making the risky sea journey in hopes of reaching Europe. Earlier this month, at least 35 migrants, including Moroccans, were killed after a boat capsized off Tunisia’s southern coast. The precarious sea voyage claimed the lives of 90 migrants in February after a migrant boat capsized off the Libyan coast near the city of Zuara.

Rabat – The spokesperson for the Libyan National Army (LNA), Ahmed al-Mismari, has accused Arab media of exploiting his commander’s remarks on Algeria. Recently, social media erupted after Al Jazeera published a video showing the LNA’s Commander Marshall Khalifa Belqasim Haftar of the eastern Tobruk-based government saying that he would “spread war” to Algeria. Algerian officials have given no official reaction followed Haftar’s remarks. However, Algerian television channel Algeria 3 reported on September 3 that Tripoli authorities apologized to Algeria. Libya allegedly expressed its apology in a phone call between Libyan foreign affairs minister Mohamed Taha Siala and his Algerian counterpart Abdelkader Messahel. Siala belongs to the Tripoli-based government in western Libya. During his phone call, Siala distanced his country’s stance from Haftar’s statements, stressing Libya’s commitment to maintain historical and strong relations between the brotherly people. Today, Algerian news outlets quoted the spokesperson of the LNA, saying that Algeria and Libya are countries with a “common destiny.” TSA quoted al-Mismari accusing Arab media, including Al Jazeera, for “exploiting” Haftar’s remarks to create tension between the two countries. Sputnik News also reported on the spokesperson’s press conference on Monday to denounce the video published by Al Jazeera.   Al-Mismari said in his press conference that Algeria and Libya are brother countries with a “common destiny.” Tension between Algeria and Haftar is not new. In 2014, the official allegedly accused Algeria of attempting to seize Libya’s wealth. In May, a United Nations-sponsored summit convened Libya’s Chief of Staff Marshall Khalifa Haftar, Speaker of the Libyan House of Representatives in Tobruk Aguila Saleh, Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya Fayez al-Sarraj, and President of Libya High Council Khaled Mechri.  The meeting, which marked Morocco’s participation, aimed to discuss ways to end the Libyan crisis. During the conference, the Libyan officials agreed to work with the UN to hold “credible and peaceful elections on December 10 and to respect the results of the elections.” The ongoing crisis in Libya started in 2011 after the Arab Spring protests which caused a civil war and resulted in the death of long-time Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The power vacuum caused instability in the country.

Rabat – After his controversial remarks about standard Arabic, Noureddine Ayouch has referred to his critics as “dogs.” Ayouch, a member of Morocco’s Supreme Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research, is generating rounds of criticism and backlash after strongly defending the use of Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in the Moroccan education system. Activists, scholars, academics, and sociologists heavily criticized Ayouch’s belief that Darija should be included in the education system. In response, Ayouch said that “the dogs may bark but the caravan moves on.” Activists launched a petition on Avaaz.org calling on the government to remove Ayouch from Morocco’s Supreme Council for Education. The petition has generated 7,554 signatures so far. The petition, according to the signatories, aims to suspend Ayouch’s plans “to destroy the principles and moral values and execute the Arabic language.” In his recent interviews with local news outlets, Ayouch said that Darija existed before classical Arabic and that Darija could curb the education crisis in the country. He also said that classical Arabic is not “sacred.” Ayouch told Chouf TV that he called people who insult him and his family dogs, adding that he respects people who criticize him. “I have always supported freedom of expression,” he said. For years, Ayouch has called on the government to include Darija in the education system. In 2016 Ayouch announced that he would launch the first online Darija dictionary in Morocco. Ayouch said that the dictionary aims to give importance to Moroccan Arabic. Promoting Darija in the education system has fuelled controversy in Morocco. The head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, made a public statement against the use of Darija in school books for primary education. El Othmani made it clear that he believes Darija cannot be used in education. He said the government is ready to give up on school books with some Darija words after a consultation between the concerned parties. El Othmani said the two official languages in Morocco are standard Arabic and Tamazight (Berber) as recognized by the Moroccan constitution. The head of government also called on Minister of Education Said Amzazi to give an explanation to the public about the use of the Moroccan Arabic in school books.

Rabat- Law 19-12 on domestic employees working conditions will go into effect on October 2. The new law will require employers to have written contracts ensuring the workers’ rights by limiting their working hours to 40 hours per week for minors aged 16-18 and 48 hours for adults. The employers may choose between a fixed-term or indefinite term contract.  The indefinite term contract must be certified in three copies: one for the employer, one for the employee, and one for the labor inspector to examine its compatibility with the law. The law does not mention part-time domestic workers. Domestic workers with contracts will be entitled to benefits from the National Social Security Fund (CNSS), one day of rest per week, and a net salary of MAD 13.46 per hour, amounting to MAD 1,548 per month. Housing and food cannot be deducted from the salary. After six months of continuous work, domestic workers have the right to paid leave, 1.5 days for each month of their service, and days off during public holidays. Employees who restart their work after pregnancy and childbirth will be entitled to, in addition to the weekly day off, one hour of daily rest for 12 consecutive months. If the employee is deprived of their resting days, the employer will face a fine of MAD 500 to MAD 2,000. If employers do not respect the contract, employers will pay a fine ranging from MAD 3,000 to MAD 5,000.  The contract must include a clear statement from the employee, indicating his or her desire to perform domestic work on behalf of the employer.  If employers force a person to work for them, they will face a fine of MAD 25,000 to MAD 30,000 and a prison sentence from one to three months for a repeated offense. According to the law, employing minors 16 to 18 will not be permitted to work until five years after the implementation of the law. Minors will be prohibited from performing life-threatening tasks such as working at great heights; handling chemical products, electrical equipment, or gardening equipment; cleaning fireplaces and water heaters; driving a vehicle on behalf of the employee; or serving an employee with a contagious disease. Underage workers must undergo a medical examination every six months. Children below the age of 15 are not allowed to work, according to Article 143 of the 2004 Code of Work. Based on national child labor statistics, of the current 247,000 working children in the country, 162,000 (2.3 percent) carry out life-threatening day to day tasks in agriculture, construction, mining, forestry, handicrafts, and fishing. Child labour in Morocco sharply decreased from 517,000 children working in 1990 to 247,000 in 2017, according to data from the High Commission for Planning (HCP). The law, adopted by the House of Representatives July 26, 2016, seeks to protect domestic workers from exploitation in underpayment and physical and verbal abuse. In addition to being deprived of an education, many domestic workers as young as 8 work overtime and are not fed adequately. According to the international organization Human Rights Watch, some girls complained that their employers beat them with belts, wooden sticks, shoes, or plastic pipes.  Some of them worked for more than 100 hours a week. Their average salary was as low as MAD 545 per month, according to the organization. “This new law is groundbreaking for domestic workers in Morocco, so many of whom have been exploited and abused,” said Middle East and North Africa communications and advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, Ahmed Benchemsi, when Morocco first introduced the law in 2016.

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred will appear in front of the judge determining bail conditions in Draguignan, at the request of the Court of Paris. According to Media Part, the Moroccan singer could go back to detention after his September 18 hearing. Saad Lamjarred was released on judicial supervision following a complaint of rape filed recently against him by a young French seasonal worker in Saint-Tropez. The 33-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday, August 26, in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from another woman. The singer is already facing a trial on charges of rape for a 2016 incident in France. After two days in custody, the pop star was placed under judicial supervision and prohibited from leaving France or contacting the complainant. In addition, the singer was required to pay bail of €150,000. The singer of “Ghazali” met the victim in a nightclub in Saint-Tropez, on Saturday night, August 25. He invited her to his hotel room and, according to Lamjarred’s lawyer, they had “a consensual sexual relationship.”  The woman, however, immediately reported to the authorities that Lamjarred had beaten and raped her. Following his arrest, the Moroccan singer’s name was ruled off the list of nominees in the All Africa Awards (AFRIMA) competition, which will take place in Ghana in November. Lamjarred had been nominated in three categories: Best singer in Africa, best song in Africa for “Casablanca,” and best artist in North Africa. Bachir Abdou’s son was previously arrested in France on October 26, 2016, for the sexual assault of Laura Prioul. The trial has not yet commenced. French authorities temporarily released the artist on bail under electronic surveillance on April 13, 2017, after he spent nearly six months at the Marriott Champs Elysées in Paris pending his trial.

Rabat – Since Morocco cut ties with Iran, rumors ran wild that Morocco was obliged to relocate its embassy from a Shiite section to the Christian section of Beirut. An authorized source from the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke to Jeune Afrique on condition of anonymity to shut down the rumors. The source confirmed that the Moroccan embassy in Lebanon moved a few months ago, “but this move was planned for three years. In 2016, a commission had gone on site and budgets had been released to allow this change.” The embassy changed its address from Bir Hassan to Starco.  The move led the Moroccan community living in Lebanon to question whether the relocation was a “direct consequence of the rising tensions between the kingdom and the Shiite movement of Hezbollah.” Morocco cut diplomatic ties with Iran on May 1, alleging the country’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah had offered military support for the separatist group of Polisario. Both Hezbollah and Iran denied Morocco’s accusations. However, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had confirmed the Polisario-Hezbollah cooperation with “solid evidence.” On September 4, Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported that the alleged Hezbollah-Polisario collaboration is causing tension between Morocco and Lebanon. An anonymous source told the newspaper that the Moroccan embassy in Beirut has imposed strict security measures. Lebanese citizens wishing to get a visa to enter Morocco have to wait three to six months, pending the approval of the General Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the newspaper. In the interview with Jeune Afrique, the foreign affairs ministry said that the procedure is imposed in all countries where Morocco is represented. “Visa applications are automatically sent electronically to the Directorate of Consular and Social Affairs in Rabat.” The ministry added that the most suspicious applications are analyzed by Moroccan security services. Quoted by Jeune Afrique, the president of the Moroccan Institute of International Relations, Jawad Kerdoudi, said that Morocco and Lebanon maintain “good political contacts” although there “has never been much economic exchange or strong diasporas” between the two countries. Kerdoudi also said that the recent tension between Hezbollah and Morocco has not affected Moroccan-Lebanese ties because it concerns only Iran’s proxy, Hezbollah. According to Jeune Afrique, a Lebanese delegation attended Morocco’s Throne Day ceremony on August 30. In April, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri posted a selfie of himself, King Mohammed VI, and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reportedly taken at the King George V Hotel in Paris. Tension between Morocco and Iran also flared when Morocco arrested Lebanese Hezbollah financier Kassim Tajideen in Casablanca in March 2017. In May 2018, Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, Nasser Bourita, explained that the Moroccan-Iranian relationship changed after Morocco’s decision to arrest Tajideen. Bourita said that Iran “threatened Morocco to release him. We gave him to the United States and from that date there was a change.” According to the official, the change also “threatens our own security.” The North African country has also accused Algeria of supporting Iran and its proxy to train Polisario members through the Iranian embassy in Algeria.

Rabat – Moroccan athlete Rabab Arrafi has achieved the third best female performance in the history of Morocco’s participation in the IAAF Continental Cup.  The competition, held by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and formerly called the World Cup, took place this weekend in the Czech city of Ostrava. Arafi arrived third in the 1,500 meter race with a time of 4:17:19, allowing Africa, along with Kenya’s Winny Chebet (4:16 :01), to finish at the top of the contest with a total of 14 points. Arafi’s race earned her the third best performance in the history of Moroccan women’s participation in the IAAF Continental Cup, after Nezha Bidouane’s gold in the 400 meter hurdles event and Zahra Ouaziz’s silver in the 3,000 meter, both in 1998 in Johannesburg. Arafi, 27, the second best athlete from Africa, was the only athlete to win two gold medals at the last Mediterranean Games in June in Tarragona, Spain. She won both the 1,500 meter and the 800 meter, which she ran in2:01:01. Morocco holds six gold medals from IAAF Continental Cups.Moroccan men earned five of the medals: Said Ouita for the 5,000 meter in Barcelona in 1989, Benyounes Lahlou with the team of Africa for the 4×400 meter relay in Havana in 1992, Khalid Skah for the 10,000 meter in London in 1994, and Brahim Lahlafi for the 5,000 meter the same year. Nezha Bidouane offered Morocco the country’s only female gold, thanks to her victory in the 400 meter hurdles in 1998 in Johannesburg.

Rabat – Journalist Taoufik Bouachrine’s sexual harassment and assault trial has been delayed again, but the controversial videos will be admissible evidence in his trial. The journalist’s trial was postponed on September 10 again. Bouachrine will appear before the judge again on Friday, September 14. The National Gendarmerie laboratory has submitted its results and analysis on the videos, allegedly of Bouachrine engaged in sexual acts. Authorities seized the videos when they arrested Bouachrine on February 23. Bouachrine is facing several charges, including human trafficking, the exploitation of people in need, and the abuse of power for sexual purposes—complaints brought by his coworkers. The journalist is also suspected of other crimes, including violent rape and attempted rape. Bouachrine is the director of Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper and Al Youm 24. Police arrested the journalist at the headquarters of the newspaper. Local news outlets quoted Mohamed Kerrout, a lawyer for the complainants, claiming that the videos were not faked. The lawyer said that the experts found that “Bouachrine is involved in the crimes of which he is accused.” Since his arrest in February, Bouachrine, along with his defense team, have denied the accusations filed against him and claimed the videos were faked. However, authorities have allowed the use of the videos in hearings as evidence. Mohamed Ziane, a member of Bouachrine’s defense team, denied that the person in the footage was Bouachrine. Ziane used explicit language in front of the press, shouting that the videos are “porn footage.” Authorities alleged that they seized more than 50 tapes supporting the charges filed against him.

Rabat – Moroccan beauty queen and Miss Universe of the World Nouhaila Lmelki is in trouble. According to local Arabic outlet Alyaoum 24, police arrested Lmelki, also called “Barbie,” on Saturday, September 8, after she crashed while drunk driving in Marrakech.

Rabat – The French Minister of Education wants to develop standard Arabic as a foreign language in the French education system. At a time when there is a tense debate in Morocco about the use of Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in early education school books, France wants to give “prestige” to Arabic. Jean-Michel Blanquer pledged that the ministry would develop two other foreign languages in French schools: Chinese and Russian. The French education system includes two or three foreign languages in secondary school. Students can choose among English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian or German, according to Lexophiles. In a statement to BFMTV, the official said that he is planning to develop a “qualitative strategy” for teaching Arabic in schools.  For Blanquer, Arabic is a language to “which we must give prestige” just like the Chinese and Russian languages, “great languages of civilization.” According to the official, Arabic  should not only be taught for people of Maghreb origin or Arabic-speaking countries as it is a “great literary language” that “must be learned.” While France aims to offer foreign languages more importance, including Arabic, Moroccan activist Noureddine Ayouch strongly advocated using the Moroccan mother tongue dialect in Morocco’s education system. Ayouch said in an interview with H24 that Darija is older than classical Arabic and that classical Arabic is not “sacred.” For Ayouch, using Darija in schools would also improve the quality of education in Morocco.

They were suspended by the coach, Herve Renard, after they came late to training.  “We must respect the hours when we are in a group. This sanction is to set an example,” said Renard after the game.  “We have to take all the teams very seriously, in Africa there is a long trip but our goal is to finish first,” the head coach added. Last month, Mendyl officially joined Amine Harit at the German football club, FC Schalke 04. Born in Casablanca to a Moroccan mother and an Ivorian father, Mendyl made his debut for the Moroccan national team in a 2-0 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier win over Sao Tome. He has also represented Morocco’s Under 19 and Under 20 teams. Before joining Schalke 04, the footballer played as a left-back for the French League 1 side, Lille.

The young footballer explained his choice by saying that he was born and raised in Morocco. “For me, it was always clear in my head, I wanted to play and defend my Moroccan jersey.”

Rabat- Iraq’s foreign ministry has summoned Algeria’s ambassador after Algerian fans chanted slogans glorifying Saddam Hussein at the Arab Champions League. Iraq’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Ahmed Mahjub, expressed in a statement “the indignation of the [Iraqi] government and the Iraqi people [at] the horrible glorification of the regime of murderous dictator Saddam Hussein.” Halfway through a football match between the Algerian team USM Alger and the Iraqi Air Force football club at the annual Arab Champions League on September 9, when the Algerian team was leading 2-0, Algerian spectators started chanting “Saddam Hussein.” A video of the incident shows the team arguing when they heard chants echoing “Allahu akbar!

Rabat – Will Moroccan football player Mehdi Benatia leave the national team?  Despite Morocco’s win against Malawi (3-0) in the 2019 CAN game qualifier, Saturday, September 8, Benatia’s absence from the team is still raising a lot of questions about his future with the Atlas Lions.  According to RMC Sport, the Juventus defender is seriously thinking of returning his jersey as captain of the Moroccan team, wanting to retire from playing with the Moroccan team.  In the last week, the 31-year-old football player was the subject of many rumors after Herve Renard did not select him to be one of the 25 players for the Malawi-Morocco qualifier game. Local media were quick to jump to conclusions, reporting tensions between the coach and the captain since the end of the 2018 World Cup. Benatia went on social media to dismiss the speculation. Afterwards, the Moroccan press speculated that an injury caused him to lose his spot with the team, which he vehemently denied in a video posted on his Instagram.  Benatia was not the only one to deny the rumors. Speaking in a press conference before the game, the national team’s coach, Renard, had to explain the absence of his captain.  “Between Mehdi Benatia and me, there is of course no problem. He is someone I really appreciate. When you are a coach, you call your captain, you ask him where he is in his training, you know like me that he had a training [with Juventus] where he does not have all the time to play,” said the coach, explaining that Benatia wanted to focus on having a good season with his club, Juventus. RMC Sport added that the absence of Mehdi Benatia is actually due to a deeper reflection on his future representing Morocco internationally, because the World Cup was difficult for Benatia to live with behind the scenes. Benatia, on the other hand, may feel he needs to prove himself as he is struggling to find his place with his current club, Juventus, where he has not made any appearances on the pitch this season.  According to Italian football outlet Calciomercato, the Atlas Lion requested a contract renewal with the Old Lady. The footballer’s current contract will expire on June 30, 2020.

Rabat- Oumaima Requas has become the first to file a complaint of sexual harassment just days before the law on violence against women goes into effect. When Requas was heading to a cafe to meet her husband on Friday, September 6, three men approached her, making sexual remarks and gestures, which they continued even after she joined her husband. Requas’ husband intervened to stop the harassment, but one of the three men tried to throw a glass at him. The three men are allegedly comedians known to the Moroccan public.  Requas filed a complaint against the harassers immediately after she left the scene.   The men allegedly tried to escape the situation by claiming that they were only practising for a skit, reported Moroccan news outlet H24 info.

The incident took place just a few days before the law criminalizing public harassment and all forms of violence, is set to take effect on Wednesday, September 12.  The government published the final draft of the law on February 22. In April, Morocco World News received an unofficial English translation of the law’s text from the international non-profit women’s rights organization, Mobilising for Rights Associates. According to the law, those who sexually harass in public spaces, by use of words, acts, or signals of a sexual nature for sexual purposes, will face prison sentences ranging from one to six months, as well as a fine ranging from MAD 2,000 to 10,000. The law was originally set to take effect in August, however the government decided to delay its implementation until September. Bouchra Abdou, an activist, feminist, and president of Tahadi Center, told Morocco World News that she did not “really understand what the delay was about.” She said that the law should have been used in Moroccan courts beginning in August. She added that there is no problem if it is delayed until September as the most “important” thing is that the law will be “finally” put into force. Moroccan activists and feminists questioned whether there is any law that criminalizes violence against women in Morocco, especially after the publicization of several rape cases and violent incidents. Morocco’s rate of reported rapes increased from 800 cases in 2016 to 1,600 cases in 2017, according to an annual report issued by the King’s attorney general, Mohamed Abdel Nabawi. Just one month after the parliament passed the law, authorities arrested a 21-year-old man who sexually assaulted a young girl in public on the street in Ben Guerir city in central Morocco. The spine-chilling video of the incident, filmed by the culprit’s accomplice, sparked nationwide uproar among Moroccans on social media platforms, who called on authorities to immediately intervene. The most recent publicized rape case is that of a 17-year old girl, named Khadija, which also sparked outrage on social media in recent weeks. The victim told Chouf TV that she was kidnapped and raped for two months. Her alleged rapists also tattooed her body against her will, although a supposed tattoo artist contradicted Khadija’s story. Khadija’s alleged rape caught the attention of UNICEF. In a statement made public September 5, UNICEF aimed to raise awareness about violence against Moroccan children in general, reminding the Moroccan government of its integrated child protection policy to protect children against sexual violence adopted in 2015. The project, which is part of a mid-term evaluation of the National Plan of Action for Children 2006-2015, aims to create a healthy environment for children, safe from all forms of neglect, abuse, violence, and exploitation.

Rabat – Moroccans will celebrate the Islamic New Year 1440 on Tuesday, September 11, according to the International Center for Astronomy (CIA).  The new moon will probably be sighted in Morocco tonight, September 10.  Like in many countries in the Arab world, in Morocco the Islamic New Year is a public holiday. The Islamic New Year, or Hijri New Year, marks the first day of the month of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar. Muharram is considered one of the four sacred months in the Islamic calendar, along with Rajab (7th month), Qa’da (11th month), and Dhu al-Hijjah (12th month). It is a month for remembrance of old times, mourning, and reflection on important events of the past. The name Hijri refers to the Hijra, or the migration of the Prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina. Each country announces its date based on moon sightings, but several countries depend on astronomical charts to work out the Hijri calendar in advance.

Rabat – Trump’s administration will close the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington, D.C. The administration’s anticipated decision is due to Palestine’s continued refusal to enter into US-led peace negotiations with Israel. PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat said in a statement today that his office was informed by a US official of the decision. Quoted by Al Jazeera, Erekat said that the decision is another “affirmation” of the Trump administration’s policy to “collectively punish the Palestinian people, including by cuttingfinancial support for humanitarian services including health and education.” The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported on a draft text of a speech by Trump’s National Security Advisor John Bolton. In the alleged text of his speech, Bolton threatened the International Criminal Court (ICC) if the international institution conducts investigations into the US and Israel. According to Al Jazeera, Bolton is expected to laud the Israeli-US relations in his speech.  “The Trump administration will not keep the office open when the Palestinians refuse to start direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.” Tension between the US and Palestine escalated when the US announced its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved its embassy to the city. The decision led Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to announce a boycott of the US peace plan. More refusals, more cuts? After Abbas’s statement, the Trump administration announced it will cut more than half of the financial aid ($60 million) that the US normally gives to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). In August, the US announced it would axe all aid to UNRWA, more than $200 million, pledging the aid for “high-priority projects elsewhere.” The US State Department said that the decision followed a review of aid to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza to “ensure these funds were being spent in accordance with US national interests and were providing value to the US taxpayer.” Deutsche Welle (DW) quoted an official from the State Department saying that the review led to the cut of approximately $25 million originally planned for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network. After the August announcement, PLO condemned the US move of cutting more aid, describing it as “the use of cheap blackmail as a political tool. The Palestinian people and leadership will not be intimidated and will not succumb to coercion,” said the organization, as quoted by Al Jazeera.

Rabat- A man carrying a knife and an iron bar has injured seven people on the banks of a canal in Paris’s 19th district. The attack occurred Sunday around 11 p.m. (9 p.m. GMT), in northeast Paris. According to French media, the man, who targeted strangers randomly, is believed to be an Afghan and was later arrested. The incident is not being treated as a terror attack.  “At this stage, there is nothing to indicate that it could be a terrorist attack,” said French police. Among those stabbed were a British couple, who are currently being treated in a hospital with the other victims. Bystanders near the canal tried to stop the attacker by throwing petanque balls.  Speaking to French media, an eyewitness, Youssef Najah, said he was walking alongside the canal when he saw a man running and holding a knife about 25-30 centimeters long. “There were around 20 people chasing him. They started throwing petanque balls at him,” Najah said. “Around four or five balls hit him in the head, but they weren’t able to stop him,” he added. The French minister of the interior, Gerard Collomb, thanked those who intervened to stop the attacker for their “responsiveness and courage.” In recent years, France has witnessed several knife and terrorist attacks and has been on security alert ever since. On August 23, a man stabbed his mother and sister to death and badly injured another person before police shot him dead. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. French police said the attacker was mentally unstable. During the same month, a 19-year-old Afghan asylum seeker stabbed four people in the southwestern French town of Perigueux. Police investigations determined that it was not an act of terrorism. On June 17, a woman shouting “Allahu Akbar” (God is the greatest) attacked people in a supermarket with a box-cutter knife.

Rabat – How can the militia of Polisario gather all these contradictions at the same time?  This is the most urgent question that occupies the minds of researchers, from kidnapping, human trafficking, drugs, embezzlement of financial allocations and humanitarian aid to detainees held in the camps of Tindouf in Algeria and selling them in the black market in a number of Sahelo-Saharan countries, according to the a report of from the European Office for Fraud. 
In these endless contradictions, these actions clearly revealed the real face of the militia of polisario in terms of the dangerous convergence of the group with terrorist organizations, which together constitute the great security threat in the Sahel and Sahara. This is reinforced by the retention of the polisario all horizons closed to the detainees and the desperation and lack of hope in front of them, which makes them vulnerable to extremism and the need to engage in the terrorist organizations. which makes them more prone to extremism and the need to engage in the terrorist organizations.  “Polisario”, fertile ground for “Da’esh” Ultimately, the militia of Polisario stands helpless in the face of its latest setbacks by the signing of the European Union the fishing agreement with Morocco. Thus it has destabilized the militia and uprooted its calculations and pushed its members to coordinate with the terrorist organizations, especially the Sahel and Sahara. This collusion is a danger that calls for vigilance and caution, where peace and security in the region and the interests of a number of States have become the main target.
In this context, the suicide car bomb attack in the Libyan city of Sabha by a fighter belonging to “Da’esh” from the Tindouf camps in Algeria, was a dangerous precedent and an immediate danger to the alliances that have become the main targets of these militias with their alliances with the terrorist organizations in the region. They do not hesitate to harm the peace and safety of the countries of the region and the interests of other countries. The suicide car bomber in Sabha in Libya was an active element in the ranks of “ISISDa’ash in Libya as well as an extremist group known as the Emirate of Grand Sahara, a branch led by former Polisario militia member Adnan Abu Walid Al-Sahrawi.  The hostage situation in Ain Aminas, Algeria, revealed the inner conflicts of decision-making in Algeria, the easy way to recruit elements of “Polisario”, who participated side by side with the fighters of the organization “blood signatories”  ‘Al Mouaqeoun bi dam’led by Mukhtar Balmokhtar a close friend with the former security director of the Polisario militia. The International Center for Terrorism Studies in Washington has highlighted the links and rapprochement between terrorist groups active in North Africa and the Sahel with Polisario militias, stressing the urgent need to address this growing threat in the Tindouf camps to avoid the great danger posed by the terrorist activities of the Polisario militia. As a reminder of the terrorist threat posed by the polisario, the Central Bureau of Judicial Invistigation BCIJ  has dismantled terrorist cells linked to the organization of the Islamic State, which was active in the town of Samara, the Belfaa and Ait Amira regions, where its members planned to join the ranks of Daesh in Libya through Mauritania. In addition their preparation of a traditional bomb device for use in terrorist operations aimed at public places and vital in the Kingdom of Morocco. Morocco: The only credible interlocutor  What distinguishes one state from another is the maturity of its constitutional institutions. In order to achieve this maturity, an accumulation of expertise and professionalism with respect to the human rights enabled Morocco to gain a credibility in the international community in various issues, including the security aspect related to the fight against terrorism and migration. These accumulations have made neighboring countries, both in the Northern Mediterranean and Africa, consider Morocco the sole and reliable interlocutor within the African region. The article of the Spanish newspaper El Pais on the Director General of both directorates the National Security and Territory Security is evidence of what is going on in the behind the scenes of  European security decision officials, of the importance of cooperation with the Moroccan security and counterterrorism agencies. The Sabha Libyan suicide bomber by a member of the Polisario militia has brought us to a whole new stage in dealing with the terrorist threat in the Sahara and Sahel region The international community must understand the important role that Morocco plays individually in confronting the coordination of Polisario militias and terrorist organizations in the region Neighboring countries are absent, and even deliberately, lack of security cooperation between their neighbors.

Rabat – Back in Morocco, Loubna Abidar has spoken out about the fallout she faced since her starring role in Nabil Ayouch’s controversial movie “Much Loved.” In an interview with Med Radio, the Moroccan actress opened up about what she went through over her leading role in the film about sex workers, accusing Moroccan filmmaker Nabil Ayouch of betraying her trust by broadcasting some erotic scenes of the film that she did not agree with.  Ayouch promised Abidar th at there would be no shocking scenes in the movie, nothing that would not be allowed in French television.  “Nabil Ayouch has ruined my life and compromised my future; he didn’t keep his promises,” said Abidar. She added that the 49-year-old producer used her image and bad press to promote his film.   Abidar fled Morocco for France in 2015 after she was allegedly “savagely beaten” by an unknown assailant on the street in Casablanca. Feeling better in France where she has been living for three years, the actress revealed that she will soon acquire French citizenship.  “When I went to France, I had a residence permit for skills and talents, and since I received a certificate while waiting for the passport and therefore the French nationality,” she said.  Despite controversy over the Moroccan movie, Abidar won several awards for her performance. Abidar won a Valois for best actress during the Francophone Festival of Angouleme in 2015. She received the Golden Bayard Best Actress Award in Belgium at the International Francophone Film Festival in October  2015.  She was also nominated in 2016 for best actress for the César, the French version of the Oscars.

Rabat – The head of government has finally reacted to the controversy over the use of Darija (Moroccan Arabic) in primary education school books. Saad Eddine El Othmani said on Sunday that Darija cannot be used in education “because first, the official languages recognized by the Constitution are Arabic and Tamazight.” The official stressed also that the law that governs “this operation and which is examined in the parliament, insisted on the obligation of the use of the language in question, without any other, and this to prevent the use of the dialect.” On Wednesday, September 5, as children across the country began the school year, citizens heavily criticized the government and the Ministry of Education for including Darija, an unwritten dialect of Arabic, in textbooks. School books included words in Darija, including the words “baghrir” (Moroccan crepe) and “briouat” (a salty or sweet puff pastry). “We can not admit expressions, sentences or paragraphs in Moroccan dialect in textbooks,” El Othmani told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The official described the decision to exclude Darija was an “irreversible” decision. A source from the Ministry of Communication, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Morocco World News today that textbooks were not discussed in Parliament before they were released because an official committee takes care of the new textbooks. The committee submitted a review of their consultation to the Ministry of Education. The source added that the new school books could be modified, but, despite El Othmani’s statement, the government has supported the new school books so far. The education minister also “strongly” defended the new school books, according to MWN’s source. The use of Darija in textbooks sparked outrage, mockery, and confusion among parents and scholars. In response to pictures of “fake” pages from school books, El Othmani  called on citizens to refrain from promoting and sharing fake contents. He said the pictures were taken of non-Moroccan books. He added that such content leads to confusion, especially for parents and creates a state of negativity at a time when Morocco is in the process of reforming education and training. After the release of school books for the start of the new school year, some pictures of textbook contents went viral. Some of the pictures reportedly did not represent actual school book content. Some textbooks included some traditional Moroccan children’s songs in Darija, transliterated into Latin letters as well as written in Arabic characters. Some Moroccan public figures welcomed the use of Darija in textbooks as the dialect represents Moroccan culture. However, several scholars slammed its use, calling the Ministry of Education’s defense “excuses.” Moroccan sociologist Ali Chaabani told Morocco World News that the decision will cause confusion among students and society. The professor said that Moroccan parents will be forced to send their children to foreign schools to provide their children with an “appropriate education.” The president of the National Coalition for the Defense of the Arabic Language, Fouad Abou Ali, also condemned the decision. Abou Ali told Morocco World News that Moroccan Arabic is a means to communicate, but cannot be a tool for education. He explained that the Darija dialect varies across the country. For example, one textbook used the Darija word “baghrir” for a Moroccan crepe, a word that is not universal. Abou Ali said that not everyone calls it “baghrir,” giving eastern Morocco as an example, where people call the crepe “khringo.” Both Chaabani and Abou Ali called on the government to revise the decision. On September 6, the ministry released a statement to explain the use of Darija in school books. The ministry argued that using Moroccan Arabic in school books is based on several pedagogical principles, including approaching students in their culture. The ministry asserted that it is normal to use Moroccan words for items that define Moroccan culture, including “chribil” (traditional slippers) and “akika” (a family ceremony celebrating birth). Government ready to give up on new school books The head of government said that his cabinet is ready to meet the requests of citizens. “We have no problem to give up these school books and ask the ministry … to give up these school books” after a potential consultation with educators, linguists, commissions, and the Higher Council of Education, Training, and Scientific Research. However, for El Othmani the issue does not form a “fundamental part” of the reform. He said not all school books included Darija. However, allowing Darija in some books does not signify leniency towards including the Moroccan dialect in textbooks and educational programs. The head of government also said that he called on Minister of Education Said Amzazi to give more explanations to the public. Morocco is a multicultural country with a number of spoken languages and dialects, including Tamazight (Berber) and Hassani, a Sahrawi language.  Will the new school books confuse students whose mother tongue is Hassani or Tamazight, not Darija? The Moroccan constitution only recognizes Tamazight and standard Arabic.

Rabat – Morocco’s embassy in Japan has said that there were no reported Moroccan victims from Thursday’s strong earthquake. On Thursday, September 6, a powerful earthquake rocked Japan’s northernmost island, Hokkaido. The natural disaster caused damages to roads and buildings and left the northern island’s 5.3 million residents without power. The 6.7-magnitude quake hit the island at about 3 a.m. local time at a depth of Q40 kilometers. The embassy reassured citizens that it is following “very closely developments in the areas affected by the two natural disasters and remains mobilized to ensure the safety of members of the Moroccan community, in coordination with the Japanese authorities.” Thursday’s earthquake was the second major disaster to hit Japan in two days. At least 11 people have been killed and 600 injured since Typhoon Jebi hit the country on Tuesday September 4. The storm is believed to be the most powerful natural disaster to hit Japan in 25 years.

Rabat – To combat undocumented migration, the European Commission has pledged more security cooperation with Morocco. Morocco, a transit and destination country for migrants, has thwarted more than 54,000 undocumented immigration attempts in 2018. Moroccan authorities are also overseeing security at the Morocco-Spain border, where hundreds of migrants try to jump the high double fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. European Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos responded to a question on border security, saying that the EU and Morocco are in “regular contact to strengthen their cooperation on migration and security.” The commissioner also pointed out the importance of the cooperation between Spain and Morocco to tackle border security and migration issues. “Spain and Morocco are cooperating continuously and closely in the field of border control in order to reduce the number of illegal crossings and the risk of potential terrorist infiltration,” he said. He also spoke about the security bodies in cooperation to provide constant surveillance in the Mediterranean to prevent undocumented immigration and cross-border crime. Following Thursday’s government council in Morocco on September 6, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi claimed that Morocco will not let its territory shelter human trafficking networks. The official also told the press that the North African country “refuses to play the policeman in the region.” El Khalfi’s remarks followed a presentation by Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit during the government council. Laftit discussed new measures to fight undocumented immigration while following the guidelines of Morocco’s 2013 migration policy. Touting Morocco’s achievements since the implementation of the policy, El Khalfi recalled the two operations to regularize the legal and administrative situation of migrants in Morocco in 2014 and 2018. The government regularized the status of 50,000 undocumented migrants, 90 percent of whom were from sub-Saharan Africa. El Khalfi said that 22,000 migrants have benefited from voluntary return operations since 2014, including 1,400 in 2018. He added that Moroccan authorities frustrated 54,000 undocumented immigration attempts and thwarted 74 criminal human trafficking groups, seizing 1,900 boats.

Rabat – Marrakech is getting its own trendy avenue: M Avenue. The immense project, scheduled to open in 2019, will give the red city a new face, displaying modernity, culture, and entertainment. M Avenue will begin as an extension of Avenue Moulay El Hassan, which leads west from Marrakech’s medina (walled city) towards Hay Menara neighborhood. The avenue will lead up to and end at the Avenue de la Menara, near the Four Seasons Resort. The promoter of the project, Nabil Slitine, who is also general manager of the Downtown Hotel Corporation, shared some details about the new avenue that he calls “revolutionary for the touristic city.” Speaking to Morocco World News, Slitine explained that M Avenue will be a multi-faceted and innovative project in Marrakech, hosting a mix of hotels, residences, offices, shops, restaurants, and art galleries. The project builds on the history of Marrakech, which began with its foundation in 1062, by Youssef ben Tachfine, the head of the Almoravid dynasty. The Almoravids established schools of Qur’anic theology and conquered all of Morocco. Ben Tachfine is considered the father of Morocco. Marrakech’s rich past has attracted scores of tourists and many celebrities to the city, an asset Slitine’s plan expects to capitalize on. “This unprecedented project has already attracted big names, including football star Cristiano Ronaldo who chose M Avenue to open his first hotel Pestana CR7 in Africa,” he said. The general manager came up with the idea while travelling the world. “I told myself there was still something missing in Marrakech. We had this land of 5 hectares next to the hotel Four Season. The M Avenue idea came to me to really create a concept, especially cultural, with several components.” Slitine’s ambition was to launch a new urban destination in Marrakech with a residential sector, a cultural sector, and a business center. “Our vision is to create a destination that represents the new Marrakech. When people come to Marrakech, they see this side that we all know: the traditional one. With the M avenue, I want them to see the other side, the one we want to create through artistic work and new concepts with modern architecture,” explained Slitine to MWN. In the mid 1990s, Nabil Slitine obtained a civil engineering degree, as well as a master’s in business administration in the United States, where he lived for 16 years. Slitine worked as an engineer and manager in several multinational companies before he decided to create his company: a startup focused on new technologies and the internet. He met immediate success. Feeling homesick, the entrepreneur decided in 2006 to come back to Marrakech, where he was appointed general manager of EHC Morocco, a subsidiary of Kingdom Hotel Investments. His first major project was to develop and build the Four Seasons Resort Marrakech, as well as the 43 villas and riads that surround it. In 2012, he formed the Downtown Hotel Corporation with international investors. For the past three years, he has been working on the M Avenue project. Slitine wants to offer the visitor an interactive and immersive trip beyond the handicrafts of Morocco and the landscapes of Marrakech, to bring him to understand the city beyond the scenes of the medina, and to interest him in the palace gardens. M Avenue started construction in 2017, and the total project will cost MAD 680 million, revealed Slitine to MWN. It covers an area of 5 hectares with a mix of hotels, residences, offices, shops, restaurants, cafes, art galleries, and a cultural center. The residential component occupies 95,000 square meters. Downtown Hotel Corporation (DHC) has signed an agreement with Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts to develop 96 residences under the brand Four Seasons Private Residences Marrakech and M Avenue. The 500-meter-long avenue will be composed of 20,000 square meters of commercial space, 65 residential apartments under the brand M Residence, 88 Four Seasons apartments, the 174-room CR7 hotel, a 4,5000 square meter business center, and a luxury clinic. In addition to a luxury concierge service, future apartment owners will benefit from valet parking and security as well as all the services of the Four Seasons Hotel Marrakech. The first apartments will be delivered this year, say the promoters of the project. Slitine is also launching a project called M Bab (door), a cultural avenue that extends beyond M Avenue about 4,000 square meters. The building and multimedia scenography will be created by a team of spatial media specialists from the German Tamschick Media and Space and the Spanish Boris Micka Associates. M Avenue also includes a business center occupying 4,500 square meters, and the rest is dedicated to gardens and landscaped areas. Indeed, the vision of the project is to make it a trendy international destination for design, fashion, recreation, and culture. The project even attracted the interest of the US daily New York Times, which wrote about the project’s ambitions on August 29. M Avenue seeks to enhance Marrakech’s reputation as a tourist hub. On travel lists, the red city ranks as the top destination to visit in Morocco. In 2017 alone, Marrakech received two million tourists. Several celebrities fell in love with the red city, such as American singers John Legend and Katy Perry; Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias; football stars David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and Zinedine Zidane; actors Will Smith, Salma Hayek, Jennifer Aniston; and recently the queen of pop, Madonna, who spent her “magical” 60th birthday there. The city maintains a vibrant nightlife. In the modernized areas, clubs and casinos are open late, while the historic Jemaa el-Fna, one of the largest open-air markets in the world, reaches the peak of its wonder at night. “Marrakech has been able to develop its product through the creation of 22,500 beds since 2010, due to the increase in investment and the support and monitoring of tourism projects,” said the regional tourism delegate in Marrakech, Fadoua Chbani Idrissi, to the Maghreb Arab Press Agency (MAP) earlier this year.

Rabat – France’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian will visit Morocco on Monday, September 10. The French ministry’s website listed the visit as part of Le Drian’s official agenda. The ministry did not give more details about Le Drian’s visit. However, local and international news outlets reported that Le Drian will meet his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita and other officials. The news platforms also speculated that Le Drian’s main objective is to prepare for a future visit of French President Emmanuel Macron in early 2019. Maghreb Confidential reported on August 30 that Macron is expected to visit Morocco in November. The newspaper added that Macron agreed to a prospective visit to Morocco after King Mohammed VI invited him to the launch of Morocco’s first high-speed train, expected to be completed by November.  Morocco’s high-speed train project entered the pre-operation phase in June, and total completion was scheduled towards the end of the year. During his visit to Morocco, Le Drian, along with Moroccan senior officials, is also expected to discuss migration. Le Drian’s latest visit to Morocco was in October 2017, when he held talks with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Both the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its French counterpart describe the partnership between Paris and Rabat as “exceptional.” In his October visit, Le Drian’s ministry called Morocco a “strategic partner for peace and stability” in the region. “With its return to the African Union and its plan to join the Economic Community of West African States, Morocco plays a growing role in Africa,” said the ministry, noting that cooperation in Africa is a critical issue for Morocco and France. With more than $4.72 billion-worth of exports, France was Morocco’s biggest buyer of goods in 2016 and its second-biggest supplier with Morocco importing goods worth $5.18 billion from France in 2016.

Rabat – Herve Renard does not like latecomers! Herve Renard has explained why Amine Harit did not play in Morocco’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier game with Malawi. “Harit has a disciplinary sanction,” Renard explained. “We must respect the hours when we are in a group.

Rabat – Moroccan football player Mehdi Benatia has allegedly asked for a contract renewal with the Old Lady. Italian football outlet Calciomercato reported on September 8 that the footballer has not made any appearances this season with his Italian football club. According to Calciomercato, the footballer’s contract will expire on June 30, 2020. The footballer has requested a contract renewal with this Italian team. Benatia was also missing from the list of players chosen by Herve Renard for Morocco’s CAN 2019 qualifier against Malawi. Benatia’s absence opened doors for speculations. When Renard’s list was released, Moroccan fans were surprised to see Benatia’s name absent from the list. Local news outlets reported that Benatia suffered an injury and Juventus sent the national team a medical file on the player. Benatia, however, denied the story on his personal social media networks. “I want to deny the information published in some media of the Moroccan press that a certificate was sent from my club. This is false, no certificate was sent simply because I am not injured,” said the footballer. “I’m fine alhamdulillah [praise God]. When a player is injured, he must come to have his injury validated by the national team doctor, but that is not my case. So, stop lying, stop inventing things because I am fed up,” he added. From 2017-2018, Benatia spent all season long on the bench, although he was chosen to play in the 2018 World Cup for Morocco. Explaining his absence from the pitch with the national team for the CAN qualifier, the footballer said that he wants to focus on his career with Juventus. It remains to be seen whether Benatia will take part in Morocco’s next CAN 2019 qualifier game. The Atlas Lions played an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Saturday, September 8, in Casablanca. The Moroccan team secured a win over Malawi: 3-0.

By Anna Schaeffer Rabat – One under-researched branch of exploitation in Morocco reverses the stereotypical paradigm of prostitution: female tourists traveling for sex. And it’s on the rise.  Prostitution often exploits the vulnerable in a society, and Morocco is no exception; Assabah estimates there are 5,000 houses and villas dedicated to sex tourism in Casablanca alone. Most often, the concept of sex tourism brings to mind abused women and children; this manifestation of sex tourism is undoubtedly a crucial issue demanding response. The significantly understudied practice of female sex tourism, though, can be just as exploitative, abusive, and critical. But far too often, it goes unaddressed.  What is female sex tourism? Wealthy, predominantly white Western women travel—primarily to once-colonized nations in the Caribbean, Central America, and Africa—to visit male prostitutes, often much younger in age. Women “pay” their companion with clothes, food, and gifts, if not cash. Popular destinations, marked by beaches and a critical mass of underemployed men, include Costa Rica, Nepal, Thailand, and Egypt—and Morocco. With the overwhelming majority of scholarly attention focused on male sex tourism, female sex tourism remains both under-reported and understudied. UNICEF and Amnesty International do not even offer official policy on the topic. But the practice dates back to at least 1900, and more than half a million women engaged in sex-based travel between 1980 and 2005.  A report published by the International Coalition for Responsible and Respectful Tourism indicates the resurgence of Morocco’s sex tourism industry. Goodwill Ambassador Khalid Semmouni pointed to globalization, border accessibility, and sex tourism as interconnected elements. People are attracted to what they perceive as exotic, he added. Angelo A. Camillo devoted a whole chapter of his “Handbook of Research on Global Hospitality and Tourism Management” to female sex tourism and its “privileges and problems.” He defines the practice as usually involving consumers from wealthier nations and prostitutes from poorer, less-developed counterparts. The “First World” exploits the “Third World.” Sex tourism thrives in poverty. Who are these women? Jane is 67. For the past decade, she has spent vacations in West Africa, where the men “make you feel like a real woman.” “I don’t mind paying for their drinks and meals if they stay the night.” One member of online penpal forum Interpals wrote: “I know of the trend of women going to other countries looking basically for a younger man to have sex with, the female version of sex tourism. They often go to countries like Morocco… because some of the younger men there, for whatever reason, make them feel young and attractive again.”  In response, another member wrote, “They sure aren’t picky, most of those women are well past their prime, late 30’s, 40’s, 50’s… all what they want is to have a man notice them and make them feel ‘feminine’ and desirable, the much younger Moroccan men are eager to oblige and shower them with attention and honeyed words.” So who is exploiting whom? Even without direct cash exchange, varying forms of “payment”—clothing, meals, shelter, gifts—reveal the relationship is a glorified business transaction. In 2006, 38-year-old Jackie lived in London but vacationed abroad, and sex tourism proved a major element of those international trips. She told The Observer she sees nothing wrong with what she does. “He tells me what all the things I want to hear, and I guess in return I pay for everything—meals, accommodation, transport, tours—and buy him gifts. But that is because I have much more money than he does. It is mutually beneficial.” Chris Beddoe, UK director of End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking (ECPAT), acknowledged that two consenting adult partners can have an ethical relationship, but female sex tourism is a whole separate issue. “If both adult partners are open and honest about what they’re getting out of it, that’s one thing. But it’s another thing to continue the fantasy when there’s a denial of the power that money brings to that relationship that creates a culture of dependency and exploitation.” “A dime a dozen” The 2005 film Heading South depicts three older white American and Canadian women traveling to Haiti for sex with local young men. Ellen, a Boston professor, tells one of her friends, “Stop pretending you just came here to get a nice tan.” “I mean, think of those cute boys. They are a dime a dozen. Take your pick… If you are too shy to pay them, just give them gifts.” The three women continue sexual relationships with multiple Haitian boys, many of whom are still teenagers. “I always told myself that when I’m old I’d pay young men to love me,” says Ellen. Ulrich Seidl’s 2012 film “Paradise: Love” follows a similar storyline: 50-year-old white Teresa from Austria on a birthday trip to Kenya, where a group of European “sugar mamas” introduce her to the world of female sex tourism. Teresa solicits sex from younger men, paying not directly for sex but instead dishing out cash for “medical needs” or other necessities required by her partner.  She feels at the beginning like prey but quickly assumes the role of predator. Lead actress Margarethe Tiesel said of her “Paradise: Love” role, “The exploited begin to exploit in a place where they have power.” A lingering effect of colonization The legacy of colonization continues to affect Morocco in myriad ways; the stereotypes perpetuated by colonial ideas of Arab men as either dangerous or exotic, or both, likely play a role in Morocco’s allure as a sex tourist destination. Macquarie University Professor Hsu-Ming Teo explained the romanticized, and often sexualized, image of the Arab man and “the Orient.” Although this idea waned with the end of colonialism, she said, it gained traction again in the 1960s and 1970s.  Camillo, the author of the aforementioned chapter on Privileges and Problems of Female Sex Tourism, concludes that the practice “[relies] upon and [reinforces] historically entrenched national and cultural demarcations that tend to marginalize the people (partners, families, communities) of targeted destinations in the developing world.” Shirley-Anne Tate, Carnegie School of Education professor and cultural sociologist, calls female sex tourism “deeply colonial [and] heteronormative.” “Thus, ‘conventional romance formulas’ [are inappropriate] because neither the sexual violence of slavery nor ideology of imperialism can be written out of understanding romance.” Playwright Tanika Gupta wrote her theatrical production “Sugar Mummies” about this very concept, specifically the industry in Jamaica. To research the phenomenon she traveled to Jamaica, where older women bragged about their local lovers. The female sex tourists even shared the advice that men in Cuba and the Dominican Republic, in comparison to men in Jamaica, are “dirt cheap.” One tourist quipped, “You can go as young as you want in Cuba.” Gupta said the “terrible mutual delusion” she witnessed during the research period shocked her. “And you do find yourself thinking, ‘We’re not a million miles from slavery.’” What about the men? Some female students spending the summer in Morocco, whether from the US, Australia, or Europe, express hopes of finding a “Moroccan boyfriend:” an “exotic” or “foreign” love for their semester abroad. Author Claire Harris interviewed an Australian tourist named Sharee, whose relationship with her Moroccan boyfriend encourages her to continue visiting Essaouira. Harris said other Western women she spoke with used “mildly patronizing terms,” such as “exotic” or “cute,” to describe their Moroccan partners. For men on the other side of the equation, though, emotional hurt can be a real element of catering the sex tourist.  Heidi Postlewait, co-author of “Emergency Sex and Other Desperate Measures,” challenged the popular idea of a male sex worker. “Our idea of a male prostitute is like Richard Gere and that wasn’t what this was at all. This was really a poor African man who lived in a shack and had a miserable life and had to [expletive] women to make a living.” Joe Hayns contributed a chapter to “Masculinities Under Neoliberalism,” in which he discusses contemporary masculinity concepts for Moroccan men, including those engaging with female sex tourists. “Some men I knew suffered a degree of emotional hurt from being acted upon (and acting) as embodiments of European fantasies. One friend, for example, occasionally needed me to explain the amorous messages of white Europeans. He was one woman’s ‘Berber nomad,’ and another’s ‘Aladdin.’ A third woman wished he would fly to Europe ‘on his magic carpet.’”  “My friend, like other men I knew, sometimes performed these stereotypes—he ‘cooned’—with wide smiles, and other times with gritted teeth. Certainly, he was not unusual amongst such men in suffering acute periods of grief.” The consequences Tom A. Peter, a GlobalPost correspondent in the Middle East, analyzed the unwanted consequences of sex tourism for both tourists and men in Jordan and Egypt. Women seeking “exotic sexual encounters” can find a handful of Bedouin guides offering such services, but not without developing a sexually-stereotyped desert tour culture in the process.  “It’s also created a climate where both guides and female tourists uninterested in sex or a relationship find themselves burdened by unwanted advances.” Twenty-three-year-old Lucy from London told the Independent about her luxury stay in St Lucia “for 10 days of pure pampering—and ideally a sexual encounter.” She said she was “keen to find a St Lucian man… I’d heard they were very well endowed.” She found Sandi. “Sandi and I had a great time. On his day off, he took us to a local street party. I paid for taxis, drinks and food.”  “We needed his protection because St Lucian men had certain misconceptions about white women—although I probably wasn’t helping.” Nirpal Singh Dhaliwal authored “Tourism,” a novel ironically narrating relationships between older white women and younger men of color. He pulls no punches defining female sex tourism in the book.  “Women enjoy casual sex and prostitution, too, but with far more hypocrisy. They help themselves to men in the developing world, kidding themselves that it’s a ‘holiday romance’ that has nothing to do with the money they spend.”

Rabat – Casablanca’s stadium vibrated tonight as the Moroccan football team beat Malawi 3-0 in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Although there was a lack of harmonized play between the footballers, the Atlas Lions secured a win tonight against Malawi. Morocco opened the score tonight.  In the third minute of the game, Ajax star Hakim Ziyech scored the first goal for Morocco. The Moroccan team scored its second goal through Youssef En-Nesyri in the 42nd minute of the match. The Atlas Lions dominated ball possession but missed several opportunities to score more points, especially in the first half. The Malawi team rolled up its defensive sleeves in the second half; more than five members of their team played inside and nearby the penalty zone. The Moroccan team also made some passing mistakes throughout the game. Coming up against Malawi’s defense skills, the Atlas Lions made several attempts to increase their score. Morocco made its first substitution in the 27th minute, when Herve Renard changed Nabil Dirar with Marzaoui Noussair. In the 82nd minute, a mistake from the Malawi goalkeeper gave Morocco a final goal through En-Nesyri. One minute after Morocco’s goal, Renard made another change, replacing Faycal Fajr with Ayoub El Kaabi. The Moroccan forward, El Kaabi, made several attempts in Malawi’s penalty zone, but could not secure a goal in tonight’s qualifier. In a pre-match conference, the coach said that the game is “important” for the team. Morocco’s head coach was confident that his men would play wellt during tonight’s game. “This generation of players deserves to go far in the competition [CAN 2019], but we still have a lot of work to do.”

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign minister called on all concerned actors to prepare for the next phase following the fisheries agreement with the EU. “After the signing of the agreement, there is still a long way to go, especially the battle that will take place at the European Parliament,” Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita said Friday, September 7, in a statement published by state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Bourita spoke at a meeting on the “Morocco-EU negotiations on the fisheries agreement” at the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Borders, National Defense, and Occupied Zones at the House of Councillors in Parliament. Before entering into effect, the fisheries agreement must pass through the European Parliament and receive approval by all 28 EU member states. “The battle requires support from the various actors, parliamentarians and supporters, in order to consolidate the achievements made by Morocco in this matter,” Bourita added. The Moroccan foreign minister stated that Morocco had set “red lines” in its negotiations over the renewal of the fisheries agreement. They included “the kingdom’s national sovereignty, bringing the agreement in line with the national fisheries strategy, and the need to consider sustainability of resources and their control.” The agreement, which allows European fishing boats to operate in Moroccan waters for compensation, excluded the Mediterranean Sea in order to preserve Morocco’s fishery resources. Bourita also stressed “the strict delimitation of the geographical area covered by the agreement.” Article 1 of the fisheries agreement stipulates that “the fishing area extends from parallel 35 to parallel 22, meaning from Cape Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in the south.” The minister also emphasized the strong involvement of the population’s representatives in the Morocco-EU partnership. Morocco’s concerned regional councils, including those of the southern provinces, approved minutes in which they supported the negotiation process in accordance with the red lines Morocco had set, Bourita added. On September, 2, a delegation from the European Parliament arrived in Morocco to evaluate “the benefits of the fisheries agreements” to the local population in Western Sahara. The delegation, which included deputies from the Committee on International Trade (INTA), met representatives of public authorities and NGOs during their stay in Dakhla and Laayoune in the southern provinces. The chairman of the Moroccan-European Union Joint Parliamentary Committee, Abderrahim Atmoun, welcomed the visit.  He also expressed hopes that “the next stage of voting on the two agreements, agricultural and fisheries, will tend to maintain the strong ties binding the two parties extending to all other areas of cooperation, including the political, technical and cultural cooperation as well as security.”

Rabat – Pamela Anderson’s love story with French-Moroccan football player Adil Rami might be over.  According to American tabloid TMZ, the “Baywatch” actress ended things with France’s World Cup champion after he proposed to her. She supposedly felt like he needed to spend more time with his children, 2-year-old twin boys.  The pair met in May 2017 during the Grand Prix in Monaco. The 51-year-old actress has left the home she shared with the footballer in Marseille, the south of France, but is still in France where she will participate in the television show “Danse avec les stars” (the French version of “Dancing with the Stars”).  Anderson moved to Marseille earlier this year to be closer to her 32-year-old boyfriend. TMZ added that Pamela Anderson gave her eldest son, Brandon, the ring Rami had given her this summer. Contacted by media outlet Page Six, a close source to Anderson explained that the actress chose to make a “sacrifice for her love.” “Pamela has the feeling that Adil doesn’t spend enough time with his children. She is removing herself from his life so he can do the right thing and be with his kids,” added the source.  Rami has reacted to the TMZ article. In an Instagram story, the football player simply wrote, “Gossip sells,” leaving his fans with a vague explanation concerning his relationship with the Canadian model.  Rami has already faced wedding rumors after winning the 2018 World Cup trophy with France.  The football player, who proudly expressed his Moroccan roots during the World cup,  denied the rumors of a possible marriage with the star. “No, no, no, I’m not engaged,” he replied, smiling, in a video posted by Closer.

Rabat- Morocco’s foreign affairs minister summoned the Dutch Ambassador to Morocco Friday over the Netherlands’ continued criticism of the Hirak sentences. Reacting to Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok’s report on the Hirak presented Thursday to the Dutch Parliament, Nasser Bourita told the Dutch ambassador, Desiree Bonis, that Morocco utterly rejects the report. According to Bourita, the report contains inaccurate facts and is a direct interference in Morocco’s domestic affairs, stemming from a lack of respect for the country’s judicial system, reported Moroccan news outlet Hespress. Bourita informed Bonis that Morocco has decided to suspend a meeting scheduled for the end of September between the two foreign ministers. Bourita also reminded Bonis of Morocco’s rejection of Blok’s previous remarks and of any interference from foreign parliaments. He stressed that the situation in Morocco’s Rif is not a diplomatic issue but an internal one. Morocco also opposed Dutch comments on the Hirak movement in April. Blok remarked in a press briefing after his April meeting with Bourita that the Moroccan government “had not been effective in responding to the grievances of the people who took to the streets.” Moroccan authorities arrested activists involved in the Hirak Rif protest movement in 2016 and 2017. In June, 54 activists and journalists were sentenced to 1-20 years in prison. After the court issued the Hirak sentences, Blok warned Moroccan-Dutch activists to be careful when visiting Morocco, emphasizing that once in Morocco, police consider bi-nationals as Moroccans only. In his recent report, Blok wrote that his country’s embassy attended the hearing of the Hirak activists who were sentenced at the Casablanca Court of Appeal. Blok commented on King Mohammed VI’s royal pardon granted to some Hirak prisoners, but mentioned that one Hirak leader, Nasser Zefzafi, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, was excluded from the pardon. According to Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, the King pardoned 184 Hirak prisoners on the eve of Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice), August 21. The Netherlands’ “interference” may influence the “very good” relationship that Morocco and the European country enjoy.  The two countries are currently collaborating on a wide range of strategic issues, including education, health, agriculture, and fishing. During his visit to Rabat in April, Blok expressed the Netherlands’ interest in reinforcing ties in the fields of justice, fighting terrorism, and crime-related issues. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.  The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, but especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in “unauthorized” protests. Following the ruling of the Casablanca court, hundreds of Moroccans rallied in protests in cities across the country, including Casablanca Rabat, and the northern city of Nador, to denounce the “heavy” sentences. International NGOs and politicians, such as El Othmani, expressed solidarity with the detainees. El Othmani regretted that his government could not intervene in the Hirak Rif case, because the judiciary is an independent authority. Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid emphasized the government’s willingness to extend favor to the remaining detained Hirak activists. He said Zefzafi and others might be released if they “act wisely and clear-sightedly.” Eight days after being sentenced to 20 years, prominent Hirak Rif activists, including Zefzafi, refused to appeal against their sentences and went on a temporary hunger strike. Hirak activist Rabie El Ablaq reportedly went on a hunger strike for more than 40 days, but suspended the strike in July. Meanwhile, Zefzafi began another hunger strike that lasted six days to protest “torture” and “harassment” he said he experiences in Casablanca’s local prison, Oukacha.  Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi’, announced his son’s hunger strike in a video posted on Thursday, August 30, stating that Zefzafi “only asks for the rights that other prisoners enjoy: that he be taken out of isolation in a solitary cell and put him in a dignified cell where he can see and talk” with the other jailed activists. Currently, all of the detained activists, including Zefzafi have appealed their sentences, except Rabie El Ablaq. The 53 activists are awaiting another trial.

Rabat – Moroccan football player Younes Belhanda is facing the consequences of his actions.  The Turkish Football Federation punished the Atlas Lion by suspending him from playing three games after he was given a red card for violently kicking a Trabzonspor player.  Belhanda was playing with his team Galatasaray against Trabzonspor last Saturday when he kicked his opponent. Following the game, the midfielder also had an angry confrontation with a Turkish fan. Following Galatasaray’s 4-0 loss, Belhanda faced angry fans in the airport who blamed him for the loss. One of the disappointed fans shouted at Belhanda: “Go home.” Irritated by the comment, Herve Renard’s player harshly insulted the fan in Darija (Moroccan Arabic). Belhanda’s insults were recorded, posted online, and the video soon went viral. Two weeks earlier, Belhanda was rumored to return to the French league, as he was courted by his former club OGC Nice for a loan.  However, the president of the OGC Nice Jean-Pierre Rivere explained yesterday to French outlet France Bleu Azur why the return of the Moroccan was not made this summer. “Belhanda has a 4 million euros salary per year. For France, it’s €700,000 a month. We’re discussing with his president if he can lend him to us a year because Younes loves OGC Nice,” said Rivere. “Since Younes is doing very good during the games, it has to be €10 million for a transfer and €4 million salary per year … It’s impossible for the OGC Nice,” he added.  Suspension aside, the 28-year-old will play Malawi alongside the Atlas Lions tonight, September 8, in the Mohammed V Stadium of Casablanca for the 2019 CAN qualifiers.

Rabat – Morocco’s national football coach Herve Renard explained his choice of 25 players for the Morocco-Malawi qualifier for the 2019 CAN. The Atlas Lions will play the Flames tonight, September 8, at the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca, starting at 9 p.m. (Moroccan time) in the run up to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). On the eve of the game, Renard held a press conference.  “It’s an important game for us. This generation of players deserves to go far in the competition [CAN 2019], but we still have a lot of work to do,” said the coach. The 49-year-old Frenchman also explained his choice of players.  On social media, the former coach of Lille was criticized for choosing players like Achraf Bencharki and M’barek Boussoufa instead of players like Walid Azaro and Sofiane Boufal. “Boussoufa is here because he deserves to be here. He will not be playing at the beginning of the game, but I wanted him to be here. He will eventually quit the national team because he’s not that young anymore, but in the meantime he is still important to me.”  Talking about Bencharki, Renard said that he “needed to see him again” calling him “multitalented.”  “You all know that I have 25 players, but only 18 will play this game. I am the coach of the team so I do what I feel is better.”  Concerning the speculations around the absence of the team’s captain, Mehdi Benatia, from the lineup, Renard wanted to clarify the situation once and for all, shutting down all the rumors of conflicts between them.  Local media were quick to jump to conclusions, reporting tensions between the coach and the captain since the end of the 2018 World Cup when Benatia made a statement blaming “people close to the team” after Morocco’s loss in the second game against Portugal. Benatia responded to Moroccan media tweeting that Renard is not just a coach for him but also a friend. Media also reported that Benatia was injured before he denied it. “Between Mehdi Benatia and me, there is of course no problem. He is someone I really appreciate. When you are a coach, you call your captain, you ask him where he is in his training, you know like me that he had a training [with Juventus] where he does not have all the time to play,” said the coach, explaining that Benatia wanted to focus on having a good season with his club, Juventus.  “As long as I’m there with the Moroccan national team, the door will always be open because he has brought us a lot. And if it is otherwise, it’s part of a coach’s life or a player’s career making decisions that are sometimes difficult,” added Renard, who said he wanted to focus on today’s important game.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Energy has given British Sound Energy a production concession for the company’s Tendrara natural gas discovery in eastern Morocco. James Parsons, Sound Energy’s CEO, said, “I am delighted with the award of the first development concession in Eastern Morocco, which is a critical step in commercialising our gas discovery.”  He added, “The Company continues to make excellent progress on all fronts, including FEED, the gas sales agreement and ground works at TE-9.” Sound Energy announced the concession on its website Thursday, September 6. The British company anticipated its first gas production to be in two years at an “expected mid case production rate” of about 60 million cubic feet per day over a 10-year period. The company will drill an additional 10 to 13 wells “to maintain this production rate.” The production concession area covers 133.5 square kilometers and is based on a development plan which includes drilling 5 new horizontal development wells and “recompletion of the existing TE-6 and TE-7 wells.” The plan also requires building “a gas treatment plant, compression station,” and a 120-kilometer-long pipeline of 20 inches wide. The gas and oil company expects to make a “final investment decision once key development milestones have been secured.” This includes securing a “gas sales agreement, capital funding and local regulatory formalities.” On August 31, Sound Energy signed a new eight-year petroleum agreement with the National Office of Hydrocarbon and Mines (ONHYM) in Tendrara region. It will come into effect after the approval of the Moroccan finance and energy ministries. The new petroleum agreement, named “Greater Tendrara Petroleum Agreement,” covers an area of approximately 14,500 square kilometers extending across eastern Morocco and “surrounding the development concession application area relating to the Tendrara gas discovery.” Following the petroleum agreement’s implementation, Sound Energy will hold 47.5 percent of the Greater Tendrara licensed area. Schlumberger holds 27.5 percent and the remaining 25 percent will be held by ONHYM.

Rabat- The government council has approved Bill 31.18 to prevent the selling of others’ property without their knowledge using forged documents. The government has stepped up to protect citizens’ property rights from real estate fraud, known to the public as the “mafia of property.” The move comes nearly two years after King Mohammed VI’s message, urging for measures against real estate fraud, to the justice minister Mustapha Ramid, who is currently the human rights minister. Bill 31.18, approved on Thursday, September 6, is set to complete the royal decree of Ramadan 9, 1331 (August 12, 1913) on the code of obligations and contracts. The bill will enable bodies in charge of documentation in real estate agencies to obtain clear legal authority which will regulate the powers of civil companies’ legal representative. It will enhance “documentary and contractual security as well as protection of rights and property.” According to Article 2 of the 2011 Law 39.08 related to rights of property, people whose property has been sold fraudulently must file a complaint within four years. If they wait for more than four years, they will lose ownership of the property. Many foreigners and Moroccans residing abroad who had bought lands or houses in Morocco came back to find that someone had illegally sold their properties to others. Many other Moroccan families have been thrown out of houses they inherited or apartments they occupied for years. Ramid suggested at the Parliament in 2014 that Moroccans or foreigners with property in the country should verify every four years whether their properties are still registered under their names, even if they had already registered their property title. In June, the minister of justice, Mohamed Aujjar, promised fraudulent sellers he would deal with them strictly. He also called for quick measures against the phenomenon which has increased in recent years.  In line with King Mohammed VI’s instruction, the government founded the committee in charge of tracking real estate fraud in 2010, after the monarch received numerous complaints from people losing their homes to fraud across the country.

Rabat – A former Algerian official has repeated his government’s accusation of “Moroccan drug trafficking.” The former Algerian minister of energy, Chakib Khelil, made the controversial statements to explain why the dinar, Algeria’s currency, is experiencing crisis. A video published by Algerie Focus on Wednesday, September 5, features the former official claiming that the dinar crisis is normal and that the currencies of other countries, including Tunisia and Morocco, are supported by “tourism, drugs, and terrorism.” “The value of the dinar has collapsed because of the fall in the price of a barrel of oil,” he said. Khelil then gave the neighboring countries as an example. “The value of the currency can be strong, as in Tunisia, because it is supported by tourism, terrorism and drug trafficking.” He further added that drugs and terrorism supply foreign currency. “When a terrorist comes to your country, he does not come alone. They send one with dollar or euro. That those countries, where terrorism and drug activities happen, have high currencies.” Khelil later echoed his government’s repeated accusations of Moroccan drug exports.  Algeria’s accusation, however, puts Morocco’s eastern neighbor in an ironic situation since Morocco’s authorities seized hundreds of psychotropic tablets from Algeria. In 2017, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced that seizures of psychotropic pills from Algeria had increased notably in recent years. DGSN said that 808,022 psychotropic pills were confiscated in 2016, compared to 260,152 in 2015 and 293,282 in 2014. Khelil’s remarks came 11 days after the secretary general of Algeria’s National Liberation Front (FLN) accused Morocco of “flooding” Algeria with drugs. He said, “Our neighbors to the west, may God forgive them, and I do not think he can forgive them, are flooding us with drugs.” Khelil’s statement backed direct accusations from both Algeria’s minister of foreign affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, and his prime minister, Ahmed Ouyahia, who accused Morocco of “laundering drug money in sub-Saharan Africa.” While Algerian officials link Morocco with drugs, some Algerian politicians, authors, and journalists have heavily criticized Algeria’s economy and political system. Secretary General of Algeria’s Workers Party Louisa Hanoune to condemn the Algerian political system and the “mafiaization of state institutions.” Hanoune referred to senior officials arrested for their involvement in drug trafficking in May.

Moroccan author Meryem Alaoui was nominated for the prestigious Goncourt prize in 2018 for her novel “La verite sort de la bouche du cheval” (the truth comes out of the horse’s mouth), published by Gallimard.  The Goncourt jury announced, Friday, September 7, in the French city of Nancy the list of 15 writers in the running for the most famous French literary prize.  “La verite sort de la bouche du cheval,” Alaoui’s first novel, tells the story of Jmiaa, a prostitute in Casablanca who lives alone with her daughter.

In 2016, prominent French-Moroccan journalist and writer Leila Slimani won the prestigious prize for her novel “Chanson douce,” published in English as “Lullaby” and “The Perfect Nanny.” Besides Slimani, the only other Moroccan author who has won the Goncourt Prize for best novel was Tahar Ben Jelloun for “La nuit sacree” (the sacred night) in 1987. The Goncourt Prize is given in November each year by the Goncourt Academy to the author with “the best and most imaginative prose work of the year.” The winners of the prize tend to experience an immense increase in book sales.

Rabat – Moroccan football players Marouane Da Costa and Khalid Boutaib might not play in the Morocco-Malawi qualifier for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nation (CAN) due to injuries.  The game will take place in the Mohammed V Stadium of Casablanca, Saturday, September 8 at 9 p.m. (Moroccan time).  According to several media outlets, Da Costa, who plays for Turkey’s Basaksehir and Boutaib, who plays for Yeni Malatyaspor, both felt pain during a training session and had to leave before the end of the session.  Morocco World News has contacted the national team’s doctor, Abderrazak Hifti, to confirm whether the two would have to forfeit, but the doctor has not responded yet.  The pressure is higher than ever for Herve Renard and his team on the eve of an important game that will help them secure a spot among the African countries that will compete during the 2019 CAN.  Morocco’s national team has a lot to prove, especially after their early exit in the 2018 World Cup, leading to a low spot in the latest FIFA rank. The team dropped five spots to 46th, in August.  Coach Renard has selected most of the players who competed in the 2018 World Cup for the qualifier game, such as Nordin Amrabat, Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi, M’barek Boussoufa, and Younes Belhanda. Noussair Mazraoui will officially make his debut under the Moroccan jersey. The Moroccan-Dutch player has finally made his choice by agreeing to play for Morocco instead of the Netherlands. Mazraoui is one of the new faces recruited by Herve Renard, as well as Nayef Aguerd, former defender of the FUS club in Rabat who transferred this summer to Dijon and Amien club’s Oualid El Hajjam. Caen’s Yacine Bammou and RC Lens’ Achraf Bencharki are also back in the selection. Notably absent is Mehdi Benatia, the team’s captain. Rumors have run wild as to the reasons why Renard did not choose Benatia, from a conflict between the two men to a supposed injury Benatia sustained.

Rabat- Marrakech’s public prosecution has released the Frenchman who “insulted” the Moroccan flag in a video after he paid bail of MAD 10,000.  The suspect, who reportedly owns a bar and restaurant in Marrakech’s Guliz neighborhood, will remain under judicial supervision until his trial on September 10. The 38-second-long video footage showed the 61-year-old French national wearing nothing but the Moroccan flag draped around his waist while drinking alcohol and dancing on a table in front of guests. The video circulated on social media earlier this week, angering Moroccans who deemed it “insulting” and leading to the opening of the investigation on Tuesday, September 4, reported Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN). The French national reportedly told the police during the investigation that the video was recorded in August at his wedding in Marrakech. According to Morocco’s penal code, insulting the emblem and symbols of the kingdom is punishable by imprisonment from six months to three years in addition to a fine of MAD 10,000 to 100,000. If the offense is committed in front of a group of people, the penalty increases to one to five years in prison.

An unsuccessful attempt to insult the national symbols is equally punishable. The offender may even lose his or her civil rights or be banned from entering the national territory, according to Article 40 of the penal code.

Rabat – EBRD has granted a €16 million loan to Varroc Lighting Systems Morocco, the Moroccan subsidiary of India’s Varroc company. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) published a statement Thursday, September 6, saying its “financing will allow Varroc Engineering to supply the Tangier Renault factory and the Peugeot PSA plant in Kenitra, as well as to set up a research and development centre.” The statement asserted, “This is in line with the government’s efforts to increase the rate of regional integration to 60 per cent by 2020.” PSA Group’s Kenitra plant announced Tuesday, September 4, that it will double its annual production capacity to 200,000 in 2020 at a cost of €560 million. Morocco and PSA Group set ambitious objectives for automotive production including the local integration rate of 60 percent in the short term and 80 percent in the long term. EBRD’s loan is set to create 100 jobs between 2018 and 2024. Hundreds of young people will also be trained. “Historically, the EBRD places significant importance on the automotive sector and provides its customers with an integrated and comprehensive financing and technical support package. The automotive industry in Morocco is now able to benefit from this offer,” said Adil Chikhi, director of EBRD’s corporate activities in Morocco and Tunisia, in a statement published by the state-owned news agency (MAP) Thursday, September 6. Since it has started working in Morocco in 2012, EBRD has invested over €1.5 billion in 41 projects in the North African country. The bank also provided more than 380 local companies with technical assistance. EBRD focuses on “supporting sustainable energy, direct and indirect financing of private enterprises, and promoting infrastructure reform” in Morocco. Varroc Lighting Systems is a global automotive supplier and manufacturer of external lighting systems for cars. In December 11, 2017, the company announced it would establish a manufacturing and product development factory in Tangier’s economic free zone. “The Morocco facility will support both local Moroccan growth as well as our customers in southern Europe,” said Stephane Vedie, CEO of Varroc Lighting Systems.

Rabat – In India, homosexuality is not a crime anymore.  The Supreme Court of India made the historical decision, on Thursday, September 6 of ending the ban on homosexuality dating from the British colonial era. Article 377 of the Indian Penal Code prohibited any “carnal acts against the order of nature.” Indian television channels showed homosexual activists crying tears of joy and falling into each other’s arms during the reading of the judgment. According to AFP, a panel of five Supreme Court justices sat in July to hear the arguments of homosexual plaintiffs, including several celebrities, who claimed the article violated the Indian Constitution. India has become the 124th state in the world where homosexual acts are not criminalized anymore, according to the International Association of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex People (ILGA).  Gay sex has long been a taboo subject in conservative India, where homophobic tendencies abound and many still regard homosexuality as a mental illness. In recent years, however, the country’s gay community has raised its profile, organizing gay pride marches in major cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai which have created awareness and encouraged many to come out of the closet. However, the battle was far from easy for the defenders of the LGBT community.  In 2013, India’s Supreme Court upheld a colonial-era law criminalizing homosexuality in a landmark judgment that crushed activists’ hopes for guarantees of sexual freedom. The case had come from a Delhi High Court decision in favor of homosexuality. The decision was strongly opposed by religious groups, particularly leaders of India’s Muslim and Christian communities, who appealed it to the Supreme Court.

Rabat – Mehdi Kabbadj, 26, became the first Moroccan bodybuilder to secure a Pro Card in the IFBB’s Men’s Physique division on August 31. In order to get an International Federation of BodyBuilding and Fitness (IFBB) professional card, a bodybuilder must win a regional contest in a specific division that will qualify him to compete at the national level. Competitions at the national level award one Pro Card to the bodybuilder who wins the “overall.” Before he became a professional bodybuilder, Mehdi Kabbadj was an undergraduate computer science student. In pursuit of a better life and more opportunities, the ambitious young bodybuilder moved to the US seven years ago as an international student. At the time, he was not a bodybuilder, and he focused entirely on academic success, earning an associate’s degree in computer science. Kabbadj told Morocco World News that when he first started bodybuilding he was just like any other beginner who wants to improve his shape to look good and feel better. He did not count his calorie intake or follow a nutrition program. For him, going to the gym was just as an outlet to de-stress. With time, Kabbadj’s love for the bodybuilding world grew to the point that he could not imagine his life without it. Kabbadj told MWN, “I fell in love with the results, and the more effort I put into bodybuilding the more results I was able to see.” He added, “The more I got into the fitness industry the more I wanted to learn, I started picking up books related to anatomy, physiology, nutrition, biomechanics and such, which allowed me to speed up the process of reaching better results in a short period of time.” Kabbadj switched from eating three times a day to eating seven times a day. He weighed every meal to perfection. By experimenting with various diets, the athlete learned how his body reacted with each one of them.  Kabbadj said his goal, besides being a prominent athlete, is to create a legacy. He described himself not only as a competitive person who always strives to improve, but as one who wants to impact others positively. Kabbadj started his competition journey about three years ago, when he first stood on a bodybuilding stage.
 Last year, Kabbadj performed exceptionally at the regional level. He won four first places and one overall win in California. Each win qualified him to compete at the national level. “It is hard for internationals or green card holders to find shows in the United States that will allow them to compete at the national level, as there are rules to which shows they can do,” he said. Kabbadj’s performance at the regional level was outstanding, but he did not feel ready to move up to the nationals. So he took time off to work on his weaknesses and to improve his strengths so that he could be “undeniable” at the national level. After seven months of off-season, during which he lifted heavy weights and ate “clean food” in order to gain weight and put on more muscle, Kabbadj decided to requalify at a regional show in his area. At the regional competition, Kabbadj won the overall in the men’s physique division.  The Men’s Physique division was first introduced in 2012. It differs from regular bodybuilding as competitors wear knee-length shorts and have a “moderate muscular body” of 5 percent body fat. Judges focus on the harmonized structure of the abdominal muscles, chest, shoulders, arms, back, and calves. Soon after Kabbadj won the regional show, promoters invited him to compete at IFBB’s World Regional Championships in Singapore on July 31. The show allowed 20 countries from all over the world to enter with their athletes and overall winners, with only one IFBB Pro Card to be awarded per division. Kabbadj successfully passed the first phase in the morning, which qualified him to battle for the overall win in the night show. Of course, only one winner in the Men’s Physique division would take the golden Pro Card home. Later that night, he lost his opportunity by one point. “It was very tough for me to swallow or accept. I came back to the United States with no clue what would be next,” said Kabbadj. A few days later, he decided to challenge himself and try again to earn the Pro Card. A competitor can only do 2 or 3 shows before giving the body time to rest and a break from the caloric deficit. The 2018 NPC North American Championship on August 31 was the next competition that allowed citizens, internationals, and green card holders to compete for the IFBB Pro Card. With only three weeks to prepare, Kabbadj refocused, doing everything he could with 100 percent effort to improve upon his last show. It was not an easy task since Kabbadj was already at one of his best looks. “Fast forward to last Friday, battling again for the professional status, I was able to get a job done, not only that I was able to win the overall 2018 NPC North American Championships, but become an IFBB professional, and also the first Moroccan men’s physique professional athlete in the world,” Kabbadj told MWN. Kabbadj said his next move is to compete in Schwarzenegger’s famous “Arnold Classic,” a competition that gathers the best athletes worldwide from various divisions, including bodybuilding, men’s physique, weightlifting, powerlifting, and bikini. Kabbadj urged Moroccan amateur bodybuilders to expand their knowledge, to be serious about bodybuilding, and to consider it a job—not just a hobby—in order to gain success. “It is not just about going to the gym, it is one of the most complicated and tough sports. You have to develop the tools that will allow you to not waste time doing the wrong things,” said Kabbadj. He concluded, “The more you invest into the knowledge the faster you will have positive  results.”

Rabat – Jailed Moroccan activist Nasser Zefzafi has ended his hunger strike after a week of protesting against “torture” and “harassment.”  Held in Casablanca’s local prison, Oukacha, while he is appealing a 20-year prison sentence, Zefzafi decided to end his hunger strike on Thursday, AFP reported. Zefzafi’s father, Ahmed Zefzafi, announced his son’s hunger strike last week, through a video which went viral on social media. In the video, Zefzafi’s father said that his son denounced the harassment in the prison and that he called for dignified treatment in the prison for himself and for the other detainees who were arrested for involvement in the Hirak protest movement. Zefzafi said that his son asked for “forgiveness” from all people, including those who do not support him. He also asked his mother to tell his family not to intervene in the hunger strike.  According to his father, Zezafi is being held in a small solitary cell where he has been jailed since before his trial, which ended with the 20-year sentence on June 26. On September 4, a member of the defense team for the jailed Hirak Rif activists, Mohammed Aghnaj,  said that Zefzafi’s hunger strike did not intend to “escalate” the situation. Aghanaj wrote that he visited all detainees on Tuesday, including Zefzafi. During his meeting with the lawyer, Zefzafi informed Aghanaj that he would end his hunger strike under several conditions. The list of demands included that detained activists should be allowed to continue their academic studies and have access to health services. Zefzafi added that he did not start a hunger strike to “escalate” the situation or to cause “anarchy” but for dignity and legal rights. The lawyer added that six activists were transferred to solitary cells. In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak Rif activists. Zefzafi and three other activists received 20 years in prison. Zefzafi was arrested in May 2017 after he interrupted a Friday prayer in a mosque to protest the sermon’s content and for his involvement in “unauthorized” protests in Al Hoceima province, home to the 2016 and 2017 protest movement after the death of local fishmonger Mohcine Fikri.

Rabat – A cholera case has been reported in Hassan II Hospital in Benslimane, near Casablanca. Hassan II Hospital’s emergency room in Benslimane received a patient with an alleged case of cholera on Wednesday, September 5. Moroccan newspaper Asaabah reported that the emergency room’s 50-year-old patient was suffering from cholera symptoms: fever and diarrhea. The newspaper added that the hospital staff was on alert after the arrival of the patient, but said that the medical department did not have the necessary equipment to take care of the patient. The patient, according to the newspaper, had to wait for several hours before he was transported to the Ibn Sina University Hospital in Rabat due to the lack of ambulances and oxygen. Morocco World News contacted Ibn Sina University Hospital to confirm the news. The hospital reception said it had received no information about the issue. The Moroccan Ministry of Health has not yet confirmed the case. However, several social media users have speculated for days that cholera has broken out in Morocco after the many cases identified in Morocco’s eastern neighbor, Algeria. The head of government and other Moroccan officials, however, condemned the rumours that “provoke fear among Moroccans.” El Othmani made his remarks August 30 during the Thursday government council. Cholera broke out in Algeria on August 7. According to Reuters, Algeria has had about 50 cases. Algerian authorities say the epidemic is now under control.

Rabat – Over the past 5 years, Morocco produced 2 million tons of citrus on an area of over 125,000 hectares. Citrus plays an important role in Morocco’s economy as an essential source of foreign currency. With an estimated value of MAD 3 billion per year, Morocco’s citrus exports from citrus has reached 500,000 tons annually. Morocco exports 80 percent of its citrus to Russia and the European Union. The remaining 20 percent is exported to North America and the Middle East. Over the past decade, Morocco’s citrus sector grew significantly with the introduction of new berry varieties. As a result, the citrus supply dedicated for export diversified widely and production and marketing periods became more widespread. A wide range of varieties characterize national citrus orchards; however three groups of varieties dominate: clementines at 35 percent, Maroc-late at 21 percent, and navels at 18 percent. The main regions of citrus cultivation in Morocco are Souss Massa in the south, Gharb in the northwest, Moulouya in the Middle Atlas, Tadla in central Morocco, and El Haouz near Marrakech. Citrus production has been improving since the launch of Morocco’s Green Plan in April 2008. The plan improved the efficiency of domestic markets, the socio-economic impacts of investments directed to small farmers, agricultural services, the management of irrigation, and the planning of irrigation projects.

Rabat – No, this is not a traditional Moroccan slipper from the souk but an expensive pair of Balenciaga’s.  Moroccan social media were surprised by the French luxury brand Balenciaga’s choice to sell an expensive and luxurious version of the traditional Moroccan slipper, also known as “babouches” in French and “balgha” in Darija (Moroccan Arabic). On its website, Balenciaga is offering a square-toe mule in either black or red leather for MAD 5,118. The much-wanted shoe is already out of stock.  However, in the souks and medinas, the traditional shoe is sold for between MAD 50 and 70, which Moroccan people have reminded the brand on social media.  Social media users have slammed Balenciaga, accusing the French enterprise of a “scam” and “cultural appropriation,” mocking their lack of imagination.  It is not the first luxury brand that found inspiration in the Moroccan shoe. In 2016, the traditional slippers attracted the attention of the most prestigious brands like Celine, Gucci, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Narciso Rodriguez.  Some American fashion magazines like Vogue defined Balenciaga’s new shoe as “the must have of the year.”

Rabat – Moroccan binationals will allegedly be exempted from the mandatory military service introduced by Morocco’s government in August. A source in Morocco’s embassy in Paris said that the “military service should only concern young people residing in Morocco.” The anonymous source told the French Sud Ouest outlet that the details of the bill will include everything about the requirements of those to be conscripted in October when the text will be officially adopted in Parliament. The government’s proposal to bring back the military service surprised Morocco’s youth. Moroccan-Dutch and Moroccan-Belgian youth have both showed concern over the decision. Dutch news outlet NL Times reported that many Dutch-Moroccans are “worried that they will have to join the North African country’s army for a year.” Moroccan binationals were not the only citizens to express concerns over the decision. The number of Moroccans residing abroad is estimated at 5 million, according to statistics offered by the minister delegate in charge of Moroccans residing abroad in July. After the government announced its decision in August, a group of activist created a Facebook group named “Moroccan Rally against Compulsory Military Service.” The activists issued a statement, explaining why they are against the draft bill. The group explained that the rejection of the bill “came because of the government’s total lack of clarity on the bill’s real objectives.” They added that conscription cannot be decided in a short period. On September 4, the Party of al-Istiqlal (Independence) discussed the government decision in its meeting. The members of the party called on the government to exercise pedagogical efforts “to correct negative stereotypes” which feature the service as a “mechanism for discipline and punishment or for the suppression of energies and spirit of initiative and creativity” among young people. The party also urged the government to hear from people and youth and communicate with them and to listen to their suggestions, according to the party’s statement. Bill 44.18 on mandatory service concerns young people aged 19 to 25, both men and women. The bill exempts citizens with diseases, married people, and people who financially support their families. Only one young person per family will be conscripted. The army can call on exempted people to join the service until the age of 40 if the reason that prevented them from participating no longer applies. Morocco first introduced 18-month military service on June 9, 1966, in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66. Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months in 1999. But in 2006, King Mohammed VI abolished mandatory military service.

Rabat – Islam is broadening its influence everywhere as it is speedily growing across the globe. According to a Pew Research Center study published in April 2017,  out of the 7.6 billion people on the earth, 84 percent belong to an organized religion. The study was based on numbers from 2015. While Christianity forms the largest religious group, with 31.2 percent of the world population, Islam is growing more than twice as fast as the overall world population between 2015 and 2060, according to the study. Islam is predicted to outpace Christianity as the globe’s largest religious group in the second half of this century. Pew’s study forecasted an increase of the world’s population by 32 percent in the coming decades. However, the number of Muslims is expected to grow by 70 percent: from 1.8 billion in 2015 to an estimated 3 billion in 2060. Muslims made up 24.1 percent of the world’s population in 2015. The number of Muslims is set to grow because of the “fact that Muslims have the youngest median age (24 in 2015) of all major religious groups, more than seven years younger than the median age of non-muslims (32),” the study finds. More than 1/3 of Muslims are in Africa and the Middle East The study shows that more than a third of those who identify as Muslims live in Africa and the Middle East. The two regions are also predicted to have the highest increases in numbers of Muslims. “But even within these high-growth regions – as well as others – Muslims are projected to grow faster than members of other groups,” the study said. The increase in the number of Muslims in the world was projected because of the growing population in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with a younger median age and higher fertility levels in the region. Pew’s findings also forecast an increase in the number of Muslims across the world, except in Latin America and the Caribbean due to the small number of Muslims who live there. According to Pew, the number of Muslims in India is growing faster and will reach 19.4 percent by 2060. Other religions, like Judaism and Hinduism are also set to grow by 15 percent and 27 percent, respectively, between 2015 and 2026. Despite losing its influence compared to Islam, Christianity will also see an increase of 34 percent, owing to the number of Christians in sub-Saharan countries in Africa. Religion-phobia still a struggle Despite Islam’s remarkable influence in the world, extremism and radicalization linked to the religion have impacted views of Muslims. Muslims living in non-Muslim-majority countries are subjected to oppression due to their religion. A 2017 study by the center, which used FBI statistics, showed that assaults on Muslims in the US have “easily surpassed” the previous modern peak of attacks on Muslims in 2001. The research showed that there were 127 reported violent crimes in 2016 compared to 91 in 2015 and 93 in 2001. Hate crimes not only target Muslims, but also Jews. Pew said that hate crimes targeting Jews in the US increased in 2016 to 684.

The number of countries participating in the competition continues to increase, according to IOI.  Participants come from all over the world: from China, Australia, Nigeria, Spain, Russia, and even Azerbaijan. From the Maghreb region, Tunisia is the only other country sending participants. In 2017, 83 countries participated in the 29th IOI in Iran. Israeli students, unable to participate in Iran for political reasons, competed from IOI’s offsite competition organized in Russia. The first IOI was held in 1989 in Pravetz, Bulgaria. The main objectives of the competition are to “discover, encourage, bring together, challenge, and give recognition to young people who are exceptionally talented in the field of informatics.” IOI also aims to strengthen international relationships in the context of computer science and informatics, and encourage countries to host and organize IOI. The host country often organizes cultural and social programs on the sidelines of the competition. Participating countries choose a team of up to four contestants to represent their nation, in addition to a team leader and deputy. During the competition, contestants compete individually and work to increase their scores by solving informatics problems. At the award ceremony, contestants with top scores receive either gold, silver, or bronze medals depending on their rank.

Rabat – PSA Group’s automotive plant in Kenitra will double its annual production capacity to 200,000 cars in 2020 at a cost of €560 million. PSA Group’s Kenitra plant, which will produce 100,000 cars in 2019, decided to double its annual production capacity to 200,000 in 2020, announced Jean Christophe Quemard, PSA Group’s executive vice-president in Africa-Mideast region. Quemard made the announcement Tuesday, September 4, in a press conference at PSA Group’s plant headquartered in Kenitra, 40 kilometers north of Rabat. Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid El Alamy attended the conference. The French car manufacturer made the decision because of the “excellent partnership” between PSA Group and Morocco and the company’s international success, especially in the Middle East and Africa, explained Quemard. In 2017, PSA Group’s worldwide sales reached a record of 3.63 million vehicles compared to 3.15 million in 2016, up 15 percent. The group’s sales in the Middle East and Africa region grew by 61.4 percent from 2016 to 2017, selling 618,800 units, including 26,800 Opel units. “The PSA Group has set up a comprehensive system in Morocco covering the entire automotive value chain. Our project has no equivalent in Africa,” said Quemard. “The Kenitra plant is the best performing of the industrial plants of PSA Group,” he added. Both cars and their engines will be produced in Morocco Morocco and PSA Group set ambitious objectives for automotive production. The production will mainly rely on Moroccan suppliers to achieve a local integration rate of 60 percent in the short term and 80 percent in the long term. In addition to engineering, conception, and production, PSA Group will also use locally-made engines. “Having both the vehicle and the engine made in Morocco makes it possible to have an integration rate of 80 percent,” said El Alamy, describing the move as “unprecedented in the world.” With the arrival of PSA Group, the automotive ecosystem in Morocco will be supported by 62 supplier sites, including 54 to be delivered to the group’s plant in Kenitra. “The PSA Ecosystem unfolds with sustained pace of important achievements. The network of actors is diversifying with the establishment of new equipment manufacturers; the integration rate is developing; the volume of local purchases is growing and an R&amp;D ecosystem is being built,” said the minister. The PSA Group anticipated that local purchase volume will exceed €1 billion by 2022. PSA Group’s project in Kenitra The PSA Group’s industrial project in Morocco is based on the creation of a complete automotive ecosystem. The group has five car brands: Peugeot, Citroën, DS, Opel, and Vauxhall. The Kenitra automotive construction site started at the beginning of 2017. By the end of 2017, PSA Group had a total workforce of 350 in Morocco. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Industry, the workforce will reach 1,000 people before the end of 2018, and will double again in 2019 to reach 2,200 people. The PSA Group in Morocco hopes to eventually generate more than 2,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirect jobs. As part of the agreement between Morocco and PSA, the group inaugurated Morocco Technical Center (MTC) in July 2017. MTC is a research and development center which will employ more than 1,500 of PSA’s Moroccan engineers and highly qualified technicians.

Rabat – The boycotted dairy company, Centrale Danone, is making another attempt to convince boycotters to buy its products. Centrale Danone’s CEO, Emmanuel Faber, returned to Morocco to announce the outcome of the public consultation launched by his company in July. Faber said that the campaign allowed the company to hear ideas from 100,000 consumers. After the consultation, Faber announced Wednesday, September 5, the measures that could help end the company’s crisis in Morocco after experiencing a major boycott against high prices, which started on April 20. “These measures will be applied from the end of this week,” he said. Faber said that his company will begin selling pasteurized milk in  470-milliliter bags, which will be sold for MAD 2.50. He added that the product will be semi-skimmed with 15 grams of fat. Centrale Danone drops price of milk by 8.57% Faber announced that the company will cut its profit margin and the price by 8.57% on its 470-milliliter milk cartons.  “We decided to adjust the price of our milk sold at 3.50 DH to 3.20 DH,” he said.   The new prices will be applied starting Friday, September 7, he added. It remains to be seen if the decrease will convince customers to buy the pasteurized milk. At the launch of the boycott, people supporting the boycott urged the company to cut the price of its milk to MAD 2.50. During the conference, Faber said that the quality of the company’s milk “will not change.”  “It will remain the best world standards, there will always be 1,000 quality control points per day.” He added that the company will also ensure transparency through continuous dialogue and meetings between stakeholders and customers. The businessman also promised that his company would publish a price list, featuring the original price of milk when provided by dairy farmers every six months. Throughout the months of the boycott, Centrale Danone, which is one of the three boycotted companies in Morocco, published rounds of statements to reconcile with its customers after one of its officials called Moroccans “traitors.”  The company also received support from the government, including from Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi and Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has dismantled a three-member terror cell operating in Tetouan and Agadir. Police arrested the suspects for their alleged ties with ISIS today. The three suspects are all in their mid-twenties, aged 25 and 26. A statement from the Ministry of Interior announced that during the arrest, police seized knives, electronic devices, a military uniform, and extremist notes and plans to incite people to violence. The statement added that the three-member cell was planning to undermine security and stability in the country through explosive devices and toxic substances. The suspects will be put in jail depending on the results of the investigation under the supervision of the prosecutor. Dozens arrested earlier this year Throughout the year, BCIJ carried out several operations dismantling terror cells with alleged links to ISIS. Authorities conducted the latest operation in July, arresting seven pro-ISIS extremists operating between Zaouiat Cheikh (central Morocco), Oulad Teima (near Agadir), and Marrakech. The suspects were also promoting propaganda for ISIS through campaigns praising terror acts. In another BCIJ operation, police arrested four suspects on July 2 in four Moroccan cities. On May 14, BCIJ also arrested four ISIS suspects in Fez, Casablanca, Kenitra (near Rabat), and Driouch (in northern Morocco). The operation was the second to occur in May, as a security cooperation between Spain and Morocco resulted in the arrest of a five-member terror cell in northern Morocco and Spain. BCIJ also dismantled a cell in the cities of Oued Zem ( near Khouribga in central Morocco) and Tangier in March. On February 21, the BCIJ dismantled a terror cell made up of six extremist supporters of ISIS in Tangier, including one member of the Polisario Front. BCIJ’s ‘anticipatory philosophy’ In response to terror threats, especially after Marrakech’s terror attack in 2011, Morocco modernized and upgraded its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime. The country’s efforts were welcomed in several reports from the US State Department. In an interview, the head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame, said that Morocco’s successful model to combat terrorism is the result of an “anticipatory philosophy” that tackles terrorism at its core. El Khiame said that Morocco’s model aims not only to fight terrorism, but also to fight its sources and to “deconstruct radicalization” in order to limit violent ideologies. In 2015, Morocco introduced the BCIJ, which has thwarted security threats across the country. In June, Khiame shared figures of the number of Moroccans who joined ISIS and other terrorist networks. According to the official, there are “only 1,660 fighters.” According to Khiame, those suspects with ISIS ties are operating throughout the MENA region, mainly in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. The number includes 200 suspected ISIS fighters who returned and were arrested in Morocco. Suspects with a terrorist background can face 10 years or more in prison, depending on the seriousness of the offense.

Rabat – Khadija’s alleged rape has caught the attention of UNICEF, which has reacted to the reported kidnapping and rape. In a statement made public today, UNICEF aimed to raise awareness about violence against Moroccan children. Khadija’s case became public in August, when the 17-year-old Khadija spoke for the first time about being raped. The girl said that she was kidnapped and raped by more than 12 people for two months. While media reports have questioned the truth of Khadija’s story, UNICEF argued that it calls for “the rights of children involved in this case to be respected, whether they are victims, witnesses or accused.”  The statement added that “the children who could be associated with this case,” remain victims of the “absence of an integrated system of child protection in Morocco,” regardless of their social status. The organization has also published figures about the number of similar cases which were adjudicated in Morocco’s courts. According to UNICEF, courts across Morocco processed 5,980 cases of violence against children in 2017. The number caused UNICEF to call on all concerned parties, including media, to prioritize the issue above any other interests to meet acceptable standards of taking care of victims of violence. The institution also reminded the Moroccan government of its integrated child protection policy to protect children against sexual violence adopted in 2015. The project, which is part of a mid-term evaluation of the National Plan of Action for Children 2006-2015, aims to create a healthy environment for children, safe from all forms of neglect, abuse, violence, and exploitation. According to UNICEF, the case of Khadija “concerns all stakeholders of the urgent need to quickly implement these territorial devices.” The statement added, “The Child Protection Policy Implementation Program provides for the establishment, at the provincial / prefecture level, of a structure for the collection, analysis, evaluation, orientation and monitoring individual situations of children.”. UNICEF’s statement argued that Khadija’s case is not the first and will not be the last case.  Sexual assaults publicized on social media This year, a mass outcry erupted several times over cases with similar circumstances as those Khadija alleged. In January, a French pedophile admitted to drugging and raping two girls aged 11 and 14 in Fez. The 58-year-old pedophile claimed that he could give the children “what they were deprived of: toys, food, gifts and money.” He blamed their families for exploiting children. In March, a video of a sexual assault was posted online, featuring a young man assaulting a young girl, while someone else filmed. In 2017, another video posted online shocked Moroccans: it showed more than five teenagers sexually abusing a young girl on a moving bus in Casablanca. Nobody else on the bus appeared to do anything. Besides security authorities, the government did not release any statements regarding the cases, which received widespread outrage on social media.  The government has not yet implemented Law 103-13 against gender-based discrimination, which was initially set to go into effect in August. The government, according to a government source will implement the law September 12. President of Tahadi Center and activist Bouchra Abdou condemned the delay in an August interview with Morocco World News, saying that the delay is unexplainable. It remains to be seen whether the government will fulfill its promises and implement the law next week.

Rabat – Morocco has lost hope of convincing Matteo Guendouzi to represent Morocco in football. Arsenal’s young footballer is not interested in becoming an Atlas Lion; he said he wants to represent France internationally. In an interview with Ouest France, the footballer said that he is giving all his attention to his career with France. The footballer did not hesitate to say that he dreams to join the French team. “I will do everything to get there one day.” He also said that he “trembled” when he watched his dream team participating in the World Cup. France won the 2018 World Cup final against Croatia. In 2017, the footballer had already made his choice public, emphasizing that he wants to wear France’s jersey after he allegedly received an invitation from both the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and Morocco’s head coach Herve Renard. Guendouzi, who transferred to Arsenal this year, has made headlines for his good start with the club as a midfielder. Born in 1999, the Arsenal player started his career at the Academy of Paris Saint-Germain. He then left Paris to join Lorient, where he made his debut in 2016.

Rabat- The Ministry of Education has changed the rules, allowing holders of older baccalaureates to enroll in all Moroccan universities. Moroccan universities will now enroll students with older baccalaureate diplomas, after campaigns and calls for the government to change regulations prevailed. that prevent holders of old baccalaureate diploma from studying in the country’s universities. For the academic year 2018-2019, people with baccalaureate diplomas obtained before 2018 must submit their registration documents between September 3 and 21. In 2017, Moroccan activists launched a social media campaign, with the hashtag #Man_Haki_Nakra (I have the right to study), urging the government to accept baccalaureate diplomas, regardless of the year they were obtained. Based on a rule “expiring” baccalaureate diplomas after two years, universities refused applications from people with baccalaureate diplomas issued more than two years beforehand. In line with the campaign, a member of the Progressive Socialist Party submitted a letter to the secretary of state in charge of higher education to accentuate the right of students to enroll in universities whenever they wished, stating: “Depriving citizens of the right to education violates their rights and the principle of equal opportunities and equal access to education, which is guaranteed by the 2011 Constitution.” The former minister of Education, Professional Training, and Higher Learning Lahcen Daoudi, said in 2015 that the baccalaureate expiration regulation was adopted due to overcrowding in universities and lack of university professors. He explained that universities themselves determine the number of students who can enroll based on their capacities. The leader of the “I have the right to study” campaign, journalist and social media activist Mahmoud Ababou told Morocco World News that citizens are not responsible for the overcrowding. “As the [government] is able to construct prisons, they are able to build universities. This is how they can curb overcrowding. Build more universities in order to curb overcrowding issues,” he said. The number of students in higher education has increased significantly in Morocco. “The number of degree holders increased from 43,000 in the last five years to120,000 this year,” said Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi in July. If universities accept students with older baccalaureate degrees, students who earned their baccalaureate between 2016 and 2018 may find themselves competing with older prospective students to get into university. According to El Khalfi’s press statement released in July, the percentage of unemployed university graduates is over 22 percent, a figure that has doubled over the last five years and is expected to keep increasing in the coming years to reach 50 percent. El Khalfi argued that the kingdom is facing a sizeable problem of unemployed higher degree holders that cannot be ignored.

Rabat – A senior official from the French justice ministry has apologized for the summoning of Moroccan journalists by a French court. A senior official at the French Ministry of Justice received the Moroccan liaison magistrate with France on Tuesday, September 4, in Paris, Le360 reported, with information from “a reliable source.” The source added that the French Minister of Justice Nicole Belloubet will hold talks today with her Moroccan counterpart, Mohammed Aujjar. The purpose of the meeting is to apologize for Aida Traore’s summons of Moroccan journalists residing in Morocco. Traore is the vice-president in charge of the investigation at the Court of Major Jurisdiction of Paris (TGI). Traore summoned two Moroccan journalists, Naim Kamal and Narjis Rerhaye, for an article’s alleged press offence against a former Moroccan army captain, Mustapha Adib, now residing in France. The Moroccan news outlet Quid.ma, directed by Kamal, published the article on June 20, 2014. The article criticized Adib for a letter he wrote to General Abdelaziz Bennani, former inspector general of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR). “Criminal Abdelaziz Bennani murdered thousands of innocent people and threw millions of orphans into the streets,” Quid.ma quoted Adib’s letter. Adib had left the letter in a hospital room in France’s Val-de-Grace Hospital where General Abdelaziz Bennani was being treated. The article, Traore wrote in the summons, contained an “outrageous expression, a term of contempt or an invective towards Mr Mustapha Adib.” The phrase she objected to, in French, translates to: “What Mustapha Adib did tends to barbarity.” Quid.ma described Adib’s action, saying “This is not activism. This is not militancy. It is not about the defense of human rights. What Mustapha Adib did tends to barbarity.” . Le360 said it also received four summonses from Traore “for articles published by media headquartered in Morocco and which are under Moroccan law.” The summons the French court sent to Moroccan journalists “are based on complaints lodged by defrocked captain Mustapha Adib,” wrote Le360. Two more journalists received same summons The TGI summoned two other Moroccan journalists for the same affair of Mustapha Adib. The journalists are Adil Lahlou, the director of Moroccan outlet Challenge.ma, and his colleague Jamel Berraoui, a columnist at the same outlet and writer of another offending article. Both journalists received summons to appear on October 8. They were summoned for an article titled “Les crapules” (Scoundrels), published in June 2014 and in which Mustapha Adib was described as a “little shit” “This case falls under the jurisdiction of Moroccan justice because it is a dispute between Moroccan nationals: one resident in France, the ex-captain Mustapha Adib, and the others in are residing in Morocco,” Lahlou said in an interview with state-owned news agency (MAP). The vice-president in charge of the investigation, who signed the summons, “did not take into account the judicial convention that exists between Morocco and France,” he added. Lahlou stressed that the case must be judged in Morocco because the trial falls within the responsibility of Moroccan courts. He also emphasized the need to apply the judicial convention signed between Morocco and France.

Rabat – Mehdi Benatia has dealt with many rumors since Renard did not choose him for the 2019 CAN qualifiers. And this time is no exception. Speculations ran wild after coach Herve Renard released his list of 25 players for the Morocco-Malawi Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) qualifier. The list did not include Mehdi Benatia, the team’s captain, leaving the door open for massive rumors. Local media were quick to jump to conclusions, reporting tensions between the coach and the captain since the end of the 2018 World Cup when Benatia made a statement blaming “people close to the team” after Morocco’s loss in the second game against Portugal. Benatia shut down that rumor, responding to Moroccan media outlet Lions de l’Atlas by tweeting that Renard is not just a coach for him but also a friend. “One more lie. This is too much!” he added. However, Benatia did not give a further explanation until another rumor about him missing from the squad surfaced.  Several media outlets, including Lions de l’Atlas and Assabah, reported that the 31-year-old football player did not make the cut because of an injury. Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported that the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) obtained a medical file from Benatia’s club, Juventus, explaining the national team captain’s physical condition. The footballer, according to the newspaper, suffered from abdominal pain. The newspaper added that Benatia’s condition required him to rest for about four months. Fed up by all the gossip, the Atlas Lion made an Instagram story where he finally explained why he will not play with the national team.  “I want to deny the information published in some media of the Moroccan press that a certificate was sent from my club. This is false, no certificate was sent simply because I am not injured,” said Benatia in an irritated voice.  “I’m fine alhamdulillah [praise God]. When a player is injured, he must come to have his injury validated by the national team doctor, but that is not my case. So, stop lying, stop inventing things because I am fed up,” he added. Benatia, who has been sitting on the bench since the beginning of the season, August 18, explained that he also wanted to focus on his career with Juventus.  At the end of his video, the Juventus player wished good luck to the Atlas Lions who will compete against Malawi on September 8 in Casablanca as part of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

Rabat – Hachim Mastour is taking a step backwards in his career.  Free since the end of his contract with AC Milan in July, Moroccan international football player Hachim Mastour struggled to find a club that would take him after a disastrous season.  According to Greek outlet SDNA, the Atlas Lion will try to bounce back in the Greek championship with the PAS Lamia club with whom he passed his medical visit Tuesday, September 4. Having spent the last season with AC Milan, Hachim Mastour did not manage to impress. This season, the 20-year-old played just one game with the Milan reserve team. Otherwise he has spent time in training, sometimes even with the pro group. Too much social media? “Mastour is more famous for making videos on social media than playing on the field,” said AC Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso in April.  Mastour has been in the spotlight from a young age but has had a hard time managing his “celebrity” status.  Hachim was born in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy, to Moroccan parents. Since he was a child, he dreamed of becoming the greatest football player in the world. He started his career in US Reggio Calcio, a football school based in Reggio Emilia linked with FC Internazionale Milano. From the beginning of his football career, Mastour was seen as a prodigy.  Nicknamed “the young Cristiano Ronaldo,” because of his speed, ability to change pace, superior dribbling skills, and ability to shoot well with both feet, Mastour did not live up to his fans’ expectations. After being courted by prestigious clubs like Juventus, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, he ultimately accepted an offer from AC Milan in 2012.  Milan loaned out Mastour for two years with no option to buy at Malaga CF on the last day of the summer transfer window 2015. On July 8, 2016, Malaga broke the loan, and Mastour returned to Milan. Since then Mastour has failed to impress, whether in Malaga or FC Zwolle where he was loaned last year. The Moroccan “prodigy” never managed to win or reveal all the technical potential he supposedly had.  Hachim Mastour is only 20 years old, but he seems to have already been forgotten by the world of football. Announced three years ago as a future great talent of the Milanese formation, he has lost his way. Not better in Morocco Mastour joined the Moroccan squad in 2015. The Moroccan international stated that he followed his heart and family in deciding to play for Morocco’s national team, although he was eligible to play for Italy as well.  “I chose to play for Morocco at the age of 16, and it was a great honor for me,” Mastour said. However, the footballer has only played two minutes with the national team of Morocco during a game against Libya on June 12, 2015. He has not been called back since. But the 20-year-old still hoped to be selected for coach Herve Renard’s squad during the 2018 World Cup as he expressed it earlier this year to beIN Sport. Unfortunately for him, he did not make the cut for any game.

Rabat – The China-Africa summit has served as a platform for Morocco to attract more investment and to reinforce Sino-Moroccan cooperation. Moroccan officials spoke positively about their participation at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), which ran September 3-4. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani led the Moroccan delegation. The minister delegate to the minister of foreign affairs, Mohcine Jazouli, who was part of the Moroccan delegation at the summit, said that Morocco’s “geo strategic” position and its notable presence in the African continent allow the North African country to play a “central role, as part of its cooperation with China.” Jazouli also described the relationship between China and Morocco as “excellent” for having “historical ties,” which have been consolidated throughout the years. The official also linked the fruitful ties with King Mohammed VI’s visit to China in 2016, emphasizing that the visit gave the diplomatic ties “strong impetus” and developed them to “the level of a global strategic partnership.” Jazouli added that Morocco’s position represents “favorable factors for a Sino-Moroccan commitment to the benefit of Africa’s development and South-South cooperation.” China has become one Morocco’s most significant economic partners as the two countries have reinforced their ties in several sectors, including media and tourism. Morocco established diplomatic ties with China in 1958, when Morocco became the second African country to recognize the People’s Republic of China. The Moroccan-Sino ties were further expanded after the King’s visit in 2016, opening up the kingdom for Chinese investments. Relaxed visa regulations, according to government statistics, have resulted in a dramatic increase of Chinese tourists visiting Morocco: in 2016, 43,000 Chinese tourists visited the kingdom, but in only the first five months of 2018, Morocco received 120,000 Chinese tourists. In 2017, the republic also announced an investment of $11 billion into the creation of “Mohamed VI Tangier Tech City,” a new factory district that aims to offer 100,000 new job opportunities. In February 2018, Morocco and China expressed interest in broadening economic partnerships after the 6th session of the Morocco-China joint committee for Economic Cooperation. Chinese officials also held talks with Moroccan officials in Rabat in July, showing interests in Morocco’s fisheries and aquaculture assets.

Rabat – Morocco, aiming to enhance its defense capability, is preparing to launch its second surveillance satellite by the end of 2018. After launching its first high-resolution satellite in 2017, the North African country is reinforcing its space surveillance capabilities with another space engine. Moroccan newspaper Al Massae quoted an anonymous military source on September 4, who confirmed the news. The project will cost Morocco €500 million and will be able to monitor activities on its borders; taking pictures with a precision of 50 centimeters. Military spending dwarfs education, health The satellite’s cost is a significant portion of Morocco’s military spending. Morocco increased its military spending to $3.42 billion in 2017 from $3.327 billion a year earlier. The number represents an increase of 1.03 percent. In contrast, Morocco’s 2017 budget allocated MAD 3.8 billion to education and MAD 2.4 billion to health. Morocco is also the second largest buyer of military equipment in Africa after Algeria, according to a 2018 report issued by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Although the report does not specify Morocco’s military expenditures,  it featured Morocco as the second largest arms importer in Africa at the rate of 21 percent of African arms imports from 2013-2017. Al Massae reported that the satellite will be ready to be launched in November, which will make Morocco the third African country to acquire two satellites, after Egypt and South Africa. Like the first satellite, baptized Mohammed VI, the second satellite will be launched from the Guiana Space Center (CSG) in Kourou, French Guiana. The project, according to the newspaper, is part of an agreement between France and Morocco signed in 2013 during the visit of former French President Francois Hollande to Morocco. Both satellites are for civilian and military uses. The satellite’s surveillance uses The first high-resolution satellite, which weighs over 1,100 kilograms, was used successfully to detect illegal activities from the Polisario Front east of Morocco’s defense wall earlier this year. To prove Polisario’s illegal maneuvers, Morocco used satellite images that showed Polisario in the region. The United Nations, which is the leading political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict, released a statement after Morocco provided proofs to the UN of the continuous presence of the front in the region. In its statement, the UN spokesperson recognized that a MINURSO patrol unit encountered Polisario east of the berm wall, facing gunfire on April 16. Several analysts also speculated that the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation provided images to Iran as evidence of Hezbollah’s involvement with members of the Polisario Front when Morocco decided to cut ties with Iran on May 1. The Mohammed VI satellite, which is capable of capturing more than 500 images daily, updates its data every six hours. It was also launched to help Morocco’s security agencies fight smuggling and arrest potential terrorists in the Sahel region and to control undocumented migration. Morocco’s Ministry of Interior has not yet unveiled any information about the second satellite.

Rabat- Morocco’s Ministry of Education has defended textbook content written in Darija (Moroccan Arabic), saying that it is “purely for educational purposes.” Images of multiple pages in Arabic primary school textbooks have caused social media uproar because they contain words used in Darija, the unwritten Moroccan dialect of Arabic, instead of pure standard Arabic. The texts include names of Moroccan traditional clothing and dishes in Darija, such as “ghriyba” (a Moroccan cookie), “baghrir” (Moroccan crepes), and “briouat” (a sweet/savory puff pastry). In addition to the Darija words in Arabic textbooks, photos of a French textbook containing a popular Moroccan children’s song next to its transliteration into the Latin alphabet and translation in French inspired the mockery of Moroccans online.  Several Moroccans condemned the use of Darija content, deeming it inappropriate for children’s successful mastering of standard Arabic. According to Article 5 of Morocco’s 2011 constitution, “Arabic is the official language of the state,” and Morocco strives for its protection, development, and integration into teaching, side by side with Tamazight (Berber). Morocco’s Independence Party (IP) held a meeting with the Committee on Education, Culture, and Communication with the minister of education, Said Amzazi, to discuss the issue. Amzazi said in a statement to Akhbar Alyaoum that the use of Darija to name Moroccan dishes and clothing in textbooks is for mere educational purposes. He stressed that the French textbook with the Darija poem does not belong to the ministry as it did not produce it or permit its use. The ministry called for educators and the general Moroccan society not to pay attention to distractions that could disrupt the progress of the current school year. The 2018-2019 academic year officially starts on Wednesday, September 5, for both public and private schools in Morocco. Parents of students in private schools have been complaining about the expensive prices of school textbooks.  The total prices of textbooks which typically did not exceed a total of MAD 2,000 or 2,800 per student for primary and secondary levels, now cost approximately MAD 1,600 for private primary schools and MAD 2,500 for middle schools.  Textbooks, notebooks, and other school accessories combined can cost as much as MAD 3,000 to 4,000 for high school. A librarian explained to Moroccan news outlets Le 360 that the French textbooks are more expensive than the Arabic books because they are imported. The increase in prices did not only stop at textbooks, but reached tuition fees also. According to Moroccan daily Al Massae, some private schools across the country increased tuition fees by 25 to 30 percent. Only 71.7 percent of Morocco’s population can read and write, while just 64.4 percent of the working-age population has completed secondary education or above, according to research group BMI. Despite challenges, Morocco is committed to improving the educational system. The government allocated MAD 70 billion to improve material resources and educational conditions for university students for the academic years ahead. The move is part of the implementation of the strategic vision of the 2015-2030 reform program, and in accordance with the 2016-2021 Government Action Program. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that about 700 vacant positions will be filled in 2018 to improve human resources management in Moroccan universities. The channels of recruitment will be diversified to attract a maximum of national and international expertise. Amzazi has recently unveiled his new national education plan to totally reform the sector. The new plan seeks to develop infrastructure and staff, rethink pedagogy, expand student enrollment and accessible education, support students against violence, and reform private education.

Rabat – Morocco will have a chance to push its exports at “Rencontres Africa” in Paris, convening decision-makers from Africa and Europe. The third Rencontres Africa (Africa Meetings) will be held September 24-25. The business delegation, led by the Moroccan Association of Exporters (ASMEX), will also include representatives of the Moroccan Investment and Export Development Agency (AMDIE), the French Chamber of Commerce, and  Moroccan industries, as well as some 20 exporters in order to explore opportunities for growth of Morocco’s exports. Several sectors, including agriculture, fisheries, health, and construction will be represented at the event, which allows exporters to meet 800 African decision-makers as well as 1,500 French and European leaders. Morocco’s foreign trade actors will actively participate to promote the continuity of South-South and South-North orientations initiated by the kingdom. “Rencontres Africa is one of the strategic meetings for the association, which has been working since 1982 to promote the national export offer,” said ASMEX President Hassan Sentissi El Idrissi. This year’s program includes conferences and B2B meetings with intra-participant meetings. The meetings are arranged directly via a matching platform. The event will also include pavilions from the nine African countries represented, including Morocco.

Rabat – After public outrage over traffic at Tangier Port, the transport ministry justified itself, saying it did not expect so many summer vacationers. Moroccan expats who came to Morocco for the summer have been stuck for more than 48 hours in Tangier Port waiting to go back to Europe. The expats, who voiced their anger through hundreds of videos on social media, were surprised to find themselves in bumper-to-bumper traffic waiting in a long line to return to their countries of residence. The secretary of state to the Ministry of Transport, Mohamed Najib Boulif, however, claimed that authorities have made all necessary measures to provide Moroccan expats with good travel conditions on their arrival to Morocco and return to Europe.  “This year, we did not expect a flow as big as in previous years. This year, it was thought [the port would have] to accommodate some 43,000 people” per day, he said. And according to Boulif, that number is the peak that the port can accommodate. “Neglected” for hours in scorching temperatures In response, activist and President of the Federation of Friends of Figuig in France Abderrahmane Benkerroum condemned the “catastrophic” situation that Moroccan expats experienced on their way back to Europe. Benkerroum, who attempted to leave Morocco on August 30, told Morocco World News that he arrived at the port at 9 a.m. with his family and had to wait until 10 p.m. for the ferry in an unbearable conditions. The civil activist, who works between Morocco and France, denounced the “infinite waiting under the scorching sun without explanation of the Moroccan authority nor even consolation from the [Mohammed V Foundation].” The activist added that even distribution of water was “insufficient.” While Boulif claimed that authorities ensured good conditions during the operation, the activist said that people were waiting in their cars in “scorching” temperatures. He blamed the fact there were only four border officials available to stamp passports for passengers for the long delay. Morocco World News contacted Tangier Med Port to ask how many ferries that Morocco owns. However, the communication declined to answer.  Boulif said that the Ministry of Transport did not expect so many expatriates to come back to Morocco for the summer and the Eid al-Adha holiday.  The Tangier Med Port transported, during the week of August 27 to September 2, 56,955 cars and 275,139 passengers, according to a new statement from the Tangier Med Port Authority. The number is up from the 16,641 vehicles and 90,973 passengers the port recorded in week at the same time of year in 2017. The numbers represent an  “exceptional increase” of 190 percent and 202 percent, respectively. Although Boulif said authorities expected only  43,000 travelers, he previously reported that 53,200 travelers left Morocco from Tangier Med Port on August 29 alone. The number, at the time, represented the highest single-day number since Operation “Marhaba” was launched in June to welcome returning Moroccan expats, according to the statement. Boulif made his remarks in a video published by his party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD). He emphasized that the government gives importance to the Marhaba operation, adding that several bodies ensure the success of the operation. The official said the ministry managed to offer 12 ferries to operate between Morocco and Europe. He asserted that the port received massive flow because many vacationers who spent the summer in Morocco wanted to leave the country between August 29 and September 1. “There was a remarkable, unprecedented flow. We did not expect that. We did what we could … by mobilizing all our resources,” Boulif said. It is not the only time Moroccan expats have expressed their anger. In the first weeks of the “Marhaba” operation, several videos circulating on social media featured Moroccans complaining about the lack of ferries between Spain and Morocco and the cost of tickets. The secretary of state responded to the situation, announcing new ticket prices after negotiations with ferry companies. The backlash, however, did not stop as citizens complained about an alleged lack of ships between Morocco and Europe. On Monday, September 3, Tangier Med Port Authority published a statement where it announced that since the launch of the operation the port recorded 181,962 vehicles and 678,783 passengers leaving the country. The numbers represented a growth of 45 percent and 20 percent since last year, respectively. Everything is “good” Despite the tension, the port authority claims that port operations “were carried out in good conditions, and a record was even achieved of 48 passenger ship rotations during the day of August 29.” The Tangier hub has also shared statements, touting the port’s achievements throughout the Marhaba operation. As of August 25, Tangier-Med Port Authority claimed that a total of 842,698 passengers entered Morocco through Tangier-Med since the launch of the “Marhaba” operation on June 5. The port added that authorities welcomed 33,091 travelers on July 29 alone. The achievements of the port, however, did not impress Moroccan expats as they were furious about long waits to return to Europe.

Rabat – A French court has summoned two Moroccan journalists, Naim Kamal and Narjis Rerhaye, for an article’s alleged press offence against a former Moroccan army captain. Both Narjis Rerhaye, a freelance journalist and author of the article, and Naim Kamal, director of Moroccan news outlet Quid.ma which published the article, are Moroccan nationals residing in Morocco. “The facts with which we are charged are based on a supposed press offense against Mr Mustapha Adib,” Kamal wrote in an article on August 29. Mustapha Adib is a former Moroccan army captain now residing in France. Both journalists received “summons for first appearance” from the Court of Major Jurisdiction of Paris, to appear on October 8. In the letter, Aida Traore, vice-president in charge of the investigation, informed the journalists that she “considers [their] indictment” for having published an article entitled “L’honneur perdu d’un ex-capitaine qui confond justice traditionnelle et caniveau’’ (The Lost Honor of an Ex-Captain Who Confuses Traditional Justice and the Gutter). The article, wrote Traore, contained an “outrageous expression, a term of contempt or an invective towards Mr Mustapha Adib.” The phrase she objected to, in French, translates to: “What Mustapha Adib did tends to barbarity.” The articles of the French law by which the two journalists have been charged include fines and imprisonment, according to Kamal. The two journalists expressed their “deep astonishment” that the French judicial system followed up on what they called “an unfounded complaint” to judge them “for a fallacious fact.” They asserted the issue “does not concern [France] in any way.”  A grievance from 2014 The incident dates back to June 20, 2014, when Quid.ma published an article stating that former army captain Adib “had tried to rush into” a hospital room in France’s Val-de-Grace Hospital, belonging to General Abdelaziz Bennani, former inspector general of Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR). Bennani was convalescing, and Adib left Bennani rotten flowers and an insulting letter. “Criminal Abdelaziz Bennani murdered thousands of innocent people and threw millions of orphans into the streets,” Quid.ma quoted Adib’s letter. “This is not activism. This is not militancy. It is not about the defense of human rights. What Mustapha Adib did tends to barbarity,” Quid.ma described Adib’s action. Adib, a captain in FAR, left the Moroccan army and settled in Paris after he was released from a Moroccan prison.  In 1998, Adib had written a letter to King Mohammed VI (then crown prince), claiming there was corruption in the Moroccan military. According to Jeune Afrique, King Mohammed VI conducted an investigation which resulted in the arrest of Adib. He was held for 30 months and freed in May 2002. Previous summons Two and a half years after Quid.ma published the article in June 2014, Kamal and Rerhaye received an email summoning them to the French police for what appeared to be an investigation. To avoid media agitation, “we preferred to act in strict observance of the procedure,” Kamal noted. “At my request I was received by Mustapha Ramid, then minister of justice, who assured me of his support. I had for him a question of sovereignty, a precise question: Did the French judiciary have the right to summon Moroccan citizens residing in Morocco, without going through any Moroccan institution?” wrote Kamal.  Ramid’s answer was “no,” he added. Rerhaye hired a Parisian law firm to follow the case. In the early summer of 2017, Morocco’s National Brigade of the Judicial Police (BNPJ) summoned both journalists  at France’s request.  Kamal and Rerhaye answered the Moroccan police’s questions, “assuming [responsibility] before the BNPJ for the entire content of the article,” Kamal wrote. Quid.ma questions the journalists’ summons Following summons, Quid.ma raised some substantive questions: “Can Moroccan citizens whose country of residence is Morocco be justiciable in France? Is the French judiciary entitled to summon foreign nationals not under its jurisdiction, in this case Moroccan, without other forms of procedure?” Again the journalists asked, “Would the Moroccan judiciary agree to divest itself of its powers? We dare to believe that the answer is no.” Conversely, the Moroccan news outlet wondered if “one could imagine a French publisher and a French journalist living in France, summoned by a Moroccan magistrate who would put them under investigation for ‘defamation’?”

In 2017, former player of Feyenoord Rotterdam and Moroccan international Karim El Ahmadi was also named best player of the Dutch nation. In 2009, it was Morocco’s Mounir El Hamdaoui who won the Golden Shoe with 23.6% of the votes. El Hamdaoui was evolving at the time with AZ Alkmaar where he finished top scorer in the league with 24 goals in 31 games the same year. In recent months, Ziyech has struggled to find his place with his own club, Ajax Amsterdam. After being linked to AS Roma, the footballer expressed many times his wish to leave, especially after his relationship with his club deteriorated.  The Atlas Lion was not happy to hear that the Dutch club replaced the number 10 jersey he always wore with number 22.  However, being a key player and an important figure, Ajax decided to renew Ziyech’s contract, convincing him to stay with a large pay rise. Calcio Mercato quoted Ziyech saying that he was “very close” to accepting the transfer move offered by AS Roma. “But in the end nothing is done due to the lack of agreement between the two clubs, but there were other offers, but for those it was not worth leaving Ajax,” Ziyech said. Ziyech also expressed his joy that he is staying with his team. “I did not expect to stay even this season, but now I am here and I will give everything for this jersey, I am very happy and I think I am in the best phase of my career.” The footballer made it to Morocco’s A list in the 2018 World Cup and has also been chosen to participate in the CAN 2019 qualifiers.

Rabat- El Othmani met several Chinese businessmen during the China-Africa summit in Beijing, including the CEO of Huawei, to discuss business cooperation. Representing King Mohammed VI at the summit Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) on Monday in the Chinese capital, Beijing, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani underlined Morocco’s commitment to improving its business climate to appeal to local and foreign investors. El Othmani invited Chinese businessmen to invest in the kingdom and Africa as a whole to bring more progress for the continent, reported state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). According to MAP, Chinese business leaders have invested in Morocco because of the country’s “stability” and have expressed a desire for future partnerships with Moroccan stakeholders. El Othmani met a number of major industrial leaders, including Ren Zhengfei, CEO of multinational IT company Huawei, and the chairman of China Energy Engineering Corporation, Wang Jianping. Accompanying El Othmani were Deputy Minister of African Affairs Mohcine Jazouli and Secretary of State to the Minister of Industry Othman El Ferdaous.

The two-day summit, held September 3-4, aims to build a bridge between Asia and Africa to deepen cooperation between the two continents. Morocco is open to initiatives aiming to boost cooperation between the two countries and improve the economy in Africa, such as “The Belt and Road Initiative.” The Chinese initiative was proposed in 2013 to create a trade network that will link Asia, Africa, and Europe. China’s ambassador to Morocco, Li Li, said that Morocco provides an ideal platform for Chinese companies looking for new markets. China pledged to invest $60 billion in African countries for the continent’s economic development.  The country’s president,  Xi Jinping, announced that the fund includes $20 billion for credit lines, $15 billion to finance imports of goods to Africa, and $10 billion from Chinese companies choosing to invest in the continent over the next three years. In 2017, Chinese firms announced a new investment of $11 billion into the creation of “Mohamed VI Tangier Tech City,” a new factory district that aims to generate 100,000 new jobs in the Tangier area. China has become one of Morocco’s most significant economic partners as the two countries have reinforced their ties in several sectors, including media and tourism.  China’s interest in Morocco also extends to its fisheries and aquaculture assets. Both Morocco’s and China’s fisheries sectors are very important to their economies. According to a recent report from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, Morocco’s fish production ranked 13th globally, with 1.3 million tons of fish, while China topped the list with 1.2 million tons of fish. Morocco’s Secretary of State for Sea Fisheries Mbarka Bouaida and China’s Deputy Mayor Wang Luming, of Qingdao in eastern China both commended Morocco’s potential in the sector, during their talks in July about fisheries and aquaculture.

Rabat – Members of the European Parliament have started a working visit to Morocco to evaluate “the benefits of the fisheries agreements” in Morocco’s southern provinces. Arriving in Morocco on Sunday, September 2, the deputies from the Committee on International Trade (INTA) aim to see the situation on the ground. The delegation consists of Patricia Lalonde, a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; Tiziana Beghin, a member of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy Group; and Heidi Hautala, a member of group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The list also includes David Martin of the Social Democrats Group. During their stay in Dakhla and Laayoune in Western Sahara, the deputies will meet representatives of public authorities and NGOs. The chairman of the Moroccan-European Union Joint Parliamentary Committee, Abderrahim Atmoun, welcomed the visit, expressing hopes that “the next stage of voting on the two agreements, agricultural and fisheries, will tend to maintain the strong ties binding the two parties extending to all other areas of cooperation, including the political, technical and cultural as well as the security,” according to a statement from the committee. A long-awaited agreement Morocco and the EU agreed to a new fisheries deal following months-long rounds of negotiations. The deal allows European fishing ships to fish in Moroccan waters for financial compensation. The deal was finalized on July 24, in Rabat, with Moroccan officials. Authorities anticipate that the agreement constitutes a brand new step and new spirit in strategic Morocco-EU relations.
Instead of the €80 million that Rabat requested, the EU agreed to pay €52 million for fishing privileges. The amount is higher than the €42 million in the previous deal. The previous deal expired on July 14. Rabat and Brussels failed to reach an agreement due to compensation negotiations. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) decreed in February that the fisheries agreement between the two parties is “valid insofar as it is not applicable to Western Sahara or to its adjacent waters.” Moroccan officials, however, were firm that they would not renew if Western Sahara were not included in the agreement. In response to the verdict, Moroccan Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch said that the ECJ “did not consult with the populations in the southern provinces, because the agreements [signed between Morocco and the EU] favored” the region. He  said, “If an agreement is reached within the framework of national sovereignty, which is a red line, [Morocco then] will negotiate with the Europeans.” In light of Morocco’s conditions and the ECJ’s not having authority over trade agreements, the EU agreed to include Western Sahara waters in the agreement.

Rabat – Russian and Syrian foreign ministries have implied that they will soon retake Idlib province, the final rebel stronghold in Syria. As Al Jazeera put it: “An all-out offensive to retake the last rebel-held province in Syria is only a matter of time.” Syrian representatives met Russian officials in Moscow on Thursday, August 30. Meanwhile, UN Syria Envoy Staffan de Mistura declared in a statement to reporters in Geneva that Idlib may experience a “perfect storm.” Al Jazeera noted that there could be “possible military implications beyond the region.” Idlib province, which is situated in northwestern Syria and borders Turkey, remains the last stronghold of the rebel factions. It is controlled mostly by the group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS was formed on January 28, 2017, as a merger between Al Qaida’s Syria affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra, and other Islamist factions. The area is controlled to a lesser extent by the Syrian Liberation Front and some Turkey-backed rebel groups: Faylaq al-Sham, Jaysh al-Nasr, and Free Idlib Army.  Idlib province was established as a de-escalation and ceasefire zone in May 2017, in the framework of the Astana agreement, which was signed by Iran and Russia (as backers of Assad’s government) and Turkey (as a rebel ally). The province became a refuge for thousands of militants fleeing territories retaken by pro-Assad forces who refused to reconcile and surrender their arms. However, the Astana agreement is threatened by the Syrian regime and its allies, who plan to reconquer Idlib. The agreement was previously challenged in the beginning of 2018 due to some clashes between Syrian regime forces and opposition factions along the countryside of southern Idlib. The regime’s increased reconquest objective is likely to generate a large-scale assault and would pose many political, diplomatic, and humanitarian challenges. Prospective Scenarios   “What we need to do now is to wipe out those terrorist groups which persist, particularly within the de-escalation area of Idlib,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He made the remarks at the press conference following his meeting with his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Muallem in Moscow on August 30. He added, “It is unacceptable that those terrorists particularly al-Nusra Front are using the de-escalation area of Idlib to attack the Syrian army and to also attack through drones the Russian military bases in the area.” The current scenario that the Syrian regime’s ally, Russia, will defend to the international community is a severe military assault targeting initially southern and western parts of Idlib where al-Nusra Front and the last vestiges of ISIS are based. Nevertheless, moderate Islamists and non-Islamist rebel groups are reluctant to believe that the purpose of the assault is to counter terrorism. They fear a massive military action that will aim to demolish all opposition factions’ capacities (both Islamist and non-Islamist ones) and push them to surrender. In this context, rebels in the northwestern area of Idlib have blown up two key bridges, dug trenches, and called civilians to take arms to hamper an expected government assault. As Idlib is the final stage in recovering all Syrian territory, Syrian regime forces will probably not limit their operations to southern and western Idlib. Instead, they will move on to a large-scale attack in the northern and northwestern parts of Idlib, where they will fight fiercely with rebels using conventional arms and perhaps chemical weapons to push them to surrender. Then, the Syrian regime will be in a strong position to force rebels to reach a reconciliation agreement. In June, rebel forces in Nawa in the southern Daraa province were compelled to accept a reconciliation agreement after a week of heavy artillery shelling and air strikes from Syrian and Russian forces in the province. Prospective Challenges Both a limited and a full-scale Syrian regime assault on Idlib would undoubtedly imply a political compromise with Turkey. However, it would raise serious humanitarian challenges in terms of civilian deaths and injuries, civilian infrastructure destruction, and another refugee crisis. Turkey is the key player. French officials are keeping silent, and the US’s position is seemingly timid. Turkey, in contrast, borders Idlib province and backs most of the rebel groups there. Turkey’s importance has been obvious since the conclusion in May 2017 of the Astana agreement, in which Turkey established many observation posts in Idlib’s northwestern part. Turkey tried to prevent a large-scale offensive on Idlib. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a Victory Day reception at the presidential palace in Ankara on August 30: “We are conducting joint works with the Russians and Iranians on Idlib to prevent another Aleppo-like disaster.” Erdogan announced he would participate in the third summit of the Astana process that Tehran will host on September 7 and that Russia will attend. The Turkish margin of influence on the Russian-Syrian Idlib assault is meaningfully restrained, however, because of its current dependency on Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile battery supplies. Speaking at a graduation ceremony for military officers on Friday, August 31, Erdogan said that Turkey needed Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries. He also said he planned to buy the S-400s as soon as possible. Erdogan would rely on Russia to preserve the Turkish military presence in the Kurdish district of Afrin, posing the need as a condition of any agreement on Idlib. Echoing that belief, the Atlantic Council’s Associate Director Reema Hibrawi stated that “Turkey’s motives seem tied more to the removal of elements of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and return of Syrian refugees than to protecting current Idlib residents.” According to the Atlantic Council, “Other analysts … expect that Turkey’s setup of twelve observation posts across northern Syria is an attempt to expel Kurdish fighters from northern Syria, gain a military foothold in the region, and protect against a new influx of besieged Syrians.” The Syrian regime’s final assault on Idlib may lead in one way or another to a humanitarian disaster. John Ging, who heads operations and advocacy for the UN’s humanitarian coordination office, told the Security Council recently: “A worst-case scenario in Idlib will overwhelm capacities and has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency at a scale not yet seen through this crisis.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said also on Wednesday, August 29, that he was “deeply concerned about the growing risks of a humanitarian catastrophe in the event of a full-scale military operation in Idlib.” Pawel Krzysiek, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria said, “The remaining [health] facilities are neither properly equipped nor prepared for a massive influx of patients” and that “any offensive will make an already precarious situation even worse.” The regime’s attack could cut off food to the dense population of Idlib estimated by the UN at more than 2.5 million people. Among those, according to Doctors without Borders (MSF), half are Syria. The number includes “civilians and opposition fighters displaced or evacuated from fighting in Homs, Aleppo, Hama, and parts of Damascus,” according to the Atlantic Council. An assault could also provoke a massive movement of refugees fleeing tensions in Idlib to Turkey’s border. But if the border crossings with Turkey are to shut down, thousands of civilians, rebels, and families will have nowhere to go and will be endangered by any Syrian regime forces attack. The UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura, speaking to journalists in Geneva on Thursday, August 30, “offered to personally escort residents of Idlib to safety ahead of any attack on the last main opposition-held area in the country, echoing an offer to do the same in Aleppo in 2016,” according to UN News.  He said: “Where can anyone go? So, for every time there was a crisis and there was a conclusion to that one crisis, there was a place where many could opt to go. There is no other Idlib.”

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred is out of the competition.  The Moroccan singer’s name was ruled off the list of nominees in the All Africa Awards (AFRIMA) competition, which will take place in Ghana in November.  Lamjarred had been nominated in three categories: Best singer in Africa, best song in Africa for “Casablanca,” and best artist in North Africa. AFRIMA is an organization that aims to promote African music and artists across the continent. The organizers of the ceremony have recently decided to remove the singer of “Ghazali” because of his recent issues with rape charges.  The 32-year-old artist was arrested on Sunday, August 26, in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France after police received a new rape complaint from another woman. After two days in custody, the Moroccan singer was placed under judicial supervision and prohibited from leaving France or contacting the complainant. In addition, the singer was required to pay bail of €150,000. The pop sensation met the victim in a nightclub in Saint-Tropez, on Saturday night. He invited her to his hotel room and, according to Lamjarred’s lawyer, had “a consensual sexual relationship.” However, the woman, a 29-year-old seasonal worker in Saint-Tropez, accused Lamjarred of rape. Lamjarred is also awaiting trial in a separate rape case in France.

Rabat – The notable absence of Morocco’s Mehdi Benatia from Renard’s list for the Morocco-Malawi CAN qualifier is still making headlines. Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported today that the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) obtained a medical file from Benatia’s club, Juventus, explaining the national team captain’s physical condition. The footballer, according to the newspaper, suffers from abdominal pain. The newspaper added that Benatia’s condition requires him to rest for about four months. The explanation could answer the thousands of Moroccan football fans and national media who have asked whether Benatia’s absence was due to a conflict with Morocco’s head coach Herve Renard. Benatia already responded to rumors of why Renard did not select him for the game. Benatia tweeted, “Oh we’re used [to it] it’s not the first time I would say @Herve_Renard_HR is not just a coach for me it’s (sic) a friend the gossip will never stop ?!” In another tweet, Benatia wrote, “One more lie. This is to (sic) much!” Morocco will play against Malawi as part of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on September 8 in Casablanca. FRMF announced yesterday that tickets for the game will be available starting September 3. The prices range from MAD 30 to MAD 600.

Rabat- The new school year has come with more costs for Moroccan parents who complain of “expensive” school textbooks. Summer and Eid al-Adha holidays have ended and the 2018-2019 academic year will officially start on Wednesday, September 5, for both public and private schools in Morocco. This year, parents with children in private schools complain of the “high prices” of school textbooks. In previous years, private school textbooks typically did not exceed a total of MAD 2,000 or 2,800 per student for primary and secondary levels. The total prices of textbooks now costs approximately MAD 1,600 for private primary schools and MAD 2,500 for middle schools. Textbooks, notebooks, and other school accessories combined can cost as much as MAD 3,000 to 4,000  for high school. A librarian explained to Moroccan news outlets Le 360 that the French textbooks are more expensive than the Arabic books because they are imported. As for public schools, the cost of primary school textbooks ranges from MAD 600 to 700. It costs MAD 1,000 for middle school and MAD 1,300 for high school. According to 2017-2018 school year statistics from Minister of Education Said Amzazi, Moroccan private schools receive only 14 percent of the country’s students. While over 6 million students go to public schools, just under 1 million go to private schools. The rise in prices does not only affect textbooks but tuition fees also.  According to Moroccan daily Al Massae, some private schools across the country increased tuition fees by 25 to 30 percent. The outlet claims that some private schools refuse to register students with grades lower than 14 out of 20 because the students would “affect their image.” The start of school year follows shortly after Eid al-Adha (festival of sacrifice) when Moroccan Muslim families bought sheep or goats to slaughter. The price of a sheep ranges from MAD 1,500 to MAD 5,000. The period is difficult for many families since school fees and Eid expenses drain their finances.

Rabat – Spanish media outlets have reported that young women conscripted into mandatory military service in Morocco will be subjected to a virginity test. The news has sparked outrage and controversy on social media. Moroccan youth were taken by surprise when the ministerial council approved a draft bill on August 20, to reinstate mandatory military service for young men and women, aged 19 to 25, for 12 months. The bill has not yet been approved by Parliament. The ministerial council said the bill aimed to “inculcate the spirit of citizenship in young people as part of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship,” triggering mixed reactions from citizens. However, Moroccans were even more surprised when several Spanish outlets, including Cadena Ser reported that women would be required to undergo a virginity test so “that families could not accuse a member of the army of rape.”  Quickly, the rumor was shot down by the Moroccan government. Contacted by HuffPost Maroc, a parliamentarian said the rumor was an “unfortunate interpretation.” added that the ministry would never impose such a thing.  According to the same source, no decree or internal note can be imposed until the law has been passed in Parliament. “The text relating to military service is general and simply evokes the bases that will be defined subsequently by decrees.”  Contacted by Morocco World News for further explanation, Mustapha El Khalfi, government spokesperson, did not respond.  A virginity test has previously been established for military services in other countries, such as Egypt and Indonesia, before it was abolish.  In 2015, Human Rights Watch asked the Indonesian military to stop virginity testing for those who wished to become soldiers. In December 2011, Egypt banned the army from conducting “virginity tests” on candidates wishing to become a soldier.

Rabat – President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker has promised that the EU will end the time switch between summers and winters. Many people across the world have signed petitions against Daylight Saving Time (DST). Juncker pledged that the EU would take into consideration people’s demands as a recent survey in the EU showed that 76 percent of people who participated in the study believed that DST is “negative.” The survey included 4.6 million participants and was conducted between July 4 and August 16. Three million of the participants were from Germany. In a statement to German television broadcasting company ZDF, Juncker said that he would support the abolishment of Daylight Saving Time. Quoted by DW, Juncker said on Friday: “We carried out a survey, millions responded and believe that in future, summer time should be year-round, and that’s what will happen.” He said, “The people want it, we’ll do it.” According to the numerous petitions, however, not all EU citizens support summer time for the whole year. Daylight Saving Time is also opposed in Morocco. In 2017, a group of activists launched a petition urging the government and the Parliamentary Council to abolish the biannual time change and maintain Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The signatories deemed remaining on GMT “appropriate with the country’s geographical location throughout the year.” A similar action erupted in Europe in recently as several member countries urged the EU to consider abolishing Daylight Saving Time. Daylight Saving Time was first adopted during the first World War in the UK to give factories more daylight hours in which to operate, thereby aiding the war.

By Chase Lacy Rabat- Unlike its recent spat with Canada, much of Saudi Arabia’s political meddling is anti-Iran geopolitical maneuvering, a focal point in Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy. On August 5, Saudi Arabia accused Canada of “blatant interference” in its affairs after Canada’s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, called for the immediate release of human rights activist Samar Badawi and her brother Raif Badawi, both women’s rights activists.  Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, “The kingdom views the Canadian position as an affront to the kingdom that requires a sharp response to prevent any party from attempting to meddle with Saudi sovereignty.” Saudi Arabia launched into a sharp reaction by expelling the Canadian ambassador from Saudi Arabia, ordering thousands of Saudi students to transfer from their Canadian universities, calling Saudi patients in Canadian medical facilities to relocate outside the country, and suspending all future trade. Notably, an $11 billion arms deal between Saudi Arabia and Canada may be scrapped.  Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia’s foreign meddling is focused on its Iran policy. Iranian-backing anywhere in the eyes of Saudi Arabia’s aggressive foreign policy is considered a threat.  Iranian ally Hezbollah, especially by the assistance of its media wing Al-Manar, has become a political force to contend with in Lebanon. In 2016 Lebanon’s Prime Minister Saad Hariri formed a coalition government that allied itself with Hezbollah, ending a two year political deadlock.  Saudi Arabia attempted to destabilize Lebanon to weaken Hezbollah. Their ensuing behavior reinforced the increasingly prevalent black-and-white Saudi perspective that everyone is either an ally of the kingdom or its enemy.  In late October 2017, Hariri visited Riyadh to meet Saudi intelligence officials and Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan. Hariri was reportedly pleased with the visit, claiming positive feedback from the crown prince. He also asserted that Saudi Arabia would support a conference in Paris to assist the Lebanese economy, a Rome meeting to support the Lebanese military, and a joint council to encourage investments in Lebanon.  Importantly however, sources close to Hariri speaking to Reuters believed he had convinced Saudi officials that rapprochement with Hezbollah was necessary for Lebanon’s stability.  Hariri was due to return to Riyadh on November 6, 2017, however King Salman requested Hariri  meet Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman (MBS), moving the date earlier to November 3. When Hariri arrived, Saudi Arabia did not put out the usual entourage to welcome an important figure like a prime minister, an initial concerning sign.  Hariri’s meeting with MBS did not take place as planned on the 3rd, and instead he spent the night in his personal residence in Riyadh.  The next morning at 8 a.m., unusually early, Hariri was summoned to meet MBS. He disappeared from public sight for hours and then reappeared on television announcing his resignation as prime minister due to threats on his life from Hezbollah and Tehran sowing “devastation and chaos” in the region. The fiery language of the speech, according to Hariri’s aides, was notably uncharacteristic of him, and added to the already prevalent speculation that Saudi Arabia had prefabricated the speech and forced him to abide by their demands.  However, Saudi Arabia failed disastrously because once Hariri had been released from Saudi Arabia he rescinded his resignation. Saudi Arabia also failed to direct Lebanon’s public’s anger towards Hezbollah and in fact united Lebanon’s various sects and factions in opposition to Saudi interference.  Qatar is another country that has been on the receiving end of Saudi aggression.  A crisis in the Gulf began on June 5, 2017, when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar. The severing of ties attempted to isolate Qatar and force the peninsula to succumb to their larger neighbor’s agenda and become a vassal state.  The “quartet” of countries demanded that Qataris leave their territories within 14 days and prohibited their own citizens from living in Qatar. Saudi Arabia closed the land border, and the group prohibited ships under the Qatari flag or working for Qatar from docking at their ports. They also required aircraft flying to or from Qatar to receive prior permission to travel through their airspace.  On June 22, the quartet gave Qatar a 13-point list of demands that included points such as ending all support for “terrorist organizations” such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah, ISIS, and Al Qaeda. The quartet demanded Qatar shutdown Al Jazeera and other Qatari-funded news outlets such as Middle East Eye and Arabi21. The group also called for Qatar to close down the Turkish military base, end joint-exercises with Turkey and diminish its ties with Iran. Finally, the coalition asked Qatar to pay reparations for “loss of life” and financial losses due to Qatari policies and to align with Saudi Arabia politically, militarily, socially, and economically.  Though initially Qatar’s economy took a downturn while there was panic regarding the blockade, it recovered. In fact, Qatar is projected to have 2.6 percent GDP growth in 2018. Rather than align with the quartet, Qatar grew closer with Iran and Turkey. Saudi Arabia’s recent row with Canada bears a remarkable resemblance to the kingdom’s diplomatic spat with Sweden in 2015.  In January 2015 Sweden’s foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, criticized the kingdom’s human rights record. Speaking to parliament, she denounced the flogging of liberal blogger Raif Badawi and accused Saudi Arabia of being a dictatorship. After Sweden recognized Palestine as a sovereign state, she was invited to speak as a guest of honor at the Arab League conference in Cairo.  Wallstrom’s planned remarks on democracy and women’s rights led Saudi Arabia to block her speech, and Sweden in turn scrapped a defense cooperation agreement between the two countries.  In response Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Sweden, Ibrahim bin Ibrahim, on March 9, 2015, citing Sweden’s “flagrant interference” in its affairs. The kingdom said criticism of its human rights record was “harmful to the kingdom.” Sweden’s business community was concerned about the diplomatic spat. Saudi Arabia is Sweden’s fourth largest recipient of arms outside the EU with sale totals in 2014 reaching approximately $39 million. Despite the confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Sweden, both were keen to repair relations. Within the same month, Saudi Arabia reinstated its ambassador to Sweden after Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven apologized.  Saudi Arabia took a similar approach to criticism from Germany. On November 13, 2017, speaking with Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, then German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said to reporters that “Europe could not tolerate the adventurism that has spread there.” His remarks were a veiled criticism of the kingdom’s interference in Lebanon. Afterwards, Saudi Arabia summoned the German ambassador in Riyadh and handed him “a protest memorandum over the shameful and unjustified remarks by German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel.” The kingdom also called its ambassador to Germany home for a consultation. The foreign ministry said “Such remarks provoke the surprise and disapproval of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which considers them as aimless and based on false info that would not help bring about stability in the region.” Since November, the kingdom has told its agencies not to renew contracts with non-essential German firms, though apparently those deemed essential continued operations.  To German news outlet Der Spiegel, an unidentified businessman said, “For Germans, the doors in Riyadh have suddenly been closed.”  Detlef Daues, who owns a virtual department store for spare parts, has invested $5 million in his business in preparation for Saudi Arabia’s economic transition from its oil-based economy. However, he claims that he is being excluded from contracts since Gabriel’s comments.  In another example, Riyadh had originally awarded a contract to construct a bike path through the city’s green belt to German AS+P Albert Speer and Bodecker Landscape Architects. After the spat however, the contract was reassigned to American company Coen+Partners.  Germany is Saudi Arabia’s third largest source of imports and its largest trading partner in Europe, with German exports to the kingdom totaling €6.6 billion. Companies such as Bayer, Siemens AG, and Thyssenkrupp are among the 800 German companies active in the kingdom, and 200 of these companies have offices there, employing approximately 40,000 people.  Saudi Arabia, embattled geopolitically in proxy wars with Iran, is pursuing MBS’s Vision 2030 plan. MBS realizes Saudi Arabia desperately needs to change going forward through moves such as privatizing certain sectors of the economy, which notably included Aramco until rejected by King Salman; encouraging foreign investment; decreasing dependence on oil money; and initiating limited social change. However, the prevailing trend in Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy is aggression. The kingdom has meddled in Syria and spearheaded a devastating war in Yemen that has created a severe humanitarian crisis.  Saudi Arabia even had the audacity to attempt to isolate a fellow Gulf nation and even detain and force the prime minister of a sovereign nation to resign from his post. These actions alienate communities and countries, and in fact push them away from Saudi interests.  Saudi’s policy to attempt to force communities and countries to bend to the kingdom’s own hegemonic ambitions in fact empowers its proclaimed rival Iran. Under Saudi threats, did Qatar move any closer to Saudi Arabia? No, in fact Qatar tightened its relations with Iran and Turkey.  Did Lebanon respond to Hariri’s resignation with anger towards Hezbollah for its power and influence in Lebanon? No, the multitude of factions in the divided country united against the simple fact that Saudi Arabia was doing to Lebanon what it so vehemently accuses Western countries that criticize the kingdom’s dismal human rights record—of interfering in their internal affairs.  The kingdom additionally did not receive support from the US or other Western nations. Contrary to US President Trump, former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, “The United States cautions against any party, within or outside Lebanon, using Lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country.” In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia has realized its need to backtrack. The kingdom made an attempt to make amends for its actions when it reinstated a $1 billion credit line to Lebanon that it had originally canceled in 2016.  Saudi Arabia’s actions regarding Canada are the culmination of Saudi’s statement to Western countries for publicly addressing issues such as human rights in the kingdom—they are not to be mentioned.   While the kingdom has introduced reforms, such as finally permitting women to drive vehicles this summer, the country is sending the message that this is by the grace of the rulers, a gift rather than the result of activism. The same dozens of individuals such as Samar Badawi that campaigned to bring such rights to Saudi Arabia were subsequently arrested by the authorities.  Saudi Arabia under MBS is willing to undergo societal transformations to stir economic growth through increasing foreign investments, privatizing, and enacting reforms. However as the arrests of the activists shows, anything that changes in Saudi Arabia is by the state’s will. If the kingdom allows for more freedom to speak out against the state, individuals may call not just for societal transformation, but for political transformation.  The aggression Saudi Arabia exhibits in its foreign policy is disastrous for its image, and if the country wants foreign investors to be comfortable in the country the government must halt these radical acts.  In time, Saudi Arabia may backtrack from its hostile position with Canada and Germany, as it did with Sweden, especially as MBS’s power is further solidified in the kingdom. When it comes to the Iranians and their proxies, however, Saudi Arabia has maintained a trend towards further hostility.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI is spending his vacation in the Seychelles, islands in the Indian Ocean, following his visit to the UAE. The king arrived on Sunday, September 2, after a five-hour plane ride from the United Arab Emirates to the Seychelles’ capital Victoria, located on Mahe, the largest island in the Seychelles. The island country lies in the Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar and approximately 1,600 kilometers east of Kenya.  The 115 islands which make up the Seychelles are called “the land of perpetual summer” and enjoy a warm, tropical climate all year. The islands are a popular destination for beach lovers. The Seychelles has attracted the King for a second visit after his first visit to the islands in April 2015. The monarch visited the UAE on August 29. There he met internet chef sensation Salt Bae, who posted a picture of the meeting on Instagram. The King’s previou visit to the country was in November 2017 to operate as a mediator amid tensions between Gulf countries and Qatar, known as the “Gulf crisis.” The UAE and Morocco have already established strong economic and diplomatic relations. The Emirati minister of foreign affairs, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, commended the “distinguished” bonds between the two countries, emphasizing that the ties are at “their best.” He pointed out in 2017 that non-oil trade exchange between the two countries rose from $464 million in 2013 to $524 million in 2017.

Rabat – The wali of Western Sahara has slammed the Democracy Now! television program for reporters’ comments on human rights in Western Sahara. A former member of the Polisario Front, Wali Yahdih Bouchaab, lost his temper and asked American journalists working for Democracy Now! to rather focus on human rights violations in the US. Democracy Now! posted an hour-long exclusive broadcast on Western Sahara on Youtube on August 31. Twenty minutes into the feature,  the crew of journalists recorded video as they headed into the office of the wali in Laayoune. But on arrival, Bouchaab refused to give the interview, asking them to get authorization. “If you have the authorization, I would be more than glad to provide this interview.” However, the journalist interviewing the official started asking him questions on human rights in Western Sahara in front of a hidden camera. “If I am retired, I can even come to your station in the US and to deliver that interview,” he said, emphasizing that he could not give information if the crew did not have authorization. The footage is believed to be from 2016. However, the video was published just four days ago. Speaking to the wali, the journalist started quoting from a 1995 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report on “Morocco’s efforts to block access to MINURSO.” The report, according to the journalist, claimed that Morocco had refused to give answers as to why MINURSO’s staff and observers are “subjected to constant surveillance by Morocco.” The wali commented with a smile: “very exciting.” When the journalist said that what she quoted is from HRW, the governor asked, “Human Rights Watch, is that Bible? Is that Qur’an?” Asked if he disagreed with the report, Bouchaab said, “I disagree completely.” The report claimed that Moroccan authorities “harassment” of HRW prevented the organization of conducting “a thorough investigation of human rights” in the region.  Slamming the report, the governor said that the organization say “anything … to “make things exciting.” The journalist continued to ask questions about alleged arrests and a crackdown after demonstrations in the region. “If you are talking about peaceful demonstration, I am with … I appreciate to see people demonstrating and to give their—to provide their opinions.” When the reporter said that people “got injured” during the demonstrations, the wali replied, “You will see who was hurt by those demonstrations. It’s not demonstrations. It’s completely—the anarchy” he said. When asked about human rights in the region, the governor asked the journalist to focus on human rights violations in the US. “Human rights—even in United States, you don’t have them. You have more than one million people living just in the underground in New York, and they are eating rats, and when they are sick they are eaten by the rats,” he said. He also proposed that Democracy Now! should ‘work on it in Guantanamo and everywhere.” King Mohammed VI appointed Bouchaab as the wali of Laayoune in 2014.

Rabat – The UAE Athletics Federation has dismissed the former Moroccan Olympic track champion, Said Aouita, from its technical staff. The federation sacked Said Aouita on Sunday after Emirati athletes delivered disappointing performances in the 18th Asian Games, held from August 18 to September 2, in Jakarta, Indonesia. The supervisory board examined the Emiratis performances and decided to sack the coach. The board argued that they provided all the necessities to both technical staff and athletes through long-term training camps with the supervision of a renowned coach, Aouita. The federation added that the Asian Games are an important step to prepare for the coming 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. The federation is now looking for a new coach who can deliver prominent results at the Olympics.  The UAE sent 12 athletes to the Asian Games. The athletes returned home with 14 medals: 3 gold medals, 6 silver, and 5 bronze. Aouita, who gained fame in athletics, was a world champion. Aouita was a middle and long-distance runner who broke multiple world records. Aouita stunned the world when he broke his own record for the 5,000 meter in 1987 with a time of 12:58.39. Aouita was the first man to run the 5,000 meter race in under 13 minutes, a feat he accomplished at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome.

Rabat – Moroccan international footballer Younes Belhanda has lost his temper.  The Atlas Lion had a rough night, Saturday, September 1, during the 4th day of the Turkish league’s season.  Belhanda, who was playing against Trabzonspor with his team Galatasaray, did not last long on the field. OGC Nice’s former player was given a red card after he violently kicked a Trabzonspor player.  Following the loss of his team 4-0, Belhanda had to face angry supporters in the airport who blamed him for the Galatasaray’s loss. One of the disappointed fans shouted at Belhanda: “Go home.”  Irritated by the comment, Herve Renard’s player harshly insulted the fan in Darija (Moroccan Arabic). Belhanda’s insults were recorded, posted online, and the video soon went viral.  Many on social media commented on Belhanda’s reaction. Some agreed with his words, denouncing the ‘racist’ fan’s words, but others blamed Belhanda for his team’s loss and described his reaction as excessive.  Belhanda will have to forget about the unfortunate incident and move forward to focus on an important competition: the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.  The 28-year-old has been chosen by Herve Renard to be part of the 25 players who will compete against Malawi, September 8, in the Mohammed V Stadium of Casablanca. The game will be a qualifier for the competition.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani landed in China on Sunday to represent King Mohammed VI at the China-Africa summit in Beijing. El Othmani will attend the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) at the request of the King. The two-day symposium, which will take place September 3-4, aims to build a bridge between Asia and Africa to deepen cooperation between the two continents. Xinhua quoted Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, saying that the summit “will be a great success and establish a new historical monument of friendly cooperation between China and Africa.” The event will convene African leaders to discuss business cooperation between the two sides. The meeting could be a good opportunity for Morocco to deepen ties with China as both countries have vowed to promote their partnership. In July, El Othmani and the secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China (CPC), You Quan, commended the 60 years of bilateral ties between the two countries since 1958. The Chinese official also expressed his country’s determination to work with Morocco “to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state to solidify mutual political trust, deepen mutually beneficiary (sic) cooperation and jointly push forward the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, which was proposed in 2013 by China,” reported China Daily. The Chinese initiative aims at creating a trade network that will link Asia, Africa, and Europe. Morocco welcomed the proposal and signed a memorandum of understanding with China to promote “The Belt and Road Initiative, ”becoming the first Maghreb country to ink the document to assist China’s economic campaign. China’s ambassador to Morocco, Li Li, said that Morocco could play a “unique” role in the initiative and that Morocco provides an ideal platform for Chinese companies looking for new markets. “The initiative provides a good opportunity for developing China-Morocco ties, which are an important part of the broader cooperation between China and Arab countries,” he said. Talks on the project will be further developed this week during FOCAC, a summit that began meeting in 2000.

Rabat – Burkina Faso’s international footballer Alain Traore has said that he asked Morocco’s head coach, Renard, for advice before joining Morocco’s RSB football club. The 29 year old signed a three-year contract with Renaissance Sportive de Berkane (RSB) in August. In an interview with So Foot, the international striker said that he called Herve Renard, who told him to join RSB “without fear.” The footballer said that he experienced a successful start with his new club. He said, “for the moment, it’s going well: I played my first match in the CAF Cup” against a Sudanese team, Al Hilal. “We won 2-0, I scored. And on August 25, I played my first league match against Oujda (1-1.)” Despite the many offers he received, Traore said he did not regret joining Morocco’s RSB. “No, no … I was very well received by the players, the staff, the supporters. The championship seems to be of a good level. Morocco also has beautiful stadiums. “For an African, it’s something special to live such an experience. I arrived very young in Europe, and there I played CAF Cup matches. We will participate in the quarterfinals. Frankly, I think it’s a great experience to live,” he said. The player also played for Monaco on loan in 2015 and Kayserispor, as well as Qatar’s Al-Markhiya. Traore also shared with So Foot why he exited Qatari’s Al Markhiya. He said that the team asked him last winter to lower his salary. “I refused. I had about fifteen months left in my contract. “I was paid three months salary, and I left. I came back to France and I trained with the reserve team in Lyon.” He also opened up about why he left the French league, emphasizing that he had to “go away” as he experienced a difficult experience in Lorient, “when Sylvain Ripoll became number 1.” He added that coach Ripoll has “dismissed” him. “I never knew why. Besides, one day, I would like to have a discussion with him, to understand.”

Rabat – There is bad news for the football clubs who showed an interest in Ajax star Hakim Ziyech. The Moroccan footballer has reportedly decided to renew his contract with Dutch football team Ajax. Calciomercato reported that Ajax convinced the footballer to stay “with a massive pay rise.” Ziyech is highly wanted in the Italian league; Roma made several attempts to convince Ajax to sell its superstar. Ziyech had been considering AS Roma’s offer, and he reportedly expressed his willingness to leave the Netherlands league. Calcio Mercato quoted Ziyech, saying that he was “very close” to accepting the transfer move offered by AS Roma. “But in the end nothing is done due to the lack of agreement between the two clubs, but there were other offers, but for those it was not worth leaving Ajax,” Ziyech said. Ziyech also expressed his joy that he is staying with his steam. “I did not expect to stay even this season, but now I am here and I will give everything for this jersey, I am very happy and I think I am in the best phase of my career.” The footballer made it to Morocco’s A list in the 2018 World Cup and has also been chosen to participate in the CAN 2019 qualifiers. In April 2018, Ajax named Ziyech player of the year after he led his Dutch team to a major win over AZ Alkmaar (3-0). The award recognized Ziyech’s excellent performance with the Dutch team over the season. Born in the Netherlands to Moroccan parents, Ziyech chose to represent Morocco internationally. On October 2015, the player made his debut for Morocco in a friendly with Côte d’Ivoire, which ended with a 0-1 victory for Côte d’Ivoire.

Rabat- Australia’s Bond University in Queensland has offered a scholarship for Morocco’s “high academic achievers.” The university announced that Moroccan students would benefit from tuition remission scholarships, providing financial aid. “These scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and are a testament to Bond University’s commitment to quality and outstanding international students,” stated the university. Students wishing to enroll for the January semester must complete the Bond University Online Application Form before September 21.  According to the announcement, “Once an offer has been received, students must complete the International Student Scholarship – Morocco Application Form.” When completed, the form must be submitted to “[email protected]” Established in 1989, Bond University is Australia’s first private university, located in Robina, Gold Coast, Queensland. It has four faculties focused on teaching and research: faculties of business, law, health sciences and medicine, society and design. The university has 2,900 undergraduate students and 1,200 postgraduate students. Morocco also grants scholarships for international students. According to the latest figures of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), 11,000 foreign students have chosen to pursue their university studies in Morocco for the 2017-2018 school year.  Despite the fact that the statistics do not include Australians and little is known about Moroccan students in Australia, Morocco’s Embassy in Australia seeks to introduce “Australian students to the different facets of political, economic and cultural life in Morocco,” according to the embassy. Morocco and Australia are at the threshold of reinforcing their bilateral relations that have been scarce to non-existent in the past. Morocco-Australia diplomatic relations began in 1976. The year 2017 was a pivotal year in Moroccan-Australian ties with the appointment of Australia’s first ambassador to Rabat, the establishment of the Australia-Morocco Business Council (AMBC) for exchange of ideas and business opportunities, and the Australia-Morocco parliamentary friendship group in Canberra. AMBC aims to solidify relations between Rabat and Canberra, the capital city of Australia, paving the way for “closer collaboration on different segments of bilateral, political, strategic, economic and cultural cooperation,” according to the Moroccan embassy. Morocco and Australia’s relations are complementary. While Morocco dominates the world’s phosphate and fishing industries, Australia heavily exports iron ore, coal, gas, and gold.

Rabat – Morocco and Russia have exchanged congratulatory cables, commending the “exemplary” bilateral ties between the two countries. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov exchanged messages of congratulations for the 60th anniversary of bilateral bonds between Morocco and Russia. The messages pinpointed the “deep friendship,” “mutual respect,” and the “multidimensional and exemplary partnership” that links the two countries. Morocco and Russia made first contact in 1778 when Morocco’s Sultan Mohammed III bin Abdullah and Empress Catherine II exchanged messages. The two countries then agreed to sign a peace treaty. The Russian government wrote in October 2017 that the “historical ties strengthened after King Mohammed VI visited Moscow in 2002 and 2016.” In their recent messages, the two ministers reiterated their commitment to jointly consolidate Moroccan-Russian relations within the framework of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, signed in March 2016 under the chairman of King Mohammed VI and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. Moroccan-Russian trade In 2017, Morocco and Russia signed 11 agreements to boost bilateral cooperation in several sectors, including energy, agriculture, culture, education, investment, and trade. The agreement followed talks between Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and his counterpart Dmitry Medvedev. Both officials expressed determination to expand trade between the two countries.  The volume of trade increased from approximately $200 million in 2001 to $2.5 billion in 2015. The Russian government said in 2017 that Russia was Morocco’s 9th largest source of imports and Morocco’s 22nd highest exporting country in 2016. “Economic cooperation between the two countries remains satisfactory, and trade continues to expand. “However, we still need to do a lot to achieve a bigger trade balance between the two countries and further develop trade and these relations,” the government said. In another publication, the Russian government wrote that Morocco was the “first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Russia.”

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat – Located in Fez,  the American Fondouk is a charitable equine hospital on a mission to improve the welfare of working equines and the owners who rely on them. Today, the number of working equids and camels in Morocco is estimated at around 1.7 million. Many are owned by poorer people who rely on the animals to help them earn a living. If the animals develop health complications, the owners cannot always afford to get them the care they need. The American Fondouk treats about 60 “patients” a day—20 of which are outpatients and 40 which are housed at the hospital. In total, the hospital treats about 3,500 to 5,000 new patients a year, an equal number of donkeys, horses, and mules. Some animals stay in the facilities for as little as a few days, while some require care for up to six months. All treatments are free of charge and funded by donations given to the organization. Additionally, the American Fondouk funds and administers an internship program for aspiring Moroccan veterinarians. Interns spend a year interning at the facility before going abroad to places like Edinburgh, Scotland, or Lyon, France, to finish their specialist training in teaching hospitals there. The goal is that interns might one day return to work with the American Fondouk and help to further its mission. The American Fondouk currently has conventions with 4 private Moroccan veterinarians who work as the senior vets in the hospital. Main health concerns for equines In an interview with Morocco World News, the animal hospital’s director, Gigi Kay (a British equine veterinarian), discussed some of the major concerns facing equines in Fez.  According to Dr. Kay, “One issue is that owners will sometimes tie up their animals’ legs with rope to prevent them from wandering off. This practice is known as “hobbling” and can cause tendon damage or lacerations.” Lacerations are one of the most common types of wounds that the American Fondouk treats. This is not the only form of wound common to equines. As many horses, mules, and donkeys pull carts or plows, they can also get wounds from contact with shoddy equipment.  Dr. Kay notes that tumors, “especially sarcoid tumours which are common amongst equids and thought to be spread by flies,” are also a big issue and may require surgical removal. These tumors are reportedly more prevalent in donkeys. Another common form of equine illness is colic. Something most people do not know is that equines, unlike most other mammals, cannot vomit. Vomiting is the body’s way of removing harmful or toxic substances. Evolutionarily, equines’ need to retain food in their stomachs was greater than their need to expel it. As grazers, they took in small portions of food at a time, so keeping the food “inside” was invaluable to their survival. When a horse gallops, its intestines shift backward against its stomach. In other animals, this would induce vomiting, but the horse’s powerful lower esophageal sphincter prevents the vomiting so that it can continue to run away from predators. Consequently, if a horse develops abdominal pain or a digestive system disorder (colic), it is much harder for its body to resolve the issues on its own. Medication, or in more severe cases surgery or euthanasia, must be administered to colicky horses.  Equine injuries can also be found inside mouths. In Fez, owners still use old “Roman-style” bits in the mouths of their equines. These bits contain a circle in the equine’s mouths that has a great amount of torque and can tear up their mouths and cause a lot of friction on the roofs of their mouths. The American Fondouk offers a straight-across trade for these “archaic” bits, giving owners new snaffle bits, which are more modern and less damaging to the horse’s mouths. Termed by Rick Gore Horsemanship as an “archaic metal pain device,” all bits are slowly losing their credibility in many first world countries. Bits use pressure, discomfort, and often pain to control a horse’s head, hence controlling their speed and direction. Bits have been in use for such a long time and are so widely used that the damage they cause is little acknowledged. Some bits are harsher than others, but all bits can cause trauma and nerve damage. Trials prove that even “hot” horses, such as racehorses, can be controlled with “bitless” bridles by applying pressure over their nose bone instead of the sensitive tissues of their mouth. Further research on the negative effects of bits is available. For the time being, however, bit-use has not been a major issue accredited in Morocco. Equine nutrition Most equid owners are quite poor. Consequently, paying for land to graze their horses in a major city or to buy proper feed is difficult. Many horses are underfed, lacking nutrition, and subject to eating things that are not natural to them—trash, for example.  Dr. Kay explains, “Plastic bags, rope, and other garbage on which they scavenge, can easily get stuck in the gastrointestinal tract and cause fatal colic.” According to Dr. Kay, most pack-animal owners in Fez make the equivalent of about $5-10 a day.  “A typical donkey or mule will consume around 3 kilograms of barley per day and cost between $1-3 to feed. That’s already a substantial chunk out of their owner’s low income.” Many Fessi equine owners will often overload their equines, put salt in their eyes, or prod them with sharp sticks to make them move faster. Dr. Kay emphasizes that this is not because the owners are inherently cruel, but often lack awareness of better practices. The American Fondouk actively reaches out to the community to teach better methods. Malign practices have been used for centuries and become ingrained in the mind of the individual as simply “routine” and commonplace. Owners of working animals rely on both their own labor and that of their animals to earn a living. Sometimes, they take terrible shortcuts and work animals that are unwell.  If their animal is ill or injured, owners have little to no money to spend on veterinary care or medicine. If it dies, they have little to no money to replace it. The American Fondouk offers services to both humanely euthanize animals that are too old to work or sick beyond saving and will often help fund half of the cost of a new work animal at a typical cost of $130.  Founding the American Fondouk  The American Fondouk is a non-profit organization founded by American traveler Amy Bend Bishop in 1927. When she visited Fez’s medina (old city), Amy was alarmed by the condition of the pack animals. She was prompted to contribute $8,000 and ask two of her friends, Dr. Frances Rowley, president of the MSPCA at the time, and Sydney Coleman, a New York animal activist, to build a refuge for the animals. Today, Bob Coleman, Sydney’s grandson, heads the hospital. The American Fondouk is an example of foreign aid abroad, hence the term “American” paired with “fondouk”—the Arabic word for “shelter.” Its mission is to help the poorer sections of the community through the provision of free veterinary care for as many of the working equids in Fez as possible. The fondouk is currently the only operating American charitable working equid hospital in the world. According to Dr. Kay, the rest of the non-profit equine hospitals are British. When the American Fondouk first opened in 1927, its mission was to serve equines. However later on, it added smaller animals to the mix (notably cats and dogs). In 2011, when Dr. Kay first joined the hospital, the American Fondouk decided to revisit its original purpose: to focus on the wellbeing of working equines in Fez. According to Dr. Kay, there were economic reasons behind the decision.  “The American Fondouk provides free care and relies 100 percent on donations to keep it operating. Thus, its budget is limited and including small animals detracted from some of the animals that needed help the most.” Luckily, awareness of animal welfare is on the rise. American Fondouk is not the only non-profit on a mission to help animals in Morocco. The Society for the Protection of Animals and Nature (SPANA) promotes animal welfare and nature conservation and is based in Temara, with branches in Rabat, Marrakech, Khemisset, Chemaia, Khenifra, Tangier, Midelt, Had Ouled Frej, Sidi Boughaba, and Casablanca. One mobile veterinary clinic is also available to reach animals in remote communities.

Rabat- While Moroccan travelers at Tangier Med Port are stuck in traffic, passengers traveling with RAM are again frustrated because of flight delays. In a video posted Friday on Facebook, Moroccan passengers demonstrated their anger because of more Royal Air Maroc (RAM) flight delays. One passenger demanded airport administrators come to solve the issue, however none were in sight. Referring to notorious bus transportation issues, one passenger shouted, “Even with buses or CTM, there’s no such thing. I have never traveled in a CTM where they told me that there’s no seat for me, yet RAM does this and it’s not even the first time.” “There are no services here. We have work tomorrow and there is no way out. We have nowhere to spend the night…. The flight was canceled. Now, come spend the holidays in your country! ” the cameraman complained. “We come to our home country, giving our time and money only to deal with such frustrations. Will we want to come back again?” he added.

Another video recorded in the airport at Oujda, a city in northeast Morocco, shows vengeful Moroccans attacking airport cafes due to frustration from the delays. Travelers are shown openly stealing whatever drinks or foods they found on the cafe counter. Shopkeepers seemed to have evacuated the space.   RAM pilots began protesting on July 18, asking for better working conditions and a salary raise of MAD 15,000 per month. Before announcing that it had made an agreement to solve the stalemate one month later, RAM reportedly lost approximately MAD 20 million daily due to at least 150 delayed and canceled flights, triggering the fury of passengers and putting the carrier in danger of bankruptcy, according to L’Economiste. But both RAM’s management and the National Trade Union of Moroccan Pilots (AMPL) reached a mutual agreement on August 14. “AMPL and RAM have agreed to grant pilots four days off monthly” in addition to the traditional two days off weekly, the agreement said, hinting at RAM’s concession to pilots’ demands for more resting time. RAM will also grant a pay raise and pay a third of pilots’ training fees. Based on seniority and competence, pilots and copilots’ monthly salaries will see an increase of MAD 3,000 to 5,175. The agreement terms for the training grant are set to come into force on October 1, but the pay raise will start on November 1.

Rabat – British oil and gas company Sound Energy has announced a new eight-year petroleum agreement in Morocco’s eastern Tendrara region.   The agreement united the areas covered by the company’s Tendrara petroleum agreement in April 2013, the Matarka reconnaissance licence granted in July 2017, and the Anoual petroleum agreement, said the British company in statement published yesterday, August 31. “I am delighted to announce that we have contractually secured our rights on this potentially transformational acreage up to 2026,” said James Parsons, Sound Energy CEO. “We look forward to the approval of our production concession and commencement of our exploration drilling programme in the near future,” he added. Sound Energy signs new 8 year petroleum agreement for Tendrara, Eastern Morocco. — Sound Energy (@soundenergyplc) August 31, 2018  The National Office of Hydrocarbon and Mines (ONHYM), Morocco’s regulator for petroleum operations, signed the new agreement. It will come into effect after the approval of the Moroccan finance and energy ministries, according to the British company’s statement. In July 2017, the British company signed two contracts with ONHYM, acquiring two new licenses for the two areas near Tendrara and the Algerian border: Anoual and Matarka. In July 2018, Sound Energy said it discovered large oil deposits in Anoual after exploring in the area.  Brian Mitchener, exploration manager of Sound Energy, expressed his satisfaction with the discovery. “I am delighted to report receipt of the final basin model and the potential for a new oil play in the Paleozoic over the Anoual licence.”  In September 2017, the Advisory &amp; Finance Group Investment Bank (AFG) gave Sound Energy a funding offer worth $60-100 million for its Tendrara gas export pipeline project. AFG is a Moroccan oil and gas investment fund owned by Mohamed Benslimane, married to Princess Lalla Zineb. AFG acts as a manager for Sound Energy in the country.  The new petroleum agreement, named “Greater Tendrara Petroleum Agreement,” covers an area of approximately 14,500 square kilometers extending across eastern Morocco and “surrounding the development concession application area relating to the Tendrara gas discovery.” Following the petroleum agreement’s implementation, Sound Energy will hold 47.5 percent of the Greater Tendrara licensed area. Schlumberger holds 27.5 percent and the remaining 25 percent will be held by ONHYM. The new agreement will be divided into 3 phases: an initial 4-year phase to dig 2 exploration wells, an “optional first complementary” 2-year phase to dig one exploration well, and an “optional second complementary” 2-year phase to dig another exploration well. All exploration wells will comply with the minimum Triassic objective.

Rabat – Morocco has signed an agreement with the World Bank to engage youth in business, create employment, and reduce the debt to GDP ratio. The new partnership agreement, set to take effect January 2019, aims to address Morocco’s health, socioeconomic, and unemployment challenges. According to Le360, the World Bank has pledged to give Morocco a helping hand through a five-year plan to achieve improvements that will boost Morocco’s economy. The World Bank has completed its role in achieving the aimed results on solar power, sanitation, roads, social inclusion, and employment through its strategic relation with Morocco during the past few years. The new agreement intends to focus on both creating value and positioning the kingdom at the forefront on the international scene. The new partnership framework, according to the news outlet, aims to reduce Morocco’s public debt to 60 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from its current level at 82 percent (MAD 871.5 billion), according to Moroccan financial site Boursenews. According to economic research firm BMI’s last report in May, Morocco’s unemployment rate is currently 10.5 percent, and the firm forecasted higher unemployment in the years to come. BMI attributed continued unemployment to the government’s halting hiring for government jobs in a bid to reduce the public debt. In the health sector, Morocco’s current goal is to expand health coverage to cover not only low-income people but to cover 90 percent of the population by 2020. The government is set to present a new development model, under King Mohammed VI’s high instructions, to strongly enhance, among others, health and employment opportunities. From August 27 to 29, the World Bank vice-president for the MENA region, Ferid Belhaj, visited Morocco and met the new economy and finance minister, Mohamed Benchaaboun; Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani; and other top officials, CEOs, and business owners.

Rabat- Moroccan summer vacationers leaving Morocco from Tangier Med Port have been stuck in a 10-kilometer-long traffic jam. Moroccan expats returning to their homes in Europe have been waiting for more than 24 hours to board ferries to Europe through Tangier Med Port, due to the high number of travelers heading home at the same time. Video of the traffic jam which have been circulating social media show long lines of vehicles on the road leading to the port. Some travelers can be seen waiting outside of their cars.
    On Wednesday, 53,200 travelers left Morocco from Tangier Med Port, the highest single-day number since Operation “Marhaba” launched, according to the secretary of state to the minister of equipment, transport, logistics, and water, Najib Boulif. Boulif’s prediction that “the registered number of travelers on Thursday will most likely” be as high as that of Wednesday has come to life. Tangier Port authorities expect that the high volume would continue through the upcoming days until September 15, the last day of Operation Marhaba, which began on June 5 to welcome home Moroccans living abroad. In a Facebook statement, Boulif apologized to travelers for the ordeal, saying that Morocco and Spain are working together to find solutions to the situation, considering adding another ship to the ferry route to reduce overcrowdedness. Meanwhile, Tangier Port authorities warned passengers that the waiting period before boarding ferries may exceed ten hours. They invited travelers to postpone their trips until after September 15 to avoid the traffic jam. According to Tangier Med Port Authority, a total of 842,698 passengers entered Morocco through Tangier Med from June to August. During the same period, 371,861 passengers, 118,579 vehicles, and 1,695 buses left Morocco through the same port which is a veritable gateway to Africa and Europe.

Rabat- A Moroccan failed asylum seeker sewed his lips in a hunger strike after being kicked out of accommodation in Metz, northeast France. Although his asylum case was denied, the French Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII) had provided the 31-year-old man with a place to stay in the city, but the man was expelled Wednesday due to his aggressive behavior.  The asylum-seeker decided to go on a hunger strike to protest his expulsion and went as far as sewing his lips with thread on Wednesday, reported France Bleu Lorraine. At first, the man refused to be hospitalized and went to a migrant camp in Metz called Blida where he met with French state services who finally convinced him to get his lips unsewn and receive treatment, according to French authorities.  The man ended his hunger strike and agreed to live in a new home provided by the country. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), some 119,000 Africans, including Moroccans, were arrested in 2017 attempting to enter European countries. Amidst concerns about a migrant crisis in France and Europe in general, French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Morocco in November to discuss with King Mohammed VI the common security challenges facing Rabat and its EU partners on irregular migration.

Rabat – A Facebook group named “Moroccan Rally against Compulsory Military Service” published a statement August 25 signed by a number of civil society organizations and activists, disavowing the proposed draft bill in Morocco. The bill on obligatory military service was approved by both the government council and the ministerial council on August 20. The bill still needs to be passed by Parliament to become law. The group, which has gained 21,000 members since its creation last week, explained that the rejection of the bill “came because of the government’s total lack of clarity on the bill’s real objectives.” The government said the objective is to “inculcate the spirit of citizenship in young people as part of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship.” Moroccan citizens would be subject to compulsory military service in accordance with Article 38 of Morocco’s constitution which states that citizens should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. Draft bill handled in ‘quick manner’ Another motivating reason for the group’s disapproval was “the legislative speed” which accelerated the approval of Bill 44.18, “unlike other more important laws that have not been adopted yet.” Some media outlets questioned the quick approval of the bill given its political weight, saying it was an action that cannot be taken “overnight.” Ahmed Assid, a well-known Moroccan philosopher and researcher and one of the signers of group’s statement, told Morocco World News that people who signed the statement are not against mandatory military service in itself but against the “quick manner” in which it was handled. “We supported these young Moroccans on this basis,” he added. Assid stressed the need for the government to open a public dialogue to discuss all aspects surrounding the mandatory military service. “This is not a democratic way. The government should open public and participatory dialogue to discuss the draft bill between different civil society and activists and also before approving it by the Parliament. However, none of this was done.” Assid cited the example of France where President Macron opened public dialogue about conscription. “French citizens had concerns over the recruitment of poor people at the expense of rich people and those having power.” The Facebook group’s statement added that the bill was not included in any electoral programs or any governmental programs for which the Parliament voted. Young Moroccans dissatisfied with the current situation Assid explained the background motivating these young people’s disapproval over the draft bill saying, “Moroccan youth are angry and discontent and they are expressing their critical opinion on social media against authority, the state, unpopular decisions, and against politicians’ contradictions which have become uncovered.” The situation, according to Assid, has led to an uproar and lack of confidence in political institutions. “Amid this confusing situation compulsory military service has appeared which young people have understood as kind of ‘punishment’; that they should keep silent,” he added. According to the rally’s statement, “Priority must be given to education, health, culture and employment, as provided for in the Article 33 of Morocco’s Constitution. According to the group, “giving priority to health and education” is only “an empty slogan for the government.” They described the government’s investment in military service as “a waste of time.” “The moral problems of young people are related to marginalizing culture, the absence of theaters and the systematic closing of public spaces. These are areas in which young people have been putting their energies through decades.” Military service, from the group’s point of view, cannot improve the situation of young men and women. “It remains merely a patchwork solution that shows the inability of the state to solve basic problems.” The statement claimed that “the recruitment of 10,000 young people a year will cost the state at least MAD 300 million year, an amount which could be invested to annually build 20 schools for 12,000 students or build 5 hospitals.” The group also published a petition under the name “no to compulsory military service.” The petition has received more than 1,700 signatures. The group’s demands The group called for the bill to be dropped, stressing that “serving the society is a duty of every citizen and not only of the young people.” “We consider the civil service as one of the finest forms of solidarity between social classes … an effort that young people make every day by working in organizations, associations and volunteer work to help the poor and marginalized people.” The group also demanded the state “contribute financially and logistically” to enable more young people to engage in civil service. The Facebook rally called for the government to invest funds allocated to military service in projects having more priority for young people regarding “education, health, culture, promotion of self-employment and creating job opportunities in addition to making the economy free of monopoly.” People feel like they are “confined in a sheep pen” receiving decisions and laws from above, Assid claimed. “When people are given their basic rights, equitable distribution of wealth, guaranteed right to work, then mandatory military service will be perceived as national duty and not as punishment.”   The statement was signed by many civil associations and organization such as the Amazigh Observatory of Rights and Freedoms (OADL), the National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH),  and Chabibat Annahj Addimocrati (Youth of the Democratic Way). It was also signed by many activists and intellectuals, such as Ahmed Assid, philosopher and researcher, and Sanaa El Aji, a writer and civil activist.
