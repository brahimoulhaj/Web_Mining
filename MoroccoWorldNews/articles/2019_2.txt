Rabat – The personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, is likely to start meeting with the parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict before the second roundtable on the dispute, which is set to take place next month. The “official” news agency of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) reported that Kohler will meet with Polisario in Berlin in early March “in preparation for the second roundtable to be held in Switzerland next month.” The separatist news platform added that the agenda of the meeting has not been defined, according to a source close to the dossier. Kohler convened the parties involved in the conflict—Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario—around the same roundtable discussion December 5-6, 2018. All parties expressed their satisfaction with the first roundtable. Kohler also expressed hope that a solution to end the conflict is possible. Less than a month after the roundtable, however, the Polisario Front started conducting illegal maneuvers in Western Sahara, especially east of Morocco’s defense wall. In response, the Moroccan government warned that Polisario’s activities might hamper the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. The UN Security Council is hopeful that a second roundtable might help to ease tension and lead at least to the establishment of negotiations between the parties. After a meeting on the Western Sahara conflict on January 29, the Security Council issued a statement to encourage the parties involved in the conflict to meet again in a second roundtable at the request of Kohler. The statement of the Security Council also emphasized the importance of the involvement of all parties in the talks to resolve the conflict. Kohler is expected to meet with officials from all the countries involved to discuss the date and place for the second roundtable. Prior to the December roundtable, however, Morocco again reiterated its principles on the conflict, emphasizing that the autonomy plan is all that it can offer as a solution to the conflict. The Moroccan initiative introduced to the UN in 2007 is the “top” and the “bottom”of what Morocco can offer, said Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale.

The Spanish Parliament approved a draft law on Tuesday to toughen the requirements of Spanish citizenship for Moroccans living in Ceuta and Melilla, with a majority of votes in favor of the Spanish Popular Party (PP) which proposed it. The bill dictates that foreigners in the two Spanish enclaves will only obtain citizenship after living there for 10 consecutive years as residents instead of one year. The bill also stipulates that children could only be considered Spanish if one of the parents had been born in Spain, reported Spanish news site El Faro de Ceuta. The PP justified its proposal by pointing out the increase in the number of “Moroccan mothers in Ceuta and Melilla.” According to the Spanish National Institute of Health Management (INGESA), 30 percent of births in Ceuta and 60 percent of those in Melilla are children born to Moroccan mothers.  The party considered the figures as weighing on the Spanish healthcare system, adding that the migration influx in the enclaves is 25 times higher in Ceuta and 50 times higher in Melilla compared to the national average.

Meanwhile, the left-wing party opposing the proposal, the Movement For Dignity And Citizenship (MDyC), indicated that throughout the past 14 years, only 2,300 people were granted citizenship in the enclaves among a total of 1 million foreign residents there. Numerous times, Spain has refused granting citizenship to Moroccans who lived in the country for years, when they failed tests on cultural knowledge and integration in the country. Currently, 1 million Moroccans live in Spain, according to the Spanish news agency EFE.

Rabat – Morocco’s price index of industrial production, with the exception of oil refineries, decreased by 0.4 percent in January 2019 compared with the price index in December 2018. According to the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP), which keeps track of economic, demographic, and social statistics, the decrease resulted from a drop in food prices by 0.8 percent, metallurgy by 2.9 percent, and the clothing industry by 0.7 percent.

The prices of extractive industries and the production and distribution of water and electric power remained stable. As for the consumer price index for January, it fell by 0.3 percent compared to the previous month. The change is due to the drop of 0.5 percent in the food index and 0.2 percent in the non-food index between December and January.

Rabat – A recording allegedly of top Algerian officials discussing the 2019 Algerian election has been sweeping Algerian social media, angering Algerian activists. The leaked recording is allegedly a conversation between Abdelmalek Sellal, the former prime minister who is leading President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s campaign, and Ali Haddad, the chairman of the Forum of Business Leaders (FCE). In the conversation, Sellal said that the group supporting Bouteflika’s fifth term “started to withdraw.” Haddad then replied that the group was “afraid.” Sellal also spoke about how ministers had not managed to get last week’s protests against Bouteflika under control. He said that he was also surprised that the vast majority of ministers stayed home last Friday during the massive protests against Bouteflika’s campaign. Sellal said that the government would instruct gendarmes to confront the protesters, and the security service would not go easy on protesters. The recording has not been authenticated, reported Algerian news outlets. However, Observe Algerie quoted one source who said that he is “certain of the authenticity of the recording.” The source added that he had two hypotheses about how the recording got leaked. “The first is that there is a group within the system who opposes the fifth term of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The second is that its a maneuver to spread messages and fear among protesters.” On Friday, February 22, a massive crowd took to the streets across Algeria to condemn Bouteflika’s campaign. When Bouteflika announced his campaign, a group of Algerians launched a campaign using the hashtag “Let_Him_Rest,” emphasizing that the president is being pressured to run. Algerian security services arrested 41 protesters last week.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou  Rabat – Decathlon has abandoned its plans to sell a sports version of a muslim headscarf in France.  Following reputable brand names such as H&amp;M, Uniqlo, and Nike, arguably the most influential sports company worldwide, Decathlon had decided to also launch a lightweight running headscarf on the market.  Following demands from Moroccans, Decathlon’s Kalenji running head-scarf is already available for sale in Decathlon outlets in Morocco.  In France, however, many frowned upon the new sports kit designed by Decathlon, so much so that the launch of the sports hijab in France, planned for March, was canceled.  The brand received backlash from social media users, including a politician from Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party, who called for a boycott of Decathlon.  In a press release, Decathlon said it “will suspend its project of Kalenji Hijabi Face for the sake of guaranteeing safety for our employees.”  The company posted on Twitter, claiming it had received 500 phone calls and emails about the headscarves and a wave of insults and threats.  The Guardian reported that French health minister Agnes Buzyn said, “It’s a vision of women that I don’t share. I would prefer if a French brand did not promote the headscarf.”  Another centrist-leaning politician, Aurore Berge from Macron’s party, tweeted, “My choice as a woman and citizen will be to no longer trust a brand which breaks with our values.”  France banned the niqab and burqa in 2010 and before that debated a bill to ban religious symbols, including the Jewish kippah and Christian cross.  Nike was not the first to introduce a hijab running suit. Oiselle, a Seattle-based company that sells athletic apparel for women, designed a special running kit for a Saudi athlete who competed in the Olympics in 2016.  Nike said its Nike Pro Hijab would “help advance the conversation around hijabs and Muslim women in sports and further make sports an inclusive space.”

And my father is Moroccan.” Idrissi may join the Atlas Lions as early as their Africa Cup of Nations qualification match against Malawi on March 23.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Justice Mohamed Aujjar has highlighted Morocco’s  “realistic” approach of enshrining the right to life in the Constitution while speaking in Brussels at the seventh World Congress against the Death Penalty. Speaking at the opening of the congress, which started on February 26 and runs until March 1, at the European Parliament headquarters, Aujjar said that although the open debate on the death penalty in Morocco has not yet been decided, Morocco did have the courage to include the right to life in the 2011 Constitution. He explained that Article 20 stipulates that “the right to life is the first right of every human being.” He added that the government has not reached a consensus on the death penalty but stressed that Morocco has not carried out an execution since 1993. Aujjar noted that the government’s policy is to limit death penalty sentences to a few crimes, such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide. However, in December, a Moroccan named Ilyas El Koraichi called for Morocco to give the death penalty to the suspects arrested for the killing of two Scandinavian tourists on December 17. El Koraichi created the petition on Change.org, and it has received 2,207 signatures so far. Aujjar highlighted the effectiveness of royal pardons to reduce the number of people on death row by converting death sentences to limited prison terms. The Moroccan official expressed optimism that Morocco’s current efforts, with the dynamism of civil society, will lead the debate to a consensus on the death penalty. The president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), Amina Bouayach, who also attended the congress, told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that CNDH has demanded the abolition of the death penalty and emphasized that the right to life is a basic right that the justice system must guarantee. The congress was attended by the high representative of the EU, Federica Mogherini; Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Didier Reynders; European deputies; and representatives of governments and civil society organizations. The speakers unanimously underlined the importance of advocating for a universal abolition of the death penalty and defending the right to life, arguing that the death penalty does not prevent crime. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, and Pope Francis also expressed their support for an end to the death penalty in messages broadcasted via a video call.

Rabat – The Polisario Front is facing another corruption scandal. The president of the Canary Sahrawi Forum Miguel Angel Ortiz wrote an opinion piece published by La Provincia to condemn what he called Polisario’s embezzlement of aid and corruption.  In the publication, the author said that a new scandal broke within the Tindouf camps following the misappropriation of some €2.5 million of humanitarian aid from the international community for Sahrawis living in Tindouf camps. Ortiz further explained that a leader of the separatist group addressed the scandal and asked the front to provide explanations. The opinion piece said that the Polisario Front was unable to justify the expenses related to the grants, “which shows how corruption is deeply-rooted among the separatists.” “Once again, the Polisario commits this kind of indecent practices and dishonest behavior towards the population it claims to represent and the international community which donates every year, in good faith, huge amounts of money that are managed in a suspicious way by the polisario’s leaders,” wrote the president of the Canary Sahrawi Forum. Ortiz also recalled that Spain’s autonomous communities provide several million of euros of humanitarian aid in form of foodstuffs and materials sent to the camps by official bodies and international NGOs. Ortiz recalled also the European Union’s Anti-Fraud Office report published in recent years, which exposed and denounced Polisario’s embezzlements of humanitarian aid. In his 2018 report on Western Sahara, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the situation in the Tindouf camps. Guterres spoke further about the “the lack of progress in the political process,” as well as “persistent difficulties, such as malnutrition, brought about by the steady reductions in humanitarian aid.” In the sixth section of the report, the UN chief warned that “malnutrition and anaemia prevalence remained public health concerns.”

By Amal El Attaq Rabat – At the initiative of the Moroccan Pluralist Association (AMP), Moroccan Jews and Muslims met on Monday, February 25, to celebrate Jewish-Muslim friendship. The meeting in Casablanca brought together many intellectuals, Moroccan associations, Muslim and Jewish artists around “Friendship Tea,” which according to them, is a sign of “unity and communion.” During the meeting, the participants wrote a letter titled “Tea of Friendship: Brotherhood Sounds,” in which they expressed a desire “to hear other voices, show other images, to spread friendship vibes and tolerance across different religions.” The letter pointed out several ideas to promote religious acceptance and tolerance. “The tea and mint flavors we share, our voices mingle today, radiate from our beloved country, to tell no matter how many people we are, twenty, a thousand or a million, we will make friendship and fraternity win,” the letter poetically stated. “As activists, young artists and cultural actors, we thought a lot about what could mark the symbiosis existing between Moroccans of both religions; Muslims and Jews, and decided to organize this meeting,” Ahmed Ghayet, the AMP president told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Ghayet said (that it is painful for him to see how people reject each other and do not seek to co-exist with representatives of other religions. “The international religious acceptance situation is bad; men and women are being persecuted just because they are Jews, Muslims, or Christians.” (translation here is bad). Ghayet added that the situation in Morocco is different. “Co-existence  in Morocco exits, and we should strive to preserve  this tradition, and even make it more fruitful for future generations.” Jewish Moroccan artist Maxime Karoutchi also participated in the meeting. He told MAP that his presence “was so natural” since “co-existence has existed for 2000 years in Morocco, and will always remain there.” At the end of the tea meeting, young Moroccan Muslim artists offered their Jewish counterparts a canvas as a sign of unity and tolerance.

Rabat – The founder and president of the Peruvian Council of Friendship with the Sahrawi People, Ricardo Sanchez Serra, has acknowledged that he received criticism over the opinion he wrote to advise the Polisario Front to accept Morocco’s autonomy plan for the Western Sahara conflict. The political analyst said that he was surprised to receive a “flood of impulsive, dogmatic and fanatical reactions.” “I do not hold a grudge against those who have insulted me. For me the praises are sculpted in the marble and the insults are drawn in the sand,” Serra said. After speaking about the viability of Morocco’s autonomy plan, the analyst took the approach of speaking about the “human tragedy” faced by Sahrawis living in the Tindouf camps. He recalled the former Polisario members who decided to come back to Morocco after Polisario’s failure. “Perhaps I am more ‘dissident’ than all the founding members of the Polisario who have decided to break at different times of the conflict and return to Morocco, where many have managed to integrate successfully in the political and social life of the country,” he wrote, referring to Yanja Khattat, the current president of the Dakhla region. Serra said that he was forced to ask himself why people flee the Tindouf camps. According to Serra, Polisario’s independence claim has no future for several reasons, including the fall of the Libyan regime, the institutional problems of Algeria, and terrorism and instability in the Sahel. All these circumstances, according to the author, play “against the option of independence.” Serra also argued that the tension in the Tindouf camps is a “real time bomb.” He added that there is an urgent need to solve the human tragedy in the camps. “The 10,000 people who have fled throughout these 44 years from Tindouf refugee camps have not done so through comfortable airports, but they risked their lives in an arid and mined desert God knows how many will have lost their lives,” he commented. The tension brought to the forefront what “Polisario has long tried to hide.” Serra said that the situation in South Sudan is an example of what can happen when speaking about “independence” for Western Sahara and referred to “endless tribal wars” in South Sudan. Serra further explained that “it is foolish and naive to think that Morocco will one day abandon the territory of Western Sahara. Throughout the years, especially in recent ones, the Moroccan government has been mobilizing civilians, especially youth, to defend the national cause and Morocco’s territorial integrity. “No cause brings together the unanimity and consensus of all Moroccan society as what is called in Morocco ‘the National Question,’” Serra said. Serra concluded his recent opinion under the title “Western Sahara: My Response to My Detractors,” to search for a political solution to end the conflict  based on the UN-led political process, “in which the Moroccan autonomy initiative enjoys the appreciation of the influential countries in the Security Council and a large part of the international community.”

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has given a congressional testimony confessing to multiple wrongdoings during the decade of his service to Trump. Cohen swore in before the US Congress’s House Oversight and Reform Committee on February 27 in Washington, D.C. Cohen’s scathing testimony cast Trump as “a racist, a conman and a cheat” who used his inner circle to cover up for any political wrongdoing. The lawyer’s testimony took seven hours, during which he asserted that he is no longer protecting President Trump. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress previously and was sentenced to prison for three years, used hard evidence to back up his testimony. As congressional Republicans accused him of being a convicted liar, Cohen maintained his quest to speak up about the goings on in the Trump administration. The former attorney warned the committee: “I did the same thing that you’re doing now for ten years. And I can only warn people, the more people that follow Mr. Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering.” Cohen testified that Trump had said, “Black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.” In response, Republican Mark Meadows referred to Lynne Patton as an African-American woman working for the Trump administration. Cohen related that he paid a $135,000 settlement from his private account to the porn star Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, to cover up Trump’s secret affair with her per Trump’s guidance, to “avoid any money being traced back to [Trump].” Cohen brought a copy of a check for $35,000 he received from Trump as a partial reimbursement. As for taxes, Cohen gave Congress three years, 2011-2013, of Trump’s personal financial statements which Trump had given to Deutsche Bank bank to request a loan. Cohen claimed that Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, to be listed as one of the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes. In response to the testimony, Trump, who was in Vietnam, expressed his rage over Cohen’s allegations through Twitter, saying Cohen “did bad things unrelated to Trump” and “is lying in order to reduce his prison time.” Cohen said he regretted his offences: “You make mistakes in life and I’ve owned them and I’ve taken responsibility for them, and I’m paying a huge price, as is my family.”

Rabat – On Monday in Rabat, Moroccan Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki met with the Committee on Foreign Relations at the House of Representatives of the Republic of Colombia who conveyed the Latin American country’s full support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. According to a statement MWN received from the House of Representatives, El Malki expressed to Colombian MPs that their country’s decision to back Morocco’s territorial integrity and autonomy plan—aiming to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution—proves the “depth of the brotherly” relations and positive dynamic between the two countries. El Malki also announced the organizing of a Moroccan-Colombian forum this year to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Colombia. The forum will give an opportunity to discuss increasing cooperation in trade, tourism, culture, renewable energies, agriculture, and fisheries. The Colombian MPs in turn expressed their country’s interest in benefitting from Morocco’s expertise in the aforementioned spheres. For his part, the head of the committee, Antonio Hernandez Lozano, praised the strong political drive of the two countries to improve their bilateral relations in all spheres, emphasizing that they both “share similar values based on peace, stability, democracy, and willingness to engage in dialogue to solve problems.” Blanco Alvarez German Alcides, a deputy at the House of Representatives of the Republic of Colombia, affirmed that Morocco is a strategic ally of Colombia, mentioning their Parliament’s resolution that backed Morocco’s territorial integrity in December. He said: “We have signed in recent months at the Colombian Congress a resolution in favor of the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco.”  “Supporting and respecting the territorial integrity of a friendly state is the least we can do for a strategic ally,” he added, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). In December 2018, the two chambers of the Colombian Parliament expressed full support for Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara through a resolution, denouncing serious violations of human rights against Sahrawi sin the Tindouf camps, in Algeria. The resolution described Morocco’s autonomy initiative as “pre-eminent, serious, credible and realistic.”

Rabat – Algeria has once again expressed disinterest in ending the Western Sahara conflict through a message to the leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali. On the 43rd anniversary of the “creation” of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika congratulated the front and expressed Algeria’s “unflagging” support for the “right of the Sahrawi people through the holding of a free and transparent referendum,” reported the news agency of the separatist group. Bouteflika, who is facing a backlash over his decision to run for a fifth presidential term, wrote, “It gives me pleasure at the moment when the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic celebrates the 43rd anniversary of its creation, to present to you and through you, to the brotherly Sahrawi people, my warmest congratulations.” He added that the event represents an “opportunity to evoke the journey of the fighting Sahrawi people.” Bouteflika also called his country an observer of the “peace process to encourage the two brotherly parties to pursue a serious and constructive dialogue to achieve a just and final solution leading to self determination through a referendum,” referring to Morocco and the separatist group. The Moroccan government is expected to respond to Bouteflika’s message which implies that Algeria is still reluctant to take responsibility as a party involved in the conflict. Senior Moroccan officials have been calling on Algeria to admit its role in the conflict and to contribute to the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. In April 2018, King Mohammed VI also addressed a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to emphasize Algeria’s support for the front. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,”  wrote King Mohammed VI. The United Nations has also called on Algeria to work constructively with the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Horst Kohler to  “ensure a successful outcome” to the conflict. Algeria, however, keeps denying its responsibility, claiming that a solution to the conflict should be found only by two parties: Morocco and Polisario. Morocco also attempted to normalize diplomatic ties with Algeria and open up direct dialogue to prevent further tension. On November 6, 2018, King Mohammed VI gave a speech on the anniversary of the Green March, devoting most of his speech to speaking about the abnormal diplomatic ties between the two neighbors. He also called on the two countries to engage in frank dialogue to break the stalemate. More than three months later, Algeria has still not responded to Morocco’s dialogue request. Bouteflika and his government, however, sent an indirect formal message to support a better Arab Maghreb, a project that is pending due to regional conflicts.

Rabat – The city of Meknes, 60 kilometers west of Fez, will have its own National School of Commerce and Management (ENCG), which will begin construction later this year.  In an interview with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the president of Moulay Ismail University (UMI), Hassan Sahbi, announced the news. He added that the university will also open new faculties in El Hajeb, a town 30 kilometers south of Meknes, including a dentistry faculty, an institute of applied sciences, and a sports faculty. The schools will have partnerships with German universities.  UMI, although based in Meknes, has many projects planned for the Draa-Tafilalet region of eastern Morocco, among them the construction of a faculty of law, economic, and social sciences and a faculty of arts and languages. Through the new faculties, the Ministry of Higher Education hopes to reduce the high number of students studying at UMI’s Multidisciplinary Faculty of Errachidia in eastern Morocco. The faculty currently has around 18,000 students and expects to welcome 23,000 next year. According to Sahbi, the university will also open several schools in the city of Erfoud near the Algerian border, including a Higher School of Technology, which will be specialized in tourism, “a local priority.” Located in the desert, Erfoud lies close to the Saharan sand dunes in Merzouga that attracts thousands of tourists each year. The UMI president also announced the creation of a library, and center for languages in the university to teach students French, English, German, Spanish, or Korean “to meet the needs of scientific research and to qualify university students to better integrate into the labor market.” Sahbi also pointed out that the University of Meknes aspires to benefit from skilled Moroccans living abroad, recalling the signing of an agreement with the Moroccan Association in Quebec (AMQ) to create dual programs in aviation between UMI and universities in Quebec City and Montreal.

Rabat – The investigating judge at the Court of First Instance in Sale has reportedly received the Imlil murder victims’ families. The Norwegian and Danish embassies also assigned a lawyer from Marrakech to both families. Moroccan police arrested 23 suspects who are now facing terror-related charges in connection to the double murder of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark and Maren Ueland from Norway.  One of the suspects, Kevin Zoller Guervo, 25, is a Swiss-Spanish man who appeared before the investigating judge in early February. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, had said that Guervos was not directly involved in the murder, but he knew the primary suspects. Police also believe Guervos trained and recruited sub-Saharan Africans with whom he planned to join ISIS in northern Mali.  All of the suspects have appeared before the court. Louisa and Maren were on vacation in Morocco. They camped in the Atlas Mountains between Imlil and Mount Toubkal in an isolated area overnight. Moroccan security services found the two tourists dead, one decapitated and one with a slashed throat, the next morning, December 17. News of Louisa and Maren’s tragic death made international headlines and saddened Moroccans who were also shocked and appalled that the double murder happened in their country. Moroccans displayed various gestures of sympathy with the victims and their families, flocking to the Norwegian and Danish embassies in Rabat to express their solidarity and signing a petition calling for the death penalty for the first four arrested suspects.   Morocco has maintained a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since 1993.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou  Rabat – In war-stricken Yemen, the Oxfam NGO warns that the spectre of famine is threatening many people’s lives and shortages on food and medical care are on a dramatic rise.
 As a result, families are taking extreme measures to survive. Some families are left with no option other than to marry off daughters for food and shelter or risk dying of hunger, according to the NGO, Oxfam.  The organization contacted families in Amran governorate in northern Yemen and stated that “families have been forced to marry off their daughters – in one case as young as three years old – to buy food and shelter to save the rest of the family.” “Although early marriage has long been a practice in Yemen,” the NGO commented, “marrying off girls at such an early age in desperation to buy food is shocking.” Oxfam reported that families resorting to such desperate measures due to spiking food prices and low incomes amid the civil war.  “As many as 20 million Yemenis are food insecure in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Already, 15.9 million people wake up hungry.  Food assistance continues to prevent a massive human catastrophe, but it is not enough,” the UN World Food Programme tweeted. As reported by Human Rights Watch, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen has become a full-scale catastrophe since the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels engaged in a violent conflict. The warring parties have prevented humanitarian aid from reaching people due to the blockade in the northern part of Yemen as a result of the closure of 27 ports through which aid flows. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, has urged Western countries to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia. She said international governments have two options: “Do nothing while millions sink closer toward famine or use the leverage at their disposal to press the warring parties to end their abuses and impose sanctions on those obstructing aid.” On Tuesday, February 26, Geneva hosted a donor conference to raise money for Yemen. In support of the humanitarian aid, Swiss Vice President Simonetta Sommaruga said the UN set a target of raising $4.2 billion at the conference, which was organized by Switzerland, Sweden, and the UN. According to the Washington Post, the United Nations has raised $2.6 billion so far and hopes to collect more to alleviate the suffering of “the 80 percent of the country’s population now in need of aid.” 

Morocco, originally a member of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, “changed” its participation “for humanitarian reasons,” confirmed Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs. The war between groups in Yemen started in 2015, with Saudi Arabia joining in on the side of the internationally-recognized government against allegedly Iran-backed Houthi Shia rebels.

Rabat – Aziz Akhannouch, the Moroccan minister of agriculture, fisheries, rural development, water, and forests, has overseen the distribution of  a tractor, crane, and of 80 engines with 15 horsepower, for traditional fishing boats to 240 fishermen in the Taghazout association of traditional fishermen north of Agadir., which along with the engines cost MAD 1.96 million. According to Akhannouch, “This is the end product of an agreement with the association of traditional fishermen; the boats will be equipped with the appropriate gear that would provide these fishermen with the best working conditions.” The initiative aims to improve the working conditions of traditional fishermen, raise incomes, and maintain the durability of boats. Akhannouch emphasized that the agreement, signed on October 5, is part of the Halieutis project, which is designed to restructure and improve the fishing sector.  Mohamed Bouhriz, president of the community of Taghazout, said, “We finally achieved our dream. This fishing community will benefit from two projects, the first of which was achieved today with the distribution of 80 engines, along with a tractor and a crane.” Bouhriz asserted, “This equipment will facilitate the lives of the fishermen in Taghazout.” Taghazout took in 46.4 tons of fish in 2018, and made an estimated revenue of MAD 3.9 million. The minister, accompanied by Mabarka Bouida, the state secretary in charge of sea fishing; the governor of Souss Massa; the labor agency of Agadir Edautan; and the head of the regional council, presented information on the fishing center in Taghazout. After distributing the engines, Akhannouch headed to Imsouane beach, 90 kilometers north of Agadir, where he was briefed on the conditions of the fishermen in the area.

By Mohamed Amine Benabou Rabat— Minister of Governance and General Affairs Lahcen Daoudi has denied rumors about the government’s intention to cut subsidies on butane gas.  In a Facebook post on Tuesday, February 26, Daoudi says “I stress that in no way has the government taken any decision in this regard. The matter [subsidy cuts] is not even on the table.” Daoudi’s statement came as a reaction to rumors breaking out on social media that the government plans to cut subsidies on butane gas, which sparked a wide public outrage.  Some said the price would double.  He explained that “this decision will be made only after guaranteeing that the purchasing power is intact, especially that of the lower and middle classes, through the Consolidated Social Register.” Daoudi confirmed that no such decision is taking place at this stage, as the government is relying on the Consolidated Social Register program in the region of Rabat-Sale-Kenitra before making it available for all other regions after 2020.  According to the government, in order to go ahead with repairing the compensation fund, cutting subsidies on butane gas, along with sugar, is one possible measure.  It is anticipated that cutting subsidies of the vital element would take effect in the coming years to balance the compensation fund. Moroccan citizens have been concerned about potentially losing the butane gas subsidy and last year boycotted the Afriquia gas company to vent their anger. On his Facebook page, Daoudi wrote that “the wealthy are still benefiting from state subsidy on a number of consumer goods more than poor people who make up 7.1% of Moroccans. We have to put an end to this.” “State subsidies will target poor and middle-class social groups,” he added. “This will be achieved through the Unique Social Register program.” 

In an interview with Anadolu Agency, Daoudi stated that “there are three elements the government will cut subsidies on but have yet to be decided.”

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – On Tuesday, February 26, Solaire Expo Maroc, a Moroccan exhibition for solar technology, opened its doors in Casablanca. As one of the important gatherings in Morocco in the solar energy sector, the exhibition is being held at the Casablanca Fairs and Expositions office near the Hassan II Mosque.  Under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, the eighth Solaire Expo Maroc is expected to run for three days, February 26-28, under the supervision of the Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development and the Ministry of National Planning, Urban Planning, Housing, and Urban Policy. The event is hosting 100 national and international exhibitors showcasing their latest products and most recent innovative technology trends and is expected to attract more than 8,000 national and international professional visitors. Among the event’s distinguished representatives are Moroccan energy minister Aziz Rabbah, the founder and director of Solaire Expo Maroc Rachid Bouguern, and diplomats from China, Switzerland, and the United States. The event also boasts experts and academics from universities and institutions across the world. Towards more renewable energy In his opening speech, Rachid Bouguern praised the event’s endeavor to promote a dynamic solar energy sector, enhance energy efficiency, and keep pace with ambitious renewable energy programs in the kingdom. While Morocco relies on imported fossil fuels for most of its energy needs, the Noor Solar Plant in Ouarzazate is making one of the world’s largest concentrated solar farm. The plan will provide 580 megawatts, saving the planet from over 760,000 tons of carbon emissions. Morocco’s vision is to increase its renewable energy production to 52 percent of its energy production by 2030. Bouguern commended the contribution of the event to building cooperative relationships among stakeholders at the national and international levels both in the private and public sectors. The director emphasized how this year’s exhibit, like previous ones, is marked by the presence of prominent entrepreneurs and institutions like Institute Research Energy Solaire Et Energies Nouvelles the Institute of Research in Solar and Renewable Energies  (IRESEN), the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE) and companies and associations like Resovert, EMC, and Cluster.  In addition to Morocco, the event has received a sizeable number of participants from different countries. Key among these countries are France, Belgium, Germany, Turkey, Tunisia, China, Côte d’ivoire, India, Spain, and Italy.

Rabat – Renowned Sahrawi activist Mustafa Ould Salma Sidi Mouloud is back again with a new social media post to condemn the unbearable living conditions of a family who have been protesting Polisario’s alleged maltreatment of Sahrawis for several weeks. The anti-Polisario activist has condemned what he calls MINURSO’s negligence of the family’s situation. The father of the family, Hamoudi Bshali Al Saleh, shared a letter with Mustafa Salma last month, in which he cried for help from MINURSO and UN senior officials, including the Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara Horst Kohler. The family has been conducting a sit-in in front of the MINURSO headquarters at Mijek, a town in Western Sahara near the Mauritanian border and 670 kilometers southwest of Tindouf. To date, according to Salma, MINURSO has taken no actions regarding the situation of the family. “Has MINURSO become a partner of Polisario in their crimes?” asked Mustafa Salma, questioning the UN mission’s ability to carry out its work. “The conduct of the members of the MINURSO mission in the Mijk region is shameful and offensive to peace, to the United Nations, and humanity,” said Mustafa Salma. Condemning the situation of the protesting family,  Mustafa Salma referred to their situation as “miserable” because they are staying out in the open. “They are hoping their message will reach the world through a UN peacekeeping mission. Unfortunately, they found the peace mission worse than what they escaped. No one from the mission itself bothered to ask the family about their demands,” he condemned. In January, the father of the family wrote a letter saying that the Polisario Front  blockaded him and his children and wife in the desert for a year. His family is suffering a “systematic siege of all kinds of humanitarian aid, donated by some international bodies.” Mustafa Salma also accused MINURSO of “cutting off the network so that no one knows anything about them” to make the international community believe that the family ended the sit-in. In another Facebook post, Mustafa Salma said that one of the children is suffering  from epilepsy. He added that the son may go into a coma due to the continuous negligence of MINURSO. The Sahrawi activist said the child needs to be transferred to a hospital  700 kilometers from Mijek. “The more we hope for his soon recovery, the more we denounce the shameful behavior of the members of the MINURSO mission in Mijek,” concluded Mustafa Salma.

Rabat – Early Wednesday, Pakistani officials reported they had shot down two Indian military jets and taken an Indian pilot into custody. India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesman confirmed the loss of an MiG 21 fighter jet and pilot and stated Indian forces had shot down a Pakistani fighter jet as well. Pakistani Major General Asif Ghafoor stated the Indian pilot in custody was being “treated as per norms of military ethics.” However, prior to the arrival of Pakistani soldiers at the scene of the plane, a video portrays residents of the region beating the pilot. In another video posted by Pakistan’s Information Ministry, the pilot is shown blindfolded and bloody. This video has since been deleted. There is only one pilot under Pakistan Army’s custody. Wing Comd Abhi Nandan is being treated as per norms of military ethics. pic.twitter.com/8IQ5BPhLj2 — Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor (@OfficialDGISPR) February 27, 2019  Pakistan’s Information Ministry also tweeted a video of the wreckage from one of the Indian jets. Wreckges of Indian fighter planes burning. Well done Pakistan Air Force. The entire nation is proud of you. pic.twitter.com/TTIb1zvNZS — Information Ministry (@MoIB_Official) February 27, 2019  Pakistan closed its entire air space early Wednesday morning and residents living along the border have been asked to leave.  World powers such as the United States, European Union, and China have all called for peace in the region in response to fears of an all-out war between the two nuclear-armed nations. In turn, Sushma Swaraj, the Indian foreign minister, stated that India would act, “with responsibility and restraint,” during a meeting with Russian and Chinese foreign ministers. “India does not wish to see a further escalation of the situation,” she continued. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan also called for talks between the two countries. “History tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that, given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?” Khan asked in a televised broadcast.  The military strikes are the most recent acts of violence which stem from the ongoing conflict between the nuclear-armed states over the region of Kashmir. Both countries claim all of the Kashmir region, but in reality, only control certain parts of it. The area is divided by a de facto border called the “Line of Control.” On Tuesday, India carried out aerial attacks on Pakistani territory for the first time since 1971. India claimed the air strikes in Balakot were targeting a Pakistani militant training base and killed many militants. Swaraj asserted Tuesday’s air strikes were “not a military operation” but “a preemptive strike against the terrorist infrastructure of Jaish-e-Mohammed.”  On February 14, a Pakistan-based group carried out a militant suicide bombing in the Kashmir region, killing 40 Indian troops. India blames the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed for the deadly attack and believes Pakistan played a key role. A long-running conflict Since their independence from Britain and subsequent partition in 1947, the two countries have fought three wars, two of which were regarding Kashmir.  Morocco has strong diplomatic and economic relations with Pakistan, in part due to a common faith and similar history. Morocco also has friendly relations with India. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Morocco last week to discuss counter-terrorism efforts. Swaraj signed an agreement with Moroccan foreign Prime Minister Nasser Bourita to form a joint working group on counter-terrorism, as well as three other agreements. However, Swaraj arrived in Morocco with a “heavy heart” just two days after the February 14 attack in Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian nationals. Swaraj revealed that after the attack she intended to cancel her trip to Morocco. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi encouraged her to make her two-day visit, stating, “Morocco always stood with us against terrorism. It’s going to sign an agreement with us on counterterrorism. It’s fighting radicalization. So, please go there.”

Rabat -Italian newspaper Il Corriere Della Sera published a news story in which it claimed that three men has allegedly attacked an Italian woman in Rabat as she was returning home from a night out with friends to celebrate her birthday. According to the same source, the alleged victim had been celebrating her 23rd birthday near Hassan Tower and the Italian embassy with colleagues and friends. Around 1 a.m. she was returning to her riad when in front of the building, she was attacked by three men who tried to remove her pants. She resisted the assault and had started to escape when one of the men took out a knife and stabbed her leg four times. Moroccan authorities have quickly denied the allegations contained in the news report. “In order to enlighten public opinion, the DGSN asserts that the only complaint received by the police headquarters in Rabat relates to an attempted violent robbery filed by an Italian student during her probationary period in Morocco, against of three individuals who, in a light vehicle, attempted to steal it around 02:30 am, at the street al Adarissa in Rabat,” Morocco DGSN said in a statement. Moroccan security services “registered the complaint and watched the recording of the surveillance camera placed near the scene of the incident, which showed an individual coming out of a parked light car, and whose identity is being identified through facial recognition.” Investigations are underway to identify the owner of the vehicle used in this attack and to arrest other possible accomplices in this case, said the source. DGSN said that the judicial inquiry into the complaint filed by the Italian national for attempted theft is still pending, under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office, while it refutes all the allegations seeking to portray this incident as a case of attempted rape and kidnapping.

Rabat – Morocco ranked 62nd out of 100 countries in the 2019 Inclusive Internet Index, and came 3rd out of 31 African countries, according to the Facebook-commissioned survey prepared by the Economist’s Intelligence Unit. The survey scores 100 countries on availability, affordability, relevance, and readiness.   Morocco ranked best, 47th globally, in availability. Morocco’s overall ranking, according to the survey was “buttressed by first-place availability in [Africa].” The availability category covers “the quality and breadth of available infrastructure required for access and levels of Internet usage,” said the report. According to the report, solid infrastructure is the “key driver of the Availability category.”  Despite Morocco’s strong availability score, the report mentions Morocco’s  low rating for “service quality” of internet.  While the Moroccan government is pledging digital reforms, the North African country only has three internet operators. The French-owned service Maroc Telecom, however, dominates the market because most public and private companies use their internet services. Morocco’s other two internet operators are Inwi and Orange, previously Meditel. The companies also provide internet service, but mostly wireless services and mobile phone data. According to the report, relevance, which examines the “existence and extent of local language content and relevant content,” is weak in Morocco. Morocco ranked 72nd globally out of 100 countries due to a “dearth of relevant content.” Affordability ranking in Morocco is also low as the study lists Morocco 66th out of 100. The category of affordability examines the “cost of access relative to income and the level of competition in the internet marketplace.” In readiness, Morocco was ranked 65th. This category examines “the capacity to access the Internet, including skills, cultural acceptance, and supporting policy.” The National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT) issued its last report on internet usage in Morocco in 2017. ANRT found that there were 22.56 million internet subscribers in Morocco in the third quarter of 2017.  A report by Oxford Business Group urged Morocco’s telecommunications operators to “focus on developing comprehensive data-based strategies in order to accelerate growth over the near term.” Oxford further explained that despite “slower growth,” Morocco’s telecommunication industry is a key component for the country’s economy.

Rabat – A speeding train derailed and smashed into a barrier at Cairo‘s main train station on Wednesday, causing the explosion of its fuel tank. The accident killed at least 25 people and injured 50 amid fire.   Video footage from Cairo’s Ramses train station shows a platform engulfed in flames pic.twitter.com/AWyrSwoJrc — Arab News (@arabnews) February 27, 2019  CCTV footages of the incident shows the panic of people catching on fire as others rushed to help by splashing water buckets on them. The explosion overwhelmed the entire platform and nearby buildings. Egyptian officials told Reuters that there was no evidence indicating that the crash was deliberate. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli vowed to punish severely anyone who was responsible for the accident. “We will identify who is responsible for the accident and they will be held accountable,” he said. Egyptian newspaper al-Shorouk cited a source who stating that the train had been undergoing maintenance when it started moving at a high speed, without a conductor, towards the station’s main building. According to the source there had been other times when trains moved without a conductor but they did not result in fatalities or injuries like today. Morocco experienced its own tragic train accident in October 2018 when an ONCF train derailed near Bouknadel between Rabat and Kenitra, killing seven people and injuring as many as 125.

Rabat – Morocco has recently passed a new law to safeguard competition in the telecommunications sector. Law 121.12, which was published on Monday in Morocco’s national gazette, is set to bring transparency and improve competitiveness in the sector. The move is also implicitly part of a broader focus on attracting more investors and business ventures to the North African country. The law identified three primary axes to improve both customer and competitors’ experience of the Moroccan market of telecommunications.
The first axis is to uphold “complete transparency.” The objective is to “inform and protect consumers,” according to the legal text. The second axis has to do with mechanisms and “tools to reinforce regulation and competition.” The move entails authorities’ concerns about the state of expertise, experience, and infrastructure sharing among competing telecom firms. Under title 2 of the law, authorities especially hope to reinforce the practice of national roaming, an agreement among competing operators to use each other’s networks and provide services in geographical areas where they normally have no coverage. The final and perhaps most critical disposition of the new law is that it increases the discharging and regulatory powers of the National Agency for the Legalization of Communications (ANRT). Before this law, ANRT did not have complete regulatory powers.
If ANRT received complaints about anti-competition practices, it had to open a legal process, which could take months or years of trial.
With the new law, however, ARNT can directly punish a cheating or monopolizing company. What about Maroc Telecom? Since the law was made public, there has been one recurring question: Will ANRT take drastic measures against Maroc Telecom? As the oldest and main telecom operator in Morocco, the partially state-owned Maroc Telecom remains by far Morocco’s most widely-used operator. The company’s history, having emerged from decades of government postal and telephone services, means that it has control over longtime infrastructure. As a result, its coverage capacity and quality is far above that of its two competitors, Orange and Inwi. Orange and Inwi have repeatedly complained about Maroc Telecom’s “anti-competition practices” over the years. The two companies have on many occasions filed complaints with ANRT, decrying Maroc Telecom’s refusal to comply with the national roaming policy. Having inherited enormous infrastructure from the Moroccan state, Maroc Telecom refuses to share infrastructure to maintain dominance over the country’s telecom market, the two companies argue. In March 2018, Inwi filed a complaint against Maroc Telecom. Inwi cited “unfair competition” resulting from Maroc Telecom’s “non-compliance with regulatory provisions related to the sharing of infrastructure.” The company claimed MAD 5.7 billion in damages and interest. But the case languished in courts. And while some were quick to criticize ANRT’s “indifference to and protection of Maroc Telecom’s monopolizing tendencies,” the regulatory body had an excuse. ANRT could hide behind the fact that it was not the ultimate deciding body and that court cases in such contexts tended to be decided over long periods of judicial process. Under the new law, however, there is no need to resort to court cases. The body can directly punish a telecom operator if it receives “justified” complaints about refusal to comply with fair-competition practices. Punishment can be 2-5 percent of the offending operator’s total revenue.
With its new capacity to regulate and punish, it will only take months to discover the cause of ANRT’s past inaction. Was ANRT complicit in Maroc Telecom’s domineering grip on Morocco or did it actually lack the power to guarantee transparency and fair competition?

Rabat – The World Bank has agreed to give Morocco a MAD 700 million loan to create private sector jobs. The World Bank approved the loan through a six-year-partnership with Morocco, from 2019 to 2024, to help Morocco reduce unemployment. The unemployment rate in Morocco dropped from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent between 2017 and 2018, according to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP).  There were nearly 26 million Moroccans who had reached the legal age to work, 15 years old, in 2018, 46 percent of whom were employed or seeking employment.  The High Commissioner for Planning, Ahmed Lahlimi Alami, said that Morocco is expected to get further into debt, forecasting Morocco’s total debt will be 82.5 percent of GDP in 2019, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018. Morocco hopes to use the loan to promote private sector employment, improve human resources, accelerate digitalization, and improve the quality of education. Through the partnership, which the World Bank called a “new road map,” Morocco aims to address social and economic integration issues, particularly for youth and people living in rural areas. The World Bank believes that the goal can only be achieved through a fair distribution of infrastructure and services across all the Moroccan regions, better management of water resources, and increasing Morocco’s capacity to combat climate change. The World Bank also stressed the need for good governance, gender equality, and greater reliance on digitization. The three financial institutions of the United Nations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and the International Finance Corporation, will work to develop financing sources for Morocco’s development depending on the private sector.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba held meetings in Libreville on Monday after a surprising visit to his country from Morocco, where he has been recovering from a stroke since November at the invitation of King Mohammed VI. The Gabonese government said the president held several meetings with officials on Monday. The head of the National Assembly, Faustin Boukoubi, said he was “pleasantly surprised” to meet with Bongo. Boukoubi said the president Ali Bongo “retained his powers of memory” and “lucidity.” However, the President may still return to Morocco, according to a source who spoke to AFP. In addition to this visit, Bongo also returned to Gabon in mid-January to chair a ceremony of the new government swearing in after a coup attempt. He then came back to Morocco. On January 7, a group of rebels seized the state-owned broadcaster and announced their plans to establish a National Restoration Council. The government, however, intervened and arrested the group of rebels, killing two of them. Bongo has been in Morocco since November recovering from a stroke he suffered in Saudi Arabia in October 2018.

Rabat – Morocco’s General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) and the judicial police of Beni Mellal and Fquih Ben Saleh in the Khenifra region found a three-year-old girl on Tuesday in a remote area in Fquih Ben Saleh after she had allegedly been kidnapped. The police arrested three suspects in the abduction, in addition to a member of the auxiliary forces and three women from the girls’ family who had allegedly planned the kidnapping. The police launched an investigation to find the girl immediately after they received a phone call from her family on Tuesday afternoon, reported the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). 
 The child was returned safe and sound to her family on the same day. An investigation into the case is underway under the supervision of the public prosecutor. In recent months, several very young girls aged five and below have been reported missing or kidnapped in Morocco. Some were abducted but eventually found and returned safely to their families while others either remained missing or were found dead. In January, police in the Azlaf commune in Driouch Province in northern Morocco found a 3-year-old child, Ikhlas, dead in a forested mountain area after she had been missing for weeks. Ikhlas’ tragedy made headlines in Morocco and saddened many. In October, a  5-year-old girl was kidnapped from a market in Al-Wifaq in the Hay Al Hassani area of Casablanca. Police found the girl and her kidnapper who had locked her up for days. Another 5-year-old girl, named Khadija, was found after she went missing from a souk in Casablanca in September. Moroccans on social media shared pictures of her to help find her. In May, a 4-year-old named Ghazal from Riad El Oualfa, Diour Nasrani, Casablanca, went missing for 11 days. She was found on May 24 after her story had made headlines. The police did not report the motives behind the kidnappings.

Rabat – Moroccan administrative authorities have decided to close the headquarters of the banned Justice and Spirituality, or Al Adl wa Al Ihssan movement, in the cities of Fez, Tangier, and El Jadida,  a source told Morocco World News. The source said the closures, carried out on Wednesday,  comes in response to the movement’s violations of zoning laws regulating urbanism and public spaces. Earlier this month, administration authorities shut down several unlicensed headquarters used by the Justice and Spirituality movement for secret meetings in several cities, including Inezgane, Kenitra, and Casablanca. The movement’s “secret meetings” in the unlicensed facilities violate Law 12-90 on urbanism. The law makes it illegal to use a residence as a public place for meetings. People who violate the law may be subject to a fine ranging between MAD 10,000 and MAD 100,000. The banned movement also violated Law  1-58-377, which stipulates that the organizers of public meetings should send a statement with the time, location, and purpose of the meeting to the local government administration.  Administrative authorities have accused the movement of redesigning some of the places as mosques, which is illegal without a permission from the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. Al Adl wa Al Ihssane movement was founded in the 1980s by Sheikh Abdessalam Yassine, a former teacher and the late spiritual guide of the group. The Islamist movement has been banned from political activities because of what the government calls its antagonistic approach towards the Moroccan government.

By Rahma Ouled Chrif Rabat – After Minister of Health Anas Doukkali announced his selection of candidates for the positions of health ministry delegates on February 20, a politician from the Rally of National Independence (RNI) party and another former politician questioned the credibility of the list. Doukkali had appointed colleagues from his Progress and Socialism Party (PPS), prompting accusations that he was exploiting his position in government. Mustapha Baitas, a member of the RNI’s political bureau, accused the health minister last week of favoring PPS party members when making appointments. Baitas called on Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to open an investigation, saying it is not the first time Doukkali has been suspected of nepotism. When Doukkali was the head of the National Agency for Employment and Competencies (ANAPEC), there was controversy over his appointment of the Skhirat regional secretary of PPS, Rachid Sadik. Doukkali appointed Sadik to a position in ANAPEC. The second allegation of nepotism forced Doukkali’s health ministry to defend his appointments to prevent further conflicts in the government. Baitas described the appointment of PPS members as “a violation of all the constitutional requirements related to competence and merit and the principle of equal opportunities and criteria of selection to be placed in positions of responsibility.” The Ministry of Health announced on Monday, February 25, that it had recently started the largest process of opening nominations at all levels of responsibility from central managers to field managers and delegates. Doukkali stressed that the process was being carried out transparently. The minister of health emphasized the seriousness of the ministry in its search for efficiency to manage its interests.

Rabat – The Moroccan royal family will celebrate tomorrow the 12th birthday of Princess Lalla Khadija, the second child of King Mohammed VI and Princess Lalla Salma, after Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan. Princess Lalla Khadija was born on February 28, 2007. Her birth was welcomed with a 21-gun salute, and crowds of Moroccans headed to the Royal Palace of Rabat to express their joy. At a young age, Lalla Khadija has already taken steps in public life, accompanying her mother and father to social and political events. Last year, the princess even posed for the November cover of Femme Du Maroc (FDM), a major women’s magazine in Morocco, wearing a caftan and surrounded by greenery at the Royal Palace. The princess also posed for family photos in 2018; the most popular one captured a doting father-daughter moment. One of the princess’s first public appearances was with her mother in 2013 at the inauguration ceremony of a center for children with cancer in Casablanca.  In the summer of 2017, the princess performed stage plays in Arabic, French, Spanish, English, Russian, and Chinese during the graduation ceremony for the royal school at Casablanca’s Royal Palace. Then the princess made a speech, expressing, on her behalf and that of her classmates, great honor and joy for the King’s benevolence and solicitude for organizing the graduation ceremony. The princess also accompanied King Mohammed VI and the crown prince in an official ceremony in September 2018 on “supporting schooling and implementing the reform of education and training.”

Rabat – It appears that Moroccan-Dutch nationals are highly integrated into the labor market in the Netherlands. According to data from the state-owned surveyor, Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, the employment rate of Dutch people of Moroccan and Turkish migrant background has increased since before the 2008 market downturn. According to the survey, 153,000 Moroccan-Dutch people had paid work in 2018. Of nationals with Turkish migration background, according to the survey,187,000 people had jobs in 2018. In 2008, 55 percent of Moroccan-Dutch aged 15-75 were employed. The percentage dipped to 51 percent in 2014 and recovered to 57 percent in 2018. “The difference in labor participation between men and women is also relatively large among people with a Moroccan background (65.8 version 49.0 percent),” said the report. However, the gender gap in the labor market between Moroccan men and women has decreased since 2008. There was also a gender gap for people with Turkish background, according to the report. “Within the group of people with a Turkish background, the difference in labor participation between men and women is greatest.” The report added that the difference has not decreased in the past 10 years: 72 percent of men work compared to only 50 percent of women. The survey found that people with Antillean, Aruban, or Surinamese background still have lower employment rates than they did in 2008. Of Dutch people with immigrant backgrounds, Moroccans are the third-most populous in the Netherlands, after the Turkish and Surinamese, according to SpringerLink. In January 2005, 314,699 people of whom “at least one parent was born in Morocco were living in the Netherlands,” SpringerLink noted.

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture and Communication will organize an international congress to celebrate 1,300 years of the historic city of Sijilmassa’s existence. Collaborating with the National Institute of Archeological Sciences and Heritage, the ministry will hold the congress December 2-3 in the city of Rissani, a town in Errachidia Province, eastern Morocco, under the theme: “Sijilmassa: The Memory and the Challenge of Development.” Sijilmassa was founded in 757 by the Zenata Amazigh tribe. It was a medieval Moroccan city that served as an important trade center in the Maghreb during the middle ages. In the year 1000, the city was inhabited by approximately 100,000 people. The ancient city experienced many invasions of several Amazigh (Berber) dynasties before it was abandoned in A.D. 1339. The initiative is part of the ministry’s strategy to preserve and enhance archaeological sites and historic monuments. The ministry has adopted a comprehensive and integrated approach to strengthen archaeological research in all Moroccan regions. The conference will be a platform for debate on the legal protection of Sijilmassa following its inclusion in the National Heritage list.

Rabat – With the two-day visit of Pope Francis coming up next month, the Vatican released a new update about his schedule in Morocco, including a visit to the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams. Vatican News quoted Archbishop of Rabat Cristobal Lopez, who shared his excitement over the pope’s visit to Morocco March 30-31. According to Lopez, the visit will be a “great event,” but a “very demanding two day visit full of meaningful meetings.” In the agenda, Pope Francis will visit Rabat to meet members of the Catholic community, bishops and migrants. According to Vatican News, the pope will also visit a migrant center, a social center and the imam school. The institute receives imams, mourchidin and mourchidat (councillors) from across the world to be trained. The pope’s visit will reflect the coexistence between the two Abrahamic religions in Morocco. “The Pope will come to Morocco as a universal pastor, father of all Catholic Christians, a person of good will who wants to meet everyone. And for everyone, he presents himself as a servant of hope,” said Lopez. Vatican News expected that security arrangements for the visit will be strict. Despite the expectation, Lopez is confident that people who want to meet the pope will have a chance. “Our concern and our desire should not be to shake hands or take a selfie with him. Attention must be paid by listening to his words, receiving his message, witnessed by words and gestures,” he said. Earlier this month, Vatican News said that the pope’s agenda would include a meeting with King Mohammed VI, as well as civil authorities and senior officials. On his second day, the pope will visit a “rural center for social services in the town of Temara,” near Rabat. The two day-visit, from March 30-31, will end with the celebration of a “solemn papal Mass.” Pope Francis also visited the UAE recently, where he announced that the Gulf country and Morocco “represent two important opportunities to advance interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding between the followers of both religions.” Vatican News estimates the number of Catholics in Morocco at 50,000, who are mostly European expatriates. The pope’s visit will be the second of its kind from a pope to Morocco after the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1985. Late monarch Hassan II invited Pope John Paul II as an opportunity to build a bridge between Muslims and Christians.

Rabat – Morocco’s joint bid with Spain and Portugal to host the 2030 World Cup has received an unexpected blow after the European Union punished Spain. According to reports from a number of European sources, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has withdrawn the 2020 UEFA European Under-17 Championship qualification hosting rights from Spain for political matters. The reports indicated that Spain does not recognize Kosovo as a nation, although the southeastern European country gained independence from Serbia in 2008.  Spain refused to play Kosovo’s national anthem in the championship nor raising its flag, and was consequently stripped of the right to host the other championship qualifier matches. After stripping Spain of the hosting rights, UEFA decided to give Switzerland the right to host the European championship. Spain’s position on Kosovo would likely impact its joint bid with Morocco and Portugal.  In a statement to the Spanish football news outlet, Marca, the president of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, said that Spain would not submit a bid to host either the World Cup or the UEFA Euro without the support of the European Union or the UEFA. However, the president of the UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, has voiced his full support to the British-Irish bid to host the 2030 World Cup, while he is completely against the cross-confederation bid between Morocco and its two European neighbors.  Unlike Ceferin, FIFA chairman Gianni Infantino has welcomed Morocco’s 2030 World Cup joint bid with the two European countries, saying that a cross-continental World Cup would fit with the driving spirit of football. Since June 2018, international media have been speculating a possible World Cup bid between Spain, Morocco, and Portugal. The recurring argument and hope were that FIFA chairman Gianni Infantino’s supportive take on the cross-continental bid would indirectly play in its favor.

Rabat – A 17-member US delegation led by Senator James Inhofe visited the Tindouf camps on Sunday. Providing no details, pro-Polisario news agency RPS reported that the congressional visit was part of the international community’s ongoing agenda to find a lasting and mutually acceptable settlement in Western Sahara. The American delegation was received on Sunday by Brahim Ghali, the secretary general of the Polisario Front. The 17-member delegation consisted of six elected officials from the US Congress, including Senator Inhofe, chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Enzi Michael Bradley, the finance committee chairman. The delegation, which was earlier spotted on Sunday, February 24, in Algiers, met with Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia before meeting with the Polisario leadership later on the same day. A devout Polisario supporter According to some reports, both visits were prepared and coordinated by Keene Consulting Services and Foley Hoag, two U.S lobbying firms hired by Algeria to influence Washington establishment in favor of Polisairo’s self-determination claims. Foley Hoag has been lobbying for Algiers for two decades, while Keene Consulting Services, which is helmed by Republican mogul David Keene, recently signed a $30,000-per-month lobbying deal with the Algerian government. Keene has since been the leading force behind the aggressive Algerian public relations breakthroughs in Washington policy circles, according to diplomatic sources. Senator Inhofe is among the few conservative US figures to express reservations on Morocco’s Western Sahara claims. Like Keene, Senator Inhofe is a well-known supporter of the “Sahrawi cause.” He has been a vocal pro-Polisario voice in the US Congress. He has constantly pushed for “Sahrawi independence” and called on Morocco to organize a referendum to “end the suffering of the Sahrawi people.” A regular visitor The congressional visit comes as the Polisario Front prepares to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the establishment of SADR. The date coincides with the start of hostilities between Morocco and the Polisario Front (supported by Algeria) in the 1970s. But the visit is not the senator’s first trip to the region. Known in some pro-Polisario circles as “a great friend of Western Sahara,” Senator Inhofe has paid a number of visits to Western Sahara and to the Tindouf camps over the border in Algeria. In August 2017, invoking such a visit, the senator single-handedly engaged in a congressional fight to delay a key American diplomatic move in US-African affairs. Inhofe cited divergences within congress on the Western Sahara question as the motive of his move, saying that Washington ought to adopt a much tougher—and Morocco-hostile—stance on the conflict. His position is more clearly outlined in a June 2010 statement. “The people of the Western Sahara have languished in desert camps for more than 30 years as the conflict has gone unresolved,” he said. “I have visited the camps and have seen with my own eyes that their story is one of determination, persistence and hope that one day they will enjoy the basic rights all humans deserve—the right to life and to self-determination.” In his press statement following the Sunday meeting with Polisario’s leader, the senator made similar statements. He said that the visit testified to “President Trump’s commitment to the freedom of this people that he will undoubtedly recover.” Despite Inhofe’s assurance that President Trump wants to “recover” freedom in Western Sahara, recent news from Washington, D.C., does not buttress his rhetoric. For all the mixed messages that characterize the Trump administration’s foreign policy, including in Western Sahara, the most recent development hinted that Washington is moving back to its traditional line of supporting its Moroccan ally. Meanwhile, the visit comes shortly before the second Geneva meeting in March between conflicting parties under the auspices of UN envoy Host Kohler. While some deep-seated divergences remain, there is hope that the ongoing process will incrementally achieve a mutually agreed upon political settlement.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Following Tunisia’s approval of equality between the sexes with regards to inheritance law, the question of inheritance in Morocco continues to be hotly debated between diametrically opposing sides. Staunch opponents to inheritance reform claim that such “reformism” violates divine limits, while proponents such as Asma Lamrabet and Mohamed Abdelouahab Rafiki praised Tunisia’s move. Asma Lamrabet, a former scholar of Morocco’s highest Islamic legal body, the Ulemma, was relieved of her duty following her bold stance for reforms of inheritance laws. Mouminoun Without Borders, a Moroccan institute for research, decided to chime in on the debate in its monthly Moroccan magazine “The What” yesterday, February 21. The monthly issue was released under the title “Examination of Inheritance: The Argument of Equality and the Struggle for Change.” The edition discussed the controversial inheritance law in Islamic fiqh (jurisprudence) through a wide range of approaches ranging from religion, human rights, and sociology. It especially addressed the differing stances on sharia law and asked such questions as: “What gender-oriented readings of patriarchal resistances within a “composite society” oscillating between tradition and restoration?”, “How does sociology deconstruct the subject of inheritance on the basis of changing social conditions?”, and “What cultural, social, and political legacies are there behind advocating for equality in inheritance? “ This issue was edited by the Moroccan Ph.D. student and sociology major Hajar Lemfadli and includes four research contributions by various writers and academics from the MENA region. Contributors include the Algerian academic Mohammed Bekkaye with his paper entitled “Women, Inheritance, and the Trajectories of Marginalization: Gender Confrontations to a Multi-Faceted Politics” and Tunisian researcher Zeineb Toujani, who wrote, “The Right to Equality in Inheritance: Now Before Tomorrow.”

Rabat – French sportswear retailer Decathlon will start selling sports headscarves in France, the US, and in its other stores around the world starting March, the company announced Monday. Decathlon said the headscarves, which cover the hair and neck, will prove “practical” for women who wear hijab and also love to jog and play sports. The headscarves were originally made and marketed in Morocco after some Moroccan women requested the sportswear.   The sports retailer explained to its customers on its Twitter account that some women expressed their need for sports headscarves, because they could not find sports accessories or gear “adapted to their way of practicing their sport.” “We are fully committed to making sport accessible to all women around the world,” said Decathlon. Many anti-Islamists around the world took to social media to criticize the sports headscarves. Agnes Buzyn, French minister of solidarity and health, expressed her opinion about the sports headscarves on Tuesday, answering a question on RTL radio. The minister said that while French law does not prohibit headscarves, she would have preferred that French brands like Decathlon did not “promote hijab.” Buzyn stressed that she did not “share the vision” of women who support hijab in the country. Other sports brands like Nike also sell women’s sports headscarves.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The Moroccan Association of Human Rights (AMDH) sent an open letter today confronting Latifa Akharbache, the president of the Supreme Council of Audiovisual Communication (HACA), on television channel 2M’s coverage of Enrico Macias’s February 14 concert. The open letter stated: “Emphasis was placed on the fact that the event was not impacted by the boycott calls, in view of Enrico Macias’s positions in favor of the Zionist entity, the Israeli army and its guards … known for their crimes against the Palestinian people.”  The AMDH noted “the absence of voices defending the boycott of the concert.”  The association considered the coverage to be “incomprehensible support of Enrico Macias.” AMDH said the news segment did not evoke “the values ​​of tolerance and coexistence of Morocco.” The Moroccan Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (MACBI) called for Moroccans to boycott the concert in Casablanca, arguing that Macias’s concert whitewashed Israel of its offenses against Palestinians. MACBI criticized the French singer of Algerian-Jewish descent for his stance as pro-Israeli. Macias asserted his position when he stated in an interview that he has “always devoted [his] body and soul to the State of Israel.” Enrico Macias had previously acknowledged threats that his concert would be boycotted but said that he refuses to “care about this boycott threat, and [he is] going to Morocco.”  Macias stated further that “[he] compares Morocco to the Andalusia of yesterday because it is a country of tolerance.”

Rabat – Despite a wave of protests against his re-election, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will submit his official application to seek re-election on March 3. Bouteflika’s campaign manager, Abdelmalek Sellal, announced on Tuesday that the president would submit his papers as per the law. “It is Bouteflika’s right to be a candidate,” Sellal told the crowd in televised comments. Beginning last week, thousands of Algerians have taken to the streets to display their rejection of Bouteflika’s campaign to win re-election for a fifth term. After the first protests on Friday, February 22, clashes between demonstrators and Algerian police resulted in the arrest of more than 40 people. Today—the fifth day of the demonstrations—Algerians renewed their anger and condemnation of their president’s campaign. Hundreds of college students rallied near their universities, shouting slogans and carrying Algerian flags. One young Algerian student, Adel, told the media amid protests: “I was born in 1999. In 20 years, I only knew Bouteflika as president.”  Many Algerians share Adel’s view that Bouteflika, 81, should step aside and give younger leaders a chance to run for elections and bring change to the country. After he suffered from a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika’s health continued to deteriorate, and he has rarely been seen in public. Algeria will hold its presidential elections on April 18.

By Ayoub Derraza Rabat – Eleven-year-old Idder Moutai is fluent in programming languages and has received the respect of the organizers and guests of DevFest, organized by the Google developer group in Agadir at the end of December 2018, surrounded by experts from Google and various countries. He also learned to speak English fluently.

Just a few weeks after the discovery of his talent, Moutai, from Tiznit, a town in the Souss-Massa region 100 kilometers south of Agadir, was mocked for his Darija (Moroccan Arabic) mixed with an Amazigh (Berber) accent in a show on the Moroccan television channel 2M.

Tamazight (Berber) is widely spoken in Tiznit. Some historians say that Tiznit is the cradle of the Sousse dialect, one of the three most popular Tamazight dialects in Morocco.

Rejection and condemnation The child received the sneer campaign with surprise and pain. He said in a post on Facebook: “I don’t know why people say I can’t speak well. I’m not good at Arabic. Don’t make fun of me.”

The child’s uncle, Hassan Moutai, said that the sarcastic comments devastated Idder. In a statement for Maghreb Voices, he said that Idder “grew up in a region where only Amazigh is spoken and the child communicates with his brothers and friends in English and with the rest of his family in Amazigh.”

Dozens of voices of solidarity were raised, condemning the sarcastic comments and describing them as “racist,” stating that “these groups make fun of creative people and celebrate the people who make the buzz.” Support campaign on Facebook Many social network activists have denounced what they have described as the “racist campaign” that Idder faced.

Al Massae journalist Mohamed Ahdad said on Facebook: “Some are so ignorant that they laugh at the accent of a child who has developed a genius in computing.”

“Is it his fault that he did not learn Darija and the Arabic language when, until the beginning of the third millennium, it was a crime to speak his mother tongue in universities and the media?” he added. Only in 2011 did the Moroccan Constitution recognize Tamazight as an official language.

Ahdad continued, “What is Idder’s problem if he speaks Arabic with a Soussi accent; isn’t that the diversity we claim to defend?”

Bloggers also called on Idder to be proud of his Amazigh identity and keep moving forward without paying attention to the negative reactions on social networking sites.

Mohamed El Medlaoui, a professor in linguistics, said that “taking care of children like Maryam Amjoun and Idder Motii is a matter of parental responsibility.” Moroccan 9-year-old Amjoun earned acclaim when she won the 2018 Arabic Reading Challenge in Dubai.

“They are excellent in a given field (mathematics, languages, creative writing, the arts, sport) but do not necessarily have the social intelligence to face the harsh public and the spotlight of contemporary media,” he added.

Activist Wissam Henkari commented on Facebook that Idder was “racially discriminated against on social media. This was only a part of what some members of this company externalize, criticizing everything: initiatives, reforms, and figures.”

The Moroccan Constitution, amended in 2011, describes Tamazight as an official language together with Arabic. In 2017, the government also drafted a law defining the stages of the officialization of Tamazight in the House of Representatives, but it has not made notable progress.

According to the draft law, the state is working to implement several measures to formalize Tamazight gradually over a period of 15 years.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou  Rabat – After his “Allo 15,” “Ben X,” and “the Red Scarf,” Moroccan director Mohammed Lyounsi has premiered his fourth historical feature film “Les Coups du Destin” (The Blows of Destiny) this month. The movie was shortlisted along with 14 other features for the 20th Festival des Films’ grand prize in Tangier in March.  Set between 1921 and 1926, the movie casts light on the Rif war and the Battle of Annual between Amazigh (Berber) tribes and the Spanish colonial power in the mountainous Rif region of northern Morocco, where the Spanish army used chemicals against unarmed Riffians.  Through the story of a Spanish woman and a Moroccan woman, one trapped in oppressive tradition and the other in religious fanaticism, the movie tells of a journey into emancipation.  The storyline lends a feminist edge to the movie without “slipping into the populist feminism that makes of men sworn enemies to women,” as Moroccan cinema magazine Cinephilia commented. Here, the movie “depicts that society and tradition oftentimes make women a contributor to other women’s oppression,” the website wrote.  The movie focuses on the historically-controversial narrative of the war and the “deep wounds the Spanish colonial power left in the region.”  Directed by Mohammed Lyounsi, the movie highlights the role of the Moroccan resistance movement, spearheaded by military leader Abd El Krim El Khattabi, in driving the Spanish army out of the region, employing guerilla warfare tactics only.  In a bold move, Moroccan actress Yousra Tarek decided to shave her head for her role. She said the scene was meant to “directly get to the audience.”  The movie cast includes Moroccan actors Mohamed Choubi, Rafik Boubker, Abdellah Chakiri, and Abdellatif Chawkil Algerian actress Bahia Rachedi; and Spanish actor Luis Fernandez Eribe.

Rabat – The president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), Amina Bouayach, has commented on the re-prosecution of Justice and Development Party (PJD) member Abdelali Hamieddine for a 1993 murder. In a television program broadcasted Sunday on Medi1TV, Bouayach stated that there is no statute of limitations for prosecution, calling for respect of the victim’s family’s decision to re-open the case. “In such cases in human rights, there is no limitation for prosecution,” declared Bouayach. “I think we must have faith in the judiciary because it could be ruled in favor of Hamieddine,” she said. “The judiciary has not yet decided in the case.” Abdelali Hamieddine, the regional secretary of the PJD of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region, is being prosecuted for “complicity in murder” under Articles 128, 392, 393, 393, 394, and 395 of the Criminal Code. Hamieddine was previously acquitted of the same charge in the original trial in the 1990s. One PJD minister of Parliament, Boutaina Karouri, has heavily criticized Bouayach’s declaration. Karouri stated that Bouayach “expressed a terrible ignorance of the law.” The MP expressed her disapproval of Bouayach’s statements in an open letter, calling on her to get better acquainted with the documents before taking a position on the controversial re-prosecution. Karouri also considered Bouayach’s comments were interfering to affect the judiciary. Similar comments have been issued from several PJD members. Among them, the Minister of Human Rights, Mustapha Ramid, who noted, “no one can be prosecuted or punished because of an offense for which he has already been acquitted or condemned by a final judgment in accordance with the law and the criminal procedure of each country.” Hamieddine’s lawyer, Abdessamad El Idrissi, who is also a member of the PJD, echoed Ramid’s statement. Through a Facebook post, El Idrissi condemned the case, calling it “political” and contrary to “the internationally recognized principles of justice.” Re-opening of the murder case The Fez Court of Appeals re-opened the prosecution of four members of the PJD  for the murder of Mohamed Benaissa Ait El Jid, a leftist student. The criminal chamber at the court began the re-prosecution of four individuals today.  The case dates back to February 1993 when a group of masked people beat Ait El Jid with sharp objects as he was leaving Dar El Mehraz University in Fez. Among those previously prosecuted for complicity in murder were Taoufik Elkadi, a professor at the University of Settat, and Abdelouahed Krioul, owner of a private school in Rabat.  The two remaining suspects are Kassim Abdelkebir, an entrepreneur in the city of Sefrou, and Abdelkebir Laajili, a laborer at the National Office of Drinking Water (ONEP), prosecuted for beating the victim by using sharp objects. Ait El Jid’s friend, El Khammar Haddioui is the only witness in the case. The four suspects are being re-prosecuted based on his testimony. In the original trial, the suspects were acquitted by the Fez criminal court. In July 2017, the Ait El Jid family filed a complaint “about facts of the murder.”

Rabat – Nigerien President Mahamadou Issoufou, Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso, Gabonese President Ali Bongo, and others all praised King Mohammed VI’s leadership and commitment to the creation of regional commissions in charge of climate issues. During the first conference of the heads of states and government of the Sahel Climate Commission on Monday, in Niamey, Niger, President Issoufou, the commission’s leader, expressed his gratitude for the King’s continued support for the Sahel Climate Commission. For their part, Ali Bongo and Hermann Immongault, the Gabonese permanent representative to the African Union, particularly noted King Mohammed VI’s willingness to launch a climate investment plan and a priority program on climate for the region. During an audience following the conference, Issoufou received Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, who handed him a written message from the monarch.  King Mohammed VI’s message urged for the strengthening of bilateral relations between Niger and Morocco in all spheres, including security and climate change, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). This audience included the presence of Moroccan minister delegate for African Cooperation, Mohcine Jazouli, and Morocco’s ambassador to Niger, Allal El Ahab. Bourita represented Morocco at the Sahel Climate Commission on Monday, reading King Mohammed VI’s address to the participants of the conference. The King emphasized Morocco’s commitment to oversee feasibility studies for investment plans with regard to the climate of the Sahel region while also expressing deep concern over climate conditions in the region. King Mohammed VI also enhanced the efforts from the launch of the COP 22 summit in Marrakech in 2016, which was a “strong political signal” and an initiative which set the stage for dynamic transnational ambitions thanks to the joint efforts of the Congo Basin Commission, the Sahel Region Commission, and the Island States Commission. Morocco is among the leading countries in terms of efforts to combat climate change. The Climate Change Performance Index for 2019 ranked Morocco as the second-best performing country following Sweden, which scored the highest rank.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has called for the necessity of rethinking Euro-Arab relations, stressing “shared visions” for the future and urging European countries to accompany their “Arab neighbors” in their quest for economic prosperity and human development. In a written message read by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on Sunday at the Euro-Arab summit, the Moroccan monarch said Europe and the Arab world need to be clear on what they want to build together, what challenges they are facing, and how they are discharging their “shared responsibilities.” Towards a new era for Euro-Arab relations As the Mediterranean region is home to some of the most daunting global challenges but also heralds some of the most promising prospects for “a shared future,” the King argued, there is more than ever the need for “a profound and responsible rethinking of Euro-Arab relations.” The “necessary reevaluation,” the message stressed, should entail an “objective and level-headed reevaluation of current results, reconsideration of axes, defining current and future goals, and improving existing working methods.” The new era of necessary connections and interdependence between states calls for bolder actions to improve multilateral platforms to meet common challenges, especially security and human development. For the Moroccan monarch, however, more than the necessary appeal of multilateralism to “face challenges together,” the brand new Euro-Arab cooperation would involve a more radical vision of collaboration. The radical “collaborative and responsible framework,” he argued, would have more to do with a deep-seated belief in shared interests than the usual—and unreliable—geopolitics of win-win. While the oft-cited win-win rhetoric is bound to change as interests shift and new geopolitical patterns emerge, “a genuine Euro-Arab cooperation” takes into account shared historical trajectories, as well as a common present and future, according to the King. The goal of such an endeavor, he said, is to “elaborate an integrated and coherent project for the kind of future we want for our space [the Mediterranean].” Neighborliness and Arab sovereignty Also essential in the Moroccan monarch’s guidelines is “neighborliness,” with an insistence on peaceful cohabitation and the respect of regional commitments and treaties. “The security and stability of the Arab world are threatened by perilous policies and behaviors of some [Arab countries] vis-à-vis others,” he said. King Mohammed VI hinted at the lack of unity and coordinated efforts barring substantial improvement in solving a number of lingering regional crises. But Arab countries are not the sole culprits, the Moroccan monarch suggested. Beneath what is often presented as “Arab conflicts” lie complexities that can extend to diverging interests and ideologies pursued by a host of actors in the region, including non-Arab countries. But such complexities should not dampen the prospects for renewal and peace, argued the King’s optimistic message. “In this regard,” the text continued, addressing the way forward in confronting regional complexities, “there is a need to promote concrete development projects that redefine free movement for persons and investments, while striking a productive balance in responding to common social, economic, and security concerns.” The message added that securing common interests will have positive repercussions far above security and development concerns. It will pave the way for a “prejudice-free shared future” and discredit short-sighted political calculations, according to the King. Most notably, perhaps, the message ended in a tone that suggested that King Mohammed VI, the current chair of the Al-Quds committee, embodies Morocco’s role and significance in pushing towards the brand new Euro-Arab order. “In Morocco, we believe that common management of questions of the immigration and anti-terrorism fight, in whatever forms they take, should be approached with a global and integrated vision based on shared responsibility and the imperative of common development.”

Rabat – The trial for the November 3, 2017, shooting at the La Creme Cafe in Marrakech is resuming today after it was adjourned on February 5. One person died in the shooting and two were injured. The Marrakech Court of Appeals adjourned the trial due to a “new lead” and two new suspects. Two masked and armed attackers carried out the shooting, which killed a 26-year-old medical student, Hamza Chaib, and injured two others. The two suspects were reportedly targeting the cafe’s owner, Mustapha El Fachtali, but they hit the wrong target.  The police linked the crime to cocaine dealing between Dutch mafia and the cafe owner, concluding El Fachtali stole €27 million from a cocaine shipment. After a long investigation, the Moroccan authorities arrested 16 suspects in connection to the crime. Among the original suspects were two hired Dutch assassins, Edwin Gabriel Robles Martinez, 24, and Shardyone Ulise Girigorio Semerel, 26, as well as El Fachtali. The “second file” of the shooting implicates another three men: Morad Taghi, his brother Jamal Taghi, and their cousin Abd Nasser Taghi.

Rabat – An Australian court announced on Tuesday that Australian Vatican treasurer George Pell, 77, was convicted of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys. A jury found Pell guilty on one charge of sexual abuse and four counts of an indecent assault against the two boys. The assaults occurred at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in late 1996, a few months after the cathedral church appointed Pell as archbishop of Melbourne. Pell had cornered the choirboys after a Sunday solemn mass and raped them. Through trial proceedings, the cleric had remained free on probation while he denied all charges against him.  More than 20 witnesses, including clerics, choristers, and altar servers testified against Pell during trial. The court held a retrial in December during which he was convicted, but the court’s decision went unreported until today. Pell faces as many as 50 years in prison for the offences. He is currently in custody and his sentencing is due to begin on Wednesday. One of Pell’s victims—now 34—said in a statement to AFP about the assault: “Like many survivors, I have experienced shame, loneliness, depression and struggle. It has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life.” Speculations about Pell’s “unreported crimes” began to surface in 2013, following the publishing of a report by a task force called Operation Tethering. In 2015, Australian police began investigating Pell. In December, a few days after the unreported verdict, the Vatican removed Pell and other cardinals from the council of advisers. Pope Francis has yet to break his silence about Pell’s conviction.  Several media reports have suggested that Pell’s verdict may tarnish Pope Francis’s reputation because the pope had previously praised Pell for his “honesty” and appointed him as prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy in 2014, ignoring the allegations of sexual abuse. Pope Francis is scheduled to visit Morocco March 30-31 at the request of King Mohammed VI.

Rabat – Ever since marrying Britain’s Prince Harry in May of last year, Meghan Markle has transfixed the world as she quickly established herself as a style icon. She cemented this further during her recent visit to Morocco; even at seven months pregnant she was as stylish as ever. She wore her most glamorous look yet to a reception at the residence of the British ambassador to Morocco on Sunday evening, sporting a cream Dior kaftan, paired with her staple simple and glowy makeup and £7,000 earrings. The dress was clearly inspired by traditional Moroccan kaftans, flowing and draping flatteringly over her baby bump. The sleeves were adorned with a line of beading from the sleeves to the floor, adding another Moroccan touch. Cape sleeves were a trend spotted everywhere on the Oscars red carpet the same night. Meghan also donned the style when she landed in Casablanca in a red Valentino cape dress on Saturday evening. There was more to Meghan and Harry’s visit than just fashion, of course. The three-day trip was action-packed. The duke and duchess took time to visit Education for All in the Atlas Mountains, a center that provides education to financially disadvantaged girls in rural areas. While there, Meghan received traditional henna intended to wish for good health during her seventh month of pregnancy. The duchess also took the opportunity to show off her French, telling the students at the school how proud she was of them. The duchess also focused on the rights of women and girls during the ambassador’s reception on Sunday night, giving a speech on female empowerment to 130 influential guests.

Rabat – Royal Air Maroc (RAM) released a statement explaining the delay of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s flight and the loss of their photographers’ luggage. RAM said that because of heavy fog over London, Heathrow and Gatwick airports ordered several airlines, including RAM, to temporarily suspend their flights over the capital on Saturday. Flight AT 803 carrying the royal couple and their accompanying delegation was consequently delayed by an hour. RAM noted that Prince Harry and Meghan’s three photographers, whose luggage was lost, flew into Morocco on RAM’s flight AT 801 on Friday. However, RAM blamed the photographers for not registering their luggage aboard the same flight. According to Mark Cuthbert, one of the royal photographers, seven members of the media had no luggage upon arrival, and five of them have “gone the whole trip without them.” He complained that RAM refused to even give them a lost luggage reference number and accused RAM of having “woeful service.” The company explained that for purely operational reasons, the three photographers’ luggage had to be transported from London to Casablanca via Madrid through airlines other than RAM. The Duke and Duchess and their staff returned to London on Monday.

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture and Communication announced on February 24 the opening of the 12th-century archaeological site of Lixus. Lixus, located near Larache on Morocco’s Atlantic coast, will open to the public when work has been completed, scheduled for April. The ministry said in a statement received by Morocco World News, that the archaeological site “is of historical importance and exceptional value.” The ministry spent MAD 10 million to build barriers around the site and create a center to introduce its heritage. Lixus is an Amazigh (Berber) name that means “golden apples” in Arabic. The statement added that the ministry has spent an additional MAD 1.8 million to establish stores for antique pieces, a conference hall, and a reception space, as well as improving and preparing routes to access the site and valuing its components.  The ministry partnered with the Italian embassy, the Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development (AICS), and the University of Siena to carry out the works. The site’s opening is within the framework of Heritage Month, held every year from April 18 to May 18. Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj recently visited the archaeological site to supervise the progress of the works. The city of Lixus is the oldest archaeological site in Morocco and one of the oldest Phoenician establishments in the western Mediterranean. It is located north-east of Larache, a city on the Atlantic Ocean between Rabat and Tangier, on the right bank of the Lokos River. According to historical sources, the city of the “golden apples” was built in 1180 B.C. by an Amazigh King of the ancient kingdom of Mauretania. The city experienced major development during the reign of Amazigh King Juba II during the 1st century B.C. Most of Lixus has not been excavated, and so far only 10 percent of the area has been uncovered, despite its defining importance to Larache. According to UNESCO data, the site of Lixus is one of the most important sites that Morocco has succeeded in including in the World Heritage List. Lixus joined the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Morocco in 1995.

By mohammed Amine Benabou  Rabat – On behalf of King Mohammed VI, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has delivered a royal address to the Climate Commission of the Sahel region.  The conference, which began its work today, is meeting in Niamey, Niger. The King stressed Morocco’s commitment to oversee feasibility studies for investment plans with regard to climate of the Sahel region. The King also expressed concern over climate conditions in the Sahel. “This region, which is a bridge between north and south African regions, is now undergoing severe climate change from which results adverse effects on the environment.” King Mohammed VI emphasized the importance of launching a climate investment plan and a priority program for the region, “whose implementation is underway.” He stated that one of “the important challenges we are faced with is tackling this environmental issue effectively, while setting clear objectives pertaining to socio-economic development and meeting security measures.”  The King considered achieving “climate equality is, for African people, a battle for bettering their living conditions, ensuring a dignified life and a promising future.”  He also put forward that climate equality should not be a “hollow slogan” but a “prerequisite for us all” in help youth avoid distress and not “fall prey to crime and terrorist organizations.” The King also highlighted the efforts from the launch of the COP 22 summit in Marrakech in 2016, which was a “strong political signal” and an initiative which set the stage for dynamic transnational ambitions thanks to the joint efforts of the Congo Basin Commission, the Sahel Region Commission, and the Island States Commission. He also suggested the possibility of the Sahel region becoming a model of regional integrity at the economic, environmental, political, and human levels. Similarly, the King stressed that the efforts stakeholders exert to combat the detrimental effects of climate change should transcend national borders. He concluded that “our responsibility for the African youth is to exhaust all the possibilities to fulfil their aspirations and put this continent on the right track.”  “The future of Africa lies in our ability to devise new joint solutions with mutual commitment that is accommodating [the] interests of all parties concerned, be they in the north or south.”

The 37-year-old’s portrayal of Freddie Mercury, the frontman of British rock band Queen, in “Bohemian Rhapsody” earned him the title. Malek, who was born in Los Angeles to Egyptian parents, is known for his lead role in the television series Mr Robot, as a vigilante hacker with a social anxiety disorder. He also won an Emmy award for best actor in a drama series in 2016. Malek described receiving the trophy as a “monumental moment.” He thanked Queen’s band members, who attended the Oscar ceremony, for allowing him to be part of their legacy. “Thank you, Queen, thank you, guys, for allowing me to be the tiniest part of your phenomenal, extraordinary legacy. I am forever in your debt,” said Malek. “I never thought I could play Freddie Mercury until I realised his [birth] name was Farrokh Bulsara,” he noted. Mercury was born in Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, to Indian parents and moved to England with his family when he was a teenager. Malek took the opportunity to mention his own heritage as a child of a migrant couple from Cairo. “I grew up in a world where I never thought I was going to play the lead on Mr Robot because I never saw anyone in a lead role that looked like me,” Malek said. Numerous Egyptians and others from around the globe posted tweets to congratulate Malek for his achievement. All did not go smoothly for Malek at the Oscars however. After collecting his trophy and stepping down from the podium, Malek misplaced his foot and fell off the stage. He was rapidly checked by medical staff who made sure that he was uninjured.

Rabat – Germany deported 1,873 rejected asylum-seekers to the Maghreb region in 2018, 35 percent more than in 2017. Germany deported 826 Moroccans (up from 634 in 2017), 678 Algerians (504 in 2017), and 369 Tunisians (251 in 2017). According to the Rheinische Post, which cited the German interior ministry, the number of immigrants Germany has deported to the Maghreb region grew nearly 14 times from 2015. In 2015, Chancellor Angela Merkel installed a new policy to keep German borders open to an influx of immigrants fleeing war and other hardships. The liberal migration policy received backlash especially after terrorist attacks. Since then, Germany has tried to negotiate to reduce migrant flows, especially of economic migrants as opposed to refugees. Germany’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer, proposed plans to hold asylum seekers in centers for up to 18 months until the requests of the undocumented migrants are processed. The policy would give Germany the power to deny undocumented migrants at the borders. The German Federal Council, the Bundesrat, postponed a vote last week on a law to rank Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria as “Safe Countries of Origin” to speed up the process of deportation. The postponement came because of resistance from the green party in Germany. The law was already approved last month by the Bundestag, the German Parliament. According to Article 16a of the European Union’s Asylum Procedures Directive, “safe countries of origin” are countries “in which, on the basis of their laws, enforcement practices and general political conditions, it can be safely concluded that neither political persecution nor inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment exists.”

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – The Supreme Court of Spain has upheld a 14-year sentence for a member of the Spanish Civil Guard, Angel Luis V.J., convicted of murdering a young Moroccan man in April 2016. Luis shot Younes Slimani 17 times in his leg and head. A grand jury determined the police officer suffered psychological problems. The public prosecutor demanded a sentence of 21 years along with an indemnity of €145,000 as compensation for the victim’s legal beneficiaries. According to a report of the Spanish justice committee, the civil guard officer was on sick leave at the time of the incident, but he kept his service firearm on him. The officer fired gunshots at the victim following an accident between them on a highway outside of Madrid. According to Euro Press, a Spanish news agency, the victim had confessed before judges that he killed “an innocent man” and that he “was fully aware of the damage” he had done. The officer regretfully said, “I know the pain the family of the victim have to go through. I also lost my brother. There are no words to describe the pain.”

Rabat – In a video of Algerian protests denouncing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s re-election campaign, a group of protesters have been recorded repeating the slogan of the Raja de Casablanca (RCA) football club. The chant, “F’Bladi Delmouni,” means “in my country they oppressed me” and is often used by RCA fans denouncing oppression and discrimination in Morocco. After raising banners reading, “No fifth term. I am Algerian, I am against it,” Algerians began shouting the RCA slogan during protests over the weekend. #فبلادي_ظلموني من الحراك الشعبي بالشقيقة #الجزائر 🇩🇿#حراك_22_فيفري pic.twitter.com/xpMr20Ai5p — La Gazzetta della RAJA (@GazzettaRaja) February 23, 2019 
Algerian football fans also voiced their disapproval of Bouteflika’s bid for re-election by shouting slogans in a tournament match. Bouteflika’s announcement on February 10 that he will seek re-election for a fifth term has met strong expressions of anger by Algerians who no longer accept Bouteflika as president. Since then, social media networks have been overtaken with commenters condemning the political system in Algeria. One critical commenter was Algerian beIN sports commentator Hafid Derradji. Derradji regularly posts tweets supporting protests, criticizing the regime, and calling for more perseverance in confronting those in power in Algeria. When Bouteflika launched his campaign, a group of Algerian activists began using the hashtag “Let_Him_Rest,” implying he is being pressured to run citing what they call his inability to perform his constitutional duties. Bouteflika suffered a stroke in 2013 and has been largely absent from the public eye since. Algerian police arrested 41 individuals protesting on February 22.

Rabat – Spain is set to increase the height of the double border fences between Spain and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. The Spanish Ministry of Interior said that the barbed wire in the fences would be replaced by other non-injurious items, according to AFP. “The height of the fence will be increased by 30 percent, reaching ten meters, where most of the entries occurred,” Minister of Interior Fernando Grande Marlaska said. The statement of the ministry said that “all the barbed wire will be replaced by an element” which will guarantee security “without hurting”migrants all along the fence. The statement added that the works will begin in about a “month and a half.” Spain and Morocco have been working together to face the challenges and pressure due to the flow of irregular migrants in Morocco. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and his senior officials have been calling on the EU Commission to assist Morocco financially to face the challenges of irregular migration. In October 2018, Sanchez spoke about Morocco’s role in controlling migration on the Moroccan-Spanish border. He called Morocco a “strategic actor” for Spain in migration policy during the Summit of the European Heads of State and Government, which took place on October 17-18 in Brussels.
 Earlier this week, rumors ran wild that Morocco and Spain signed a new agreement on irregular migration. Spanish news outlet El Pais reported that Spain will start returning rescued irregular migrants to Moroccan ports instead to Spanish ones. However, both countries denied such agreement, emphasizing that Spain will still be landing rescued migrants to Spanish ports.

Rabat – Dahbi will be honored for his charity work in the UK and Morocco, and especially for his noble efforts following the London disaster of Grenfell Tower catching t fire on 14 June 2017. To show compassion, Dahbi invited the Grenfell Tower survivors to an evening where they were served a 4-course Moroccan inspired menu cooked by him.  Further meetings were held in the following days of the tragedy and were meant to help the survivors forget at least for one night what they have been through and enjoy Moroccan cuisine. Dahbi is expected to be received by Britain’s royal couple Sunday evening at the residence of the British ambassador in Rabat. Who is Khalid Dahbi? Khalid Dahbi is a Moroccan chef and entrepreneur originally from Rabat who left his family and beloved country behind at the age of 16 to travel to Europe to build his own career.

After studying business management and volunteering in workcamps for children and needy people, Dahbi went then to study culinary arts in Naples, Italy. Dahbi’s professional journey began in France. The Moroccan chef worked first as a cook before collecting experience to work as a chef in the country’s top restaurants, including Le Meurice and L’Arpege. In 1999, Dahbi settled in London and worked with the best chefs there, such as Gordon Ramsay, Macro Pierre White, and Jamie Oliver, among others. Dahbi’s experience in culinary arts enabled him to become a Resident chef at the Quintessentially Group, a British concierge company founded in 2000. On June 2018, Dahbi established his own restaurant in Central London called Beso Moorish. The restaurant presents Mediterranean dishes with each one having a story to tell about all the places he had been. Dahbi is also the first Moroccan in the UK to import the finest caviar in the world through his company, KD Luxury. The company sells also products with 24 karat gold. Additionally, Dahbi did not limit himself only on preparing delicious dishes, but his skills go beyond that, as he is a fashion designer and the first to design a handbag made from python and crocodile skin through a line called Antoine Amato.

I have discussed with my parents what is best for my career,” he added.

 By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat—Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, has condoned China’s use of the re-education camps. MBS, who arrived in Beijing on Friday, February 23, met with Chinese authorities, including Vice Premier Han Zheng , to sign a number of bilateral agreements on energy cooperation. Later speaking to a Chinese television channel, MBS appeared to dismiss the ongoing global condemnation of China’s ill treatment of close to 2 million of its Muslim population in the autonomous Xinjiang region. Beijing has recently doubled its crackdown on Uighur Muslims, arresting and detaining them in what the Chinese regime calls “re-education camps.” The goal is reportedly to make them less Muslim and more Chinese. International observers have however decried the measure, denouncing “religious discrimination” and referring to the confinement centers as “concentration camps.” During his Beijing trip, however, MBS sniffed at the global outcry and sided with China’s dismissal of international condemnation over its re-education camps policy. MBS appeared to liken Uighurs to potential terrorists, arguing that Beijing has the right to take necessary measures to curb radicalization and extremism. “China has the right to carry out anti-terrorism and de-extremization work for its national security,” MBS was quoted as saying on Chinese television. Prioritizing political interests Prior to MBS’ visit, it was reported that the Uighur community hoped that, in his capacity as Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader and guardian of Islam’s holiest sites, MBS would bring up the Uighur predicament to his Chinese hosts. Instead, the Saudi prince chose to be on China’s side, turning a blind eye to the plight of Uighurs. “We respect and support China’s right to take counter-terrorism and de-extremism measures to safeguard national security…. We stand ready to strengthen cooperation with China,” MBS maintained, according to local chinese news outlet Xinhua. On social media, some users slammed MBS’ defense of China’s crackdown on Uighurs. They said that the increasingly isolated Saudi prince is choosing economic interests and potential partners over the defense of fellow Muslims. In his visit, crown prince signed twelve agreements and memorandums of understanding in a variety of fields, which include petroleum, the chemical industry, investment, renewable energy and counter-terrorism. Physical and psychological torture in detention camps In its alleged counter-terrorism campaign, China has so far detained roughly one million ethnic Uighur Muslims. The Uighurs (or Uyghurs) are a Turkic Muslim community and are the dominant ethnic minority group mostly living in Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwestern China. While China has traditionally mistreated minorities, the crackdown on Uighurs especially intensified last summer, reportedly coinciding with Beijing’s agenda to reinforce the country’s communist identity As China’s anti-Islam campaign reached its peak last summer, an article in the Atlantic said that Beijing was “treating Islam like a mental illness.” “One million Muslims are being held right now in Chinese internment camps,” the article pointed out. It cited reports of “inmates being forced to eat pork and drink alcohol” as well as evidence of violence and torture in the so-called reeducation camps. Most recently, Turkey has also criticized China’s anti-terrorism approach on Uighurs, describing the internment camps as “a great cause of shame for humanity.” “It is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks incurring arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in internment camps and prisons,” Turkey’s foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a statement. He added that “Uighurs who are not detained in these camps are under heavy pressure.”

Rabat –Britain’s Prince Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan Markle, or Duchess of Sussex per British royal tradition, arrived Saturday night at the Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca. Upon arriving at the Casablanca airport, the British royal couple was greeted with a battalion of local authorities, including most notably Said Ahmiddouch, the Wali of the Casablanca-Settat region, as well as the British ambassador to Rabat, Thomas Reilly. After the traditional guard of honor ceremony, an additional crowd of enthusiast local dignitaries including president of the Casablanca provincial Assembly and representatives of the city’s municipal council welcomed the Duke and Duchess. The British royal couple is on a three-day tour in Morocco to further the diplomatic ties between Rabat and London. The Duke and Duchess will be King Mohammed VI’ hosts in one of the many royal residencies in Rabat in during the first night of the tour. While cementing the cultural and economic ties between Morocco and Britain is the primary reason for the royal visit, diplomacy will apparently not be the sole concern of the couple during their Moroccan stay. The Prince and the Duchess are expected to make the most of their Moroccan trip, judging by the official schedule of their visit which was made public by the British embassy. Culture, education, women’s rights, and youth empowerment feature prominently on the list of issues that the couple expects to address during the visit. After their first night at a royal residency in Rabat, the couple will then head on Sunday evening for an official reception at the residence of the British ambassador in Rabat. Prior to being hosted by the British ambassador on Sunday, the royal couple will travel to the Marrakech region, where they will visit “Education for all” boarding houses. In the Marrakech region, the prince and Markle will also travel to the Atlas Mountains to visit Asni, a small town in the High Atlas mountains 50 kilometers south of Marrakech. Monday, the third and final day of the royal tour, will be exclusively dedicated to cultural events in Rabat. The couple will visit the Moroccan Royal Federation of Equestrian Sports in Rabat, the Villa des Ambassadeurs restaurant for a cooking class on traditional Moroccan cuisine, and the Andalusian Gardens in Rabat.

Rabat – A 23-year-old woman died yesterday in a tragic accident after stones flew from an unknown direction and smashed her car’s windshield.  The woman, who was on the highway between Fez and Oujda, lost control of her car which overturned, causing her death, according to local sources.  The victim died before the arrival of the ambulance at the scene. She was a call centre counsellor, sources have indicated. According to Moroccan news website, the young woman was from Fez and worked in a call center. Authorities have opened an investigation to shed light  on the circumstances of the accident.

Rabat – In a rare public statement in a recent interview with Morocco’s Radio Mars, retired Moroccan middle-distance runner Hicham El Guerrouj said that Moroccan athletics is in bad shape and requires a royal intervention to regain its pass glorious days. The heavily Olympics-decorated 44 year-old is widely considered as the greatest middle-distance runner of all time, having won trophies in different categories of the sport. But El Guerrouj said that those victories are relics of an ancient time for younger generations of Moroccan athletes who wish to emulate him. According to El Guerrouj, even with a burning desire to compete and propel their country at the forefront of the discipline on the world stage, Moroccan athletes are increasingly faced with public disinterest and lack of support. “While there are no facilities where athletes can take bath or change, millions are being spent on walls, buildings, and other trivialities,” El Guerrouj said, appearing to target the country’s recent history of lavish spending on mega projects. Of his self-imposed seclusion from public life and debates on the sport that made his name, El Guerrouj said that the choice to remain silent on some issues, especially the fate and future of Moroccan athletes, was “conscious and deliberate.” He said he avoided visibility and public statements “out of respect for the people in charge and their strategies” and also because “I wanted to let them attend to their job with calm and serenity.” But his silence has not helped, he suggested, explaining that the situation of Moroccan athletes has worsened in recent years. Moroccan athletics has a glorious history with names such as Aouita, Skah, Boutaib, or Bidouane. Those early successes were possible because Moroccan authorities were engaged and supportive. Today, however, continuity has been stalled because nothing substantive is done to help the new generation replicate the success of their elders, the 44-year-old stressed. “Today, the reality is that [Moroccan] athletics is going from bad to worse, from failures to even more failures, and as a result generations of athletes are unfortunately lost… Today athletes don’t even have places to change or take a bath, this should be punished. I call on King Mohammed VI to save [Moroccan] athletes.”

Rabat – Until now, migrants rescued in the Mediterranean between Morocco and Spain were “automatically taken to Spanish ports.” From there, they would proceed to apply for asylum in Spain or continue to another EU country. But the latest agreement between Madrid and Rabat seeks to make it possible for Salvamento Maritimo, Spain’s rescue services, to repatriate migrants to the nearest Moroccan port. “Given our good relations with Morocco, Salvamento Maritimo will assist the Moroccan Navy if so required. In that event, rescued individuals will be taken to the nearest safe harbor, which in this case will be Moroccan,” a Spanish government source told Spanish outlet El Pais. According to the newspaper, “the new guidelines are meant to go into effect immediately, although their future will depend on the outcome of the [Spanish] snap general elections called for April 28.” Some sources said that the new agreement is set to increase the death rate in the Mediterranean. Now that Spain’s Salvamento Maritimo is set to coordinate with the Moroccan navy, migrants will avoid both entities, even at the peril of their lives in deep sea, argued Ismael Furio, a spokesman for Salvamento. “This kind of measure could turn us into someone to avoid. Deaths will rise. They will stay away from anything that smells of repatriation.” While a number of EU countries recently closed their ports to migrants rescuing ships, Spain opted for a more humanitarian approach. In recent months, however, pressure has been mounting on authorities to considerably curb the number of migrants reaching the country. As far as Spanish authorities are concerned, the deal is part of an initiative to positively respond to societal pressure. The goal seems to be to secure reelection in the April general elections. But also involved in the move is the need for Spain to get more engagement from its Moroccan ally. Madrid has been Rabat’s most steadfast supporter at the EU, and Spanish authorities want more reciprocity from Morocco on border security, El Pais’ sources suggested.

Rabat – Algerian police have said they arrested 41 protesters objecting to President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s re-election campaign for “disturbing the public order [and] engaging in acts of vandalism, violence and assault.” Of the 41 people arrested, 38 were arrested in Algiers, the country’s capital city. Clashes between demonstrators and Algerian police in protests yesterday afternoon resulted in police’ use of tear gas to disperse crowds and stop them from approaching the presidential residence. Algerian authorities did not report any injuries on their side or among protesters. Yesterday, thousands of Algerians took to the streets after Friday prayers to display their rejection of their President Bouteflika’s campaign to win re-election for a fifth term. The protesters carried banners and chanted hostile slogans to the president like “Bouteflika, the Moroccan, there will be no fifth term,” referring to Bouteflika’s Moroccan birth city, Oujda. The hashtag #protest_february_22 circulated on social media, encouraging the Algerian people to start a wave of protests against the president’s re-election. Algeria will hold its presidential elections on April 18. After he suffered from a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public.

Durham, North Carolina – When I was studying in Fez last year, my class had a couple days off in the third week, leaving me with a four-day weekend. To anyone who knows me, it will be absolutely no surprise that I did not want to take those four days to “relax” or “unwind” or even just stay in the Fez area. So I decided to take a somewhat spontaneous road trip. I booked a rental car and began scouring travel websites and blogs, trying to figure out where I wanted to go. After contemplating some suggestions I had heard from my classmates and the various interesting-looking attractions highlighted on websites, I pinned the locations on Google Maps and came up with a route that began with Chefchaouen. I left my Fez apartment at 5 a.m. and proceeded to attempt to navigate the narrow, winding roads that span the hilly countryside north of Fez, which, before sunrise, is a little nerve-racking. But after a couple of hours of continuous driving sequences that would make Americans panic (but which, to Fez taxi drivers, I am inclined to believe, would just be another day in the life), I arrived at the province of Ouazzane. There, I paused on a hill to admire the sunrise. As I drove through, I got to see the sleepy town begin to come alive, with shopkeepers opening their doors and delivery carts making their morning rounds. I stopped in a cafe that was just opening up to get a cup of coffee. It was when I asked for it “a emporter” that I discovered that coffee “to-go” does not seem to be as customary in Morocco as it is in the US. This gave me pause (it sometimes amazes me what a deluge of thoughts a simple detail can release). I see those familiar and incredibly environmentally-unfriendly cardboard to-go coffee cups every day at home. When I order a beverage in a coffee shop, more often than not the barista assumes that I would like it to-go. Presumably, this happens with other customers as well. So why is this coffee-drinking atmosphere so different in these two countries? To me, it seems that Americans are, generally speaking, a more rushed bunch of people than many Moroccans. It made me think about what I have observed in both Fez and my own city in North Carolina in the local coffee shops and cafes. In Durham, NC, I would venture that at least half (potentially more) of the coffee shop customers are stopping in to get a drink to take with them. We are always moving. As a society, we are virtually expected to be heading somewhere specific and productive when we leave the house. A coffee shop is simply a quick stop along the route. Of course, there are some people who sit and stay in the shop after ordering their beverage. But even they are different. First of all, most of them are students who are either reading or working on laptops, since free wi-fi is basically a staple of coffee shops across the country. And many of them are alone. Even the students who are not alone are acting as though they are. I have even done this! In college I would often study “with my friends.” But thinking about that now, I realize that all I had was another body across from me. I did not usually interact with them more than I had to since I was working on whatever academic task I had gone there to accomplish, group projects and collaborative efforts aside. After the “to-go-ers” and the solo students, lastly come the people who are actively engaging with the person or people whom they had come there to meet. But that is often the minority. This American pseudo-independent culture is in stark contrast with what I frequently observed in Morocco. In the cafes lining many of the main streets in Fez, as well as other cities I visited, both the indoor and outdoor seating areas are filled with people drinking coffee or tea. Many of these people are deep in conversation with others at their table, or are casually chatting while people-watching, or are even playing games together like chess or a different dice-throwing game that I never did figure out. This social, loud, and vibrant atmosphere can definitely be witnessed in the evenings at bars in the US, but I see it less often during the day at coffee shops. Daytime is “go-time” for Americans. But in Morocco, perhaps daytime is just as much a time to relax as it is a time to get things done. I do not call myself any sort of expert on American or Moroccan social cultures; all I can analyze are the situations I have viewed and details I have noticed in my personal experiences. I also do not think that one of these cultures is necessarily “better” than the other. Rather I am simply pointing out the differences. I find these types of reflections quite fascinating, and while I cannot confidently say that I know why these differences exist as they do, I enjoy watching simply for observation’s sake. However, I would think it could definitely be an interesting aspect of life to ponder. So next time you—as an American, a Moroccan, a European, an Asian, or simply as a fellow human—walk into a coffee shop or cafe, perhaps it would interest you to glance around, take in your surroundings and the people within them, and consider your motivations for walking into that establishment. What is your purpose?

Rabat – The Belgian Aliens Litigation Council (CCE) ruled on Friday in favor of expelling Malika El Aroud, known as “the black widow,” to Morocco, concluding that she would not be subjected to torture in her country of origin. The council said in a statement on Friday that its chambers judged that El Aroud “who had been sentenced in Belgium for her affiliation with a terrorist organization, and then stripped of her Belgian citizenship can be expelled to Morocco.” El Aroud had previously argued that she might be subjected to torture in a Moroccan prison if extradited, the basis of her appeal against the extradition and application for political asylum in Belgium. The Belgian Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (CGRS) rejected El Aroud’s request for asylum as the Belgian government deemed her “too dangerous” and unworthy of international protection because she has not expressed “remorse” for her actions. In November 2018, Belgium stripped El Aroud of her Belgian citizenship  after a Belgian court in 2010 sentenced her to eight years in prison for her involvement with terrorists.  Born in 1960, El Aroud was a member of al-Qaeda. She is the widow of a Taliban jihadi, Abdessatar Dahmane, who had posed as a television journalist in Belgium to assassinate the Afghan political and military leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. In October 2018, Belgium began to consider extraditing El Aroud to Morocco in line with the country’s s new migration and asylum legislation which went into force in May 2017. El Aroud is internationally known as “black widow” and  “the most dangerous woman in Belgium.”

Rabat – Chadian President Idriss Deby received Maroc Telecom Group Chairman Abdeslam Ahizoune earlier this week.

Ahizoune went to talk to Deby on February 19 about Maroc Telecom’s probable entry into Chad’s telecommunications market.

Ahizoune told the president that the group is strongly committed to supporting Chad’s digital development. The Chadian leader said that the government was ready to welcome any investor with open arms.
 Last year, Chad announced a plan to auction a new telecommunications licenses for mobile services. In recent years, the Chadian tax on mobile companies gradually increased. The tax rate was 4 percent in 2014, and then went up to 7 percent in 2016. In January 2018, the rate jumped to 9 percent. If Maroc Telecom enters the Chadian market, the group will have to face two foreign competitors—Luxembourg’s Tigo and India’s Bharti Airtel. But Airtel has said in the past that it might exit the Chadian market.

Through its Moov subsidiary, Maroc Telecom operates in Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Niger, and the Central African Republic.

Except for the Central African Republic, the company’s growing business in each of these countries has yielded positive results.

Maroc Telecom performed well in 2018. Its revenue for the year is expected to be over MAD 36 billion, an increase of 3.1 percent over the previous year.

Rabat – The recent announcement of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika that he would seek re-election for a fifth term in office has sparked a wave of protests throughout Algeria. Thousands of people turned up to protest after Friday prayers after the hashtag #protest_february_22 circulated on social media. Protesters, waving banners, were chanting hostile slogans to the president. During a rally in the city of Constantine, the protestors chanted “Bouteflika, the Moroccan, there will be no fifth term” in reference to the fact that Bouteflika was born in Oujda, Morocco. Algeria is set to hold presidential elections in less than two months on April 18.  Although the Friday afternoon protests remained largely peaceful in Algiers, police deployed as reinforcements in several neighborhoods and major sites of the city. When protesters began marching on the presidential palace, police fired tear gas, according to the BBC. The fear that the protests might spark violence led the US embassy to post on Twitter, “Dear U.S. Citizens in Algeria: This is a demonstration alert for U.S. Embassy Algiers, Algeria. Event: Demonstrations may take place throughout the country on Friday, February 22 and Sunday, February 24, 2019.  Actions to take: Monitor local media and avoid crowds and demos.”  Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public since he suffered a stroke in 2013.

Rabat – Following a recent investigation into a case of child labor and employer abuse at the orders of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), Casablanca police found marks of physical violence on the victim, a 13-year-old girl who worked as a domestic employee in Casablanca. The victim’s family had known of the abuse their child experienced and filed complaints against the child’s employers, a married couple. The couple blackmailed the parents and forced them into withdrawing the lawsuit.  The husband and wife are currently in police custody on charges of assault and battery, as more investigations are ongoing into the motives of the violence. Meanwhile, an investigation into the local police officer whom DGSN accused of professional misconduct and laxity is ongoing under the supervision of the King’s attorney general to carry out the disciplinary procedures. Soon after media reports of the abuse of a child emerged, DGSN opened an investigation into the incident and judged that the police officer in charge of the case did not abide by the Penal Code criminalizing torture. According to Articles 231-1 and 231-3 of the Moroccan Penal Code, “any act of torture or intentional causing of pain or acute physical or mental suffering to a person by a public officer for the purpose of intimidating, pressuring him/her” is punishable by imprisonment from 10 to 20 years and a fine of MAD 20,000 to 50,000.

Rabat – Abderrahim Mastour has denied media reports stating his son, Moroccan international football player Hachim Mastour, had disappeared, leaving his family and relatives in a worrying situation. Reports claimed Hachim Mastour had been missing since the beginning of the winter transfer season. Mastour’s father explained that his son sustained an injury in a championship match with his club Greek PAS Lamia on December 12. According to the father, the club neglected the player’s injury and refrained from assuming responsibility for covering medical care and pressured Mastour into playing other games, despite the pain. On December 22, the Atlas Lion had to travel to Italy to undergo a medical examination, paid for with his own money, indicated the father. However, Mastour’s father denied that his son was missing.

Rabat – Released this month, a study by Atradius has listed Morocco and four other countries as promising emerging markets for this year. The overview of the report indicates that Morocco is among the “bright spots for export opportunities” despite global economic concerns. According to the study, Morocco, Peru, Bulgaria, Indonesia, and Vietnam shined in 2019 “as markets with strong growth prospects and limited vulnerability to global headwinds.” The markets, according to the study, experienced growth in several areas, including strong investment growth, infrastructure, and manufacturing. Several international reports and media articles have written about the key importance of the automotive industry in Morocco. The Wall Street Journal reported that Morocco is leading Africa in the automotive industry. The business newspaper said that Morocco has emerged as the continental leader, surpassing South Africa with 345,000 passenger vehicles in 2017 over 331,000 for South Africa. For the recent study by Atradius, the stable political situation and institutional conditions play an eminent role in the growth of the emerging market. The study described Morocco as “solar powered.” “Morocco is improving thanks to a cyclical upturn in agriculture production, as well as strong non-agricultural growth, especially in the manufacturing sector supported by increasing government investment.” In 2018, Morocco’s Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture commended that year’s harvest, emphasizing it was an “exceptional” harvest. According to the ministry, Morocco harvested 10.3 billion kilograms of cereals, exceeding the harvest of the previous season by 7 percent. This year, however, concerns mounted from Moroccan farmers due to the delay of rainfall in the country. Despite disappointments, the study expect a bountiful year for Morocco as other sectors also contribute to the Moroccan growth. “Morocco is a strategic hub for trade and investment between Europe and Africa and between North America and the Middle East.” The study also discussed Moroccan tourism. “There is also strong potential in the tourism industry, which has recorded average annual 6% growth since 2000 and climbing to 8.5% in 2018.” The renewable energy sector is also a source of pride for Morocco because it has seen “strong growth, with potential opportunities for imports.” According to the study, Morocco “sources about 35% of its power from renewables, especially from concentrated solar power.” Morocco ranked 60th in the 2019 World Bank’s ease of doing business report, jumping nine places from 2017.

Rabat – Following the injury of dozens of protesting teachers by security forces using water cannons and batons, the National Commission of Medical Students “strongly” condemned the use of “violence” to disperse the protesters, in a statement on Thursday. The statement read that the police officers’ actions were “a violation of human rights” and the right to lead peaceful protests. They expressed full solidarity with the teachers who “were deprived of their rights to stability, promotion, and continuous training.” The commission also called on the government to pay serious attention to the demands of the teachers and start a constructive dialogue with them, “which is for the best interest of the national education.”  Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said Thursday, following the weekly government meeting, that the government is keen to listen to and guarantee the contractual teachers’ rights to health coverage, job promotions, and a pension fund. Contractual teachers do not benefit from health coverage or retirement funds because they are hired for a fixed term by educational institutions, unlike permanent teachers in the public sector. El Khalfi explained that the hiring of the teachers comes after they undergo vocational training and spend two years getting work experience at educational academies. On Wednesday, the eighth anniversary of Morocco’s “20 February movement,” hundreds of teachers from different cities took to the streets of Rabat to lead a protest from Parliament on Avenue Mohammed V to the Ministry of Education at Bab Rouah. The teachers, fed up with the lack of response to their demands to be integrated into the public sector of employment, began to make their path toward the the Royal Palace of Rabat when security forces started firing water cannons and manhandling them, leading to the injury of dozens. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said yesterday in a statement that security forces had to maintain “order and public safety” and stop some protesters who were getting violent. The police did not make any arrests, according to DGSN.

Rabat – In the wake of rising anti-Semitism concerns in France, Eric Zemmour has again hit at the country’s immigrant community with his usual anti-immigration and Islamophobic rhetoric. A polarizing essayist and well-known media figure in France, Zemmour is most famous for his trenchant criticism of immigration and Islam. Zemmour is also a strong believer in France’s “assimilation” policy, maintaining that non-Judeo-Christian names like Mohammed put the survival of France’s history and culture in jeopardy. But this time, Zemmour particularly angered a number of Franco-Moroccan figures with Islamophobic slurs that appeared to single out “migrants coming here from Morocco” as champions of terrorism and anti-Semitism. Earlier this week, political parties, civil society organizations, and “anonymous citizens” marched in Paris to “express indignation” at the country’s rising anti-Semitic attacks. The march came in support of Alain Finkielkraut, a French writer of Jewish origin who was recently a victim of anti-Semitic insults during a yellow vest protest. Speaking on a morning show on LCI television channel on February 19, Zemmour dismissed the march against anti-Semitism. Zemmour argued that rather than fighting against anti-Semitic abuses, leftist political parties and civil society groups have been the allies of an “Islamic-leftist agenda to colonize and Islamize France.” According to Zemmour, France’s leftist parties’ repeated calls for diversity and immigration-friendly policies have become the “breeding ground of terrorism and anti-Semitism.” “We are regularly witnessing attacks on Jews and churches,” Zemmour said. He added that “there are verses in the Qur’an which openly call on Muslims to kill Jews.” On the LCI morning show, Zemmour maintained that immigration, especially from Africa and the Arab world, is the greatest threat to France’s social and cultural identity. He pointed out that France “keeps taking in migrants, especially those coming here from Morocco” who he said threaten the core of France’s social fabric, in addition to being “the root causes of insecurity and terrorism.” Zemmour noticeably said that the claim that Islam is a religion of peace is a “lie” used by leftist politicians and elites who put their “globalist views” and economic interests before those of France. ‘Shameful and irresponsible’ Zemmour’s remarks ignited a social media storm. Many in France’s Muslim and immigrant community took to various social media platforms to denounce the polemist’s “Islamophobic,” “irresponsible,” and “fascist” comments. But the most notable reaction to Zemmour’s LCI interview came from Yassine Belattar, a French-Moroccan comedian who hosted a show on the same television channel that aired Zemmour’s latest comments. In a series of tweets just hours after LCI aired its interview with Zemmour, Belattar vented his “anger” and “disappointment” at LCI for giving a platform to a “liar” and “irresponsible” polemist. “There is a difference between freedom of expression and freedom of provocation,” Belattar wrote. He said that he longer wanted to be part of the LCI team because the channel was indirectly legitimizing Zemmour’s “outrageous” views. “I am so very angry. I resign from LCI. This is so shameful,” he added.

Rabat – The embassy of Morocco in Copenhagen announced on Facebook that the former Danish consulate in Essaouira, which dates back to the 18th century, is now being restored. The former Danish consulate represented the diplomatic ties established between Sultan Mohamed Ben Abdallah of Morocco and the King Frederick V of Denmark back in 1763. “In the last twenty years, the renovation project has been put on the table. For a period of time there had been a lot of ideas for the renovation,” said the Moroccan embassy in Denmark in a Facebook post.  The restoration is being overseen by renowned architects who published a book on the project of rehabilitation of the old consulate, including Moroccan architects. Discussions relating to the restoration of the old building with the Danish ambassador to Morocco, Morocco’s ambassador to Denmark, and various Moroccan ministries included the possibility of using it as a cultural exchange center between Morocco and Denmark. Morocco will be administering, fostering, and financing the project. The building will also have a cultural vocation and “will serve as a bridge between Morocco and Denmark.”

Rabat – The Moroccan transport ministry has acquired 280 American-made intelligent radars to better monitor traffic violations. The Ministry of Equipment, Transport, and Logistics distributed the “Trucam LTI 20/20” to the Royal Gendarmerie and national police on Thursday. The new intelligent speed cameras are mobile and can detect speeds from a distance of up to 1.5 kilometers, record video evidence, take high resolution images, and record the make, model, and plate number of violating vehicles. The transport ministry delivered the speed radars equally to the Royal Gendarmerie and the national police to be used on “high accident” roads. The sophisticated cameras are multifunctional, enabling law enforcement to measure speed before and after passing the radar and also identify traffic offenses, such as not wearing seat belts, talking on the phone while driving, or blocking traffic. Additionally, the radars detect speeding cars at night, traveling time, distance between vehicles, and can also distinguish between commercial and private vehicles, even in bad weather. The ministry spent MAD 27 million (tax free) to acquire the 280 radars. The cameras are also expected to cost MAD 1 million per year for maintenance. The secretary of state within the transport ministry, Mohammed Najib Boulif, said that the ministry launched the project to reduce the escalating number of road accidents and to improve drivers’ behavior. On the National Day of Road Security on February 18, a representative of the transport ministry stated that Morocco plans to install 550 intelligent radars in addition to 140 previously installed speed cameras. The intelligent radars will be fixed on high traffic roads, in contrast to the 280 Trucams, which are mobile. In 2018, the General Directorate of National Surveillance (DGSN) recorded 66,343 road accidents, resulting in 964 deaths, 3,748 serious injuries, and 84,048 minor injuries. DGSN registered over 1.8 million traffic offenses and began infringement proceedings on 573,557 vehicles. The number of traffic accidents increased by 7.5 percent in comparison to 2017, when 61,686 accidents were recorded. The number of deaths and injuries also increased in comparison to those recorded in 2017.

Rabat – Morocco and Russia agreed to extend their fisheries and cooperation agreement into 2019 at a meeting in Agadir this week.

The secretary general of Morocco’s Maritime Fisheries Department, Zakia Driouch, and head of Russia’s Federal Fisheries Agency, Ilya Shestakov, signed the agreement.

The Moroccan-Russian Joint Intergovernmental Commission for Maritime Fisheries agreed earlier this week on an 8 percent increase to Russia’s fishing quotas in Moroccan waters for this year.

For 2019, Morocco increased the authorization for fishing to 140,000 tons of fish, compared to 129,500 tonnes last year. 

In 2018, seven Russian fishing vessels were operating in Moroccan waters with some 327 Moroccan fishermen on board, according to Russia Beyond.

The Deep Strategic Partnership sealed in 2016 between Morocco and Russia led to a number of major projects and actions in priority areas such as agriculture, fisheries, energy, industry, and tourism.

In return, Russia will grant Morocco financial compensation of $22 million annually and expert training. 

Russia will pay an additional $8 million, consisting of the costs of annual scientific research campaigns, port fees paid to the National Ports Agency (ANP), and employing Moroccan seamen on board Russian vessels.  Morocco aspires to become Russia’s top economic partner in Africa and the Arab world, the Moroccan ambassador to Russia told Sputnik last year. The country ranks second among the Arab countries that trade with the Russian Federation. Despite Polisario’s threats to appeal to the European Court of Justice and the United Nations to oppose it, Morocco concluded another fishing deal earlier this month with the EU. The European Parliament approved the Morocco fisheries agreement with 415 votes in favor and 189 votes against.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – The Moroccan national team is bringing home two medals, one gold, and one bronze, from the African Para-Taekwondo Championships. The event was hosted in Hurghada, Egypt, February 19-20. Moroccan martial artists were among 126 competitors who took part from 30 countries across the globe. Four taekwondo artists represented Morocco in the championship. Rachid Ismaili Alaoui won the gold medal in the category of over 75 kg K43. Moroccan Naoual Al Arif earned a bronze medal in the same category after defeating his Egyptian adversary in the quarter final with a score of 25-4. Moroccan taekwondo martial artists Sana Bouni, in the under 58 kilogram category, and Ayoub Idouich, in the under 61 kilogram category, made it past the first round.  Ahmed Fouly, president of World Taekwondo Africa and vice-president of World Taekwondo, said the high number of participants was due to the sports “inclusion on the programme for the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo.” The competition is part of the Morocco’s para-taekwondo preparations for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020. Morocco has several notable taekwondo martial artists. In 2018, Abou Fares, a female Moroccan taekwondo artist, was the first Arab to win a gold medal in taekwondo at a youth Olympics event. She won the Arab Athlete of Distinguished Athletic Achievements award after her win at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Argentina. Back in 2017, Moroccan para-taekwondo artist Abdennour Lafdini, competing against a 353 candidates, won a Special Needs Persons award at the 10th Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Creative Sports Awards in Dubai.

Rabat – Violent riots started after the final whistle in a match on Wednesday, February 20, won by Mouloudia Oujda 1-0 at Al-Sharafi Stadium in Oujda, a city in northeastern Morocco on the border with Algeria. Following the match, part of the 16th round of the national professional football championship, some fans rioted and damaged the stadium. The stadium had only recently been repaired and reopened. According to some local media reports, four security agents and six fans were injured after the match. “Al-Farabi Hospital in Oujda received the injured group, which brought together Mouloudia Oujda and Nahdat Berkane fans, including security agents, to receive necessary care,” a local Oujda outlet, Shams Post, reported. The Central Committee for Discipline and Sportsmanship of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), held a meeting on Thursday morning and issued several disciplinary measures against both teams. In its press release, the committee stated that it reviewed many reports regarding the violent riots. “These acts negatively impacted sport in general and football in particular, and caused physical and financial losses, which according to preliminary results is 670,000 dirhams.” The FRMF “denounces these irresponsible actions and affirms that it will not hesitate to make an end to whatever would undermine the national football reputation.” The committee declared that Mouloudia Oujda would have to play five open games without an audience and pay a fine of MAD 85,000. FRMF also obliged the team to make material compensation quickly, after the stadium management service evaluates the losses. FRMF also decided to punish Nahdet Barkane, making it play two games without an audience and pay a fine of MAD 10,000. The committee also called for football fans to combat the phenomenon of rioting and abuses in all its aspects.

Rabat – The Moroccan government council adopted a bill ratifying the agreement to establish the African Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) on Thursday, announced Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi.

The bill has yet to be brought before Parliament for ratification.

The agreement aims to facilitate integration between African markets, El Khalfi said.  The agreement would consider that the areas of regional economic communities remain the pillars of CFTA’s establishment, he added.

The council reiterated the same interpretation that Morocco made when it signed the agreement establishing the African CFTA.

Morocco’s signature of the agreement does not imply that it recognizes the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, also a member of the African Union, restated Khalfi.

Only 16 percent of all African trade is with other African nations, a low rate in contrast to the EU, where 70 percent of all trade is between EU members. The CFTA should cover five regional blocks: the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA), the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD).

The TFTA is a proposed entity made up of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Southern African Development Community (SADC), and East African Community (EAC).

Last May, Morocco signed the agreement to establish the CFTA at the Extraordinary Summit of the African Union in Kigali, Rwanda. Morocco returned to the AU in 2017 after a 33-year absence.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Egypt carried out nine executions by hanging on Wednesday, February 20, in Cairo. The alleged murderers, who are said to have been affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood, were convicted of orchestrating the assassination of top Egyptian prosecutor Hisham Barakat in Cairo on June 29, 2015. The nine men were among 28 convicted of involvement in the murder. On his way home, Barakat was killed when a car bomb detonated near his convoy. The young men were reportedly tortured with electric shocks into making confessions. One of the convicts said before the judges, “Give me an electrocution tool and I’ll make you admit you killed Sadat! We were electrocuted with enough electricity to last Egypt for 20 years.” Some blame “the human rights abuses” on the el-Sissi administration, while others have demanded that Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi leave the country. The use of the death penalty in Egypt has been on the rise ever since el-Sissi toppled Mohamed Morsi in a coup in 2013. The government has since cracked down on anyone believed to have ties with Morsi’s party, the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Under el-Sissi, courts have confirmed 1,451 death sentences as of December 2018. Among 2,443 preliminary death sentences, 12 were given to juveniles, according to a European Parliament motion on Egypt. The hangings were widely denounced on social media, where Egyptians activists launched a campaign using the hashtags “#Halt_Executions” and “#No_to_death_penalty” to voice their opposition to the 15 executions carried out so far this year. Barakat’s daughter wrote on Facebook before the executions that she believed “the nine men are innocent and they are going to be unjustly killed.” In a tweet, an advisor of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated, “Six were killed by Egyptian politicians last week, so will another nine be executed tomorrow. The world is keeping silent over such butchery.” A number of Egyptians staged a sit-in in front of the Egyptian consulate in Istanbul to condemn the hangings. Najia Bounaim, Amnesty International’s North Africa campaigns director, said in a statement, “These executions are a stark demonstration of the government’s increasing use of the death penalty.” Bounaim continued, “Egyptian authorities must urgently halt this bloody execution spree which has seen them repeatedly putting people to death after grossly unfair trials in recent weeks.” The human rights group stands against all forms of executions, saying that those involved in the murder “deserve to be punished but executing men who were convicted in trials marred by torture allegations is not justice but a testament to the magnitude of injustice in the country.”

Rabat –  Good news: Morocco’s Ministry of Health has announced major cuts on the price of 319 medicines for several chronic diseases, including blood derivatives, antibiotics, and treatments for anemia, hemorrhaging, epilepsy, and rheumatoid arthritis. According to the ministry, the approach is in line with the implementation of the national medicines policy to facilitate citizens’ access to medicines and reduce the burden of medical coverage expenses. The ministry’s decision comes under the provisions of the 2019 Finance Bill on the exemption of Value Added Tax or TVA for medicines that cost more than MAD 588. The ministry also expressed determination to continue the implementation of the policy to “promote equitable access to quality treatments at fair prices.” In the finance bill, the Moroccan government allocated more than MAD 16.3 billion to the health sector, up 1.6 billion from the 2018 bill. The increased spending on the health sector follows King Mohammed VI’s instructions to prioritize education and health. The government promised to improve public access to health services and to restructure support and social protection policies. The government also approved a number of provisions in the bill related to value added taxes. According to the Pharma World magazine, Morocco is a key player in the pharmaceutical market due to its “stable political framework” and its strategic location on the Mediterranean.
Speaking on Morocco’s medicine policy, the magazine referred to a Business Monitor International study which said that the government “planned actions to reduce retail mark-ups and VAT for chronic illness medicines and to improve the medicine supply chains, increase the number of qualified staff and facilities and promote the rational prescription of medicines … Plans are also ongoing to eradicate the Hepatitis C Virus by 2030.”

Rabat – On Wednesday, security forces intervened to stop hundreds of protesting contractual teachers from approaching the Royal Palace of Rabat by firing water cannons and manhandling protestors, leading to dozens of injuries. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement on Thursday that security forces had to maintain “order and public safety” and stop some protesters who were getting violent. The protesters supposedly ignored police warnings and were “persistently” engaging in premeditated violations. According to the DGSN, the violations included attempts to trespass “private properties,” acting in ways that “could have undermined the safety of the public.” Five members of the security forces were also injured during attempts to disperse the event. The DGSN denied allegations reported by some media outlets that it had arrested protesters. Contractual teachers came to Rabat from various cities in Morocco—Tenghir, Azilal, Taroudant, Agadir, Tiznit, and Chishawah—to participate in the march. Wearing white teacher robes and demonstrating against fixed-term contracts which they “were forced into,” Moroccan contractual teachers marched from Avenue Mohammed V, where Parliament sits, to Bab Rouah, where the Ministry of Education has its headquarters, in Rabat. The path goes past the entrance to the Royal Palace. The Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) organized the march to renew calls to be integrated into the public sector of employment that they say have “fallen on deaf ears,” and rise against the signing of a contract extension for contractual teachers hired in 2016, 2017, and 2018. To them, signing the extension contracts would be like “showing that they approve of contractual teaching.” Contractual teachers do not benefit from rights in the employment law like permanent teachers. Contractual teachers also do not have healthcare coverage and a pension fund. Their salaries come from the educational academies with whom they are contracted for a certain period of time.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The fifth Halieutis Fisheries International Fair marked, on its first day, the renewal of three partnership agreements between Morocco’s National Fisheries Office and the French agricultural office FranceAgriMer, the northern French city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, and the French fishing port of Lorient-Keroman. According to Amina Figuigui, managing director of the National Office of Fisheries, “The fisheries agreement aims to strategize a business plan, between 2019 and 2020, built on past agreements. It focuses primarily on organization, marketing, modernization, and restructuring.” Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s minister of agriculture, fisheries, rural development, water, and forests, emphasized, “We must highlight these achievements and work on improving them.” Morocco is the world’s 13th largest producer of fish and top producer in Africa, with 1.4 million tons of fish production. According to Jean-Paul Solaro, president of the Lorient-Keroman port, the port’s partnership agreement with Morocco aims at “marketing fish products, modernizing the sector, improving financial management of commercial transactions, supporting Moroccan and French exporters and importers as well as developing a seafood tracking system.” As for the partnership made with Boulogne-sur-Mer in February 2017, Frederic Cuvillier, the previous French minister of agriculture, agrifood, and forestry, stated that it focuses “on the marketing of fisheries products, training, innovation and regional cooperation at the national and European levels, as well as the support of Moroccan and French exporters and importers.” The fair, held from February 20-24 in Agadir, was inaugurated by Akhannouch under the theme “New Technologies in Fishing: For a Better Fisheries Contribution in the Blue Economy.” The fair anticipated it would host over 350 exhibitors from 38 countries.  Norway is the guest of honor, and other guests include Russia, Italy, Spain, France, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Gabon, Guinea, and Benin. The five-day fair is organized in the form of roundtables, each of which consists of 20-30 participants so as to facilitate discussion on current practices and requirements to meet traceability needs of national and international markets.  The fisheries fair also allows professionals and various stakeholders to exchange experiences and foster innovation in the vital sector for the Moroccan economy. The event will be open to the public on Saturday and Sunday.

Rabat – Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has again declined to comment on rumors of Morocco allegedly holding a secret meeting with the Israeli government. When asked in a press conference about the rumors of a secret meeting between Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, El Khalfi said that “the Kingdom of Morocco does not respond to rumors.” El Khalfi’s statement comes in response to a program aired by Israeli television channel 13, which reported that Bourita met with Netanyahu in September in New York on “the sidelines of a UN General Assembly.” The channel also claimed that Israel “offered assistance for Morocco regarding Iran.” Israel also refused to respond to the rumors when Netanyahu’s office said that they do not comment on “contacts with countries Israel has no formal relations with.” The recent rumors come on the heel of allegations that Netanyahu was preparing to conduct an official visit to Morocco in the coming month. The government declined to answer questions about it in a press conference, emphasizing that Morocco does not “comment on rumors.” Following the speculation, dozens of activists went to Parliament to protest against the normalization of relations with Israel earlier this month in Rabat. In a statement, the Moroccan Anti-Normalization Observatory said that the possible visit of Netanyahu would aim to discuss a US-proposed solution to the Sahara conflict. The secretary general of the observatory, Aziz Hanawi, told Morocco World News in a previous statement that “those promoting a visit by Netanyahu to Morocco are trying to convince us that it is a matter of mediation on the Sahara issue.” Israeli news outlets reported that Morocco was seeking rapprochement with Israel to gain US support in the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – The American Chamber of Commerce in Morocco (Amcham)  held its annual gala on February 16 in Casablanca at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. The event, which gathered business leaders, entrepreneurs, social workers, and authorities from both the US and Morocco, sought to promote greater commercial ties between the two countries. Furthering US-Morocco connections In a press release shared with Morocco World News, organizers highlighted the importance of upholding the traditionally strong connections between Morocco and the US. As a growing continental hub, the document suggested, Morocco offers enormous investment opportunities for American firms. At the same time, business cooperation between US and Moroccan firms and entrepreneurs can enable the North African country to have greater access to the technological know-how of American enterprises. In its bid to become the platform that can uphold and further the US-Morocco connections, Amcham’s event “celebrated the Casablanca-Miami direct flight recently launched by Royal Air Maroc,” the press release noted.
Direct flights play an essential role in bringing countries and people closer. Currently, Royal Air Maroc operates two direct flights to the US from Casablanca to Washington, D.C., and New York. The airline also has plans to launch a Casablanca-Boston flight this year. In the US-Morocco case, Amcham suggested, the Casablanca-Miami flight is part of a broader dream of solidifying the win-win bilateral relations between the two countries through a joint platform of support for entrepreneurship. “The Miami-Casablanca line will stimulate trade, investments, tourism, as well as cultural exchanges between Morocco and the US,” the press release noted. In addition to firms and businesses, the Amcham gala marked the presence of US and Moroccan authorities. Representatives from the US included Miami-Dade Commissioner Jose Diaz; Manny Gonzalez, chief of economic development and international trade for Miami-Dade County; and Stephanie Miley, the charge d’affaires of the US embassy in Morocco. Amcham 2019 Prizes As part of its continued endeavor to pave the way for more prosperous business ventures from the US to Morocco, and vice versa, Amcham 2019 acknowledged the efforts of citizens and firms whose actions strengthened bilateral ties between the two countries. In total, four prizes were awarded to individuals and companies that stood out in their commitment to promoting US-Morocco trade and cultural exchanges. The first prize, the American Investment in Morocco Award, went to Hexcel Composites. A global leader in making and engineering aerospace materials, the American company has been accompanying Morocco’s growing aerospace sector. Hexcel Maroc has invested over $20 million and created 100 jobs in the past three years. Amcham awarded Hexcel Maroc for bringing its state-of-the-art expertise to Morocco as well as “its commitment to innovation, corporate responsibility, inclusiveness, and diversity.” The second category rewarded Moroccan exports to the US. The Marocaine des Thes et Infusions (Mathe), a tea-producing and exporting company, won the prize. A leader in the Moroccan food sector, Mathe’s investments amounted to $12 million in the last three years, creating 250 jobs. The company started exporting to the US in 2015. “Mathe places innovation and creativity at the heart of its activities,” Amcham said. Justifying Mathe’s prize, the document said the Moroccan company has “transformed and improved” the quality of Moroccan tea, gaining it recognition in foreign markets. The third category, US exports to Morocco, went to Tropicars, a Miami-based global leader for golf and utility vehicles. The company operates in the Caribbean, the Americas, and increasingly in Africa. Tropicars Morocco opened in 2016 and is gradually becoming the leading provider of luxury vehicles to the country’s booming tourism industry. The last category, the Amcham Hall of Fame Prize, was awarded to Stephanie Miley, the charge d’affaires at the American embassy in Rabat. The Hall of Fame prize acknowledges a Moroccan or American personality whose efforts stood out in terms of promoting Amcham’s values, actions to strengthen commercial and cultural ties between the US and Morocco. According to Amcham, “Miley has worked with Amcham and American firms in the past three years to further Morocco-US commercial ties.” Promising prospects While this year’s Amcham event was heavily focused on Miami, it came against the backdrop of increased US-Morocco connections. In addition to the security sector where Morocco is regarded as the US’s strongest North African ally, there have been steps in recent months to further commercial ties. In November, US and Moroccan representatives met to discuss collaboration on agro-science. The goal was to equip Morocco with new agricultural technology while allowing greater access to the Moroccan market for American products. The meeting was part of agreements to open the Moroccan market to American poultry and beef. Following the agreements, Robert Lighthizer, the US Trade Representative, noted, “The Trump Administration continues to prioritize the opening of new markets for U.S. agricultural products. This new access to the Moroccan market is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports.”

Rabat – Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi has denied that Morocco and Spain reached an agreement on irregular migrants. In Thursday’s press conference after the weekly government meeting, El Khalfi said that there is no agreement between Rabat and Madrid allowing Spain to return migrants rescued in the strait or in the Mediterranean to Moroccan ports. El Khalfi said that the “information is false.” El Khalfi’s denial comes after statements from Spanish Secretary of State for Security Ana Botella, who also refuted that the Spain and Morocco signed this agreement. The statement was a response to an article posted by Spanish outlet El Pais, which quoted three government sources who claimed there was an agreement, which was in line with the good diplomatic ties between the two countries. According to their sources, the measure would apply to migrants found in missions where Spanish rescue services are operating in maritime zones under Morocco’s security control. In response, Botella said that Salvamento Maritimo, a Spanish rescue operation, “will continue to transport migrants to Spanish ports.” She added that migrant rescue operations by Spain and Morocco in the strait and the Mediterranean are collaborative and in respect to the competences of each country.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The Ministry of Culture and Communication has announced the publication of a guide for the Rirha historical site in northern Morocco. The guide was published under the title “Rirha: Ancient and Medieval Site of Morocco” by Laurent Callegarin, Mohamed Kbiri Alaoui, Abdelfattah Ichkhakh, and Jean-Claude Roux. The site of Rirha, which, according to the guide, has been on the list of Moroccan cultural heritage pieces since 2001, sits on the right bank of the Oued Beht river located in the Gharb plain between Rabat and Fez. This site, which was first discovered in 1919, was excavated by Louis Chatelain but the results of the discovered artifacts were only published in a limited number of scientific magazines. Chatelain conveyed that the land was very likely a military site because it measures exactly 120,000 square meters. The Rirha site has four layers: The oldest layers date back to the fourth century B.C. and the first century B.C., before the Roman era. The other two layers were built during the Roman era, in the first century and third century A.D.   This publication is the result of a 2004 excavation by Ichkhakh and his colleagues, a scientific team of Moroccan and Algerian members and French and Spanish researchers.  It also highlights the importance of historical sites and archaeological research that have attracted the interest of many Moroccan and foreign scholars according to the ministry’s statement. The guide is the product of combined efforts by the scholars to uncover signs of early settlements in Morocco. Ichkhakh and his colleagues discovered historical artifacts, including markings that can be traced back to the Roman era. It is the result of a series of efforts made by the Ministry of Culture and Communication, under the supervision of the National Institute of Archeology and Heritage, along with the Department of Cooperation and Cultural Action of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   The ministry also appointed specialists of various nationalities and scientific fields, including earthen architecture, excavation, and restoration of painted and mosaic objects to preserve the historical site.

Rabat – Moroccan real estate actors will hold a Morocco Property Expo in Jeddah in October. Moroccan real estate developers, investors, administrations and banks will attend the real estate investment and lifestyle fair.

On an area of more than 3,000 square meters, the show will also bring together promoters of economic projects.

The show will feature spaces for Moroccan crafts and its “art of living” for Saudi investors to discover. The free three-day event starts on October 4.  Read also: Morocco, Main Export Market of Passenger Vehicles for Saudi Arabia The Moroccan community in Saudi Arabia is estimated at more than 50,000 people. The community is mainly made up of laborers, those in the liberal professions, spouses of Saudi nationals, and executives. For 89 percent of Moroccans living in Saudi Arabia, buying property in Morocco is “very important,” the show’s website says. Moroccans living overseas send home an estimated MAD 5 billion per year. In the fourth quarter of 2018, real estate transactions in Morocco jumped 12 percent from the third quarter of 2018. The central bank said real estate prices fell by 2.4 percent. Morocco and Saudi Arabia recently started several working meetings to discuss options for economic cooperation in Africa, in the midst of doubts about recent tensions between the two long-time allies.

Among individuals without degrees, 46 percent are employed or seeking employment. Of those with high school degrees, 43 percent are active, and of those with university degrees, 56 percent are active. Young people aged 15 to 34 are well-represented in the workforce at 38 percent of those employed.  The highest rates of employment compared to the overall working age population in the country by region are 64 percent in Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, 45 percent in Marrakech-Safi, and just under 45 percent in Casablanca-Settat.

Meanwhile, there are about 45,000 foreigners in Morocco. Twenty-three percent come from Arab countries, 37 percent from Europe, and 33 percent from sub-Saharan Africa.A majority of foreigners, 60 percent, are male. Foreigners also tend to be highly educated, with 84 percent holding degrees. A slightly higher percentage of foreigners in Morocco, 51 percent, are employed or seeking employment compared to Moroccans at 46 percent. However, the employment rate between foreigners and nationals is much closer: 44 percent among foreigners and 42 percent among nationals. According to one of the commission’s latest briefings, unemployment in the country dropped from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent between 2017 and 2018.  The Moroccan economy made slight progress from 2017 to 2018, creating 112,000 jobs, 91,000 in urban areas and 21,000 in rural areas, up from 86,000 new jobs in 2017. Across all sectors, the study details that the demographic of potential workers between the ages of 35 and 44 are more likely to be employed than those aged 15 and 24, an HCP 2018 report stated.

Rabat – The German police arrested a Moroccan couple allegedly involved in planning terrorist attacks on Thursday. The police also raided the homes of 12 suspects in southwest Frankfurt.

The suspects were planning an attack in Germany, the Frankfurt prosecutor, Nadja Niesen, told the Associated Press news agency. ”We are not aware of a specific target of attack,” she said.

Around 200 police officers stormed about 15 buildings and houses in the cities of Russelsheim, Raunheim, and Biebesheim in the Hessen region on Thursday morning.

The German police officers, according to Wormzer Zeitung, hoped to arrest 12 suspects. All of them were of German or Moroccan nationality and aged between 22 and 33 years. 

During the assault, money, knives, and documents were seized by the police. 
 The couple are accused of traveling with their two young children to Syria with forged passports in order to be trained to commit attacks, according to the Frankfurt prosecutor.    Last December, Moroccan intelligence intercepted suspicious phone calls between two individuals about a planned attack on the Stuttgart airport. The Moroccan intelligence community informed their German counterparts of their suspicions and the suspects’ names. In September, Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita warned of the threat that repatriated fighters and their families represent. Bourita called for “extreme and continued vigilance” to detect actions such as incitement of people to carry out terrorist attacks.

Rabat – India’s foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, who visited Morocco last weekend, has revealed that she had wanted to cancel the trip, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi persuaded her not to do so, according to the India Times.

Modi told Swaraj that the support of this predominantly Muslim country was essential in the fight against cross-border terrorism.

Swaraj expressed her intention to cancel the visit in the wake of a February 14 car bombing in India’s Kashmir province. Forty Indian police officers died as a result of the attack, the deadliest on India’s state security personnel in the border region of Kashmir since 1989.

“It’s my first visit to Morocco. When I tour I do happily, but I’ve come here with a heavy heart,” Swaraj told the Indian community in Rabat.

“When I said [I wanted to cancel my visit] to [Modi], he said something I would like to share,” she said.

“Morocco always stood with us against terrorism. It’s going to sign an agreement with us on counterterrorism. It’s fighting radicalisation. So, please go there,” Modi replied. Swaraj arrived in Morocco on February 16 for a two-day official visit as part of her four-day tour including Bulgaria and Spain.
 With her Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita, Swaraj signed four cooperation agreements.  One of the agreements established a working group on security cooperation and information sharing to curb ideology-drived violence. The foreign minister added that trade between India and Morocco stood at $1.5 billion from January to October 2018. In 2017, phosphoric acid was Morocco’s top export to India at 68 percent, while Indian exports to Morocco are more diversified.  India’s refined oil, cotton yarn, and filament yarn make up the three top Indian exports to Morocco at 8, 6, and 5 percent, respectively, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Morocco and India have exchanged 20 ministerial-level visits in the past two years. The two countries have signed 40 agreements on air service, tourism, social programs, mining and geology, and information technology.

Rabat – “Distress Ghanaian Citizen Needs Help Now,” read the subject of an email that a Ghanaian citizen, who identified himself as Joseph Kwesi Mbir, sent to Morocco World News today. In the email, Mbir explained that authorities at the Mohammed V Airport refused to issue him a visa despite having all the documents required to have a visa upon entry. According to the documents attached to his email, Mbir is a technology savvy and “creative entrepreneur” with 15 years of experience in the field of media and security. Given his interest in the intersection between security and technology, he had requested to be invited to participate in the African Security Exhibition and Conference (Asec Expo). His request was granted, and Asec sent him an invitation letter as well as other accompanying documents. Upon reaching Casablanca, however, he was told that authorities had received no confirmation about his participation in the Asec Expo. He wrote in the email, addressing the Ghanaian embassy: “I traveled from Ghana to morocco on 20th February 2019 on an invitation to attend Asec Expo and African security conference going in Morocco now at Rabat. “I was given a visitor Invitation Letter to the expo and the conference and letter got visa confirmation letter issued by the minister of foreign affairs in morocco by the promise from the organizers that I will be given visa on arrival which has approved by the foreign affairs ministry in Morocco.” Mbir reached Morocco yesterday, February 20, at around 10 am. He showed his documents to the authorities at the airport, in addition to his certifications as an entrepreneur in the security industry. The immigration officers, however, “said they don’t have confirmation of my details in there [sic] system so therefore I can’t be granted entry due to that I have been confined in a room at the airport from morning till now.” In his plea to the Ghanaian embassy, Mbir stressed that he only traveled to Morocco to attend the conference and has no intention to stay in the country after the conference. He requested that the embassy “kindly come as soon as possible to help me resolve this and leave this airport because my health is at stake due to the area am now.” No grave mistreatment But Mbir insisted that the airport’s immigration authorities did not in any way “mishandle” him. He said he was “just” left in a room where he could not stay any longer because of health concerns. “I have not been mishandled by any officer but the environment I have been put is not good for my health and other factors. As I write I can’t communicate with my family at home because my access is limited because I have no credits on the local line I bought to make calls and can’t go out and get some, I have money but can’t access anything because i have been confined.” By the time Morocco World News received Mbir’s email, it was understood that he was still confined at the airport and his situation had not changed. The Ghanaian embassy had not responded to his cry for help.
Morocco World News subsequently contacted the organizers of the African Security Conference for their version of events. According to the Asec organizing committee, Mbir was not their only “participants” to have been given a hard time at the Mohammed V Airport. Some two or three other participants “experienced the same thing,” only to be later allowed entry after the committee confirmed their “participant status.” But what is particular about Mbir’s case? Why were others later allowed to attend the conference while he is still in a waiting room at the airport, with no freedom of movement and limited access to means of communication? “At this stage, we do not have the final say. The airport’s authorities are the ones that can decide, based on their own criteria, to accord or not to accord entry to a person. We did our best by providing all our participants and guests with all the necessary papers to get a visa,” the head of the organizing committee told Morocco World News. When told that Mbir was in need of help and had tried to reach his embassy, she added, sounding apologetic, “I think we also received an email like that, but I’m really sorry that we can’t do anything at this stage. I’m especially sorry because this [the African Security Conference] is supposed to be an event that promotes greater intra-African cooperation. So, of course, we would like to have as many African representatives as possible. But I’m sure the immigration officers have their own reasons for denying him entry.” Morocco World News reached out to the Ghanaian embassy to know whether they had received Mbir’s email and what was being done to resolve his situation. But the embassy was unreachable after numerous attempted calls. Neither did they call back. In recent years, Morocco has doubled security regarding entry to the Moroccan territory. The goal has been to curb the number of sub-Saharan migrants using Morocco as a transit country to reach the EU. In an unprecedented move last summer, Rabat ended a visa-free agreement with three African countries, namely Guinea, Mali, and the Republic of Congo. Citizens from those three countries now need an e-visa to enter Morocco. And while Mbir has not complained about being othered or mistreated by Moroccan immigration officers, complaints of differential and prejudiced treatment of African (black) travelers are no news for airports regulars. The Asec Expo started yesterday and ends today at 7 p.m., Moroccan time.
Meanwhile, Mbir, who did not get to participate in the event, will only leave his confinement tomorrow night. “But they said is [sic] only tomorrow night that they can get return flight for me to go back to Ghana,” he wrote in the email.

Rabat – Moroccan international football player Hachim Mastour, who currently plays for Greek club PAS Lamia, went missing several weeks ago. International news outlets stated that the 20-year-old player had not shown up for the club’s training sessions since the end of the winter transfer season, which takes place the whole month of January. The attacking midfielder runs the risk of possibly being prosecuted for an unjustified absence. The club also confirmed the disappearance of the player, whose contract runs until 2021, adding that the case is now in the hands of the club’s lawyer. PAS Lamia has also sent a message to FIFA to report on Mastour’s case. Despite being reportedly missing, some news outlets reported that Mastour remains very active on social networks. However, Mastour’s last post on Instagram was on February 2. Last summer, Mastour joined PAS Lamia after the end of his contract with AC Milan.

Rabat – The founder and president of the Peruvian Council of Friendship with the Sahrawi People, Ricardo Sanchez Cerra, has written an opinion piece on the Western Sahara conflict calling on Polisario to accept Morocco’s autonomy plan for the region. Referencing the plan which Morocco proposed to the UN in 2007, Serra titled his article “Western Sahara: Why Not the Autonomy?” “I have published a book and dozens of articles in Peruvian and international media about this cause. All this gives me today the moral authority, the right and the duty to be honest with my Polisario friends,” he said. The scholar then acknowledged that he and other supporters of Polisario were backing Polisario’s claim of independence. “But the international reality makes that goal illusory.” The Peruvian activists also recalled that the Security Council adopted a resolution that called for a “just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution,” and described Morocco’s autonomy plan as a “serious, credible and realistic” solution to the conflict. Serra noted US support for the autonomy plan, which said it “represents a potential approach to satisfy the aspirations of the populations of the Sahara.” Under King Mohammed VI’s leadership, the Moroccan government has been mobilizing its diplomatic efforts to emphasize its assets and principles on the conflict. Serra acknowledged that Morocco “has evolved its position on the conflict, moving from total integration [with the rest of Morocco] to broad political autonomy with international guarantees.” He added that Polisario, however, is still reluctant to drop its independence claims. But its requests is “considered by many influential countries as anachronistic and a leap into the void.” The analyst also commended Morocco’s policy, emphasizing that it is a “mature and modern state, with tremendous development potential.” “And in these circumstances, its autonomy plan is valid.” The analyst also criticized the circumstances under which Sahrawis live in the Tindouf camps. “It is nearly 44 years that a part of the Sahrawi population lives in these arid deserts, assisted by international cooperation without prospects for the future and with less food support.” The expert also commented on the positive positions of the US, the EU, and the AU towards Morocco’s cause. “The European Union renewed the fisheries and agriculture agreements with Morocco including the territory of the Sahara, the United States has just extended for the fifth consecutive year trade relations and cooperation with Morocco to the Sahara region, the African Union decided to refrain from intervening in the Security Council in the Western Sahara council,” said the expert. He then went on to add that “these achievements in favor of Morocco are compelling.” Peru supports Morocco’s autonomy plan. In October 2017, 21 members of the Peruvian Parliament expressed their support for Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara.

Rabat – Morocco is becoming a hub for a partnership between Morocco, China, and other African countries, said Minister of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development Aziz Rabbah on Wednesday in Rabat.

Rabbah spoke to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) at the 20th Mines-Rabat Enterprises Forum, the theme of which is “Morocco: A promoter of Chinese-African partnership.”

Morocco can act as a link between China and the rest of Africa thanks to major reforms and partnerships under Morocco’s Africa policy, he stressed.

Because of Morocco’s successful model, which has yielded some positive results on both the African and international levels, Morocco could stand as a strategic hub for trade and investment between Africa and China, Rabbah asserted.

The forum, as indicated by the director of the Rabat Mines School (ENSMR), Mustapha Ouadghiri, is an annual meeting that allows students, teachers, and private and public bodies to debate key issues concerning the integration of the school’s engineers into Morocco’s economic and social development process.

According to the president of the forum, Oussama Amaani, the aim of the forum is to reduce the gap between students and the professional world to facilitate their contact with participating companies.

In early 2017, the Moroccan mining company Managem, after 10 years of successful exploration efforts in Congo, sold a 61 percent stake of Lamikal, of which it owned 81 percent, to Beijing-based Wanbao. Later that year, representatives of Beijing and Rabat established a joint Morocco-China business council to oversee and implement the Morocco-China trade agreement.

Rabat – Another representative of the self-declared interim president of Venezuela Juan Guaido has emphasized the need to restore Venezuela’s diplomatic ties with Morocco. The diplomatic representative, Carlos Scull, said that Guaido and his government “want to establish cooperative relations with Morocco.” In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Scull, who is representing Guaido in Peru, spoke with Morocco’s Ambassador to Peru Youssef Balla. The Venezuelan diplomat noted Guaido’s appreciation of Morocco’s position, saying Morocco was the “first African country to support the government of President Juan Guaido.” Morocco has only vaguely intimated that it supports Guaido. After the government of Guaido expressed hope to restore diplomatic ties with Morocco, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita held a phone conversation with Guaido. During the conversation, Bourita informed Guaido that Morocco backs all the actions Guaido “is taking for the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people for democracy and change.” Scull described Morocco’s support as important, emphasizing that Nicolas Maduro’s regime “had affected the Venezuelan people and seriously damaged” the country’s international diplomatic ties. “This regime has maintained poor relationships with several democratic countries,” he added. Scull emphasized that Venezuela hosts the “largest Moroccan community in Latin America.” He added that both Venezuela under Guaido and Morocco “maintain strong relations of friendship.” More than 50 countries have recognized Guaido as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela since he made his declaration last month.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – There is mounting tension between Lahcen Daoudi, Morocco’s minister of public affairs and governance, and Driss Guerraoui, the Competition Council president.  Following a conference held by the council on February 14, Driss Guerraoui expressed surprise over Lahcen Daoudi’s refusal to provide him with the government’s study on regulating oil prices. Daoudi stated that it is not the responsibility of government institutions to hold MPs accountable. The role of these bodies, he said, is to consult but not to evaluate.  Daoudi has reportedly caused the tension with Guerraoui by claiming the report is confidential. Another cause of the tension was Daoudi’s refusal to attend an ad hoc meeting requested by Guerraoui to discuss with Lahcen Daoudi the legality of price capping, after Daoudi had consulted with the General Secretariat.  Guerraoui said in a press interview that the government’s decision was illegal. He said it does not comply with the requirements of Article 4 of the Law on Freedom of Price and Competition. Under the law, the administration may “take temporary measures against excessive price increases or decreases caused by exceptional, catastrophic or manifestly unusual market conditions in a sector after consulting the Competition Council.” Legally, the government could only cap oil prices for a six-month period, and only a one-time extension is allowed. Guerraoui claimed he received only one document containing fuel company revenues from the liberalization of fuel prices in 2015 to 2018. He said he wants to know “the basis on which the government made the decision.” He argued that the document was insufficient and that it is legally imperative that all administrations and institutions provide all documents requested by council. In a an interview with Moroccan outlet Al3omk, Guerraoui stated that he considers the measures “insufficient and inefficient” economically, competitively, and for social equality. He added that the same decision to cap prices, effective December 2014 through December 2015, proved unsuccessful. Daoudi said Morocco would begin regulating fuel prices “between the end of February and mid-March.”

Rabat – The famous clothing brand Zara took Moroccan style as a reference for its new spring-summer 2019 collection. The Spanish ready-made giant Zara, under the direction of Fabien Baron, unveiled its spring-summer 2019 women’s collection, inspired by the bohemian spirit of North Africa, especially Morocco. According to the marketing manager of Zara, Steven Meisel, Morocco inspired the company with the typical colors of the dunes, sunsets, and desert of the country. The collection features models Lexi Boling, Amanda Murphy, Anyelina Rosa, Veronika Kunz, and Vittoria Ceretti on powerful and poetic performances in natural tones. Beige is set to be the key color of the collection, mingled with various derivatives of red. Talking to the press, Steven Meisel said that “the brand offers a journey through time and space through this collection that highlights the peace of the Moroccan desert.” Turbans, leather sandals, slippers, large earrings, and golden belts are the accessories of this collection. “This collection reminds us of the warmth and tranquility of summer,” added Meisel. It is not the first time Morocco has inspired the brand. For its spring-summer 2018 collection, Marrakech was Zara’s source of inspiration. Zara offered a series of caftan and babouche dresses reminiscent of Moroccan traditions. Several names in international fashion have drawn their inspiration in Morocco, especially from Marrakech and Chefchaouen, the blue pearl.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement that it ordered the Casablanca Prefectural Police to investigate following a media report about an underage Moroccan worker who suffered torture at the hands of the minor’s employer in Casablanca. The DGSN stated that it immediately reacted to the reporting of the incident and judged that the police officer in charge of the case did not abide by the Penal Code criminalizing the torture. The DGSN will conduct medical tests on the minor and start the legal procedures against all those involved in the case. According to Articles 231-1 and 231-3 of the Moroccan Penal Code, “any act of torture or intentional causing of pain or acute physical or mental suffering to a person by a public officer for the purpose of intimidating, pressuring him/her” is punishable by imprisonment from 10 to 20 years and a fine of MAD 20,000 to 50,000. The region of Casablanca-Settat has the highest rate of child labor, employing 25 percent of children who work across the country according to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) report in 2018 on World Day Against Child Labour. About 38,000 of the 4,026,000 children populated in cities are employed across Morocco.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Railway Office (ONCF) has issued a call for bids to develop, market, and manage a new shopping mall beside the Rabat-Agdal train station. ONCF is inviting companies to submit their applications before March 15. The shopping center would be one part of an urban development project covering an area of 26,000-square meters. The development would also include hotels, offices, a business center residential complexes, and mixed-use complexes. ONCF plans to equip its mall with a supermarket, restaurants, fast food establishments, leisure and service stores, home appliance decoration stores, apparel and shoe shops, and sports-related shops. ONCF spent MAD 800 million building a new train station at Rabat-Agdal that was completed late in 2018. King Mohammed VI inaugurated the station in conjunction with the launch of the high speed train (LGV), or “Al Boraq,” that connects Casablanca to Tangier and makes a stop at Rabat-Agdal. The government has improved infrastructure around the Rabat-Agdal station by paving and expanding roads. The government also changed the street lights, improved sidewalks, put in traffic signs, and added pedestrian crosswalks. ONCF hopes the new shopping center will employ people in the local workforce serve as an entertainment center for locals in the Agdal neighborhood.

Rabat – The Moroccan Exporters Association (ASMEX) recently met US Department of Commerce Foreign Commercial Service Officer Nathalie Scharf in Casablanca.

The meeting discussed possible future collaborations from a shared profitability perspective, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

“The free trade agreement between Morocco and the US has not been beneficial to Moroccan exporters, given the size of the US market and the complex procedures yet unfamiliar to Moroccan companies,” said ASMEX President Hassan Sentissi El Idrissi, quoted in the statement.

“This agreement should be reviewed in such a way as to consider the reality of Moroccan [small and medium-sized enterprises],” he added.
 Scharf drew attention to the opportunities that the US now offers to Moroccan investors and exporters.

She invited Moroccan exporters to join the Select USA Investment Summit in June 2019, an event that will host high-level participants to help establish business relationships and develop economic activities.

Both sides proposed ideas to boost Moroccan exports to the US market. One option involves setting up a program to support and refer Moroccan exporters to major US clients.

The two parties also jointly proposed signing a tripartite memorandum of understanding between ASMEX, the Moroccan Investment and Export Development Agency (AMDIE), and the US diplomatic representation for the Select USA program.
 The memorandum would mainly focus on supporting major Moroccan groups whose strategy is to do business in the US and throughout North and South America.

The mission would involve organizing seminars to assist American investors in Africa and carrying out Moroccan-American economic missions to Africa, concluded the statement.

Earlier this month, Morocco and the US held the first session of the Africa working group under the Morocco-US Strategic Dialogue on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. Morocco is the first African country to hold such a meeting with the US. However, questions surrounding fair trade prompted Moroccan exporters to call for a review of the Morocco-US free trade agreement, signed in 2004.  Last month, US President Donald Trump commented on Morocco opening its market to US poultry imports in August 2018. Morocco also agreed to allow imports of US beef in December.

Rabat – Spanish Secretary of State for Security Ana Botella refuted a story that the Spanish government and Morocco reached an agreement to return rescued migrants to Morocco. The official said in a program “Hoy por hoy” aired by Spanish radio Cadena Ser that the only agreement reached with Morocco was to improve authorities’ rescue capabilities. She added that the Spanish Salvamento Maritimo “will continue to transport migrants to Spanish ports.” The statement came to deny a report by Spanish news outlet El Pais, saying that the two countries would allow Spain to return migrants to Moroccan ports. According to sources from the Spanish government, the measure would apply to migrants found in missions where Spanish rescue services are helping Moroccan authorities in maritime zones under Morocco’s security control. The measure, added the source, was within the framework of good diplomatic ties with Morocco. Last year, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that Morocco would never house any migration centers for Europe. Bourita  said that “migration is not a security issue, it is a question of human security.” The official also emphasized that Morocco is no one’s policeman, implying that the migration issue is a shared responsibility.  In recent years, Morocco has been determined to emphasize its commitment to migration issues in Africa and across the world. The North African country also implemented programs to regularize the status of some sub-Saharan migrants and refugees to allow them to benefit from Moroccan healthcare and education. So far, Morocco has regularized more than 50,000 irregular migrants through two campaigns. Ninety-five percent of those regularized were nationals of other African countries and 18,819 were women, Bourita announced in October 2018.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) will consider adding Morocco’s Gnawa music to its ICH list at its 14th session December 9-14, in Bogota. The ICH list seeks to enhance visibility for the traditions of communities without recognizing standards of excellence or exclusivity.  Mustapha Nami, a Moroccan senior curator of historical monuments, submitted a file nominating Gnawa music to the ICH Service in September 2018. Others had attempted to nominate Gnawa art previously.  Neila Tazi, the head organizer of the Gnawa and World Music Festival, made a first attempt, but she announced that, “the file is quite complex to build and we now wait on our Ministry of Culture and our delegation to UNESCO to help us make it.”  Tazi blamed the Ministry of Culture in a Facebook post for “lack of interest on the part of senior Moroccan officials and administration” that she said diminished the importance of preserving Gnawa art. Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj refuted the claim, saying, “The Ministry of Culture has started the procedure (2014) and respected all the steps.” Tazi stated further, “If we had not done this [Gnawa] festival and persevered against many obstacles … maybe the Gnawa culture would have disappeared.” Gnawa music infuses poetry and traditional music along with dancing. According to Rene Basset, the word “gnawi” means “black man.” The art has West African roots and began as the music of slaves who were brought to Morocco. The West Africans brought with them the music that later evolved into what is known as Moroccan Gnawa today.   After Tazi’s initial attempt, Ahmed Skounti, a Moroccan social anthropologist who helped draft UNESCO’s 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, announced, “The file of Gnawa music will be presented to UNESCO in 2019.”  If Gnawa music is added to the list of ICH, Morocco would have eight pieces of heritage on the list. Morocco has seven other cultural places and traditions on the ICH list: the Moussem of Tan-Tan tribal gathering, Marrakech’s Jamaa el-Fna Square, the cherry festival in Sefrou, the Mediterranean diet, argan practices and argan tree know-how, falconry as a living human heritage, and the taskiwin martial dance of the western High Atlas. Adding Gnawa music to the ICH list for safeguarding would highlight this heritage as a symbol of ethnic and cultural diversity in Morocco.

Rabat – Spain and Morocco have agreed on a deal to control migration pressures. According to Spanish news outlet El Pais, both countries reached an agreement that will allow Spanish authorities to return some rescued migrants to Moroccan ports instead of Spanish ones. The news outlet quoted three sources from Sanchez’s government, who announced that the measure will “apply to migrants found in missions where Spanish rescue services” are helping the Moroccan authorities in maritime zones under Morocco’s security control. A Spanish government source told El Pais that the measure is in line with the “good relations” between the two countries. Traditionally, Spanish authorities land rescued migrants in Spanish ports if found in the Strait Gibraltar or the westernmost part of the Mediterranean Sea. The decision follows promises and negotiations between both countries to cooperate in order to curb migration. Spain also represented the voice of Morocco at the European Union and the European Parliament, urging the EU commission to grant more financial aid to Morocco for migration controls. During the Spanish royal visit to Morocco last week, Spain touted the strong diplomatic cooperation between both countries in all areas, especially migration. In 2018, more than 57,000 migrants arrived in Spain through the western Mediterranean route. Moroccan migrants represent the largest number who crossed the route at 31 percent. Guineans represent 20 percent of the number, while 16 percent of the migrants were from Mali. Under pressure, the Moroccan government asked for more financial aid to modernize its border control equipment. In response to the Moroccan request, the European Commission announced on December 14, 2018, that it would give Morocco a fund of  €148 million. “The EU is intensifying its support to Morocco to address irregular migration in response to increased migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean Route,” the commission said.

Rabat – On the night of Saturday, February 16, two Moroccan men aged 24 and 26 held a wedding ceremony in a remote resort in the ochre city, Marrakech, until the Royal Gendarmerie interrupted. The wedding, attended by Middle Eastern businessmen and other LGBTQ Moroccans, took place in a luxurious tourist complex in Saada, a rural town near Marrakech.  The wedding organizers reportedly asked guests to switch off their phones during the ceremony to avoid the leaking of photos or videos of the wedding. The organizers then suspected that the Royal Gendarmerie had surrounded the resort and informed the wedding guests who began to flee and hide in a nearby forest.  The gendarmerie, with the help of some local residents who had reported the wedding, chased and arrested eight guests. Others managed to escape the scene by car. Same-sex marriage is illegal under Article 489 of the Moroccan Penal Code, which criminalizes “lewd or unnatural acts with an individual of the same sex.” It is punishable by 6 months to 3 years’ imprisonment and a fine of MAD 120 to 1,200. Although same-sex marriage is legal in several parts of the world, including the US, Australia, and Canada, merely being a member of the LGBTQ community in Morocco and other generally conservative societies is largely rejected.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Lahcen Daoudi, Morocco’s minister of public affairs and governance, says he “cannot let oil companies do as they please” with oil prices and pointed to the degree to which Moroccans have suffered as a result of spiking oil prices. “In no way can we leave oil companies to their own devices,” Daoudi said in a statement. “Some of these companies, which set their profit margin at 2 dirhams in the past may increase it to 3 dirhams in the future,” Daoudi said. In a press release, Daouri stated that a meeting Tuesday evening, February 19, with the Moroccan Petroleum Group (GPM), “had initially faced some obstacles.”  However, he said oil company representatives agreed that “oil capping is a reasonable measure under the current circumstances.”
 He also declared that the government is ready to put capping measures into effect, provided that all parties come to a mutual understanding. He stressed that “this mutual agreement will ensure that the margin of profits of oil companies will not rise once a six-month period is over.” Daoudi asserted that “the picture will become clearer” after another meeting with oil companies. Despite the warning of Driss Guerraoui, the Competition Council president, that a government decision to cap fuel prices would be unnecessary and would harm industry stakeholders, Daoudi stated in previous interviews that the government “will cap prices irrespective of the position of the Competition Council.” In negotiations with Moroccan Petroleum Group, Daoudi said he is trying to build a long-lasting agreement with oil companies to regulate oil prices regardless of the rise and fall of prices on the global market. Morocco liberalized fuel prices on December 1, 2015, a move that caused great dissatisfaction, according to Arab Weekly. According to Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD) MP Omar Balafrej, the oil companies’ revenues from 2015 to 2018, which he estimated at MAD 17 billion, were “unethical and unreasonable.” Balafrej called on the government to recover those profits to invest them in providing free “public transportations for students or in building community schools.” “I found it strange that none of the MPs or heads of parties have raised the issue of retrieving the 17 billion dirhams,” he said. “It’s not a ‘trivial’ amount.” Abdellah Bounau, an MP of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), who chaired a committee of inquiry to investigate oil prices last year, stated that the profits of some companies tripled since oil price liberalization.  “Their profits went from 300 million dirhams to 900 million dirhams between 2015 and 2016 thanks to the liberalization of fuel prices,” he said. The rising prices from the globally low prices in 2015 have impacted the purchasing power of the Moroccans.

Rabat – The Ministry of Industry and Trade announced on Wednesday that since January 23, it has taken “exceptional measures” to sample diaper imports and conduct analyses on them at laboratories. Local brands are also undergoing examinations for their quality and conformity to the standards of the local market to ensure that none contain toxic substances. A study by the French environment agency ANSES launched in January found out that some diapers in the country contained substances like weed-killer, glyphosate, and a compound called butylphenyl methylpropional used in perfumes and cosmetics, also known as lial. The French government had given manufacturers 15 days to remove the toxic substances from the diapers. Morocco’s trade ministry has been in charge of strict monitoring of baby diapers since 2004. In 2018, the ministry carried out 224 control operations on diapers in the local market and 479 import control operations and detected only one defective sample, said the ministry.

Rabat – A collaboration of researchers from Spain, Switzerland, and France have determined that a group of bats, which were once thought to be the same as the known species Myotis escalerai, are instead an entirely new bat species, the Myotis crypticus or cryptic myotis.  After a genetic analysis published by “Acta Chiropterologica,” scientists were able to conclude that the two kinds of bats have significantly different genes.  While the bat species share many of the same physical characteristics, the genetic analysis proved what superficial observation alone could not determine. #EBDpub A new species of bat was hiding in our forests // Una especie nueva de murciélago se escondía en nuestros bosqueshttps://t.co/xKxHA2dErs pic.twitter.com/Dn0f2xbQf8 — E.B. Doñana-CSIC (@ebdonana) February 19, 2019   The study describes the bats to share similar habitats in the forests of the northern mountains of Morocco. However, the habitat of the new species, Myotis crypticus, extends into Spain, the south of France, Italy, and Switzerland. According to Javier Juste, a scientist at the Donana Biological Station in southern Spain, “Given that the new species lives in forests in Italy, Switzerland, France, and Spain, which are under human development, it is urgent to study the species with detail to determine its protected status. While completing the same research, the scientists also discovered another new North African bat species, the Myotis zenatius or zenati myotis. The second species is estimated to be at a more critical level of endangerment. Zenati myotis are extremely rare, probably vulnerable, and only found in certain caves in the mountains of Morocco and Algeria, most notably Azrou and Errachidia. 🦇Un estudio liderado por @ebdonana identifica dos nuevas especies de murciélago: el murciélago ratonero críptico (en Europa) y el murciélago zenate (norte de África).

The effects of the disruption of their natural habitat remains unknown. However, just having been discovered, this species may be included on the endangered list. The two new bat species are of the family of Vespertilionidae and had “gone unnoticed until now,” since they “are represented by 53 species in Europe, but many of them are enormously similar,” Juste said in a statement.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – The World Bank Group set up a Country Framework Partnership for 2019-2024 with Morocco yesterday to help guide the bank’s financial and technical assistance programs in Morocco. The partnership aims to support Morocco’s ambitions in the global economy to promote prosperity for its population, the World Bank stated. In accordance with the partnership, the World Bank board endorsed another $700 million project in Morocco in 2018, called Development Policy Financing. Building upon the Government’s five-year Program 2017-2021, reinforced by the National Financial Inclusion Strategy and the national strategy to drive digital transformation (Plan Maroc Numérique), the project aims to accelerate the development of digital technology, allowing the kingdom to improve its services, growth, and employment as well as assist in transforming the economy, not only in North Africa but in Africa at large. Marie Francoise Marie-Nelly, the World Bank Maghreb country director, said that Morocco has been making strides both economically and socially. She noted that the progress has helped raise the aspirations of Moroccans, especially the youth.  “The Kingdom is at a turning point in its history and has a unique window of opportunity to create high and inclusive growth, taking advantage of positive trends in Moroccan society, including urbanization and the demographic transition,” the World Bank stated. It continued to say Morocco’s plans are “ambitious.” The World Bank said that Morocco has tremendous potential and that they “will receive full support from the World Bank Group” to ensure that Morocco has the necessary skills to boost its economy.  To achieve this, the World Bank will have to harness “the potential of new technologies to promote entrepreneurship, productivity, and e-government platforms to boost growth and innovation.” According to the Doing Business Index 2018, Morocco ranked 60th in the world for ease of doing business, making it the second best country in the MENA region for business after the UAE.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Real Estate Price Index (IPAI) in Morocco fell by 0.4 percent, according to data released by Bank Al-Maghrib and the National Agency of Conservation, Land Land Records, and Cartography (ANCFCC). The fall in IPAI allowed transactions to increase by 12 percent from the third quarter of 2018.  The IPAI is a statistical tool used to measure the relative change in real estate prices over time. Within the calculation, the data takes into account residential, commercial, and agricultural real estate purchases. The data from the central bank demonstrated a fall in real estate prices by 2.4 percent as well as a 1.2 percent price drop in assets for professional use. The price decrease of assets for professional use is attributed to the decline in the prices of commercial land by 0.5 percent and offices by 3.3 percent. In turn, transactions in the category grew by 18 percent, with a 17 percent increase in sales of commercial land and 31 percent in offices. At the same time, residential prices rose by 0.8 percent. The prices of apartments increased by 0.6 percent, houses by 0.8 percent, and villas by 5.9 percent. Despite higher prices, the number of transactions increased in each category as well by 15 percent, 31 percent, and 40 percent, respectively. Quarter on quarter in 2018, the IPAI rose by around 0.3 percent, in turn causing the amount of transactions to increase by 11 percent. However, in the fourth quarter, the IPAI fell by 0.4 percent. Over the year, within cities, residential prices increased by 0.7 percent and agricultural land prices rose by 2.9 percent. However, the prices of land within the commercial sector fell by 17.4 percent. In Casablanca, residential prices fell by 0.4 percent and land prices fell by 3.2 percent. There was an increase in prices of commercial assets by 6.2 percent, and overall, sales grew by 7.4 percent. In Tangier, prices increased by 0.8 percent for residential real estate, 0.9 percent for agricultural land, and 3.4 percent for commercial land use. Attributed to an increase in apartment transactions, sales increased by 8.5 percent. In Marrakech, prices increased by 1.1 percent for residential assets and declined by 0.5 and 2.0 percent, respectively, for agricultural land and commercial land. Correlating with an increase in land sales, transactions in the region increased by 19 percent over 2018.

By Ahlam Ben Saga and Amal El Attaq Rabat – When protesting contractual teachers started to approach the Royal Palace of Rabat, the King’s official residence, today, security forces used water cannons to disperse them.   Members of the Moroccan auxiliary forces also manhandled the protesters to prevent them from reaching the palace and the headquarters of the Ministry of Education, leaving a few protestors with injuries. Chanting slogans such as “Death or Humiliation” and carrying banners such as “I’m a Teacher, I earn 400€ a month,” hundreds of teachers rallied near Bab Rouah, several hundred meters from Parliament in the capital city. They renewed their calls to be integrated into the public sector of employment that they say have “fallen on deaf ears.” Wearing orange jumpsuits, teachers receiving the government’s ninth pay grade were on their third day of protesting. The protesters, who call themselves “teachers of jail cell number 9,” also stated that the ninth pay grade is “a shame.” The march, organized by the Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers (CNPCC) “forced into contractual teaching,” rose against the signing of a contract extension for contractual teachers hired in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The teachers chanted slogans calling for “their right to be promoted to the tenth pay grade” and “exceptional promotion with financial reimbursements backdated to 2013 unconditionally.” The protesting teachers are accusing the government of “discriminating between teachers” in Morocco through the contracts. Contractual teachers do not benefit from rights granted by an employment law to permanent teachers. Contractual teachers also do not have healthcare coverage and a pension fund. Their salaries come from the educational academies with whom they are contracted for a certain period of time. Teachers came to Rabat from various cities in Morocco—Tenghir, Azilal, Taroudant, Agadir, Tiznit, and Chishawah—to participate in the march. The protest started on Monday, February 18, and is scheduled to last until the end of the week. Morocco has experienced a continual series of protests recently.  Several trade unions in Rabat are leading a separate protest today, which marks the eighth anniversary of the 20 February Movement, to denounce the government’s “disregard” for their needs, “poor” social dialogue negotiations, problems in education and healthcare, and the deterioration of workers’ situation. The 20 February movement that began in spring 2011 and continued until spring 2012, witnessed the participation of thousands of Moroccans in different cities, but mainly in Rabat, demanding a new constitution; an end to corruption; a change in government; and better housing, employment, and living conditions.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – The Ministry of Health has launched its first official survey of hepatitis prevalence in Morocco to assess its extent. Currently, there are no figures for the seroprevalence of viral hepatitis in Morocco. The survey is being conducted February through April by the health ministry, in collaboration with the WHO, UNICEF, and local authorities. Its main objective is to provide data on hepatitis among the Moroccan population aged 5 years and older. The survey will cover 13,500 participants belonging to 4,575 households, distributed in all regions of the kingdom. During the survey, a 17-member team from the Ministry of Health will collect data through blood tests. The investigators will also seek information through a questionnaire on the knowledge of the population and their lifestyle habits that could put them at risk to transmit hepatitis. Most people with the virus, whether hepatitis B or C, are unaware of their chronic infection. They are, however, at high risk of developing a serious liver complication like cirrhosis and liver cancer and may unknowingly transmit the infection to others. Hepatitis, which can lead to liver failure, is a global public health problem. The various strains of hepatitis are referred to by their types, A, B, C, D, and E.  While Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by the ingestion of contaminated food or water, Hepatitis B, C, and D usually occur as a result of contact with infected body fluids. At the end of the survey, the health ministry will release the results of the samples to the participants and provide support for those diagnosed positive.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Justice Mohamed Aujjar expressed the Moroccan government’s surprise over a report issued by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention about Moroccan journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, convicted of sexual assault. The UN report called for the journalist’s immediate release. Bouachrine was convicted of human trafficking, rape with violence, and sexual assault on November 18, 2018. The report also called on the government to compensate Bouachrine and to give him a guarantee not to repeat the trial. In response, Aujjar said on Wednesday that the government took note “with great surprise.” The official added that the “government’s astonishment stems from our strong belief in the importance of the United Nations’ human rights mechanisms and the importance of cooperation with them.” According to Aujjar, the government provided the working group with details on the case of Bouachrine. But despite the “positive interaction” that Morocco provided, the government was surprised by the group’s opinion “without giving us the opportunity to provide data on the supplementary observations, while the mechanisms of the working group profile the possibility of requesting additional clarifications.” He commented that the government was surprised because Morocco abolished arbitrary detention in the 1990s. The 2011 Constitution criminalized arbitrary detention. The report, according to the government, does not reflect Morocco’s continued efforts to promote human rights and its determination to ensure an independent judiciary. The minister echoed a statement made by the legal adviser of the Moroccan mission at the UN, emphasizing that the group has already issued similar reports against a number of countries, including “democratic countries, such as France, Spain, Australia, and others.” On Monday, the legal adviser said that the findings of the group were not backed by solid evidence and sometimes relied on details to incite public opinion against governments. Moroccan officials, according to the adviser, further criticized the working group, saying it “intervenes even in cases that are still before courts.” Bouachrine, who founded the Akhbar Al Youm newspaper and was well-known for his critical reporting on senior government officials, was arrested in February 2018 after a group of female employees filed complaints against him for rape and assault..

Rabat – The Spanish Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Luis Planas has again expressed his satisfaction with Moroccan-Spanish diplomatic ties. On Tuesday, Planas spoke about the Spanish royal visit to Morocco last week, emphasizing that King Mohammed VI’s invitation “testifies to the friendship, mutual trust and good relations between the two kingdoms.” The official attended a high-level conference at the 5th Halieutis Show in Agadir. The Spanish minister said that the signing of 11 cooperation conventions during the royal visit was a “huge success.” Planas added that the fisheries agreement between Morocco and the EU is a good example of the close relationship. Spain strongly voiced its support for the adoption of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement. In January, the European Parliament adopted the fisheries agreement. The Parliament also adopted the agriculture agreement. Planas described the adoption of the agriculture agreement as a “very important” action that is a “green light for the marketing of agricultural products.” He had also urged European MPs to adopt the fisheries agreement, allowing Spanish vessels to fish in Moroccan waters, before summer.

Rabat – Juan Guaido, who has declared himself the interim president of Venezuela, addressed a message to the Arab world, especially Morocco, in a recent interview with Emirati television channel Al Ghad. “We thank the Arab world, and Morocco especially, for its supporting position for us,” he said. Guaido also thanked Great Britain for its unconditional support. After Guaido announced he would restore diplomatic ties with Morocco, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita responded to the opposition leader’s request for support. Bourita spoke with Guaido by telephone, informing him that Morocco backs all the actions Guaido is taking for the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people for democracy and change. Prior to the phone call, the foreign affairs advisor of the Venezuelan assembly, Manuel Avendano, expressed Guaido’s determination to re-establish diplomatic relations with Morocco. Following the phone call, Avendano said that Venezuela will “reconsider its recognition of the Sahrawi Republic” under Juan Guaido. He added that Venezuela recognizing the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) was more in line with “left ideologies, like those of Nicolas Maduro’s regime” rather than “a real quest for a peaceful and political solution to the dispute over the Sahara.” Through Algerian news outlet El Massa, Venezuelan Ambassador to Algeria Jose Rojo Reyes said that he rejected Guaido as interim president and claimed that Morocco is “taking advantage” of the conflict between Maduro and Guaido. Reyes said that “Morocco is not in a position to speak about the nature of democracy in Venezuela and Latin America, because it knows very well the consistent position of Chavez and Maduro on the issue of Western Sahara.” Morocco broke diplomatic ties with Venezuela in 2009 because of its support for the Polisario Front. “Formal” diplomatic ties between Venezuela and SADR began in 1982 during the regime of Luis Herrera Campins. In an interview with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Avendano said that Guaido’s government wants to turn a new page after 20 years of “Chavism” and “Madurism” to adopt its “own positions on diplomatic issues.”

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – In an unprecedented move, the European Parliament held a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, February 19, to hear victims of abuses recount their testimonies, including the fiancee of the murdered Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. In a plea to the European Parliament, Hatice Cengiz said that government officials should make Khashoggi’s murder their number one priority over economic interests. Cengiz urged the EU Parliament to come down hard on Saudi Arabia, which admitted that Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in Turkey. In her visit to the Parliament, Khashoggi’s 37-year-old Turkish fiancee said in a press release that she was there “not only as the fiancee of Jamal but also for the values he fought for, values he wanted for the people in his own country, the people of the Arab world.” The murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident and a Washington Post contributor who was trenchantly critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had reportedly been made at the order of the crown prince, US senators confirmed following CIA Director Gina Haspel’s briefing on the case. Cengiz stated that those involved in the murder of Khashoggi have yet to be brought to justice. “Up until now, nothing has been done to those implicated in this crime,” she said. “Hasn’t the moment come? I ask this question as a simple human being.” She added that “anybody could fall victim of this system.” “We will not let Saudi Arabia get away with Khashoggi’s murder,” Antonio Panzeri, an MEP and chairman of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, stated in a press release. A year before Khashoggi was killed, MBS threatened to shoot him if he could not be returned to Saudi Arabia forcibly, according to accounts of senior American and international officials familiar with US intelligence on the crown prince’s phone calls and written communications.

Rabat – UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced on Tuesday, February 19, the appointment of Moroccan activist Najat M’jid and six other expert members to the Civil Society Advisory Board on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. According to Stephane Dujarric, the Secretary-General’s spokesperson the board aims to promote “closer interaction with civil society and external experts and organizations as part of the UN’s efforts to combat sexual exploitation and abuse.” Maghreb Arab Press stated further that the creation of the board, according to the UN, “is an important element in the strategy of the UN Secretary-General to improve the fight against this global organization of sexual exploitation and abuse.” The functions of the committee are to advise the Secretary-General on ways to strengthen preventive measures and accountability mechanisms against sexual exploitation and abuse by UN members and non-UN members operating within the mandate of the Security Council. Najat M’jid, a member of Morocco’s National Human Rights Council, is a pediatrician who has been involved in protecting vulnerable children for three decades.  M’jid founded BAYTI, an NGO working in the field of family reintegration, schools, and the socio-professional reintegration of children in precarious situations. Between 2008 and 2014, M’jid worked as the UN’s special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children.

Rabat – In an article published by US sports magazine the Players’ Tribune, the young Moroccan footballer Amine Harit shared his story with his fans,  friends, relatives, and even those who do not know his name yet. In an article titled “Remember the Name”  Harit narrated details about his family and especially about his sense of belonging to Morocco. The Moroccan-French footballer also confessed his love for France, which gave him “everything” in his life. But for him, Morocco remains special because “Moroccans … are my people, too.” “I feel this connection to the country that I can’t fully explain. France gave me so much, but my family is my everything.”  Explaining his choice to represent Morocco instead of France, Harit said, “My grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins — so many of them still live in Morocco. So when I had to choose who I wanted to play for, I felt indebted to those people.”  When relating his pride in Morocco, the footballer also had a flashback to when the Atlas Lions defeated Cote d’Ivoire 2-0 to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in 2018. “I cried. I really did. So much. Tears of joy. And when we arrived back in Morocco, the support we had when we landed was so, so incredible. I have never seen anything like it in my life. I want that again. I want it a million times over.” He expressed his determination to “bring joy to Morocco,” adding that every achievement he makes is for his family. “And if you’re from Morocco, you’re my family.” Harit, however, has made a name for himself for less positive reasons. He was involved in a deadly car accident that killed a 30-year-old pedestrian in Marrakech in June 2018. The young player paid a fine and received a suspended four-month sentence after the accident. Last year, German media also speculated that Harit’s career might be affected by his alleged addiction to gambling.  Harit, who published the article under his signature, promised that “there’s more to come.” The footballer was born in Pontoise, north of Paris. He said that he, his sister, brother, mother, and father lived in a small house. “They were my team, my everything.” He also acknowledged that the city he was living in was not the safest place in the early 2000s. “My parents wouldn’t let me and my brother play too far from the front door of our home. If we got more than maybe 15 feet away, my mum would come out and yell.” Harit, however, said that the place has changed now. Harit said he used to  go directly to the football pitch after school, which angered his mother. “I had these raggedy, old football boots, with laces that were way too long.  The winner of the Bundesliga Rookie of the Year award for 2017–18, Harit joined the Schalke 04 club in July 2017.

Rabat – The Ministry of Transport plans to install 550 new speed cameras in Moroccan cities in an attempt to reduce the number of car accidents. On the National Day of Road Security on February 18, a representative of the ministry, Noureddine Dib, stated that Morocco has had 140 speed cameras in operation since 2010, and the ministry plans to install an additional 550 radars. The ministry believes the new radars will reduce the volume of both car accidents and traffic violations.  Once installed, the speed cameras will not only capture speeding, but also driving the wrong way down one-way streets, overtaking in lanes where it is forbidden, and failure to stop at red lights. Previously, reports emerged that the ministry planned to adopt new “intelligent” radars that would have a 20-kilometer-long view, enabling them to record cars that do not stop at stop signs and defective brake lights. The ministry will also repair several radars that are out of operation. In 2018, the General Directorate of National Surveillance (DGSN) recorded 66,343 road accidents, resulting in 964 deaths, 3,748 serious injuries, and 84,048 minor injuries. DGSN registered over 1.8 million traffic offenses and began infringement proceedings on 573,557 vehicles. The number of traffic accidents increased by 7.5 percent in comparison to 2017, when 61,686 accidents were recorded. The number of deaths and injuries also increased in comparison to those recorded in 2017.

Rabat – The Court of Appeals in Taza, a city in northern Morocco, has ruled in favor of an individual accused of “shaking the faith of a Muslim,” a crime according to Article 220 of the Penal Code. The defendant had given someone a book explaining the Bible. The court announced its decision in a statement, explaining that the Bible “is one of the holy books” that Muslims believe in and declared the defendant “innocent” of any offences. The details of the case date back to 2018, when the plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant, accusing him of proselytizing, the act of attempting to convert a person to another religion. The defendant denied the accusation and pleaded not guilty. According to Article 220 of the Penal Code: “Anyone who attempts to shake the faith of a Muslim to convert to a different religion” will be punished by 3 to 6 months imprisonment and a fine ranging from MAD 15 to 575. Toward the end of 2018, the court upheld a preliminary ruling at the request of the King’s general prosecutor to explain its decision, considering it “a step toward promoting religious freedom in Morocco.” Although Article 3 of the 2011 Constitution dictates the freedom to practice religious rituals, Moroccans of religious minorities, such as Christianity, keep a low profile for fear of social judgment or persecution.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – The Moroccan secretary of state for sustainable development, Nezha El Ouafi, has signed the Brussels Declaration on climate change while representing Morocco at a conference in the Belgian capital.  El Ouafi signed the declaration on behalf of Morocco yesterday. In the face of global climate change, many countries took it upon themselves to sign the declaration to affirm their commitment to combating the issue.  The declaration stresses the importance of each country showing its determination to combat climate change.  The high-level Conference on Climate Change and Oceans Preservation was officiated by Marie Christine Marghem, Belgian federal minister of energy, environment, and sustainable development. Morocco has made efforts over the years to preserve marine life, fight climate change, and develop renewable energy, factors the declaration highlighted. At the event, Nezha El Ouafi stressed Morocco’s “voluntarist policy” regarding its integration of renewable energies into its “national energy mix.” She argued that “the policies Morocco has so far implemented, thanks to the farsightedness of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, reflects its irreversible and strategic choice ensuring a close link between renewable energy and economic and social development of Morocco.”  The conference offered participants an occasion to take a stance on the marine environment and reiterate their commitment to limit the adverse impact of global warming on the oceans. According to Belgium’s the Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment, the declaration aims to call on all interested parties to “develop, adopt and implement the necessary visions, policy plans and strategies regarding cost-effective renewable ocean energy and marine spatial planning, safeguarding the biodiversity, resilience, connectivity and services of marine ecosystems.” Also attending the conference were Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and Prince Albert II of Monaco as well as a number of government representatives from other countries. The Climate Change Performance Index for 2019 ranked Morocco ranked as the second-best performing country following Sweden, which scored the highest rank. Morocco improved its climate change policy significantly as shown in the index, with a considerable increase in renewable energy capacity and with low greenhouse gas emission levels and energy use. Despite delays in implementing national policies, Morocco could be a “policy frontrunner” internationally with its long-term strategy for 2050, according to the CCPI.

Rabat – Several Moroccan trade unions, including the Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT), the Democratic Federation of Labor (FDT), and the General Union of Moroccan Workers (UGTM) are protesting on the eighth anniversary of the 20 February movement against the government’s “disregard” for their needs. Today, eight years on from the Arab Spring and Morocco’s 20 February movement demanding a new constitution, unions are going on strike and conducting sit-ins in front of various ministry headquarters and government offices across Morocco. The unions leading the protests are condemning “poor” social dialogue negotiations, problems in education and healthcare, and the deterioration of the workers’ situation. The Islamist group Jamaat Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane (the Justice and Spirituality movement) will also participate in the protest. The group’s members denounced the government’s limiting of its freedom and that of trade union activists to create union offices, in addition to the negligence of their demands despite a series of “negotiations.” The Islamist group said in a statement that the “social dialogue” negotiations have stagnated since eight years ago, conveying its support for the protest in Rabat today. Protesters are at the same time on a labor strike. On February 20, 2011, inspired by the Arab Spring, thousands of Moroccans rallied in Rabat in protests that lasted until the spring of 2012. They demanded an end to corruption; a change in government; better housing, employment, and living conditions; and above all a change in the constitution. The protests successfully ushered in a new constitution, now known as the 2011 Constitution. Other separate protests of the same kind took place in Casablanca, Marrakech, Tangier, Al Hoceima, Chefchaouen, Larache, Ksar-el-Kebir, Fez, Guelmim, Tetouan, and Sefrou.

Rabat – A woman appeared before the King’s attorney general on Monday after her first husband filed a lawsuit against her for taking a second husband. Police arrested her on Sunday, February 17. The first husband, who was serving a prison term, returned from jail in August 2018 to find that his wife had applied for divorce and married a second husband with whom she had a child. The woman is reportedly suspected of forging divorce documents to marry her second spouse, a military man. The woman, who works as a teacher, secretly started divorce procedures after her first husband’s release. For its part, the Court of First Instance in Meknes noted the laxity of administrative officers who had not noticed that the documents the woman presented were forged. The woman risks a prison term on charges of adultery and forgery. According to Article 491 of the Moroccan Penal Code, “any married person convicted of adultery is punishable by imprisonment for one to two years; prosecution is pursued only on a complaint from the offended spouse.” It was not the first time that a Moroccan woman had a polyandrous marriage. Late in 2017, a young woman in the rural commune of Ben Mansour north of Rabat was legally married to two men until her first husband found out and filed a complaint against her. While polygyny—the marriage of a man to more than one wife—is not uncommon in Morocco and other Arab or Muslim countries, polyandry—the marriage of a woman to more than one husband—is prohibited and seen as scandalous.

Rabat – Dubai Deputy Police Chief Dhahi Khalfan stirred controversy in a tweet yesterday saying that Muslims occupied Andalusia in Spain for hundreds of years.

“Muslims occupied Al Andalus for eight centuries, and Al Andalus returned to its people. Be patient. Every power goes down, no matter the time,” Khalfan said.

A flood of replies followed Khalfan’s post, mostly denying that Muslims occupied the Iberian peninsula. One user who commented made a reference to the early 20th-century Spanish poet Lorca Federico. “The Spanish poet Lorca considered the Muslim exit from Andalusia the greatest disaster that Spain ever knew.” والله انك لا تستحق عناء الرد ولكن افعل حتي لا تغرر بمن لا يقرأ
الشاعر الإسباني لوركا عد خروج المسلمين من الأندلس اكبر كارثة حلت بتاريخ اسبانيا الفرنسي جوستاف لوبون والألمانية زيجريد هونكة والأمريكي جوزيف ماك جب والأمريكي واشنطن ايرفنج وغيرهم لا يحسبون دخول المسلمين اليها إحتلالا — المسلمون فى الاندلس (@andalucian711) February 19, 2019 The user was likely referring to a quote by Lorca on the city of Granada, in which he said that the city “lost an admirable civilization.”  “A relationship with the Israeli people is possible, but not with the Israeli government,” Khalfan argued in another tweet. 

“Israeli citizens can go to any Arab country, but Israeli officials cannot communicate with us unless a Palestinian state is established. Maybe this has to do with the human side, far from politics,” he continued in the same post.
 احتل المسلمون الاندلس ثمانية قرون وعادت الاندلس لأهلها ..اصبروا ..لكل قوة زوال مهما الزمن طال. — ضاحي خلفان تميم (@Dhahi_Khalfan) February 19, 2019 In following tweets, police chief struck a different tone. He compared the mindset of Israeli officials to Nazi ideology, “in terms of the sense of superiority.” القادة السياسيين الاسرائيليين يعيشون بعقليات متخلفة يهيمن عليها ما هيمن على عقلية هتلر
تماما من حيث الشعور بالفوقية. — ضاحي خلفان تميم (@Dhahi_Khalfan) February 19, 2019 A month ago, Saudi blogger Mohammad Al Shammari made a similar comment to Khalfan’s.  Al Shammari said “Muslims came to Spain as invaders. They captured over 600,000 people and after four centuries, the church regained its land from the invaders.”  “If logic says that land belongs to whoever invades and imposes power over it, then we should treat Israel with the same logic,” added the blogger. While relations between some Arab countries and Israel saw some rapprochement in recent years, many popular and grassroots movements have protested the moves.  In late October, an Israeli official accompanied her country’s judo team to the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam, where the Israeli anthem was played for the first time in the UAE’s history.  Israeli Minister of Culture Miriam Regev was later invited on an official visit by officials in the United Arab Emirates to tour the country’s largest mosque, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. Last month, a Moroccan movement called for the boycott of pro-Israel French Jewish singer Enrico Macias, amid rumors of Morocco-Israel normalization following an alleged high-level secret meeting between Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita and Israel’s Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – American university LaGrange will dedicate a special day to discuss former British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill’s loyalty to Morocco. The event will be held at the department of science and arts in LaGrange College, Alabama, on February 25. Duncan Sandys, Winston Churchill’s great grandson, will deliver a presentation on “Magic of Morocco”, recounting the fascination and love his great grandfather had for Morocco as well as the secret meeting of his great grandfather and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  According to the LaGrange official website, “Morocco was the favorite winter retreat of Sir Winston Churchill,” Britain’s legendary World War II leader.   Sandys is going to introduce the public to the various “amusing stories” of his late great grandfather extracted from family letters as well as observations on Churchill’s trips to Morocco. He was especially fond of Marrakech, which he described as “the most lovely place in the whole world.” Sandys said that the Casablanca conference where Sir Churchill and Roosevelt met was “critical” to the decisions behind war-time negotiations as well as a time where the two “forged a personal bond.”  LaGrange College President Dan McAlexander expressed his joy at Sandys’ initiative to lecture on Morocco, describing Sandys as an “engaging speaker whose personal connection to Sir Winston Churchill” that his presentation will add “depth and charm” to the lecture.  The meeting will also include speakers and lecturers such as Dr. Kevin Shirley, history professor, Dr. Dottie Joiner, art history professor, and Dr. Caleb Williams, exercise science professor.  In addition to Sandys presentation, the 3D travel/lecture series, in its ninth version, will also cast light on the Moroccan scholar and explorer Ibn Battuta, which will be presented by medievalist teacher Dr. Kevin Shirley. Dan McAlexander also says that 30 “3D travelers” are intending to set out on an exploratory trip to Morocco for the upcoming Spring.

Rabat – A British organization conducted a poll in July 2017 showing that 35 percent of people believe that Islam is a threat to the British way of life, reported the Guardian on February 17. The Hope not Hate organization, according to the Guardian, announced that it will launch a report which indicated that more than a third of people in the UK deal with Islam as a threat. The poll conducted by the organization showed that only 30 percent of British people who voted in the poll consider Islam as compatible. According to the Guardian t30 percent of those who voted for Conservative in the 2017 election believed that Islam is incompatible with “Britishness,” while 22 percent of Labour supporters held the same view. The report also found that the 2017 terror attacks which took place in the UK had a negative impact on their judgments. The report also said that 30 percent of voters in a poll of more than 5,000 people conducted in August 2018 agreed to launch a campaign to stop any initiatives aimed to build mosques where they live. One suggestion is that Islamophobia is still rampant in a number of western countries. Despite the remarkable influence of Islam in the world, extremism and radicalization linked to the religion has impacted views of Muslims. Muslims living in non-Muslim majority countries are subjected to religion-based oppression to their religion. Using FBI Data, a  2017 study by the Pew Research Center found that assaults on Muslims in the US “easily surpassed” the previous modern peak of attacks on Muslims in 2001. Jewish people are also subject to hate crimes. The study also said that Islam is growing more than twice as fast as the overall world population between 2015 and 2060. Christianity, however, still forms the largest religious group with 31.2 percent, according to the report.

Rabat – RSF announced in a press release on Tuesday that about 15 unknown individuals barged into a conference room on February 15, and “verbally and physically” attacked the journalists and activists of  Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Morocco (ASDHOM) in the middle of their conference. “We ask of the French authorities to identify those responsible for sabotaging this conference, and to take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of journalists as well as free practice of press freedom in France,” said RSF. RSF expressed concern for Moroccan journalists and activists who “could not freely and safely discuss press freedom in Morocco.” The incident has inspired the solidarity of numerous associations with the journalists, including the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) in France which has categorically condemned the violence in a public statement. Le vendredi 15 février 2019 une quinzaine d’individus d’une agressivité inouïe ont attaqué verbalement et physiquement nos camarades et militants de l’Association de défense des Droits de l’homme au Maroc (ASDHOM) lors de leur conférence sur la liberté de la press au Maroc. pic.twitter.com/Vs3lkwaeyE — PSU Section France (@PSUFrance) February 16, 2019  PSU expressed its “full solidarity” with ASDHOM “which has been fighting for the defense of human rights in Morocco for years.” The Moroccan the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) also denounced the “unacceptable” attack against the Moroccan journalists and press freedom.  Last year, the RSF claimed that Moroccan authorities deterred the work of domestic and foreign journalists who were attempting to cover Hirak Rif, a protest movement that erupted in the Al Hoceima Province in 2016 and 2017 after the death of a local fishmonger, Mohcine Fikri.  The ministry condemned the report then and described RSF’s reasoning behind its rankings of Morocco in terms of press freedom as “baseless and lacking credibility.”  In 2018, RSF ranked Morocco 135th among 180 countries in its press freedom report.

Rabat – In April 2018, Moroccans launched a boycott targeting select companies, whose products prices do not meet their purchasing power. Central Danone, a French dairy company, is among the companies that suffered losses due to the boycott. Several months after the boycott, Centrale Danone is still complaining about its losses due to the campaign. The net profit of the company dropped by 4.1 percent in 2018, while its turnover stagnated to €24.65 billion with a decline in sales of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. The boycott, according to the company, caused a €43 million decrease in the group’s profit compared to 2017. The boycott launched on April 20 and targeted two other companies with large market shares: Sidi Ali, and Afriquia Gaz. However, Central Danone was the only company which publically voiced the impacts of the boycott several times, publishing statements and reassuring citizens that it will work to reduce the prices. The company also launched a consulting campaign with consumers in several cities across Morocco, including Casablanca, Marrakech, and Rabat. The campaign also urged the general director of the company, Emmanuel Faber, to visit Morocco and personally consult with citizens and ask them what measures are needed to end the boycott. Throughout the boycott, Moroccan senior officials urged citizens to end the boycott on Central Danone as it offers job opportunities to small farmers. The Moroccan government also said that the boycott would discourage foreign investors. Official data shows that during the period of August 2017-2018, foreign direct investments fell to MAD 14.6 million, according to Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani.

Bashagha said in a press briefing that the Skhirat Agreement remains the ideal framework to achieve a national reconciliation. “Morocco has always stood on the side of Libyans in a neutral manner and has provided them great support by hosting the Skhirat talks that led to the signing of the Skhirat Agreement, which is an “ideal framework” for reconciliation,“ stated Bashagha.

Rabat – The Central Judicial Investigation Bureau (BCIJ) recently dismantled a terrorist cell in the Safi area that was planingd to carry out major serial attacks, according to Assabah newspaper.

The group planned to target the Safi area first and then other Moroccan cities. They planned to disguise themselves as police officers.

The cell planned to attack the gendarmerie and police services in Safi city in order to seize the officers’ weapons and uniforms.  They would then use the captured weapons to launch attacks in other Moroccan cities.

Targeting tourist attractions and crowded areas, the terror cell wanted to attack a tourist complex in the Sidi Bouzid area, a hotel in the city, a nightclub, and a bar.  They planned to use swords and knives in the first phase of the attacks.

Rabat – The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted about a meeting convening a Saudi minister  and a Moroccan diplomat, suggesting that news about possible tension between the two kingdoms is just a false alert. The Saudi Minister of State for African affairs Ahmed Abdul Aziz Kattan received Moroccan ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mustapha Mansouri on Monday. The ministry, however, did not mention the reason of the meeting between the two officials. The meeting comes on the heel of alleged tension between the two countries. In the last two weeks, rumors emerged on social media suggesting that Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs recalled its Riyadh envoy. Reports cited the airing of a Morocco-hostile documentary by state-owned television channel Al Arabiya.  #الرياض | وزير الدولة لشؤون الدول الأفريقية #أحمد_قطان يستقبل سفير #المغرب لدى المملكة مصطفى المنصوري pic.twitter.com/g62syAHgGs — وزارة الخارجية 🇸🇦 (@KSAMOFA) February 18, 2019  The documentary, which gave historical grounding to Polisario’s separatist claims, was largely perceived in Moroccan policy circles as undermining the North African kingdom’s territorial Integrity. . Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, however, denied any kind of tension between the two countries. In a number of subsequent public statements, Bourita emphasized that Morocco would announce such decisions if there were any through its special channels. Last week, many journalists also took advantage of the joint press conference held between Bourita and his Spanish counterpart Josep Borrell to ask questions about  the reported diplomatic rift with Saudi Arabia. Other news outlets also claimed Morocco recalled its ambassador from the UAE. In the press conference with Borell, who was part of the Spanish delegation that accompanied the Spanish royal family in Morocco, Bourita reiterated that the claims are false. The official described the news as “inaccurate,” saying that the two ambassadors were in Morocco to take part in meetings, but they went back to their offices last week. According to Bourita, the meetings with the two ambassadors aimed to review the “significant changes” in the region. He also reassured that the relations between Gulf countries, especially with the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are historical and strong. His denial was the third of its kind as he has refuted similar allegations twice before. The first time Bourita talked about Saudi-Moroccan diplomatic bonds was during an interview with Qatari television channel Al Jazeera. Bourita also talked about Morocco’s participation in the Yemen war, emphasizing that the participation has changed.  The official, however, maintained that diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia have not been affected by Rabat’s withdrawal from the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.

Rabat – Morocco is allegedly planning to purchase its first submarine ship. If purchased, the submarine will be based at the Ksar Sghir navy base in Northern Morocco.  The Spanish news outlet El Confidencial Digital has reported that Morocco intends “to buy at least one submarine for the Ksar Sghir base.” The purchase of the submarine is “an old aspiration of the Royal Navy” that remained unachievable to date despite successive attempts, according to the newspaper. Moroccan Navy officials have intensified the search for submarine ships especially after Algeria acquired two new Type 636M ‘Kilo’ class Russian submarines– the upgraded ‘Kilo’ class– adding them to their already four operational submarines. The news outlet did not reveal the provenance of the alleged submarine. Reports have emerged that Morocco has already signed agreements to acquire submarines from Russia, the US, and Germany, but none of them have been disclosed. The Royal Moroccan Navy is also said to have approached Greece to purchase a second-hand submarine intended for training Moroccan Navy agents to get them used to modern submarines.   The outlet acknowledged Morocco’s leap in terms of modernizing its military equipment by acquiring last model of F-16 fighters, Abrahams battle tanks, Predator drones, or even Mohammed VI-A satellite.

Rabat – On Sunday, Moroccan authorities found the body of a 22-year old Moroccan in an apartment for rent in the Al Jaych El Malaki avenue in Fez. The 22-year old allegedly told his family that he was leaving to buy an autoradio DVD he found available on advertisements website. The disappearance of the young man worried his family, who contacted the police to report on their missing son. One of the suspects, believed to have kidnapped the victim, reportedly called his family to ask them for a ransom. The father of the victim accepted to give the suspects the ransom. The suspects, however, did not call the father back.  Moroccan authorities later found the body of the victim, who was allegedly  slaughtered inside the appartement. Security services in Fez and Tangier worked in collaboration to arrest the suspects. The suspects were arrested in Ksar El Kebir, a city in North Morocco. The incident is not the first of its kind. While there has recently been great focus on the dangers of fake news and unreliable advertisement spread by tech giants, relatively small advertisements website are no strangers to equally dangerous online hazards. In addition to fraudulent advertisements with the aim of extorting money from victims, there have been other instances where the security, well-being, and in some case the life of persons are put in jeopardy as a result of an online announcement.

ONDH said on Sunday that it was closely monitoring “the upsurge in suicides in Chefchaouen province,” stressing that “the most important right in the global human rights system is the right to life.”

Rabat – Footage has emerged of a disheveled and apparently homeless British woman wandering around Tan-Tan, a city in southwestern Morocco. The video, which was uploaded to the internet on Saturday, February 16, shows a British woman in disheveled clothes aimlessly walking around the city.  A campaign was launched to determine the woman’s identity and nationality in the hope of finding her family after the video widely circulated on Facebook.  According to local sources, the woman has lived around the area for a long period and the reasons behind her current condition remain unknown.  After a wide search, the authorities of Morocco’s Tan-Tan Province found the British woman in an abandoned building in the north entrance of the city. Following a long discussion with the woman, they identified her as Victoria Jeanne Harding.  The woman carries a valid British passport. She arrived in the port of Tangier on February 8 and traveled to the city of Tan-Tan.   After the authorities informed Harding of the dangers of living on the outskirts of the city, they booked a room for her in Texas hotel, which she was unable to afford herself.  Victoria Jeanne Harding was seen leaving the hotel on the morning of February 17 to follow her quest to reach Dakar, the capital city of Senegal.  Harding is said to be on a journey from Tan-Tan to Laayoune, and then Dakhla, in direction to Dakar.

Rabat – The trial of Brahim J, accused of murder, began yesterday before the Val-d’Oise criminal court in Paris, according to le Parisien. The French-Moroccan man is facing life imprisonment. He is accused of murdering his wife in 2015, in the Paris area, before throwing her body into a canal.

The 37-year-old confessed to killing his wife, Hafida, after an argument that turned out badly. 

“She pissed me off. So I hit her, and I killed her. I strangled her. That’s it,” he explained. He then backed down and said it was an accident. He said his wife tried to strangle him, that he defended himself by strangling her and he did not want to kill her.

Brahim went on to admit that he wrapped the body, kept it in the trunk for a few days before throwing it into the canal.

His Moroccan wife’s body was then found by a passer-by a few weeks later. The passer-by discovered black garbage bags with adhesive tape around, with the shape of a human foot. DNA tests would later confirm the woman’s identity. Testimonies from the husband’s family describe him as jealous, authoritarian, and often violent. 

The woman had filed a complaint against her husband in Morocco. She had even initiated divorce proceedings before she changed her mind, the Parisian newspaper adds.

Rabat – The legal adviser to the  Moroccan permanent mission at the UN has dismissively reacted to a report issued by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on the case of detained Moroccan journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, who was convicted of human trafficking, rape with violence, and sexual assault. According to the statement of the adviser, a copy of which Morocco World News has viewed, the working group’s report includes opinions and observations which  don’t have a binding aspect. The UN body’s report  called for the “immediate” release of Bouachrine. The report also called on Morocco to compensate Bouachrine, asking the Moroccan authorities to give him guarantee of non-repetition. In response, Morocco’s legal adviser recalled that several other countries, such as Spain and Australia, have rejected similar findings in the past.  According to the Moroccan adviser, the findings of the working group, were not backed with solid evidence, and sometimes relied on details to incite public opinion against governments. The Moroccan officials further slammed the findings of the report, pointing out that the working group “intervenes even in cases that are still before courts.” A Moroccan court handed Bouachrine a sentence of 12 years in November 208. During his final trial, Bouachrine said he was a victim of an assault on freedom of expression. Bouachrine was arrested in February 2018 after a group of former female employees at Akhbar Al Yaoum, the newspaper he founded,  accused him of sexual assault and rape.

Rabat – Golda El Khoury, the director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) office in Rabat and Mohamed Benabdelkader, the Moroccan minister delegate in charge of administration reform signed an action plan on the right to access to information on Monday in Rabat. The plan is part of the implementation of a cooperation agreement signed by UNESCO and Morocco on October 30, 2017 in Paris, to launch joint programs allowing better access to information, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The main objective of the action plan is to enable Moroccan citizens to access “detailed and transparent” information and gain close knowledge about updates and events in Morocco to exercise their own voices and make decisions based on accurate data and contribute to the democratic process in the country.  The plan also seeks to reform and develop media and communication services, provide training to authorities in charge of relaying information to the public, and produce a guide to the proper use of law 13.31. Law 13.31, contains 8 articles dictating that all Moroccan citizens have the right to access information, and aiming to ensure transparency, counter corruption, boost the administration’s openness, and establish a culture of good governance and democracy.  The agreement strives to thoroughly implement the law as it is “a fundamental right for every person in every country,” said Golda. The action plan is in the framework of UNESCO’s intergovernmental Information for All Programme (IFAP), established in 2001, through which “member and partner governments pledge to harness the new opportunities of the information age to create equitable societies through better access to information.” Although the Moroccan 2011 Constitution stipulates the right to information, Moroccans’ access to information continues to be limited. Morocco enjoys partial freedom when it comes to access to content on the internet, according to the 2018 Freedom on the Net report. In the country, the state can shut down publications “prejudicial to Islam, the monarchy, territorial integrity, or public order” and issue prison sentences and heavy fines on publishers of infringing content. News criticizing the monarchy does not exist in Morocco, notes the report.

Rabat – A recent study from the US Carnegie Institute Endowment for International Peace emphasized Rabat’s efforts to combat terrorism and radicalization. The study said that Morocco’s counter-terrorism strategy is successful to prevent terror attacks. The study also called the Imlil double murder, which took place in December 2018 near Toubkal Mount, an “isolated” case. On December 17, authorities found the bodies of two Scandinavian tourists decapitated. Since December, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested at least 22 suspects involved in the murder. The study, however, found that the strategy is not sufficient to curb radicalization. According to the study, “of the jihadis imprisoned in these years, 220 had previously been arrested on terrorism charges,” and 1300 Moroccans who have left to fight in Syria. The study also recalled that Moroccan security services were able to dismantle a number of terror cells, which are small groups given the number of terror suspects arrested. However, former jihadi detainees headed some of the cells, indicating recidivism. The institute said that Morocco’s strategy is effective at preventing jihadis “from organizing into larger groups.” But Rabat still needs to work on its programs to reintegrate prisoners with terrorism, according to the study. “Yet despite Rabat’s sporadic efforts to deradicalize  jihadis while they are in prison, this policy remains unable to reintegrate them after they have been released.” The study also recalled Moroccan programs launched by the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR), including the reconciliation or Moussalaha program, launched in 2018 and aiming to reintegrate jihadis into society.. The Moroccan government, however, has trust in its reconciliation program. King Mohammed VI offered royal pardon to several defendants convicted of terror-related crimes.  Many former jihadis applied to join the program, with 300 prisoners applying for the 25 spots in 2018. The reconciliation program involves human rights experts and anti-radicalization experts who provide psychological support and rehabilitation to defendants charged and jailed for terror crimes. However, the program is not widespread.  The DGAPR has only accepted 50 out 1000 imprisoned jihadis since launching. The study also suggests that program participants may not have adequate support once leaving in prison, ending up the same circumstances that led them to radicalization.  The study recommends “family support, psychological counseling, vocational training, and forums to continue religious dialogue with credible scholars,” to prevent recidivism. DGAPR reassured citizens that the reconciliation programs to offer the best conditions for participatory reintegration of persons serving sentences for terrorism. Morocco’s government is still concerned about the threat posed by people who were involved in terror acts in Middle Eastern countries affected by civil wars, including Syria and Iraq. After the arrest of the Imlil murder suspects, the Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame said that ISIS fighters are still posing a threat to the stability and security of the region. He warned that international cooperation is needed and a must to curb the scourge of terrorism.

Rabat – Middle East and North Africa expert at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) Thomas Hill expressed satisfaction with the US administration’s decision to sign the 2019 spending bill. The bill reiterates Morocco’s position that Western Sahara should be considered as part of the US aids funds allocated to Morocco. A section on the bill, which US President Donald Trump signed on Saturday, reads that “Funds appropriated under title III of this Act shall be made available for assistance for the Western Sahara.” Hill told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the funding allocated to Morocco’s southern provinces is a “recognition that development programs in the Sahara regions should be carried out through and with the permission of the government of Morocco.” The expert also recalled that Morocco “is already promoting programs in Laayoune and neighbouring regions.” The signing of the bill suggests that diplomatic ties between both nations are moving in a good course. The expert said that Morocco is one of the strongest allies of the US in Africa, in North Africa and in the Middle East. Hill stressed Morocco’s efforts to combat terrorism in the region, pointing out that the country is America’s strongest ally in North Africa, especially on security measures.. Morocco’s counterterrorism is well recognized worldwide. Morocco’s efforts to fight radicalization and extremism have traditionally been applauded by American security reports, including the ones issued by US Departments of State. In its 2018 Country Report on Terrorism, the US Department of State warmly spoke of  Morocco’s contributions to international counterterrorism. The report noted that intelligence obtained from Moroccan services helped thwart scheduled terrorist strikes in a number of partner countries, especially in the EU. The State Department said, “Following the August attacks in Barcelona, Morocco assisted the Spanish investigation and promised to expand cooperation to track terrorists of Moroccan origin radicalized abroad.” Hill said that the stability of Morocco is an essential asset for the US and European countries as both regions are facing challenges due to migration, cross-border crime, trafficking of all kinds as well as the instability in the Sahel region. “Morocco is and continues to be a reliable ally of the United States in North Africa,” he added. In addition to the experts, several congress figures and US senior officials urged US administration to further reinforce its diplomatic ties with Morocco. In December 2018, US attorney general of Idaho Lawrence Wasden and Utah’s attorney general Sean Reyes co-wrote an opinion piece, to emphasize Morocco’s efforts as a leading counter-terrorism country. The two officials also called on the US to intensify its support to Morocco’s position in the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco’s efforts in countering terrorism and radicalization, “underscore the need for continued US support to help Morocco resolve the Western Sahara conflict,” emphasized the two officials. Morocco’s government has expressed its satisfaction with the pro-Morocco spending bill. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that while the bill’s language is reserved, diplomatic, and does not appear to overtly embrace Morocco’s position, its pro-Morocco sentiment is unmistakable, the ministry said in a statement.

Rabat – The Polisario Front has signed an agreement with an international company to explore minerals in UN restricted zones, setting a dangerous precedent for the ongoing UN-led settlement process. The front’s move comes weeks after EU authorities rejected its appeals against the EU-Morocco agriculture and fisheries deals, suggesting that the front is angered by the EU’s commitment to agreements with Morocco. On Sunday, the “news agency” of the separatist group announced the signing of an agreement between the front and Australian company Hanno Resources Limited. The agreement will allow the company to explore “liberated zones” for iron, gold, and other minerals in an area of  8000 square kilometers. The agreement, according to the separatist website, “comes as part of the revision and amendment to the previous agreements in the liberated region of Tiris,” east of Morocco’s defense wall. The agreement is another violation from the Polisario Front as the United Nations clearly warned against any illegal activity in Western Sahara and in the region east of Morocco’s defense wall claimed as “liberated zones” by the front. During the adoption of Resolution 2440 in October 2018,  the Security Council called on the Polisario to refrain from any maneuvers that would change the status quo of the region. The Security Council also called on Polisario to refrain from relocating or constructing any facilities in the areas that Polisario has long claimed as “liberated zones.” This year again, the front conducted a series of illegal maneuvers east of Morocco’s berm wall. In January, the front carried out military maneuvers in the “fourth military region in Mehriz,” a town east of the Moroccan berm. The provocative move resulted in Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale condemned the Polisario actions, emphasizing that  they are “flagrant violation” to the UN 2440 Resolution. Addressing a letter to the Security Council, Hilale said, “On the behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco, I would like to bring to your attention that the Polisario persists in its violations and provocations in the Guerguerat buffer zone, as well as in the east of the defense system in the Moroccan Sahara.”

Rabat- Israeli television Channel 13 has reported that Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita met with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in September in New York. While authorities in Rabat have not been forthcoming regarding recent reports of a potential work visit by Netanyahu in late March, neither denying nor confirming the rumored visit, another leak in the Israeli media has just suggested that “normalization talks” between Morocco and Israel are real. “Quoting a senior Israeli official who was involved in arranging the meeting, the TV report said Netanyahu asked Bourita to advance the normalization of Israeli-Moroccan ties,” Israeli the Times of Israel reported yesterday. While Channel 13 did elaborate on the reported “secret meeting,” it hinted to intense talks between Netanyahu’s office and Moroccan authorities to “normalize” diplomatic relations. The pair reportedly met on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly, and Netanyahu “offered assistance for Morocco regarding Iran,” according to the same report. Netanyahu’s office denied the news, however, issuing a statement that Israel does not comment on contacts with countries it has no formal diplomatic ties with. On January 23, Norm Coleman, a former senator and former chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), tweeted a picture of a recent trip to Rabat. The picture showed Coleman and a number of pro-Israel Jewish Republicans meeting with the Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita. And while Bourita’s meeting with the RJC seemed to add legitimacy to Netanyahu’s normalization acclaims, Rabat’s silence means it is not yet certain which narrative to hold on to. A number of recent developments suggest Netanyahu has no qualms about making his normalization inroads much bigger than they actually are because his political survival is at the stake. Netanyahu’s aggressive normalization campaign Meanwhile, many suspect Netanyahu himself of being the originator of the continued leaked information on his “normalization with Arabs” agenda. Some of his domestic political foes have even accused him of condoning the leaks so he can positively influence the country’s public debate weeks prior to the election in March. For them, Netanyahu, hungry for another term in office, is poised to give any punches to land few marks in his favor as Israelis prepare to go to the polls. The accusation seems far-flung, but it is hardly unlikely. Recent weeks have seen a flurry of news reports in the Israeli press on the alleged normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and a host of Muslim and Arab countries. Relayed in major Israeli news, the reports have been met with a fierce reaction in many of the concerned Arab countries. Morocco, a strong supporter of the now apparent sidelined two-state solution, was no exception. Many Palestine-supporting Moroccan associations have since spoken up against the rumored normalization with Israel. They have pointed out that Palestinian rights are part and parcel of Morocco’s identity on the global stage, and that no normalization can happen “as long as Israel’s occupation continues on Palestinian lands.” Netanyahu’s keenness on perceived “normalization” was most apparent at the recent Warsaw summit. While in the Polish capital, Netanyahu reportedly leaked a video that brought more spotlight to his normalization efforts. The footage, showing Netanyahu in discussions with foreign ministers from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, seemed to support what he later described as a “historical turning point” in Arab-Israeli relations. “In a room of some 60 foreign ministers representative of dozens of governments, an Israeli prime minister and the foreign ministers of the leading Arab countries stood together and spoke with unusual force, clarity and unity against the common threat of the Iranian regime,” he said of the Warsaw meeting.

Rabat – While the Moroccan Constitution only recognizes Sunni Islam and Judaism as native religions, some Moroccans have embraced other faiths. Several Moroccan Christians opened up to Morocco World News about suffering from discrimination, the hostile reactions of their relatives and friends, and their occasional problems with authorities. Agadir and Marrakech, in particular, have significant Christian populations, according to the Moroccan Association of Religious Rights and Freedoms (AMDLR).  One Marrakchi Christian, Abdelmouttalib Ghaffar, 53, is a farmer who is married and has three children. He told MWN he decided to convert to Christianity in 2009 “after a lot of research and watching relevant TV channels.” He said that the decision did not come without consequences. “The decision was not easy, I have been through a lot of bad situations.” Ghaffar related how painful his friends’ reactions were. “People look at me just like a criminal or an ‘infidel’ person. However, I really assume responsibility for my decision.”  Since he is unsure if people will accept or understand him, Ghaffar said that he can never reveal his religious beliefs to people. Moroccan Christians typically worship in privately, usually in a private home, where small groups gather to pray, study the Bible, and discuss various topics related to Christianity.    “Because of being a Christian, I was also deprived of my national identity card and my driver’s license. I started some administrative procedures to get new ones but in vain,” said Ghaffar. He related that he does not have the energy or the money to pay a lawyer to defend him. “I have 3 kids, and I am the one who provides all that they need. How can I work without my national identity card?” Ghaffar asked. Like most Moroccan Christians, Ghaffar is calling for his rights to be recognized: To be able to worship publicly in churches, to get his national identity card and driver’s license back, to live safely, and to enjoy religious freedom. “Difficult situation” Jawad El Hamidy, the AMDLR president, said that all Moroccan Christians are in a difficult situation for many reasons. “There is lack of recognition of freedom of belief and an absence of legal guarantees when it comes to practicing some non-Islamic religious rituals: Morocco does not tolerate people converting to Christianity from Islam,” El Hamidy told MWN. He added, “Moroccan Christians do not possess ‘normal’ citizenship rights, and there is no political willingness to protect them.” El Hamidy linked the government’s lack of protection to society’s intolerance towards Christian converts, whom he said risk “ruining relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.”  El Hamidy argued that Moroccan authorities should stop pursuing these religious minorities but allow them to live freely. Another side to the story In an article about Ghaffar, a Moroccan media outlet cited a “credible source” in government who denied that Moroccan authorities treat people badly for their religious beliefs or converting to Christianity. The source explained that Ghaffar has been in conflict with the law since 2013 because of his illegal possession of “white arms,” a term for weapons like knives. According to the source, “he was also arrested in July 2017 since he issued a dishonored check to an insurance company.” Ghaffar denied the claim. In April 2018, news outlets reported that a Moroccan man from Rabat was arrested for carrying Christian books. In response, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) in Rabat said they “had not arrested any Moroccan or foreign citizen because of this, and no one has been subjected to a restrictive freedom measure.” At that time, the Moroccan Christians’ Coordination group denied the media narrative as well. The group wrote on its Facebook page the story was “just an imaginary scenario told by Jawad El Hamaidy, who was not appointed by any Christian or asked to defend a Christian, trying to create problems between the Moroccan authorities and religious minorities.” The Constitution vs. the laws Article 3 of the Moroccan Constitution declares “Islam is the religion of the State which guarantees to all the free exercise of beliefs.” On the other hand, the Moroccan Penal Code prohibits converting people to religions other than Islam. According to Article 220 of the Moroccan Penal Code, “Anyone who employs incitements to shake a Muslim’s faith or to make him convert to another religion will incur a sentence from 6 months’ to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of 200 to 500 dirhams.” Article 220 further states: “Whoever uses means of seduction in order to shake the faith of a Muslim will be punished with the same penalty.” Christianity first came to Morocco during the Roman era. After Islam came, the numbers of Christians fell. According to the US State Department, Christians, Jews, and Bahais in Morocco together make up less than 1 percent of the country’s population. The department also said that “Christian leaders estimate there are between 2,000 and 6,000 Christian citizens distributed throughout the country.”

Rabat – Hundreds of Moroccans from different cities rallied on Sunday near the Parliament in Rabat to condemn the “marginalization” of the people of Essaouira and Souss-Massa region and protest the lack of measures against overgrazing and wild boar damaging their lands. Organized by Akal Coordination defending people’s rights to land and wealth, the protest is the second of its kind after one last November in Casablanca, as demonstrators stated that their calls “fell on deaf ears.” The march saw a strong presence of Moroccan Amazigh (Berber) people from the Souss and the Rif region, who are calling on the government to return their “usurped lands” and conduct “a fair distribution of wealth.”  The people expressed concern over the repeated attacks of wild boars on their property, complaining that the animals destroy agriculture and plants such as argan trees in the Sous valley of southwestern Morocco. The demonstration also addressed the issue of law 113.13 related to the management of nomadic pastoralism. The law requires shepherds to obtain permits to find pastures for their livestock to graze on a set of conditions.  “We declare our categorical refusal to pasture law 113.13 and call for a radical solution to policies that promote land expropriation, marginalization, and exclusion of indigenous people,” read the banners held by protesters. Protesters condemned acts of overgrazing on lands they inherited from their “forefathers.” They called on the government to abolish the law permitting nomadic pastoralism, expressing frustration at the authorities’ inaction and previous “false promises” to find solutions to their problems. The march comes a few days after the government approved three bills related to the administrative management of the property of tribal communities and “hereditary lands.” The total of the land areas is estimated at 15 million hectares distributed among 4,563 ethnic groups in the country.

Rabat – An estimated 3,000 people gathered in Brussels on Saturday afternoon demanding Morocco release political prisoners from the Hirak movement in Morocco’s Rif region, according to the Brussels police.

The demonstrators carried banners and placards calling for the unconditional release of all prisoners and the lifting of the blockade.  They also displayed the traditional flags of the Rif region and the resistance against French and Spanish colonization. Some, including relatives of prisoners, delivered speeches at the Schuman square where major EU institutions are located.

The demonstrators called on the EU to demand respect for human rights in Morocco. They also protested the alleged torture of Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi. “These prisoners were arbitrarily sentenced to 10, 15 or 20 years in prison simply for claiming basic rights,” Aissa Dmam, a demonstrator and member of the Mouhcine Fikri committee according to RTBF, told Le Soir.  “The Rif lives under an economic and military blockade. Half of the young people migrate massively to Europe and many fail in the Mediterranean,” added Dmam. Last November, sometime after he was pardoned by King Mohammed VI, Hirak activist Mohamed Amkouh was handed a two-year prison sentence for insulting security forces. Two months later, Morocco summoned the Dutch ambassador to Morocco over the Netherlands’ criticism of the Hirak sentences.  In December 2017, 900 people demonstrated in Brussels to demand the release of Hirak prisoners.

A fish seller named Mouhcine Fikri was crushed in a dumpster in October 2016 after the police confiscated his goods. The incident sparked a wave of protests.

Launched in October 2015, a year before Al Hoceima protests began following Fikri’s death, delays in the Al Hoceima’s five-year development mega-project put the government under pressure. Several ministers were sacked as a result of the delays.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika addressed a message to King Mohammed VI, expressing congratulations on the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU). In the message, which was published by Algerian news agency APS, the Algerian leader said that he wanted to address a “warm congratulations and best wishes.” The message also wishes King Mohammed VI and his people “more progress and prosperity under” King Mohammed VI’s “enlightened leadership.” According to Bouteflika, the celebration of the anniversary offer the Maghreb countries the “pleasant opportunity to recall the bonds of brotherhood, solidarity and good neighborliness existing between Maghreb peoples and civilizational constants they share.” The diplomatic ties between Algeria and Morocco have long been described as tense due to Algeria’s stance regarding the Western Sahara conflict and Morocco’s territorial integrity. The border between the two “brotherly”  countries has been also closed since 1994. Algeria made the decision after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni hotel in Marrakech. Tension further grew between the two countries when Algeria began supporting the separatist group Polisario Front. King Mohammed VI, however, expressed hopes that dialogue would end the stalemate that  hampers the Maghreb unity project. On November 6, 2018, the King devoted the biggest part of his speech on the anniversary of the Green March to emphasize the importance of frank and direct dialogue to break the ice covering the frozen diplomatic ties between the two countries. Algeria, however, has not addressed any direct response. Instead, Algeria announced that it has requested an urgent meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) Foreign Affairs Ministers Council to build the “whole” Maghreb. In response, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement  weeks after Morocco’s dialogue offer, saying that the Algerian request for a meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) foreign ministers is “unrelated to the royal initiative.”  Morocco’s government stressed that the state of “lethargy that the AMU has known for years, is mainly due to the abnormal nature of Moroccan-Algerian relations, which can be treated only in the framework of a bilateral dialogue, direct and without intermediaries.” But, Algeria still reluctant to send a direct answer to Morocco’s dialogue initiative.  Bouteflika’s recent message on the Maghreb Union added that Algeria is still committed to the “building of the Arab Maghreb Union as a strategic choice and popular demand to revitalize its institutions and structures and to defend common interests.” Morocco has no objection to holding meeting of the AMU.  However, Morocco’s government was hoping to receive an official reaction from Algeria instead.

Rabat – The Polisario Front is reassuring Sahrawis about the disappearance of Polisario member Ahmed El Khalil, who went missing more than 10 years ago under unknown circumstances. Following pressure from Sahrawis, leader of Polisario Ibrahim Ghali said that he met a representative of the family of El Khalil on Saturday 16. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara reported that the Ghali handed a letter o he representative of the family, which will be read on Sunday in Laayoune. The leader of the separatist group also promised to find a solution to the disappearance of El Khalil. Several other news outlets reported that Ghali announced that Algerian authorities said that El Khalil is still alive. It is still remains to be seen whether Algeria and the Polisario Front are claiming El Khalil alive to avoid further pressure. In recent months, the separatist group and its supporters faced pressure and backlash when the family and relatives of El Khalil protested his disappearance several times. In February, Sahrawis took to the desert in Rabouni, where the Secretariat of the Polisario Front is located to condemn the disappearance. Some Sahrawis also launched an online campaign to draw attention to the kidnapping of the Polisario member. Friends and relatives of the kidnapped member also threatened to organize demonstrations in European capitals if their demands are not met. El Khalil was kidnapped by Algerian intelligence services in 2009 two months after Polisario appointed him to monitor human rights in Tindouf camps. The member of the front was born in Tan-Tan in southern Morocco. He decided to join Polisario in 1977.

Rabat – Morocco and Spain are studying the possibility to connect the two countries through an intercontinental railway line. In an interview with Anadolu Agency, Morocco’s State Secretary to the Minister of Equipment, Transport and Logistics Mohamed Najib Boulif said that both countries have been working on the intercontinental railway. “We are now in the process of deepening technical studies,” he said. The official added that companies from both sides are working “to find the best way for an intercontinental railway line, and the study related to the depth of the sea will propose a number of possible options.” Spain and Morocco, he said, will attempt to finish the study in one or two years to start the “important phase,” which is to look for investors to fund the project. Boulif recalled that the project has been supported by several Maghreb countries, including Mauritania and Libya. On January 31, the secretariat general of the Arab Maghreb Union said that it launched a campaign to attract international investors to renovate railways linking Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.  The ALU also launched a campaign to hire an adviser “whose task is to accomplish the promotion of the study on the economic feasibility of the project, and to communicate with international banks, international companies, and public and private sector companies.” Boulif’s announcement comes on the heel of the Spanish royal visit to Morocco.  King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain arrived in Morocco on Wednesday for a two-day official visit.  During the visit, both sides voiced their commitment to strengthening their diplomatic ties. The two countries also signed 11 agreements touching several areas, including energy, culture, and trade.

Rabat – Dozens of Algerians took to the streets to condemn the decision of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term in April’s presidential election. Protests against Bouteflika’s move took place in several cities across Algeria, including Algiers, Oran, Annaba, and Bataa. Protesters held banners reading “No fifth term. I am Algerian, I am against it.” Football fans in Algeria also protested Bouteflika’s decision. A video went viral of football fans shouting slogans against Bouteflika’s decision.  Algerian opposition party Rally for Culture and Democracy also denounced Bouteflika’s decision. The spokesperson of the party said that there “will be no election but an appointment of the head of state.” Algerian renowned sport commentator Hafid Derradji also criticized Bouteflika in several Facebook posts. In one of the posts, Derradji wrote that he is sad for his country. In another post, Derradji also criticized Algerian youth for not taking action to stop what is happening in the country’s political scene. In a third post, the beIN Sports journalist also cast doubt on Bouteflika’s ability to perform his constitutional duties. “Bouteflika did not run, nor can he make his candidacy, nor campaign, nor even oath.”  A group of Algerian activists also launched an online campaign using the hashtag “Let_Him_Rest,” implying that Algerian elites pushed Bouteflika to run for the fifth mandate. “A president who cannot carry out his duties towards the country and the people, a president who does not give speeches, does not sign decrees, does not appoint, does not sack, does not make field visits, does not meet invitations, does not receive heads of state, a [president] who does not declare war and peace is an illegal president according to Article 102 of the Constitution,” wrote the activists on their Facebook page. Bouteflika is in power since 1999.

Rabat – President of the Argentinian Football Association (AFA), Claudio Tapia said that he is not questioning Messi’s presence in the friendly game between Morocco and Argentina, which will take place on March 26 in Tangier. “I have no doubt that he will be there, I know how he feels about this shirt, without talking to him, I know he wants to go back, he never left,” Tapisa said as he was quoted by Spanish media. There has been speculation that Messi will finish his national team sabbatical for the first time since the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Goal.com quoted J former Argentina striker Javier Saviola, who said that Messi is still angry and hurt as he did not manage to clinch the World Cup trophy with his national team. Tapia argued that “football is a collective game, if we think that only one player will win the World Cup, is not right.” While some Moroccans expressed excitement to attend the friendly match, others expressed their discontent for the alleged amount Morocco would need to pay Messi  to attending the match. Some Moroccans started a boycott campaign on Facebook recently, calling for the match to be suspended and the money to be used to improve the lives of needy people. Morocco and Argentina last played each other in a friendly game in April 2004. They also faced off in the 1994 World Cup, when Argentina won 3-1.

Rabat – A video circulating on social media shows a section of books on fire, causing great panic among visitors. The fire was reported to have broken out in a bookstall inside the 25th edition of the Casablanca International Book Fair on Friday 15. According to organizers of the event, the fire burnt to ashes a number of book stalls, including a section for children’s literature books. The 25th edition of the Casablanca International Book Fair, which was inaugurated by the Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, hosts more than 700 exhibitors across 40 countries.  The fire seems to have been put out quickly before it could spread onto other book sections and possibly cause a conflagration. Luckily, the damage was not severe next to the sizeable number of book sections the fair housed.  No casualties were reported either as visitors were rushed outside to evacuate the venue.  Emergency teams were quick to extinguish the fire before it consumed more books. The fire gutted books in four stalls. The estimated number of books destroyed has yet to be reported as an investigation to the cost of damage is underway. The damage was apparently caused by a short-circuit.

Rabat – The Directorate of the Ministry of Education in Settat, the Casablanca-Settat regional prefecture, and Najiya Nadir signed two partnership agreements on Friday after Nadir donated MAD 12 million to build a number of schools in the region. Thanks to Nadir’s donations, a high school will be built in Oulad Fares, a small town and rural commune in Settat Province.  Nadir said that the purpose behind her initiative was to contribute to quality education in the country, especially in rural areas, noting the problems that children face when schools are too far for them, especially for rural girls who may become exposed to sexual abuse. “When schools are 15 or 20 kilometers from the children, they start to face challenges such as exposure to drug use or rape,” said Nadir. Nadir emphasized the importance of building schools, commenting on the large number of mosques that continue to be built in the country compared to the small number of schools in rural areas. “Although one can pray at home, you can find many mosques in one area, aligned to each other,” Nadir argued, stating that it is not the case for schools that are much needed. Nadir said that her initiative was also inspired by King Mohammed VI’s calls to improve and expand access to education.

Rabat – Faouzi Lakjaa, President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), declared on Thursday, February 14 that VAR technology will be introduced in the Moroccan football league starting next season. The decision to introduce VAR was made on Thursday during a meeting chaired by Lekjaa. The meeting was attended by coaches and referees so as to discuss solutions for a better future for Moroccan football. Lekjaa decided that referees will be trained so as to be ready for the next African Cup of Nations that will be held in Egypt in 2019. The VAR technology will be implemented to avoid referees mistakes similar to those during the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Morocco’s national football team was one of the teams that lost a chance to qualify for the second round of the World Cup finals due to injustice from a referee. In addition to VAR Lekjaa also announced that “meetings will be organized so as to discuss and analyse the mistakes that happen during matches.” The way that the VAR technology works is that it consists of referees and a replay operator. The staff work together to recommend the review of a mistake or a decision that was made. Afterward, the referee takes the appropriate action after reviewing the footage on the side of the playfield .

Rabat – The Moroccan National Coordination of Teachers “forced into contractual teaching,” (CNPCC), is urging contractual teachers to organize a march on February 20, to protest their situation. After vocational training academies across Morocco launched the call for contractual teachers of 2016, 2017, and 2018 groups to sign a contract extension, CNPCC released a statement on Tuesday, calling on all contract teachers to boycott the signing and join in a major protest. The CNPCC pointed out that the educational academies are breaching article 16 of the Organic Law for teachers that says educational institutions are not allowed to “renew employment contracts until they receive a qualification certificate.” The coordination accused the government of “discriminating between teachers” in Morocco through the contracts. Unlike permanent teachers, contractual teachers do not benefit from an employment law that protects their rights. Neither of the public or private employment sector laws protect the contractual teachers whose salary, although the same as their permanent counterparts, comes from the educational academies with whom they are contracted. Moreover, contractual teachers do not benefit from healthcare coverage and or a pension fund.  To the protesting contractual teachers, renewing the contracts would be like saying that they accept contractual teaching and think well of it. The contractual teachers are already on a five-day strike before their scheduled march on February 20, a contractual teacher told Morocco World News. In 2016, the Moroccan government allowed educational academies and vocational training centers to hire their own teachers through temporary contracts.

Rabat- Morocco’s foreign affairs ministry has positively reacted to the new US pro-Morocco spending bill, thanking its ally for what appears to be an endorsement of Morocco’s Western Sahara position. President Trump signed the new bill yesterday as he announced a definite end to the government shutdown that paralyzed federal activities for three weeks in January. In its section on US funds to Morocco, the new bill explicitly includes Western Sahara, suggesting that, in terms of foreign aid, Washington considers the disputed territories as part of Morocco. “The funds appropriated [to Morocco] under Title III shall also be made available for assistance in the Sahara,” reads part of the bill. While the bill’s language is reserved, diplomatic, and does not appear to overtly embrace Morocco’s position, its pro-Morocco sentiment is unmistakable, the ministry said in a statement. In its response, the Moroccan foreign affairs ministry said that US Congress’ adopting of the bill and the president’s signing and turning it into a law pointed to the strong alliance binding the two countries. “The US executive and legislative powers, embodied respectively by the President and the two Houses of the Congress, agree to consider the Sahara region as an integral part of Morocco and to make it benefit from co-operation funds in the same way as all the other regions of the Kingdom,” the ministry said in its statement. Also included in the new bill is a section where that called for greater collaboration between the US administration and special UN bodies, especially UNHCR and the World Food Program, to submit “report to the Congress on the measures taken to strengthen the monitoring of the delivery of humanitarian aid to refugees in the region of North Africa.” According to the ministry, that section is an obvious reference to Tindouf camps refugees. It said the section is an indication that Washington has taken into account Morocco’s repeated demands in recent years that more international action be taken to prevent Polisario’s perceived embezzlement and mismanagement of humanitarian assistance to the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – Ilias, a 15-year-old Moroccan lost his life on February 14 in the port of Ceuta. 

Originally from Martil, he had been living in Ceuta for two months “in an attempt to hide inside a vehicle and migrate to Europe,” according to El Faro de Ceuta. 

Ilis “was seriously wounded in the head and died almost instantly” despite the presence of the emergency services, the newspaper recounted. 

According to the local Spanish authorities, the boy died as a result of a collision between a truck and a nacelle carrying an excavator. 

Ceuta’s Civil Guardia opened an investigation on the tragedy and the port cameras will be examined to find out its circumstances. 

“The deceased is said to have made several attempts to travel to the peninsula in this way,” said El Faro de Ceuta.

The Caballas coalition, a left-wing Spanish party, convened for one minute of silence before the city hall.

Mohamed Ali, the spokesman for the party, criticized local institutions.

“We believe that the minute of silence should serve in this city as a turning point for a change in mentality, not only of citizens but also of political institutions in the face of the phenomenon of unaccompanied foreign minors,” said Ali. “No one denies that more resources are needed or that the State should be more involved. Criminalizing this group, which is only trying to build a better future for itself, is unacceptable.”  “We have to blame the institutions that have created a hostile climate towards these minors,” he added.

Last month, the party was said to plan to propose at the Assembly of Ceuta a parliamentary initiative to urge the Government of Spain to “negotiate a new Good Neighbor Treaty with Morocco,” according to Europa Press. The treaty should “defend” both territories of the process of “economic suffocation” that they consider Morocco has “devised on them to advance its annexationist” demands, the party said.

Among other things, the text of the proposal calls for is creating new coordination mechanisms between the two countries to address “the phenomenon of unaccompanied foreign minors.” This is the second immigrant death in the port of Ceuta in less than a year. In June, a teenager, identified by his friends as Omar ‘Susi,’ 16 years old, was crushed to death by a truck. The Civil Guard arrested two drivers involved in the fatal incident, one of them for homicide, said El Faro. In October, two hundred migrants attempted to jump the border between Morocco and Melilla. One of the migrants died of a heart attack.

In July, at least 600 migrants crossed the border from Morocco to the Spanish enclave Ceuta.

In 2018, almost all of the 3,344 unaccompanied minors from the MENA region who entered Ceuta were Moroccan. The number of unaccompanied and underage migrants from MENA crossing to the Ceuta border increased by over 400 percent compared to in 2017.

Rabat – The International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) has called on the Alsa bus company in Tangier to take immediate action regarding the “concerted campaign to persecute union activists there,” said ITF in a press statement shared with Morocco World News. 

Unite the Union (“Unite”), the UK’s largest union, has publicly backed this call.

In a statement, ITF inland transport section secretary Noel Coard said that  Alsa workers recently started to work with the Moroccan Labor Union (UMT) to establish a separate trade union.  He added that Alsa officials subjected the workers to a “campaign of intimidation and persecution.” 

According to ITF’s statement, Alsa offered the workers “incentives to leave the union,” before it dismissed UMT’s general secretary in Tangier, Jamal Al Sharfi, on Thursday. Al Sharfi faced “serious accusations about his conduct.”

“The management at Alsa in Tangier clearly can’t stand the idea of their workers getting organised,” said Coard. “Their behaviour is totally unacceptable and will not succeed,” he added.

In a statement to the UMT, Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: “similar behaviour in the United States via their US subsidiary Durham and just as we did then, we will ensure it is immediately raised with their parent company, National Express here in the UK.”  In 2005, National Express bought most of the operations of Spanish transport operator Alsa, which manages buses in Morocco, Spain, and Portugal. Unite and Arriva Durham County Ltd will hold talks tomorrow to try to resolve a payment dispute as bus strikes continue, according to Unite’s website.

“It is unacceptable for global companies who work with us well here in the UK to operate in an aggressive, anti-union way elsewhere across the globe.” ITF plans to “industrial, political and legal” actions to defend the UMT, starting on Monday. Last July, amid a major boycott protesting high commodity prices, Alsa announced a MAD 1 increase in its ticket prices. ITF represents 18 million workers in 665 transport workers trade unions across 147 countries.

Rabat – Ahmed Bin Abdulaziz, younger brother of King Salman of Saudi Arabia,  arrived in Morocco’s Laayoune on February 12 for a private visit. The arrival of the Saudi coincided with news of growing tensions between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Prior to the Saudi prince’s trip to Morocco, the Polisario thanked the Saudi kingdom for supposedly siding with their separatist claims on Western Sahara.  During his visit, however, Bin Abdulaziz shunned Polisario’s expectations, ditching claims that Saudi Arabia has been now reconsidering its position on the Western Sahara conflict. Meanwhile, pro-Polisario media that had praised Riyadh is now been complaining against the visit of the Saudi prince to Laayoune. Separatist news outlet FuturoSahara reported that a Saudi prince is “conducting an illegal visit to the occupied city of Laayoune” in Western Sahara to practice bird hunting. Emirati news outlet Erem News reported that the visit of the Saudi prince “destroys speculations” that there is a tension between Rabat and Riyadh. In recent weeks, the Polisario Front took advantage of the alleged tension between Morocco and Saudi Arabia after Saudi-government owned television channel Al Arabiya aired an unfriendly documentary against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Following rumors that Morocco recalled its ambassador Saudi Arabia to make a bold statement against a Morocco-hostile documentary made by the Saudis,  Polisario’s “ambassador” to Algiers Abdelkader Taleb thanked Saudi Arabia for its position in an interview with Algerian news agency APS. He also welcomed reforms made by King Salman of Saudi Arabia, including on Western Sahara, saying the conflict has enjoyed “reconsideration” from Saudi Arabia. Morocco’s government has denied any possible tension between Saudi Arabia, or any other Gulf country. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that Morocco maintains strong diplomatic ties between all Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Rabat – At a news conference in the White House’s Rose Garden yesterday, President Trump controversially called for a national emergency and announced his signing of a sweeping 2019 spending bill which he said would avoid a repeat of a painful government shutdown. The bill includes sections that favor Morocco’s Western Sahara position, suggesting that after a period of doubt in President Trump’s first months in power, the two allies are again set on a good course. Trump’s Rose Garden address, which essentially laid out the president’s high-handed take on border security, saw him complain that waves of “aliens” that have been invading the US. The spending bill he pledged for as a consequence includes bolder moves to unlock the funds needed to build his “Mexico Wall.” The move is reportedly not sitting well with policymakers in Washington, with dissenting voices condemning the circumstances of the president’s national emergency call as an assault on the separation of powers. Reiterating US support for Morocco Elsewhere, though, a bit farther from the seemingly shambolic US domestic scene, the bill that Trump signed on Friday reiterates US support for Morocco. It seals the previous pro-Morocco steps that both the president and the two houses of the US Congress had taken earlier this year. President Trump signed a similar spending bill in late January, but back then it was simply a temporary move to secure a partial end to the painful government shutdown. The country was just emerging from a three-week government shutdown, the longest in US history, and there were reports of US government workers turning to food banks to survive. “I will sign a bill to open our government for three weeks… Over the next 21 days I expect that both Democrats and Republicans will operate in good faith,” Trump said at the time. But having failed to secure the “cooperation” he had hoped to get from Democrats for his migration policies, Trump said he felt compelled to resolve to the boldness he seemed to embrace in his Friday address. The 2019 spending bill would still prevail, but it felt burdensome to wait for all the normal congressional procedures and the traditional hurdles of Washington politicking, Trump suggested as he announced his national emergency. “I didn’t need to do this. I just want to get it done faster.” While the bill is allegedly vague and –understandably— controversial on US domestic issues, it is unequivocally pro-Morocco and unusually forthcoming on US development funds for Western Sahara. It reiterates Morocco’s position that Western Sahara should be considered as part of the US aids funds allocated to Morocco. “Funds appropriated under title III of this Act shall be made available for assistance for the Western Sahara,” read the bill’s “Morocco” section. The bill also calls for better monitoring of the humanitarian aid to the Tindouf camps’ “vulnerable refugees.” The plea for international action to better track whether Tindouf-bound humanitarian assistance does actually reach its rightful recipients has been a crucial point of order in Morocco’s Western Sahara diplomacy. Morocco-US relations have been erratic in recent months, culminating in heightened doubts in Rabat when National Security Advisor John Bolton appeared to embrace Polisario-friendly rhetoric when he unveiled the US Africa strategy in December 2018. In more recent weeks, however, the relationship seems to be reverting back to its traditional line, with Washington viewing—and treating—Rabat as its most reliable and strongest ally in North Africa.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Education has launched Tadkik (audit), an online platform for students who will sit for the baccalaureate exam in June. Tadkik service, launched on Friday, will help the baccalaureate candidates of the 2018-2019 school year to keep track of their student profile database and scores. The aim of the platform is to avoid errors in student profiles. Mistakes in student profiles potentially alter candidates personal data and scores. Students will be able to access their personal data and report errors.  The ministry stated that students must verify that all their personal data are correct. In case some information is missing or mistaken, students should report the errors by February 24. The 2019 baccalaureate exam will take place between June 11-14, while the baccalaureate make up exams will be from July 4 to 8. The Ministry of Education launched Tadkik online service for the first time last year. In the 2017-2018 school year, 187,138 students have passed the exam in the ordinary June session, while the success rate of “free baccalaureate” exam takers, who could not attend regular courses for reasons such as work or health issues, was 24.92 percent.  The country’s highest baccalaureate grade in the 2017-2018 academic year was 19.44 out of 20 in physics and French literature, recorded in the Marrakech region, including the coastal city of Safi.

Rabat – Namibia and South Africa, which support Polisario’s separatist claims, will chair a conference to reiterate support for the Polisario Front. A statement issued by the South African government announced that the two African countries will co-host the SADC Solidarity Conference on Western Sahara in South Africa on March 25-26. “We want to emphasize that the solution to the question of Western Sahara should be based on the principle of self-determination and decolonisation,” reads the statement. Morocco, whose genuine investments in developing southern provinces have been acknowledged by many foreign diplomats, holds a position that favors local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty.  The principles underpinning Rabat’s position are laid out in the 2007 Autonomy Plan, a document that a number of international observers, including the UN, have described as “serious,” “credible,” and “realistic” for brokering a lasting settlement to the Sahara conflict. But South Africa and Namibia, hostile to Morocco’s position on the conflict, are supporting the “holding of a referendum that will lead to its [Western Sahara’s] independence.” The two government also linked the Western Sahara conflict to the Palestinian cause, claiming their support to “the people of Palestine who continue to suffer under severe repression and denial of basic human rights and we reiterate our support for a two-state solution.” The announcement comes as no surprise given South Africa’s well-established pro-Polisario moves in the Western Sahara dispute.  Most recently, when South Africa was elected to a two-year tenure as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council,  the South African president also pledged to use his country mandate to promote “self-determination for Sahrawis.”   He said that his country “ stands “alongside the Polisario Front and the leaders of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in their struggle for full sovereignty over all their territory.” Tension erupted between Morocco and South Africa in 2014, when Pretoria recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR.) South Africa has been one of the most active vocal supporters of the separatist group. It also joined the Algerian lobby to thwart Moroccan efforts and attempts to find a mutually accepted political solution to the conflict. Namibia and South Africa along with Algeria are among the states that opposed Morocco’s decision to return to the African Union. Observers had predicted that  Ramaphosa would show anti-Moroccan sentiments on the Western Sahara conflict when he came to power.  Before Ramaphosa emerged as president, Morocco and South Africa were engaged in an unprecedented process of diplomatic rapprochement.   Morocco’s government, however, is certain that the AU no longer plays a determining role in the Western Sahara conflict.  The organization’s latest report on the Sahara question, which was unveiled by  chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat in July 2018, maintains the centrality of the UN-led process. In the document,  the AU vowed uncompromising support for the UN Security Council agenda.

By Amal El Attaq Rabat – The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development, the Research Institute of Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN) and the Secretariat of the Moroccan-German Energy Partnership (PAREMA) organized a workshop to discuss ‘Power to X’ technology. Held in Rabat, on Monday, February 11, the workshop gathered public authorities, researchers, and private stakeholders all working to improve the North African country’s energy sector.  “Power to X” (or “P2X”) is a technology that allows the transformation of electricity into another energy vector. This vector “X” may cover some industrial or mobility needs. It can also be a synthetic gas such as hydrogen. After setting up a national commission to display a ‘Power to X’ roadmap, the workshop sheds light on the “Power-to-X” technology and its opportunities in Morocco. The workshop was also an opportunity to explore the economic and environmental benefits of ‘Power-to-X’ sectors in Morocco, with the aim to develop the local industry to achieve strong export potential. Promising prospects During the workshop, the German institutes Fraunhofer IMWS, IGB, and ISI, presented two study results which highlighted some of the prospective economic and environmental benefits of ‘Power-to-X’ in some sectors in Morocco. “Due to its relevant geographical location and exceptional potential in wind and solar energy, Morocco could capture a significant share of demand for ‘Power-to-X’, ranging between two and four percent of the global demand in 2030,” according to the studies. A new study is scheduled to concretize the roadmap into a project to develop Morocco’s experience in this area and make it an investment platform.  In his introductory speech, Badr Ikken, General Director of IRESEN, shared his optimism about the future of the sector in Morocco. Ikken presented the new Moroccan research platform for the Power-to-X, highlighting the efforts being invested to bring the sector to new heights.  With an estimated budget of 150 MMAD, IRESEN will be dedicated to R&amp;D (development and research) demonstration of “Power-To-X” technologies.  Ikken explained that the institute will mobilize a diversified research program on hydrogen application in the production of green molecules such as Methanol or Ammoniac.

Rabat – The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) rejected Mansour’s appeal against his expulsion from Denmark to Morocco for terrorism-related convictions. A court in Denmark had convicted Mansour of incitement to terrorism for Facebook posts praising Osama bin Laden and encouraging followers to join the al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, according to Al Jazeera. ECHR rejected the appeal based on Morocco’s reassurance that the country would not physically harm, torture, or execute Mansour. “This appears to be a thorough, well-considered decision, which we take into account,” Mansour’s defence lawyer Michael Juul Eriksen told Danish Ritzau news agency via written message. Mansour’s appeal was based on three elements of the ECHR, mainly article 3, which states that “no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. “The court finds, based on international material, that the human rights situation in Morocco has generally improved over several years, and that authorities are working to comply with international human rights,” the court wrote in its verdict, according to Ritzau’s report. Saïd Mansour claimed he would be  in danger in Morocco for his critical opinions on King Mohammed VI and the Moroccan government.  Moroccan ambassador to Denmark had previously stated that Mansour is suspected of being part of the 2003 Casablanca bombings in which 45 were killed including 12 terrorists. He was also found guilty of editing and publishing three books of terrorist propaganda. Mansour was stripped of his Danish citizenship in 2015.

Rabat – In response to the Competition Council’s statement that capping fuel prices would hurt Moroccan oil market, the minister of public affairs and governance, Lahcen Daoudi, tweeted today that his ministry will proceed with its decision to cap fuel prices. The move will be made in coordination with various industry stakeholders, according to Daoudi. Competition Council President Driss Guerraoui said earlier today that the government’s decision to cap fuel prices was unnecessary and would harm industry stakeholders.

Guerraoui told a press conference that the decision to cap up prices was “a real danger that could harm the small and medium-size stakeholders, making them more vulnerable.”

Not only will the government’s choice to cap prices not be sufficient from an economic and competitive point of view, Guerraoui argued, but it would also be harmful from a social justice perspective. Guerraoui noted that this measure was already tested between December 2014 and December 2015 without achieving the expected results. He attributed the first failed attempt to the fact that stakeholders “generally adopt the fixed maximum prices without any effort to reduce them.”

Guerraoui noted that the government’s request “did not meet the legal requirements of the Law on Freedom of Prices and Competition, which requires provisional measures aimed at temporarily excluding a product or service from free prices.”

According to Article 4 of the Law on Freedom of Prices and Competition, the administration may “take temporary measures against excessive price increases or decreases caused by exceptional, catastrophic or manifestly unusual market conditions in a sector,” after consulting the Competition Council. 
The article allows the government to cap fuel prices within six months, subject to a one-time extension.

In a press release issued earlier this month, Daoudi said that the opinion of the competition council was “not binding,” adding that the government will “cap prices regardless of the council’s position.”

Daoudi is seeking to conclude a permanent agreement with companies as part of the negotiations conducted by the Moroccan Petroleum Group (GPM). The aim is to set a maximum profit that different companies can make, regardless of whether global market prices rise or fall.

By Rahma Ouled Cherif Rabat – Wednesday, the 13th marked the day of the royal dinner that was organized in honor of Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia during their second official visit in Morocco.  Queen Letizia wore a silk white dress adorned with a sheer white tulle tunic during the evening for a gala dinner that was hosted in the royal castle in Rabat.  As the dinner adjourned and the temperature dropped, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, adorning the King’s cape that the monarch gave to her after she grew cold, were escorted out of the castle.  In addition to King Mohammed VI’s galant gesture, the Spanish royal couple spent their time at the Rabat royal palace in the company of Moulay El Hassan crown prince, whose attire for official events consists of Moroccan cape including modern suits, Prince Moulay Rachid as well as Moroccan royal princesses, Princess Lalla Asma, Princess  Lalla Hasna, and Princess Lalla Oum Keltoum. During the royal dinner, King Mohammed VI wore a traditional Moroccan attire that consisted of a white selham, a handmade cape from a blend of wool and cotton, over a yellow djellaba embellished with a blue sfifa along with beige shoes. The King’s gallant act of providing Spain’s Queen Letizia with his cape did not go unnoticed on social media. Many users commented on the nobility and chivalry of the King. The King’s gesture is hardly a one-off, they said in chorus, highlighting that the act characterizes the King’s generous nature.  The dinner, which was organized in honor of the Spanish royal couple, provided a perfect atmosphere for discussions of improving the relationship between the two nations. With the aesthetic lighting, a Moroccan banquet and attendees in luxurious formal wear, the royal dinner ended on a perfect note.

Rabat – Announced earlier this week to represent Morocco at the Mideast conference in Poland, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister held a conference  with his Spanish counterpart instead. On Monday, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jacek Czaputowicz  confirmed that Morocco will be represented at the Middle East Conference in Warsaw by  Nasser Bourita. But Bourita appears to have ditched the ongoing Warsaw Mideast Conference. Instead, the minister chaired a joint press conference with his Spanish counterpart on the Spanish-Moroccan diplomatic ties in conjunction with the Spanish royal visit to Rabat. Bourita’s decision comes against the backdrop of aggravating concerns in Morocco’s relations with a number of Mideast players, including most recently Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Although Rabat has consistently played down the gravity of growing signs of disagreements with Riyadh on numerous regional dossiers, including the Yemen War and the Trump’s administration’s Palestine’s agenda, public discourse indicates that the Saudi-Moroccan alliance is far from unaffected by recent developments. Meanwhile, Spain has been a strong and valuable Moroccan ally. When some voices in Brussels expressed concerns about the prospects of EU-Morocco cooperation, especially on migration and fisheries, Madrid repeatedly sided with Morocco.  Spanish authorities on various occasions voiced support for a number of Moroccan demands to the EU, saying that the success of the EU policies on security and migration passes through solid partnership with Morocco. Mohcine Jazouli represents Morocco But in a bid to avoid raising any further concerns  or upset the other attendees of the US-organized Warsaw conference, the Moroccan diplomacy did outright snub the event.  Instead, Minister delegate for African cooperation, Mohcine Jazouli, flew to Warsaw to take part in the event, which is taking place in the presence of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Israel, UAE and Kuwait.  The conference aims to discuss the challenges and humanitarian issues facing the Middle East. During the meeting’s session on countering terrorism and illegal financing” on Thursday , El Jazouli spoke about Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy.. He said that the Moroccan strategy in curbing radicalization and fighting violent extremism has become a reference at the  global and regional levels. He also added that countering terrorism is a shared responsibility because it requires the mobilization of the international community. The official added that the international community’s effort might help curb the scourge of terrorism. Morocco’s anti-extremism strategy is recognized in the international community.  Morocco ranked 132 out of 163 in the 2018 Terrorism Index report, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. Despite collecting plaudits for its performance on security, Morocco has  introduced in recent years a number of new measures to upgrade its anti-terrorism architecture.  The upgraded hard security measures include, among others, regional cooperation, intelligence sharing, the promotion of moderate Islam, and democratic reform. The strategy also includes renovation and upgrading of mosques, making official lists of imams public, training imams, and reviewing laws governing worship sites.

Rabat – International observers are following the recent developments in Saudi-Moroccan relations carefully. While some predict the tension is just a passing cloud, others suggest that Morocco should reconsider entirely its diplomatic ties with the Saudi government. The timeline below gives an overview of the start of the friction between Morocco and Saudi Arabia. November 2017: Morocco’s blockade-breaking hurts Saudi hopes When Saudi Arabia and three allies decided to enforce a hard blockade in May 2017 on Qatar, Morocco’s refusal to back the Saudi-led coalition angered the peninsula. Morocco has remained neutral throughout the Gulf crisis. King Mohammed VI even flew to Qatar on November 12, 2017. Upon his arrival in Qatar from the UAE, Qatari media welcomed the monarch, naming him the “first blockade breaker.” The King also ordered the Moroccan government to send food assistance to Qatar. The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs then cited religion as a reason “especially during the month of Ramadan where solidarity among Muslim people is required.” Saudi Arabia was not at all please with Morocco’s neutrality, especially because Morocco and Saudi Arabia share historical and strong ties. March: Putting Saudi Arabia’s interests first It all started with a tweet, when an adviser of the Saudi royal family indirectly attacked Morocco nearly four months before the vote on the 2026 World Cup host. Then head of the Saudi sports authority, Turki Al Sheikh, became known for his unfriendly comments about Morocco throughout the World Cup bid process. On March 18, 2018, Al Sheikh started politicizing the 2026 World Cup bid, posting a tweet to announce his country’s indirect position on the 2026 World Cup bid. In his first tweet, Al Sheikh said that neither of the World Cup bidders asked for Saudi Arabia’s support. But in case someone asked for backup, Saudi Arabia would vote for the country that would best serve its interests. “If someone ever asks, we will look for Saudi Arabia’s interests first.” Al Sheikh at that time also granted interviews, touting the strong diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and the US and describing Trump’s administration as their “strongest allies.” In an interview with a Saudi-based sports news outlet, Al Sheikh said, “Friendship and Fraternity have been very detrimental to the Saudis… what really matters to me is that the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted in the best conditions,” implying that these conditions would not be met in Morocco. March: It was all about Qatar Al Sheikh’s proximity to the Saudi royal family, especially Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, makes it likely the monarchy was aware of his tweets and stance against Morocco. Al Sheikh’s first tweet was not the last. The second tweet came four hours after the first and clarified his position against Morocco. “Some people went astray. If you want support, you should seek it in Doha . What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you. A message from the Gulf to the Ocean.” The message referenced Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf Crisis between Al Thani’s government in Qatar and Saudi Arabia’s coalition.  The tweet also coincided with the final campaign to gather votes for the hosting rights of the 2026 World Cup. Morocco had filed its dossier to host the 2026 World Cup but lost the vote when a majority of countries, including Arab countries, voted for the North American bid. More than that, Al Sheikh considered Moroccan neutrality in the Gulf Crisis as a threat to the diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Morocco took a neutral stance because of its strong bonds with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. April: A purely political move Adding insult to injury for Morocco, Al Sheikh posted a picture of himself with the chairman of the joint North American bid for the World Cup.  The photo of Al Sheikh and the chairman exchanging a firm handshake and wearing large smiles spoke for itself. “I was pleased to meet Mr. Carlos Cordeiro, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, and chairman of the United 2026,” said Al Sheikh. Up until then, Saudi Arabia had not voiced direct support for the United 2026 World Cup bid. April: A hopeful selfie Al Sheikh’s comments faded when a selfie of King Mohammed VI, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Lebanese Prime Minister Saad El Hariri was shared online. The selfie, taken and shared by Hariri on April 9, made observers forget about Saudi-Moroccan tension, thinking the picture was “worth more than a thousand words.” But a few months after the selfie, Morocco would be stunned by Saudi Arabia’s conduct in Moscow. Decisive June June was the decisive month for both the Moroccan and United bids. Morocco was shocked, however, to find that Saudi Arabia officially lobbied against the Moroccan bid. On June 4 Saudi Arabia announced its decision to officially back the US.  “We weighed the issue and, in the end, we went with what was in the best interest of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” said Al Sheikh, saying that the country gave its word to the Americans. Saudi Arabia launched a last-minute campaign on June 11 and 12, pressuring countries to vote for United 2026. On June 13, Morocco’s bid was knocked out of the race with only 65 votes, 33 percent of the vote. United 2026 won the rights to host with 67 percent of the vote at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. Several Arab countries voted against Morocco, including Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates. Several African countries also voted for the North American bid, including Namibia, South Africa, and Liberia. Post-World Cup feud Morocco considered the votes of African and Arab countries against Morocco as betrayal.  Then another alleged crisis between Morocco and Saudi Arabia erupted. Known for his extravagant summer holidays in Morocco, Saudi King Salman instead chose to spend his summer 2018 vacation in the newly planned city of Neom, Saudi Arabia, for “business reasons.” The decision raised more media speculations from both parties. Moroccan and international analysts also started noticing Morocco’s absence in meetings held in Saudi Arabia and joint military symposiums. On June 15, Morocco’s Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj said that that he would not participate in the meeting of communication ministers in the Coalition Supporting Legitimacy in Yemen on June 23 in Saudi Arabia because of his busy agenda. Speculations also ran wild that Morocco withdrew its troops from Yemen. Morocco shunned a joint naval exercise called the Red Waves 1 held in Saudi Arabia from December 30 to January 4, 2019. October: Khashoggi murder ‘seen’ by Morocco Arab countries and the Saudi coalition showed full support for Saudi Arabia after international media accused the Saudi crown prince and the Saudi royal family of being involved in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Several countries condemned the killing of the journalist and its potential link to Mohammed bin Salman. Some countries also said that Saudi Arabia had crossed a “red line.” In contrast to other Arab countries, Morocco did not express support for the Saudi royal family. November: Morocco snubs bin Salman In the aftermath of the murder, bin Salman announced a world tour with stops in Maghreb countries, including Tunisia and Algeria. Several political observers then questioned his decision not to include Morocco in his agenda. But Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita confirmed that Morocco had been on MBS’s schedule. A source from the government told Morocco World News that the visit could not be made because King Mohammed VI said that he could not receive bin Salman personally, suggesting his brother Prince Moulay Rachid meet MBS instead. Saudi Arabia, however, refused Morocco’s alternative. Bourita said that bin Salman did not visit Morocco because of King Mohammed VI’s schedule, but said no disagreement should be inferred from the occasion. “If relationships are measured by different schedules, this trivializes the relationship.” Second target: Territorial integrity After accomplishing the World Cup mission, Al Sheikh eyed Morocco’s territorial integrity as his next target. The Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA), chaired by Turki Al Sheikh, posted online a Moroccan map split into three parts, excluding Western Sahara from Morocco.  The UAFA later deleted the map and apologized, but the same scene repeated itself by another football organization under Al Sheikh’s leadership. Egypt’s Pyramid football club, owned by Al Sheikh, posted a similar map, making the maps associated with Al Sheikh appear uncoincidental. January: Moroccan government does not feel the tension yet In January, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita had an interview with Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera. Saudi-Moroccan diplomatic ties came up in the interview. Bourita denied that there is tension between Morocco and Saudi Arabia but acknowledged that Morocco’s participation in Yemen has changed. A week after the interview, the Associated Press reported that a Moroccan government source said that Morocco recalled its ambassador from Saudi Arabia. The news came after Saudi news channel Al Arabiya aired an unfriendly documentary against Morocco’s territorial integrity, calling Western Sahara an “occupied” territory and putting Morocco and Polisario on an equal footing. Bourita, however, denied the news, emphasizing that Morocco has its own channels to announce such news if they are true. Bourita also implied that Morocco’s ambassador was summoned for consultations regarding the Saudi-Morocco diplomatic ties and nothing else. Other rumors abounded that Morocco also summoned its ambassador to the UAE. Both diplomats reportedly returned to their offices after consultations in Rabat.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – In a serious blunder, Al jazeera news channel mistook the controversial Moroccan actress Loubna Abidar for the granddaughter of late Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Al Jazeera posted a picture of Abidar on its official Facebook page on Thursday, accompanying the photograph with general information on Hussein’s granddaughter. The mistake occurred as Al Jazeera announced their program with a rundown of written information on the family of the late Iraqi president Saddam Hussein following his downfall. Internet users were quick to spot the error, with some describing it as an “unforgivable journalistic blunder.” Others, more understanding, ascribed the mistake to the heavy workload, stress, and exhaustion that journalists have to handle. Following the public uproar on social media, Al Jazeera quickly removed the Facebook post. This mistake is not the first of its kind. Saudi outlet Al Arabia has made a similar mistake.  In May 2017, the channel presented the Moroccan singer Maria Nadim as sister of Salman Ramadan Abedi, the terrorist attack who carried out the Manchester Arena bombing. Abidar’s role as a prostitute in the movie “Much Loved”, depicting Morocco’s sex industry, has made headlines and raised public concern within the Moroccan society since its release in 2016. Moroccan liberals welcomed “Much Loved” as a much-needed take on the patriarchal codes governing what they see as the country’s hypocrisy-ladden sexual norms. They celebrated Abidar and Nabil Ayouch, the movie’s director, for their courage in confronting one of Morocco’s most entrenched social taboos. For conservative Moroccans, however, the movie was a “disgrace” to the country’s image and reputation. Abidar, who subsequently said she faced death threats and online abuses for not being representative of the pious and polite Moroccan woman for her role as a prostitute, has since fled to France.

Rabat – Chili has joined Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to present a collective bid to host the 2030 World Cup. Chilean president Sebastian Pinera took to his Twitter account to announce the news on Thursday. “Presidents of the Argentine Republic, Mauricio Macri, of the Republic of Chile, Sebastián Pinera, of the Republic of Paraguay, Mario Abdo; and of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, Tabaré Vázquez, have agreed to present their joint candidacy to organize the 2030 World Cup,” tweeted Pinera. In October 2017, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay informed FIFA of their joint candidacy for hosting the 2030 World Cup.  Pinera explained that he proposed to his three counterparts his country’s intention to be part of the joint candidacy for the World Cup several months ago. Uruguay was the winner the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930, which the South American country hosted, and that Paraguay is the only nation to have never organized it, in opposition to Argentina (1978), and Chili (1962). Other countries have also expressed their will to jointly organize the big football event. Spain, Portugal, and Morocco are considering a joint bid.  During an official visit to Morocco in late 2018, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez reiterated his country’s desire to team up with Morocco and Portugal to co-organize the first ever transcontinental World Cup.  Additional joint European candidacies may also be submitted by Greece, Romania, Serbia, and Bulgaria. England and Ireland are also reportedly in discussion to present a joint bid. Morocco, which in June 2018 lost its bid to host the 2026 World Cup, has been intent on organizing the footballing showpiece.  Soon after losing the 2026 bid to the North American trio, Canada-U.S-Mexico, Morocco notified FIFA of its bid to organize the 2030 World. That bid will be Morocco’s sixth attempt, following its previous bids for the 1994, 1998, 2006, 2010, and 2026 tournaments.

Rabat – Men and women, old and young, carrying Palestinian flags and chanting slogans,“ No to normalization of Zionism,” and “get out Macias.” Protesters gathered yesterday in front of Megarama, the movie theatre where Enrico Macias’ Valentine’s day concert was taking place.   The Moroccan branch of Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement, the global movement that promotes the Palestinian cause, organized the protest. The event witnessed speeches from protesters who read out evidence of Macias’ “unconditional loyalty” and “support for the Zionist regime,” describing the singer as a defender of the Israeli occupation in Palestine. The demonstrators mentioned that Macias pledged support for a number of Zionist entities in 2006. The same accusation had been levelled against the singer by the Moroccan Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (MACBI) which was the first to urge Moroccans to boycott Macias. MACBI emphasized in a statement on January 13 that Macias is giving his “blood, sweat and tears” to the association Migdal, which supports the Israel border police.  Protesters also referred to Macias’ reaction to boycott threats by Moroccans. They said that the singer “insulted Moroccans before he even arrived in Morocco.” Macias had said on the French Radio network RMC on February 1 that he did not care about the boycott threats. “My victory will be to go and perform in Casablanca … I am going and whomever wants to attend is welcome,” said Macias. Rejecting Macias, calling for criminalization of the “normalization” of Zionism, and condemning authorities’ decision to allow Macias’ concert, protesters said: “Casablanca is the city of activism against Zionism,” and “Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine.” Protesters also denounced the rumored visit of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has reiterated his statements on the reported spat with Saudi Arabia. He says there is no tension between Morocco and its Saudi ally. Speaking at a joint press conference with his Spanish counterpart Josep Borrell, Bourita said that Morocco has not recalled its ambassadors to UAE and Saudi Arabia.  Rabat has instead summoned its representatives in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi for “consultations on the profound chances that the Gulf region is experiencing at the level of relations between” Gulf countries and Morocco, Bourita argued. He added that “it is normal that the two ambassadors are in Rabat because Morocco wants to know what is happening” in the region. Doubling down on his denial of news reports of escalating tensions between Rabat and its Gulf allies, the Moroccan official insisted that Morocco enjoys strong and historic diplomatic ties with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  Speculations ran wild in recent weeks on possible diplomatic tensions between Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The speculation resulted from a documentary aired by  Saudi government-owned news outlets against Morocco’s position in the regional conflict over the Sahara. The documentary prompted Moroccan observers to demand that the Moroccan government  reconsider diplomatic ties with the Gulf country. Following rumores that Morocco recalled  both ambassadors from Saudi Arabia and UAE, Bourita denied the news. He especially stressed that the “Moroccan diplomacy has a history of announcing such news through its own channels.” This is the third time that Bourita has reassured that there has been no diplomatic  tension between Morocco and the two Gulf countries. The first time that Bourita talked about Saudi-Moroccan diplomatic ties was in an interview with Qatari television channel Al Jazeera. In the interview, Bourita acknowledged that Morocco’s participation in the Yemen war has changed. He maintained, however, that diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia have not been by Rabat’s withdrawal from the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.  Bourita said that Morocco’s decision to withdraw from the coalition in Yemen was dictated by humanitarian considerations.

Rabat – Since Algeria’s ruling party announced recently that President Bouteflika is their “ideal candidate” for the upcoming April 18 presidential elections, critics have been quick to lambast the president for clinging to power despite his concerning health status. Domestic and foreign Algeria watchers, including journalists, analysts, and academics, have hit at what they call a “dysfunctional” and “paralyzed” regime led by “an old, ailing” and “medically unfit” president who appears to have no interest in handing over state power to a new political generation. France’s Le Monde newspaper is the latest agency to join the chorus of voices decrying the ailments of the Bouteflika regime, pointing out the president’s “wrong” decision to run for a fifth term. “In Algeria, There is a Power Fossilization,” the French newspaper headlined a recent scathing editorial on the ills and unfulfilled promises of the Algerian regime. “At 81, Abdelaziz Bouteflika is set to secure a fifth term, bad news for the Algerian population suffocated by a paralyzed regime,” Le Monde wrote.
Bouteflika came to power in 1999 and won the hearts and minds of Algerians. The country was coming out of a harsh civil war and extremism was rampant in the late 90s when Bouteflika rose to political prominence. In his first years in power, he stabilized the economy and brought social peace. Unsustainable social contract But, le Monde explained, the last five years have been trying times for Algerians, whose frustration hit its highest level as it faced a regime more concerned with securing its own survival its grip on the country’s resources rather than take the “courageous” and “much-needed” decision to leave the room for a new generation of leaders. “This is bad news for Algeria,” the newspaper said referring to the ruling party’s determination to have its “ideal candidate” elected on April 18. “The fossilization of power seals the rupture between society and the highest echelons of the state, with the two living two different stories.” At the summit sits a power-hungry elite still living in the “victorious” years of the independence war and the tough 1990s, while at the bottom waits a frustrated and “young society hungry to live in the 21st century but suffocated by the straitjacket imposed from above,” according to Le Monde. After emerging as president at the end of the 1990s and until the heat of the Arab Spring in 2011, Bouteflika succeeded to maintain his grip on power by “buying” the support of Algerians through lavish government spending that guaranteed socio-economic security. But that once successful social contract is no longer sustainable. Young Algerians aspire to change but are faced with an “anachronistic regime whose only option is immobilism,” the newspaper argued. Criticism, sometimes even far harsher than Le Monde’s, has also come from domestic observers. In a recent Facebook post, Algerian journalist Hafid Derradji berated President Bouteflika over his decision to ignore his failing health to run again for president. “We are ashamed to belong to this miserable generation that accepts humiliation, and is pleased to have its honor and homeland raped by a vicious gang and a renegade,” read Derradji’s post.

It was only this week that the court released the full text containing details of the case. The details of the case go back to June of 2018 in Larache near Tangier, when the wife had asked for a divorce, a request which her husband did not take very well despite their growing marital problems. Because the husband committed physical and sexual abuse against his wife, she suffered from abnormal vaginal bleeding and was hospitalized before she reported him. Meanwhile, the husband blamed his abusive acts on financial difficulties and the fact that his wife did not want to live with his family and asked for their own house. The court did not recognize “marital rape,” stating that the man and woman engaged in “sexual intercourse within wedlock,” adding that its decision to jail the husband, abiding by articles 401 and 404 of the Penal Code,  was because of the “serious violence” he had inflicted on her. The Law 103-13 which took effect last September to eliminate violence against women, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination, does not list marital rape as a punishable crime.

Rabat – A memorandum of understanding for the development of a third Morocco-Spain electric interconnection through the Strait of Gibraltar was signed on Wednesday in Rabat.  King Mohammed VI and King Felipe VI attended the signing ceremony.

The memorandum aims to promote regional electricity trade, improve the reliability of electricity systems and maintain the security of the interconnected networks across the Maghreb.

The Minister of Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development Aziz Rebbah and the Spanish Secretary of State for Energy Jose Dominguez Abascal signed the agreement.  The agreement mandates the system operators of the two countries to analyse, develop and build the interconnection for commissioning by 2026.

Last November, Portuguese Secretary of State for Energy Joao Galamba said that Morocco and Portugal are planning to call for tenders to build a 250 kilometers subsea electricity cable. The first Spain-Morocco submarine electric interconnection was commissioned in 1997 and was 28 km long. The interconnection was the first submarine electric line between two continents. In 2000, the Spanish and Moroccan Governments asked their Transmission System Operators, the Spanish Electric Network (REE) and the National Electricity Office (ONE) to reinforce the interconnection with a second parallel line.

Rabat – The Spanish government is refusing asylum requests from many Moroccan migrants as the country is considered to be in a stable state. Spanish news outlet El Pais said that Pedro Sanchez’s cabinet granted asylum to 55 Moroccan migrants. However, the Spanish government denied 595 other requests. Despite the denial of hundreds of requests, El Pais said that Moroccans “appear in the statistics among the main beneficiaries of refugee status for the second consecutive year.” The news outlet said that most of the migrants have been granted asylum due to their sexual   or gender identity. The news outlet added that Hirak Rif activists are also among the beneficiaries. According to El Pais, the number of Moroccan migrants granted asylum “contrasts” with remarks made by the Spanish Secretary of State for Migration, Consuelo Rumi, who confirmed that Morocco “is not a country whose inhabitants are granted asylum or refuge.” In her visit to Rabat on October 3, 2018, the Spanish official explained that applications from Moroccans for political asylum are generally rejected because Spain does not view Moroccan migrants as refugees. She added that “emigration is not the solution because the journey of irregular migrants often ends badly.” The Spanish official also said that “the European dream does not exist.” Morocco and Spain have been facing pressure due to the increase of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan and Maghreb countries. The Spanish Ministry of Interior said last year that Moroccan nationals make up the highest number of the 38,000 migrants believed to have entered Spain in 2018. In October 2018 alone, 40 Moroccans applied for asylum. The migrants are a group of activists who were involved in Rif protests in Al Hoceima province in 2016 and 2017. Undocumented migrants from Morocco are returned home in accordance with bilateral agreements signed between Morocco and Spain.

The 12th African Games will take place from August 23 to September 3, 2019, in Morocco. Morocco is succeeding Congo, which hosted the 11th tournament in 2015, said Portail 242 on Tuesday. The president of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA), Mustapha Berraf, revealed the dates in December, according to RFI.  Last July, Morocco’s Ministry of Sports and Youth announced that Morocco will host the African Games in October 2019. After hosting the African Nations Championship, Morocco will celebrate the 12th Annual African Games, following the withdrawal of Equatorial Guinea. The decision came at the request of the African Union and the National Olympic Committees as they consider Morocco to be a country that meets all the conditions and has the expertise to host a major international sports event, according to the Ministry of Youth and Sports. More than 5,000 athletes will take part in the event. Officials from 54 ANOCA member countries will also be present. The event will qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

The ANOCA and the Union of African Sports Confederations (UCSA) organize the African Games every four years. The first African Games were held in 1965 in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo.

Rabat – Spanish authorities have denied “sharing similar opinions” with Algeria on the sensitive Western Sahara question. The European country says its commitment to the UN process is “unchanged.” Spain’s denial of its reported convergence of opinions with Algiers follows reports in the Algerian media that Madrid, recognizing “Algeria’s role in the Maghreb and Sahel,” is considering upgrading its “solidarity” with Algeria on a wide range of regional security issues. Spain’s Algerian friendship follows a meeting between the Spanish ambassador to Algeria, Fernando Moran, and the president of the Algerian national assembly, Mouad Bouchareb. “Bouchareb Hosts Spanish Ambassador: Total Convergence on Western Sahara and Palestine,” Algerian outlet El Moudjahid headlined on February 12. In the meeting, Moran allegedly compared the Palestinian and Sahrawi “causes,” and congratulated Algeria for its supposed efforts for guaranteeing regional peace and security. El Moudjahid added that the Spanish ambassador “praised President Bouteflika’s wisdom” and called for greater efforts to “rekindle cooperation [between Algeria and Spain] on questions of common interests.” Attempt to sabotage the Spain-Morocco agenda? Spain is Morocco’s strongest EU ally, and Madrid has repeatedly expressed a desire to further the strategic relations that bind the two countries. Ambassador Moran’s alleged statements came as Morocco’s King Mohammed VI prepared to host Spain’s King Felipe VI and family. The reports of Spain’s pro-Algeria position on the Sahara came across in the Moroccan media more like an attempt to sabotage Morocco-Spain relations before the strategic meeting of the two royal families. Doubt regarding Algiers’ reporting of Moran’s meeting with Bouchareb increased when the Spanish foreign affairs ministry said that the ambassador’s words were “misunderstood” and “mistranslated.” Asked for comments on the meeting, a spokesperson for the Spanish ministry said that news relayed in the Algerian press mischaracterized Spain’s position on Western Sahara. “What happened was a misinterpretation of our ambassador’s statements on Western Sahara.” The spokesperson noted that the translation [of Moran’s statements] was incorrect, adding that the ministry “will soon provide a correct translation.” Most importantly, the spokesperson explained, “Spain’s position on Western Sahara has not changed. It is in line with the UN principles.”

Rabat – The Spanish government has expressed its satisfaction and support for the adoption of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement after Tuesday’s plenary session by the European Parliament. The Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Luis Planas, said that Spain is satisfied with the adoption, which will allow nearly 90 Spanish fleets to fish in Moroccan waters. In his statement, the Spanish official said that the adoption of the deal is a “decisive step” to facilitate the return of the Spanish fleet to Moroccan fishing zones. He added that the new agreement includes operational progress for fishing vessels. Earlier this month, the Spanish minister expressed hope that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement will be finalized soon. “I would like it if the Spanish vessels would be able to fish again in Moroccan waters before summer,” said the Spanish minister in an interview with Spanish news outlet EFE. The European Parliament adopted the agreement on Tuesday with an overwhelming vote. Four-hundred and fifteen parliamentarians voted for the agreement, while and 189 votes against. Forty-nine MPEs were absent for the vote. The agreement covers the fishing area from parallel 35 and Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to parallel 22 and Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. It also increases the EU’s financial contribution from the previous agreement’s annual payment of €40.0 million to €52.2 million. Spain’s support for the adoption of the agreement fall within Spanish-Moroccan strategic diplomatic ties. Spanish monarch Felipe VI and his wife, Queen Letizia are currently on a two-day visit in Morocco. Both parties inked 11 cooperation agreements. The ceremony of the signing of the agreement was chaired by King Mohammed VI and King Felipe VI yesterday. King Mohammed VI also hosted an official dinner to celebrate the arrival of the Spanish monarchs in Morocco.

The Meshuar square in Rabat’s royal palace hosted a special ceremony in honor of the Spanish King and Queen. The visit mirrors the “depth and quality of bilateral ties thanks to the shared will to foster the multidimensional strategic partnership uniting the two neighboring and friendly countries,” stated the Moroccan Ministry of Royal Household, Protocol and Chancellery.

Rabat –  Real Madrid’s president Florentino Pérez also accompanied the Spanish sovereigns to Morocco. In an interview with Maghreb Press Agency (MAP), Perez stated that “Morocco and Spain are two neighboring countries whose proximity goes beyond the geographical aspect.” He added that “Moroccan-Spanish political, economic, and cultural relations not only foster the two countries cooperation, but also open the door to broad prospects for collaboration and partnership between Europe and Africa.” The president of Real Madrid has highlighted the role of sport, particularly football, in the rapprochement of the two nations and their people, noting that the round ball is a universal language through which peoples can communicate without intermediaries. “Football is a sport that has no borders. Real Madrid has more than 600 million fans around the world, including more than 4 million Moroccans who follow it on social networks,” added Pérez. Recalling when Real Madrid won the 2014 Club World Cup held in Marrakech, Pérez welcomed Moroccan fans support given to his club during the competition. Perez pointed out the six socio-sports schools in Morocco, namely in Tangier, Tetouan, Marrakech, Mohammedia and Benguerir, that contribute to the social integration of more than 1,400 Moroccan children. The president of Real Madrid also expressed his pride in having a great player like Achraf Hakimi growing up in the Madrid club. “Achraf is a talented player who made a remarkable World Cup with the Moroccan national team and won several titles, including a European Champion Clubs’ Cup with Real Madrid. We are counting on him in the future to continue writing the history of our club,” declared Perez However, many football reports say that Hakimi does not want to return to Real Madrid to be a substitute again, especially after improving his football skills and being guaranteed a permanent spot as an undoubted starter at his current German club. When Hakimi played with Real Madrid, he was rarely featured in matches. He was deemed surplus to requirement, pushing Real Madrid to loan him to Borussia Dortmund for two years.

Rabat – Aircraft and helicopter parts manufacturer Le Piston Francais (LPF) plans to open a second factory in Morocco by 2020. The French daily Les Echos reported that LPF will invest €5 million to open its second factory in Casablanca to manufacture large circular parts, up to 1.20 meters in diameter, with vertical machining towers. In the first term, the manufacturer will rent a 4,000 square meter plant to employ 65 personnel,  before expanding it to 11,000 square meters and employing 150 people by 2024.  Through its second plant that will be constructed at a lower cost, the subcontractor will increase its business for Safran, a French multinational aircraft engine, rocket engine, aerospace-component, and defense company.  They may also supply the British luxury automobile maker, Rolls-Royce, with which it is in negotiation. The French aeronautic parts manufacturer will also invest an additional €15 milliont o increase its production volume in France by 2021.

“We can say, by adopting the motto of the European Union, that Spain and Morocco are also united in diversity,” said the former vice president of the Spanish government, noting that the closeness of our countries and their peoples is not a mere rhetoric but is based on an ancient affection which unites us beyond differences. She added that promoting the best possible relations with Morocco has always been a priority goal for successive Spanish governments, highlighting the solid trade and economic relations between the two countries. Spain is currently Morocco’s top supplier and also its top customer, the Kingdom is for us the second largest market outside the EU, after the US. It is also the first destination of Spanish investments in Africa, said Fernández de la Vega. The Spanish official considered it necessary to work for preserving the political and commercial relations existing between the two countries, in order to continue working for peace, progress and democracy, three essential pillars for stability and development in the whole region. “In addition, both countries have a potential for mutual development that needs to be harnessed, and I make reference here to our common interests in Africa and Europe,” she noted. Fernández de la Vega welcomed the insight and the clear commitment of HM King Mohammed VI to Africa, thanks to which Morocco has become a model in promoting human development and modernizing governance mechanisms in Africa.

Rabat – The Casablanca Judicial police arrested Wednesday Hind El Achchabi, a Moroccan businesswoman and mother of three children for issuing a non-sufficient funds (NSF) cheque, amounting to MAD 42 million. El Achchabi was first arrested and jailed in November 2016, after her former second husband, Kuwaiti ambassador to Austria, Sadiq Marafi, filed a complaint against her, accusing her of adultery and other offences involving her lover. She was first married to a Saudi man. El Achchabi’s lover and father of her two children, Mohsine Karim-Bennani, whom she had married in Mali was also sentenced to jail. Their marriage was not recognized by the Moroccan law.  Following an appeal in early 2017, the Moroccan justice reduced El Achchabi’s sentence to two years and Bennani’s to seven months. El Achchabi resumed her business activities upon her release from prison on August 2018. A former flight attendant, El Achchabi is the president of airline Dalia Developpement.

Washington D.C – Spain’s King has arrived in Morocco today for a two-day visit. This is King Felipe VI’s second visit to Morocco since he acceded to the throne in Spain, five years ago. The visit had been postponed several times for scheduling reasons. It was scheduled for November 2017, but Morocco asked to postpone it. King Mohammed VI was attending the African Union and European Union summit in Cote d’Ivoire. The visit was again postponed in January 2018 at Morocco’s request because it did not fit into King Mohammed VI‘s agenda. Morocco’s disinclination to set a date for the Spanish King‘s visit to Morocco raises concerns in Spain. Some observers attributed this to chilling bilateral ties or Morocco’s displeasure with some of the Spanish government’s decisions. The Spanish government has repeatedly stressed, however, that the two countries have excellent relations and that the dates chosen for the Spanish King‘s visit did not fit into King Mohammed VI’s agenda. The King’s medical examinations in France last March further delayed the meeting date. Spanish media traditionally pay a great deal of attention to the King’s visits to Morocco, which usually have strong political connotations. Since the early years of the democratic transition in Spain, after the late King Juan Carlos came to power in 1975, and especially after the 1982 legislative elections that brought the Socialist Party into power, Spain has sought to establish direct communication channels between the two royal families. Relations between Royals Houses serve as safety valve for Morocco-Spanish relations Over the years, the relations between the two sovereigns have grown so important that successive Spanish governments saw them as a safety valve in Moroccan-Spanish relations. With the exception of former Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who sidelined the Spanish royal family in the relations between the two countries, all of Spain’s heads of government  relied on the royals’ friendly relations to mirror the depth and quality of bilateral ties between the two governments. King Felipe IV is apparently looking to maintain the same tradition and is even seeking to further strengthen inter-regal ties. The fact that he has visited Morocco twice in less than five years attests that the Spanish King is keen on strengthening ties between the two countries. The former Spanish monarch, Juan Carlos, visited Morocco only three times overall—in 1979, 2005, and 2013. The delegation accompanying the Spanish monarch—made up of the ministers of foreign affairs, culture, agriculture, and trade—shows the strategic importance of Morocco for Spain. The Spanish governments have always been keen to maintain and develop ties with Morocco to immunize them against any occasional diplomatic friction. Minimizing impact of thorny issues on overall relations Long gone is the time when disputes over Ceuta and Melilla, the Western Sahara, illegal immigration, or the issue of fishing or drug trafficking stood between the two countries. In 1982, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Fernando Moran put forward the “interest cushion theory” (coined colchon de intereses in Spanish), linking the two countries through a set of common strategic interests that could cushion the impact of thorny issues. His theory proved instrumental in helping the two countries to strengthen their relations. Morocco has also become an essential partner for Spain in its counter-terrorism strategy. The level of cooperation and trust between the national security services of the two countries is excellent. Spanish officials praised security cooperation on several occasions. The same applies to the issue of illegal immigration. With the definitive closure of the Italian borders to illegal immigration, Spain has every interest in staying on good terms with Moroccan officials to secure their cooperation in this area. Any laxity on the part of the Moroccan government or lack of cooperation with its Spanish counterpart could put Spain at risk of incessant inflows of illegal immigrants. Such an outcome could have a disastrous impact on the Spanish economy and security. To ensure continued cooperation with the Moroccan authorities, the Spanish government has urged the EU to increase its fund dedicated to help Morocco cope with the flow of illegal immigration. Thanks to Spain’s support, the EU decided to increase its financial assistance for Morocco to €140 million. According to the newspaper El Pais, the considerable efforts of Moroccan security authorities prevented 13,721 potential illegal immigrants from reaching Spanish territory in 2018. Morocco also has a strong interest in ensuring that its relations with Spain remain close. In addition to its need for Spanish support on a wide range of regional and international issues, Rabat has an interest in ensuring that the well-being and job security of more than 800,000 Moroccan immigrants in Spain are not affected by any diplomatic friction with Madrid. Any diplomatic crisis between the two countries could create a climate of mistrust and even give rise to a wave of xenophobia against the Moroccan community. Through this strategy of consultation and cooperation on all fronts, Morocco is at least securing Spain’s positive neutrality on the Western Sahara. The Spanish government is unlikely to take a hostile position on Morocco’s territorial integrity. It is also unthinkable that a Spanish prime minister today would threaten Morocco, as was the case with the former Spanish prime minister, José María Aznar. Spain has not missed any opportunity to reaffirm its tacit support for Morocco on the Sahara issue. On the economic side, bilateral trade is booming and reached record highs particularly over the past decade. Spain has even overtaken France as Morocco’s leading trade partner. King Felipe‘s visit will certainly lead to the signing of a number of agreements in strategic sectors. Such agreements will provide a new impetus for bilateral cooperation. Now for the strategic relations between the two countries to be mutually beneficial, it is time for Morocco to explore ways to decrease its trade deficit with Spain. Over the past five decades, the trade balance has always tilted in favor of Spain, which deepens Morocco’s overall trade deficit and further weakens its economy. The Pending Task The friendly bilateral relations between Morocco and Spain should not derail us from the existing mistrust that persists between the Spanish and Moroccan people. Studies from recent years show that despite the improved strategic relations between Rabat and Madrid, people from both sides continue to hold prejudiced perceptions about the other side. A poll published by Spain’s Real Insitituto Elcano shows that Spanish public opinion has an ingrained negative image about Moroccans. This was the result of the tumultuous historical relations between the two countries and their multiple armed confrontations, as well as of the prejudiced portrayal of Moroccans in Spanish text books. Despite Morocco being close geographically to Spain, most Spaniards have a harrowing ignorance about their southern neighbor. The same can be said to a lesser extent about the image of Spain in Morocco. According to the same study, Moroccans also have bad misconceptions about their northern neighbor. To ensure the sustainability of the relations between Morocco and Spain, one of the pending tasks on the agenda of both governments is to work towards fostering understanding, mutual respect and minimizing the impact of stereotypes on the perception of each other. The two countries must also work towards healing the wounds of their past, especially Spain’s expulsion of the Moors between 1609 and 1614, as well as the gassing of the Rif population during the Rif war between 1921 and 1926. Such moves would greatly contribute to healing the rift between Moroccans and Spaniards, which can only be beneficial to strengthening the strategic partnership between their governments and enabling them to withstand diplomatic crises that might arise in the future.

Washington DC – While it is unclear whether Mr. Bourita choose purposely to give an interview about the war in Yemen to a Qatari owned media outlet, it is hard to believe that the Foreign Minister ignores the optics of criticizing Saudi Arabia on Al-Jazeera. For the Moroccan public, the fact of the matter is, news of their country’s decision to leave the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen and to recall its ambassador to Saudi Arabia came from foreign news outlets, while domestic organizations were left out in the cold. Morocco spends thousands of dollars in tax payers’ money to subsidy a national news agency, the Maghreb Arab Press, a national news channel, Al-Akhbaria, and the semi-private news channel Medi 1 TV that broadcasts worldwide in French and Arabic. Yet governmental officials prefer to talk to foreign mediums. The choice to give news scoops to non-Moroccan entities struck a chord with a wide variety of political observers in Morocco. Several journalists went online to express their frustration and anger over the government’s poor and discriminatory treatment of local journalists. In essence, Mr. Bourita and other Moroccan officials favored Al-Jazeera, the Associated Press and Russia’s Sputnik news to give key interviews and exclusive information. In ignoring the national press, Moroccan officials feed the arguments that the foreign press is inherently superior. The fact is, Mr. Bourita could have given an interview to a local news outlet and his message would still have had the same impact in terms of reaching the audience of his choice. Moroccan officials need to remedy this wrong and treat the domestic press as a sober political partner that can help in propagating the Kingdom’s views and positons. Furthermore, they must put the domestic press at the heart of  the public discourse and equip local journalists with the knowledge and opportunities to better defend the nation’s interests on the intentional scene. In the age of Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, important news events are re-broadcasted instantly regardless of the original source. For example, President Trump gave several interviews to little known news outlets and yet his comments were captured, analyzed and discussed the same way as any of his interviews with more known press organizations. The Moroccan Foreign Ministry, among other agencies, needs to appreciate the role and the value of native journalism in winning the ongoing media war with Algeria over the Western Sahara. The national press needs to have a voice, a presence and diverse viewpoints when it comes to foreign policy. With engaging and well-informed journalists, Morocco can push a narrative that advances its agenda and influence hard to reach audiences. Critics of the national media complain about the lack of professionalism among local journalists and regulations that vaguely define the profession. In fact, Moroccan media institutions have had a tough time throughout their history. The ruling establishment never sought a solid press corp. To the contrary, it gutted serious news magazines, pushed good journalists to self-exile or brought them into government friendly outlets. Today, local and national news outlets are poor and live mostly on the few Dirhams from a stingy advertisement market in Morocco. The government and governmental agencies are the richest source of this commercial pool, thus most of the media lives and dies at the hand of politicians and bureaucrats. The truth is that the self-reliant independent Moroccan media has not failed; it never existed in the first place. We rarely see minsters, parliamentarians or politicians face local journalists in open, fair an honest debate. Nonetheless, we have seen several tedious and scripted interviews that do hurt journalists’ reputations and protect, more than often, the amateurism of politicians. This prejudice against the national press must stop. Journalism remains a civic institution that the government and the political establishment need to respect, support and protect.

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation is visiting Australia to examine prospects of importing Australian cereal into the country. Minister of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development, and Waters and Forests Aziz Akhannouch, alongside a Moroccan delegation, has visited logistics facilities at the headquarters of GrainCorp, an Australian leader in exporting cereals. Akhannouch, who has been in Australia since Monday, said that Australian operators have shown great interest in supplying the Moroccan market with their wheat, especially soft wheat. He added that the Moroccan grain market has high importing potential and particularly interests Australian exporters. The minister also called on Moroccan operators to consider the Australian experience in the sector as an inspiration through the various components of the value chain. The president of the Interprofessional Federation of Cereal Activities, Chakib Alj, noted that “the opportunities for cooperation are promising with Australia, especially as the country-continent faces the same climate challenges.” For Alj, the visit allowed a close look at the Australian experience to consider how to improve cereal production in Morocco and to examine the prospects of importing Australian cereals into the country. Morocco imports nearly 6.5 million tons of cereals a year. He further explained that Morocco can import Australian wheat at a favorable price given that Australia has a staggered crop compared to other countries, which puts suppliers under pressure to sell their crop. For his part, GrainCorp’s general manager, Don Campbell, said his company is interested in the Moroccan market, particularly in the soft wheat sector which is the core of the wheat sector in Morocco.

Rabat – The Spanish-based credit risk management company, AIS Group, has started implementing Morocco’s first anti-fraud system founded in machine learning and artificial intelligence through the Moroccan company Salafin.  Salafin finances consumer credit and the purchases of vehicles for individuals, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. It is also a subsidiary of BMCE, Banque Marocaine du Commerce Extérieur. Salafin detected 700 confirmed fraud cases in 2017. Daniel Torrents, the head of business and development for AIS Group in Morocco and Africa, described the system’s fraud-prevention strategy. “A model has been put in place that calculates the likelihood of fraud in credit applications filed with financial institutions. Thus, the risk of fraud is evaluated before the final loan is granted,” stated Torrents. Torrents elaborated that the artificial intelligence techniques “have a much greater predictive ability than traditional techniques and, as a result, a higher success rate detecting fake accounts, including non-existent businesses.” Additionally, “credit assessment and fraud detection models combine credit risk and operational risk to integrate a single view of the transaction and facilitate overall risk control.” AIS Group predicts that in Moroccan financial institutions, the artificial intelligence based system should improve fraud detection by 20 to 30 percent. Salafin’s project is the first model to use the machine learning method in Morocco. In 2018, the international security company McAfee released a reported that detailed the economic impact of cybercrime worldwide. Globally, in 2017, the cost of cybercrime was around $608 billion and in the MENA region, around $5 billion. The implementation of artificial intelligence to curb cybercrime will significantly reduce economic loss, according to Forbes magazine. Artificial intelligence is capable of learning relationships in modeled data, in turn identifying fraudulent activities and preventing them from causing harm.

Rabat – Moroccan diplomats, whose anxiety reportedly rose with news that the new African Union leadership is poised to undermine the UN’s Western Sahara agenda, can now relax. The AU will not reverse its allegiance to the UN-led process in the Western Sahara conflict. That is at least the spirit of a February 8 message addressed to all AU diplomatic representations. Written by Bankole Adioye, AU legal advisor and Nigeria’s permanent representative to the AU, the message called on all delegations represented at the AU summit to refrain from making Western Sahara part of their agenda during meetings. The message singled out the AU Peace and Security Council (PSC), the body’s branch in charge of preventing, managing, and resolving conflicts in Africa. Western Sahara has long been part of the PSC’s agenda. Adioye’s message, however, stressed that even the PSC no longer has the right to discuss Western Sahara. Referring to the latest AU report on the conflict, which recognized the UN Security Council as having exclusive legitimacy to broker a settlement deal for Western Sahara, the message noted that the latest decisions from the AU heads of states and governments “also apply to the PSC.” It added that the PSC will no longer “mention, cite, or refer to the situation in Western Sahara.” Background At the 32nd AU summit early this week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the pan-African organization underwent a routine leadership reshuffling. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi took the reins from Rwanda’s Paul Kagame as AU president. Meanwhile, South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Al-Sisi as the next in line for president. The picture was a not a good sight for the majority of Moroccan diplomats and political analysts. On the one hand, there was a current AU president, Al-Sisi, known for his ambivalent position on Western Sahara. On the other, there waited the next AU leader, President Ramaphosa, who has characteristically been forthcoming about his overt and “fraternal” sympathy for the Polisario Front. Shortly after the leadership change, there were reports of mounting fear in Moroccan circles that the new AU leadership would undermine the progress made so far on the Western Sahara question. The fear was that the new leadership would attempt to reverse a recent AU decision to leave the Western Sahara agenda to the UN Security Council. In July 2018 in Nouakchott, Mauritania, the AU promised to exclusively leave the resolution of the Sahara dispute to the UNSC.
The pan-African body even created a troika tasked with “accompanying” and “supporting” the success of the UN-led process. But with President Al-Sisi and Ramaphosa as part of that troika, it seemed doubtful whether the AU would follow the guidelines of the Nouakchott summit. More fear than damage: Investing in continental diplomacy While the fear was legitimate, new developments at the AU have put to rest any notions that any AU leader can individually shape the direction of the whole organization on burning issues. In addition to Ambassador Adioye’s message, there have been other positive returns for Morocco’s continental diplomacy, according to Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita. For Bourita, the AU’s decision to completely withdraw from attempts to push for an “African agenda” in the Western Sahara dispute is a sign of a diplomatic victory for Morocco. “This is the first time that no single decision regarding Western Sahara was taken at an AU summit,” Bourita said, explaining that Morocco should upgrade its continental diplomacy to capitalize on support from as many African countries as possible. When Morocco asked for readmission to the pan-African organization following King Mohammed VI’s insistence that “Morocco’s future belongs in Africa,” some Moroccan analysts expressed doubt about the effectiveness of a return to AU. They argued that seeking membership in an organization that recognizes the Polisario-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ran against the core of Moroccan interests. According to Bourita, however, only by being an important player in the AU and showing its committed contribution to solving continental issues can Morocco secure the support it needs for its position. Morocco needs to be present where decisions are made to stand a chance of shaping the narrative and having a say in the directives, Bourita suggested, speaking to the press after the Addis Ababa summit. He gave the example of the African Observatory on Migration, an AU-sponsored research body tasked with studying and giving policy recommendations on human mobility across and from Africa. The observatory will be headquartered in Rabat, which, according to Bourita, speaks volumes about the “sincere efforts” that Morocco has invested in African migration. The observatory is of “crucial importance” for an “African perspective” on migration. During the closing ceremony of the AU summit in Addis Ababa, Bourita noted, a number of AU head of states “thanked and congratulated Morocco for its engagement” on the migration front. Commenting on that move, Bourita said that more presence in AU decision-making bodies and more engagement in Africa will only benefit Moroccan diplomacy.

By Mohammed Amine Benabou Rabat – Former Juventus defender and captain of Morocco’s Atlas Lions, Mehdi Benatia, has expressed his displeasure at his now-former coach, Allegri Massimiliano. His statement came as a reaction to the alleged “broken promises” Allegri had failed to fulfill, particularly after Leonardo Bonucci, who has a highly reputable profile, returned back to Juventus.  Benatia left Juventus earlier this year after spending multiple games on the bench, breaking his contract in order to join the Qatari Al Duhail club. At first, Allegri objected to Benatia’s decision to leave Juventus for another team, but Benatia stood firm because he demanded more game time and did not want to have his “butt glued to the bench.” In an interview about his signing with Al Duhail, the 31-year-old French-Moroccan Benatia, who captained Morocco’s national team at the World Cup, told L’Equipe that Herve Renard, head coach of Morocco’s national team, is “not only my selector, but also a friend of mine.” In voicing his discontentment with his former Juventus coach Allegri, Benatia said that he would not mind staying on the bench “if there were to be a player much more competent than I am.” In those circumstances, he said, “I would assume my role as a leader on the team with a smile.” He added that Renard thought “I had to pursue my career in Europe, [but] he respected my decision.” Benatia chose Al Duhail over other clubs despite tempting bids because he said he wanted his kids raised in a “Muslim culture.” Benatia, who joined Juventus in 2016, said that he initially decided to stay with his team after having been reassured that Bonucci, the newly arrived defender, would not immediately take his place unless he proved himself. Benatia eventually decided to “look somewhere else” when he realized Bonucci was getting more game time. Al Duhail competed for Benatia with Manchester and Monaco and ended up getting him for €10 million. The captain of Morocco’s national team, Mehdi Benatia joined the Atlas Lions’ squad to play Cameroon in an Africa Cup Nations (CAN) qualifier late last year.

Rabat – Currently, 1 million Moroccans live in Spain, said the Spanish news agency EFE. The two neighboring countries cooperate on a number of issues from security and migration to trade and education, some statistics of which are significant yet not reported often in the media. For example, 770,523 Moroccans lived as residents in Spain in 2018. Another quarter million Moroccans are currently staying “illegally” in Spain after their residence permits expired. Moreover, there are currently 180,000 Moroccan children who attend Spanish schools, receiving education to become influential in Spanish society and public life. Still, while Moroccan immigrants are often MPs in the Netherlands and Belgium, it is not the case in Spain, noted the agency. Moroccans in Spain, however, are among the top foreigners who hold Spanish visas, making up an average number of 130,000 each year. Meanwhile, there are more than 200,000 Moroccans with Spanish citizenship. Moroccan immigrants in Spain still face issues such as poor integration into Spanish society and job market, according to migration expert Moroccan Abdelwahid Akmir. The influence of Spanish and Moroccan cultures on each other is also evident in other areas. Moroccans are increasingly interested in learning the Romance language. Spain’s Instituto Cervantes found that 1.7 million Moroccans have mastered Spanish, according to its 2018 report. In return, some Spaniards are also interested in learning Darija (Moroccan Arabic). Spanish writer Jesus Greus and Moroccan professor Naima Lahrach produced a Spanish-Darija dictionary in 2018. The Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI and his wife, Queen Letizia, arrived today in Rabat for a two-day visit. The royal family made its last visit to the North African country in 2014. The visit reflects the “depth and quality of bilateral ties thanks to the shared will to foster the multidimensional strategic partnership uniting the two neighboring and friendly countries,” stated the Moroccan Ministry of Royal Household, Protocol and Chancellery.

Rabat – In the 25th Maghreb-Orient of Books in Paris, Moroccan novelist Meryem Alaoui won the literary prize Beur FM Mediterranee on Saturday, February 9, for her first novel “Truth Comes out from the Horse’s Mouth,” or “La verite sort de la bouche du cheval” in French. The event gave Alaoui the 22nd literary award at the l’Hotel de Ville in Paris. Narrated in the first person, Meryem Alaoui’s novel follows the story of Jmiaa and the characters who “punctuate her everyday life.” Jmiaa is a prostitute who lives in Casablanca alone with her daughter. Despite boasting a strong character, the quick-witted Jmiaa struggles to depict the world around her: Her beloved Chaiba, a taciturn yet browbeating bully; Halima, her depressive associate; and Mouy, her mother, whose character is hardly placable. The protagonist’s life witnesses a turn of events when she meets filmmaker Chadlia. Chadlia, who goes by the nickname of “the Horse’s Mouth,” is looking for actresses and wants to make a movie to reflect life in Casablanca, especially Jmiaa’s neighborhood. Alaoui’s 2018 book was taken out of the running for the prestigious French book award Goncourt Prize after competing along with a shortlist of authors that includes Pauline Delabroy-Allard, David Diop, Paul Greveillac, and Nicolas Mathieu. Meryem Alaoui has now managed to claim the prestigious Beur FM Mediterranee, succeeding Moroccan author Leila El Alami.

Rabat – A new Saudi app, Absher, notifies and asks for the approval of the male guardian when a woman travels or attempts to cross the border. The first explanation that “Absher” facilitates documenting the abuse and discrimination that Saudi women go through is now being challenged as another strategy by the Saudi government to control their women.  According to US television channel CBS News, the strong opposition to the app was highlighted by US Senator Ron Wyden along with human rights organizations demanding Google and Apple take the app down.  Ron Wyden emphasized these demands by writing to the CEOs of Apple and Google, saying that “American companies should not enable or facilitate the Saudi government’s patriarchy” through their tracking of women. He said the app “flies in the face of the type of society you both claim to support and defend.”  Despite the backlash, neither Apple or Google have deleted the Absher from their app stores.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – Morocco awarded North African focused oil and gas company, SDX, licenses to expand in Moulay Bouchta Ouest and Lalla Mimouna Sud. The Moroccan government awarded SDX Energy two new licenses in Moulay Bouchta Ouest and Lalla Mimouna Sud, allowing the North African focused energy company to significantly increase its presence in Morocco. SDX Energy, headquartered in London, is an oil and gas exploration, production, and development company.  The company received the Moulay Bouchta Ouest exploration licence for an eight year period, which spans 458 km2. Within the first three-and-a-half-year period of the project, SDX plans to reprocess 150 kilometres of 2D seismic data, gain 100 km2 of new 3D seismic, and drill one exploration. In 2017, the company received the permit for Lalla Mimouna Sud as a part of their acquisition of  Circle Oil. Since the concession expired when the work commitments had been completed, SDX reapplied and was re-awarded with the Lalla Mimouna Sud licence for an eight year period. The permitted region is 857 km2. Within the first three-year period, SDX intends to acquire 50 km2 of 3D seismic and one drill exploration. “We are very pleased to be expanding our acreage in Morocco, which we see as a key growth region for SDX going forward.  Both of these permits offer significant underexplored hydrocarbon potential and are located adjacent to our existing operations and infrastructure, so can be tied into our facilities quickly.  The award also gives SDX and its partner control over the entire onshore Gharb Basin,” commented the President and CEO of SDX, Paul Welch. SDX’s portfolio includes six concessions between Egypt and Morocco. The company currently works with two producing assets in Egypt, North West Gemsa and Meseda. In Morocco, SDX works in Sebou, in the Rharb Basin. The company describes its assets as “exceptionally low cost” and “resilient in a low oil price environment.” In addition to their producing assets, SDX also has exploration projects in Morocco and Egypt. “We have an active work programme planned for Morocco in 2019, with a 12 well drilling programme set to commence in H2.  With the addition of these new permits, we will be able to further grow our reserves and production base in Morocco, and generate significant value for our stakeholders, as we look to build upon our market leading position in country,” Welch stated. SDX attributes its interest in Morocco to uncomplicated business, increasing gas prices, significant growth potential, and lower operations and drilling costs.

Rabat- On Tuesday, the European Union Court of Justice rejected Polisario’s request seeking to cancel the mandate granted to the EU Council to negotiate the fisheries agreement with Morocco which includes the waters of Western Sahara. The EU court also ordered the Polisario Front to bear its “own legal costs and those incurred by the Council of the EU and the European Commission in this stillborn procedure.” The court’s decision came following the adoption of the EU-Morocco fisheries deal, which received 415 votes in favor. The agreement allows  European vessels to fish in Moroccan waters and covers the fishing area from parallel 35 and Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to parallel 22 and Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. It also specifies the fishing areas and access conditions for EU vessels. The deal also increases the EU’s financial contribution from the previous agreement’s annual payment of €40.0 million to €52.2 million. According to Morocco’s Minister of Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch, the European Parliament’s vote confirms that the Morocco-EU partnership “has always considered sustainable, reliable, and built on a solid foundation of cooperation between the two historic partners.” According to the Ministry of Foreign affairs, the agreement’s adoption also confirms that Morocco is the “only legal authorities to negotiate and sign agreements including the Moroccan Sahara.” The ministry added that the adoption of the agreement also deterred Polisario and Algerian maneuvers to affect the partnership between Morocco and the EU.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita is one of the members of the Moroccan delegation representing King Mohammed VI to the 32nd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU). Morocco’s decision to return to the African Union in 2017 made the country able to monitor all developments and decisions taken inside the pan-African organization, including on the Western Sahara conflict. In July 2018, Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat unveiled a report  supporting the United Nations-led political process to end the conflict. The report, which was introduced at the 31st AU Summit for heads of state in Nouakchott, ruled that the UN is the only body with full legitimacy to find an agreed upon and mutually accepted solution to the conflict. The AU’s role in the conflict is to support and accompany UN efforts, according to the report. During the recent summit, Bourita said that he felt the notable changes, expressing satisfaction with the AU’s objectivity in the conflict. Bourita told the press on the sidelines of the summit that “this is the first African summit where no decision has been taken on the question of the Moroccan Sahara knowing that the decisions inherent in this issue are taken at the level of the UN.” Bourita added that any mention of the  conflict was “absent from the final report of the 32nd AU summit.” He added that this is a “first and an important evolution.”

Rabat – Algerian journalist Hafid Derradji has criticized Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika for his decision to run for a fifth term. In a Facebook post, the beIN Sports journalist commented on Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth term, saying: “ We have started feeling ashamed” The post, which was shared more than 2,000 times and generated over  26 thousand reactions, questions President Bouteflika’s ability to lead the country giving his age and degrading health.  Referring to the Bouteflika’s party announcement that the ailing president will run for a fifth mandate, Derradji said that what happened yesterday is “just a myth.”  “Bouteflika did not run, nor can he make his candidacy, nor campaign, nor even oath,” said Derradji as he cast doubt on Bouteflika’s ability to perform “his constitutional duties.” Ashamed and miserable The journalist regretted belonging to a “miserable generation that accepts humiliation.” “We are ashamed to belong to this miserable  generation that accepts humiliation, and is pleased to have its honor and homeland raped  by a vicious gang and a renegade who practices the mafia,” he said. Derradji’s Facebook post is not a one-time expression of accumulated frustration. The journalist is an established critic of  the Algerian government’s poor performance on development. In December 2018, Derradji lambasted his country’s unreadiness to host sports events like the 2019  Africa Cup of Nations.  Pointing out that Morocco is “scoring positive points,” in terms of infrastructure, the Algerian said that he feels sorry for his country for not even being able to “ even host a chess competition.” adding that Morocco’s is  Bouteflika clinging to power despite health concerns Deaf to the mounting criticism facing his regime, especially his ability to lead the country, Bouteflika announced his determination to run for a fifth term on Sunday. He said that he accepted to run for a fifth term in response to “ all pleas and calls.” In response to Bouteflika’s decision, a group of Algerian activists launched a campaign  using the hashtag “Let_Him_Rest,” implying that Algerian elites pushed Bouteflika to run for the fifth mandate. On their Facebook page, the activists wrote: “A president who cannot carry out his duties towards the country and the people, a president who does not give speeches, does not sign decrees, does not appoint, does not sack, does not make field visits, does not meet invitations, does not receive heads of state, a [president] who does not declare war and peace is an illegal president according to Article 102 of the Constitution.”  Bouteflika who uses a wheelchair due to a stroke he suffered in 2013, is in power since 1999. His ruling party National Liberation Front (FLN) backs his candidacy. The party says that he is the ideal candidate for the election campaign.

The head of the Houthi movement, Abdel-Aziz bin Habtour has sent a message to Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, thanking the country for suspending participation in the Saudi-led coalition in the ongoing war in Yemen. In an unprecedented move, the head of the Houthi movement lauded Morocco’s withdrawal from the Saudi coalition in the conflict, reported the Yemeni news agency. Morocco’s withdrawal decision, said Habtour, “reflects the good, brotherly Moroccan-Yemeni relations.” He added, “Yemeni people will continue to cherish their strong, brotherly ties with the Moroccan people in days to come.” Habtour also said he hoped for Morocco to join the international efforts to stop the war in Yemen, in line with its “sound decision.” The Houthi leader ended his message by wishing “development and prosperity for Morocco and its people.” Tensions have been rife between Morocco and Saudi Arabia, although there have been no official moves from either party to express frustration. In the public discourse, meanwhile, the spat between the two allies seemed to reach a new level after a Saudi television channel aired a controversial documentary about the Western Sahara conflict. The documentary, broadcast by Saudi-owned pan-Arab television, Al Arabiya, claimed that Morocco “occupied” the Western Sahara and presented Polisario as the sole “legitimate representative of the Saharawi people.” The documentary was aired weeks after Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita told Al Jazeera that Morocco’s participation in the Yemen war has changed due to humanitarian reasons. Following the controversial documentary, news reports indicated last week that Morocco recalled its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mustapha El Mansouri, “for consultations” on the relations with Saudi Arabia. But Morocco’s foreign ministry Nasser Bourita denied that narrative. In an interview two days after news circulated of Morocco recalling Ambassador El Mansouri, Bourita said the news was “unfounded” and “not correct.” Meantime, Rabat-Riyadh ties had already weakened following the ascension of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to power. Saudi Arabia initially joined the Yemen war in 2015 in an attempt to curb the armed movement of the Houthis, a group of Islamic Shia rebels.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has approved the creation of Pan-African Fertilizers, the Moroccan OCP company’s subsidiary in Ethiopia, the Moroccan official gazette announced on Monday, February 11.  Funded in part by the Ethiopian government, the newly-established company is expected to boost the East African country’s agricultural productivity. The creation of Pan-African Fertilizers cost a total of $50 million. The project was jointly financed by Morocco’s OCP and the Ethiopian Chemical Industry Corporation (ECIC), a body the Ethiopian government created in 2013 to monitor and develop the country’s industrial sector.  The two companies—OCP and ECIC—will each hold half of Pan-African Fertilizers’ assets, with the Moroccan and Ethiopian authorities vowing to use the new venture as a platform to improve cooperation. OCP Africa as part of Morocco’s South-South policy As part of the broader OCP Africa vision, the cooperation between Ethiopia and Morocco is set to increase the East African agricultural productivity, while at the same time boosting the quality of Ethiopian fertilizers.  The plan, according to OCP’s CEO Mostafa Terrab, is to help Ethiopia reach self-sufficiency in fertilizer production, “with prospects of investing in its potential for exportation.” To do so, the venture plans $1.3 billion as supplementary investments by 2025 to bolster Ethiopia’s fertilizer production capacity to 3.8 million tons per year. Reaching that production level would support and meet the growing local demand for fertilizers, according to Terrab. OCP Africa, which was initiated in the first half of 2016 to accompany Morocco’s South-South agenda, has emphasized the necessity of intra-African collaboration to sustain the food security demands of Africa’s growing population.  “Strongly committed to South-South cooperation, development, we put Africa at the heart of our growth plan using a personalized approach, which led to the creation of OCP Africa. The newly created subsidiaries aim at meeting the challenge of a structured, efficient, and sustainable agriculture,” Terrab said in OCP’s 2016 annual report. Pan-African Fertilizers is part of that global vision to invest in intra-African capabilities to meet the continent’s most burning challenges, including food security, according to Moroccan authorities. The official gazette’s announcement of the establishment of Pan-African Fertilizers came as Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani led the Moroccan delegation at the 32nd AU summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia over the weekend. El Othmani, who met Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed at the AU summit, said afterwards that their discussions were about improving cooperation between Morocco and Ethiopia on a wide range of issues.  “Ethiopia plays a prominent role on the African political scene,” and Morocco’s African ventures would benefit from Ethiopian support, El Othmani noted.  Since returning to the African Union in January 2017, Morocco has multiplied efforts to assert its continental visibility. Ventures like OCP Africa have established the North African as a key player on the African scene. Recently, the Financial Times lauded Morocco’s outreach in continental markets. Morocco, the British paper wrote, is spearheading “the emergence of genuinely post-colonial African order.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commended the adoption of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement. Today in Strasbourg, MEPs voted for the fisheries agreement, which received 415 votes in favor. A statement from the ministry said that Morocco “expresses its appreciation for the collective action of the European institutions and EU member states, [and] praises their continued commitment to the strategic partnership with the kingdom of Morocco.” The statement added that the adoption confirmed that Morocco is “the only country legally entitled … to negotiate and sign agreements including the Moroccan Sahara.” The ministry, led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, wrote that these legal instruments cover the “Moroccan Sahara region and explicitly stipulate that the fishing zone extends from parallel 35 in the North, to parallel 20 in the South, from Cap Spartel to Cap Blanc, south of Dakhla.” The statement also noted that the adoption confirms the commitment of Morocco and the EU to reinforce their partnership and to preserve their deals from the “desperate political and legal maneuvers carried out by Algeria the Polisario.” The statement added that the fisheries sector has been a key element of the EU-Morocco deal. The agreement between the EU and Morocco increases the EU’s financial contribution from the previous agreement’s annual payment of €40.0 million to €52.2 million. On January 16, the European Parliament also adopted the agriculture deal signed between Morocco and the EU. The EU and Morocco had their agreements approved despite Polisario’s threats to hinder the agreement process. The separatist group has announced it will appeal the agriculture agreement to the European Court of Justice and the United Nations.

Rabat – The book called the “Moroccan Letters” was reviewed and signed at the 25th International Book Fair (SIEL) in Casablanca. Enamored by the charm of Morocco and its people, 20 contemporary Arab writers wrote a few pages each in the book, speaking of their experiences in Moroccan cities while also providing glimpses on realities lived in each city. The 439-page compendium compiled by two renowned Lebanese media figures, Sami Kleib and Faycal Jelloul, holds testimonials from one of the most influential authors in the Arab world, Syrian poet and critic, Adunis. Testimonials from the late Lebanese-American intellectual, Ameen Rihani, have also found a place within the pages of the book. A book signing for “The Moroccan Letters” took place on Sunday, February 10, at SIEL in Casablanca. Kleib and Jelloul said at the event that the purpose behind the book was to“rebuild the bridges between Morocco and the Levant, especially as the latter is suffering never-ending tragedies.” The literary work “informs about the history and civilization of Morocco that many are not familiar with,” and about “the Moroccan citizen” as seen in the eyes of a Middle Eastern one, the two co-authors said. The book, published by a Lebanese publishing house, Dar Alfarabi, holds in its many pages “a love for Morocco and its people.” The annual book fair in Casablanca running from February 7 to 17 under the patronage of King Mohammed VI is witnessing its 25th anniversary.  More than 700 exhibitors from 40 countries are taking part in the event inaugurated by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani last Thursday. This year, Spain is the book fair’s guest of honor. The book fair will honor Moroccan writers who write in Spanish and host two round tables under the title “Spanish, more southern.” The book fair will also pay tribute to Juan Goytisolo and Jose-Miguel Ullan during the conference titled “Claiming the Count Don Julian, an homage to Juan Goytisolo.”

Rabat – Kaoutar Fal, a Moroccan woman who was detained in Brussels on suspicion of spying for Morocco intelligence, has lodged a request to the European Court of Human Rights, questioning the legality of her detention.  Fal, who spent two months in a closed center from May 29 to July 23 last year, wrote of “the ill-treatment” she received from Belgian authorities. She explained that she was arrested the moment she landed at Belgium’s Charleroi Airport. Fal emphasized that her detention occurred without any legal “justification.” The Belgian state security ordered that the 32-year-old woman be detained in Repatriation Center 127 bis, in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium. Belgian authorities reported that Fal was notorious in the world of business and lobbying, seeing her liberty as a threat to their national security. The Indictments Division and the Aliens Litigation Council (CEC) released Fal in July after it had announced that her detention was against the law. A CEC spokesman said then that she was detained “on the basis of another article according to which she is illegally in the territory, and because she represents a threat to national security.” Fal returned to Morocco on July 23 of her own volition. Fal is a co-founder of the Female Entrepreneurship Association in the north of Morocco.  She has been “advisor to several Governments, Chambers of Commerce in Morocco and abroad and Director of the ESC-Tetouan the Institute on the Chamber of Commerce,” according to her website.

Rabat – South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will replace Guinea’s Alpha Conde in the African Union’s troika on the Western Sahara question. Morocco is already seeing the change as a potential threat to its continental diplomatic efforts on Western Sahara. Formed at the 31st AU summit for heads of states in July 2018 in Nouakchott, Mauritania, the AU troika came days after the continental organization pledged allegiance to the UN-led process in the Western Sahara territorial conflict. At the Nouakchott summit, African leaders agreed that the troika, in its mission to “accompany” the UN Security Council’s Western Sahara agenda, would be composed of the AU president, together with his predecessor and successor. The AU commission’s chairperson is expected to support the three leaders in their mission. At the time, Conde, who led the AU in 2017-2018, joined the Troika as the “predecessor.” But the Guinean leader’s status changed at the 11 February AU summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where Egypt’s Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi took over as the new AU president. President Al-Sisi replaced Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, while South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa filled the rotary position for the 2020-2021 tenure.  The leadership reshuffling means the troika will now be composed of Kagame, Al-Sisi, and Ramaphosa.  Moussa Faki Mahamat, who is still the chairperson of the AU Commission, will support the three African leaders in their dealings with the UN Security Council on the sensitive Sahara dossier. In an interview with France’s RFI radio in early July 2018, shortly after the formation of the AU troika, Conde said that the AU would refrain from any moves that may undermine the UN-led process in the Western Sahara question.  “It is the African Union that transferred the Western Sahara dossier to the UN in the first place,” the Guinean president said. He added that the then newly-appointed troika’s role would only be to “follow the UN process and inform the AU thereon.” There would be no “parallel AU agenda” for Western Sahara, Conde promised. He stressed that the troika’s role is to ensure “full support to the UN Security Council to attain a sustainable, peaceful, and mutually acceptable political solution.” But it is uncertain whether the new troika will show the same spirit of uncompromising collaboration with the UN Security Council’s agenda on Western Sahara. Morocco has not been on good terms with Al-Sisi’s Egypt, and the Egyptian leader has on occasions expressed sympathy for the Polisario Front, the separatist group claiming independence in Western Sahara. President Ramaphosa, for his part, has made it crystal clear on numerous occasions that the “cause of Western Sahara is our cause.” In June 2018, the South African went as far as calling on Morocco to “decolonize” Western Sahara. Most recently, when South Africa was elected to a two-year tenure as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, President Ramaphosa said that his country will use its mandate to advance the Sahrawi quest for self-determination. Shortly after the new AU leadership was made public on Sunday evening, AU Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat tweeted that the continental organization will soon come up with a “new mechanism” and a new “roadmap” to allow for the AU to contribute “more significantly” to the UN process in Western Sahara.  Mahamat did not provide details, however. It remains to be seen whether South Africa’s well-established closeness to the “Sahrawi cause” will shape the organization’s new guidelines.

Rabat – Since the arrival of King Salman to power a few years ago, Saudi Arabia has undergone several drastic changes to the extent that one wonders what on earth is happening to the guardian Islamic orthodoxy and the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques? Are the changes introduced real and leading to better governance, or are they just bogus moves to prepare the terrain for the crown prince to become King in an area where Iran is becoming a lethal threat to the Sunni world, once led by the rich and influential Saudi Arabia? The once dormant, predictable, and tranquil Saudi Arabia was shaken to its core by the decision of King Salman to appoint his son Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) as heir to the throne in lieu of the existing heir, even though he lacked experience and wisdom. Mohammed bin Salman, unlike the majority of Saudi leaders, has been reckless in his decisions, either because he is poorly advised or just because he acts on impulses of youth and lack of experience. As soon as he assumed his new position, he came up with Vision 2030 to help wean his country from oil dependency. Many analysts believed the decision was rash and the approach poor and badly devised. To stifle mounting opposition to his manners and policies, MBS rounded up all the rich and powerful of Saudi Arabia and “quarantined” them in the luxury hotel Ritz Carlton and coerced them into giving up part of their wealth to the state to be freed, on the ground that the money they made was corruption money and embezzled state funds. Such a decision was purely political, if not tribal and not, in the least, judiciary. It was seen as a political move to silence any opposition possible and show that he is the only master on board. On an official trip to the US, MBS recognized Israel in an interview with the Atlantic magazine. The move shocked beyond belief all of Saudi Arabia and especially the orthodox religious community that wondered why he would make such a statement at a time with nothing to gain for the Palestinians and their cause. Later on, in an interview with the New York Times, he stated that Wahhabism was never the choice of the Saudi state but was imposed on them by the Western world to fight communism when it was at its height. In another controversial move, the crown prince allowed women to attend soccer matches and to drive cars previously considered no-go areas in this traditional and orthodox country. People around the world applauded the audacity of this young prince and thought that he was opening up his country, at long last, to modernity. But the young prince artfully deceived the whole world. He was not a modernist, democratic, or responsible prince. He was only eager to prepare the ground to become King and ally himself with Israel to protect him from powerful, theocratic Iran. More than anybody else, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, was not deceived by the tricks of the prince. Khashoggi denounced MBS’s methods in op-eds published by the Washington Post. MBS was annoyed by this journalist so he was awaiting the opportunity to crush him, bearing in mind that in Saudi Arabia if opponents are not easily commandeered, they are silenced with force. Thus, when Khashoggi showed his desire to marry a Turkish lady, the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Washington, D.C., advised the journalist to go to Istanbul to get the necessary legal papers at the Saudi consulate there.  The ambassador is no other than the brother of MBS, whom he had consulted before speaking to Khashoggi. The trap was set, and the bait was powerful. MBS may have thought that eliminating Khashoggi in Washington, D.C., was very risky, politically speaking, but doing it in a Muslim country like Turkey was feasible. And he was right. On October 2, Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to never reappear again. A Saudi killing squad assassinated him, dismembered his body, disposed of it, and left for the safety of the kingdom the same day. The United States, Europe, and much of the world denounced this reprehensible murder, but Saudi Arabia escaped unscathed nonetheless. The CIA report stated that MBS was behind the murder, but Trump discarded the report.  For Trump, Saudi Arabia means unlimited political and economic opportunities, and, most importantly, a weakened country and heir is a blessing in disguise. Tomorrow, MBS will become a King, but he will be a weak monarch in the hands of the West and Saudi Arabia will lose its aura, as it has lost its leadership of Islam and the Sunni world. For many Arab analysts, Khashoggi’s horrendous murder shows quite clearly that the Arab world has not changed in its mentality in spite of the Arab Spring. In fact, the Arab Spring did not fail, but like Khashoggi, it was nipped in the bud by counter-revolutionary forces that are ready to serve the vile economic and political interests of the West in return for protection and support.  Saudi Arabia did not experience the Arab Spring because the government bought social peace and political tranquility with cash. The arrival of King Salman to power and his single-handed approach to political management of the country’s governance outside of the extended family’s consensus and tribal accord sparked an unwanted power-mongering and a quiet but lethal opposition of the princes to the manners of MBS. For the time being King Salman and his heir are on a razor blade path with the traditional Persian enemy at the gate and inner circles of opposition in the making. When King Salman passes away, opposition will, probably, come out of the closet to bar MBS’s way to power and the Iranians will not only applaud that but offer their support though just symbolically. All in all, Saudi Arabia is in for political turmoil soon that will strengthen the grip of the US on the country and embolden Iran in the region and make it the only potential leader of the whole Muslim world, no matter what.

Rabat – Moroccan customs authorities at the border with the Spanish enclave of Ceuta seized 14.5 kilograms of plate-shaped hashish concealed inside a Morocco-registered motorcycle on Monday. The suspect was attempting to traffic the banned substance to Europe, a customs source told Maghreb Press Agency (MAP), noting that the drugs seized were hidden under the motorcycle’s plastic body and seat. Customs arrested the motorcycle owner, a Moroccan citizen, and handed him over to the Tetouan judicial police for further investigation under the prosecutor’s supervision. Morocco’s national strategy to fight drugs and addiction, resulted in an increase of people prosecuted in drug cases to 107,000 in 2017, according to the government’s spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi. According to statistics from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), Moroccan police seized 1.65 tons of cocaine, over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills, 52 tons of cannabis resin, and 693 kilograms of cannabis in 2018.

Rabat – Assil Belatla, a 21-year-old Algerian medical student, was murdered this weekend in Algeria. Two unknown individuals reportedly slit Belatla’s throat in his dorm room at the university campus of Taleb-Abderrahmane-2 of Ben Akhnoun in Algiers province. The attackers stole his car keys and left a homophobic message on the wall. Belatla’s friends found him dead in his dorm room on Sunday evening, February 10. On the wall, his murderers wrote in English with his blood: “He’s gay.” Belatla, originally from Bordj Bou Arreridj in Algiers province, was in his third year at the faculty of medicine. Belatla’s brutal murder has sparked the condemnation of his fellow medical students who boycotted classes, organized protests in front of the faculty buildings, and called for more security on the campus. “We demand strong security in the capus, so that not anyone can randomly come and go,” one student at the faculty agitatedly told Algerian media. Another one stated: “He was one of us, our brother. People enter without student ID cards. What happened to [Belatla] could have happened to any of us in the campus.”  People have also taken to social media to express disgust at the homophobic message. The incident is reminiscent of the murder of Prosper Nduzso, 22, a Zimbabwean senior electronics student in Sidi Amar, Annaba, a town in north eastern Algeria, over the weekend. Nduzso was stabbed to death in the chest and leg by three Algerian men when he was on his way to a market. When the student’s friends reported the incident to the police, they took a long time to get to the crime scene.  Sub-Saharan Africans led peaceful protests in Algeria to condemn the murder and how it was treated with indifference and racism by authorities.

Rabat – Judicial police arrested French suspects accused of financing terrorism on Monday in Sale, the sister city of Rabat. One of the suspects is of Algerian origin. The suspects are also facing charges of having ties with terror groups. According to a statement received by Morocco World News, an investigation found that the suspects “have been successful in forging close ties with active fighters in the ISIS group” in both the Syrian and Iraqi conflict zones. The three men were arrested in coordination with Morocco’s General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The suspects are in custody for further investigation to determine if there are other possible suspects connected to them in Morocco and abroad. Last week, an Iraqi citizen was arrested in Morocco for alleged involvement in financing terrorists in Syria and Iraq. Moroccan police said the suspect had created a “complex financial network” operating in several countries in Asia and the Middle East. He was also involved in smuggling large amounts of foreign currency outside Morocco. The Iraqi citizen had multiple bank accounts and created fake companies and exchange offices in Morocco to swindle investors before converting their money to other currencies and sending it to the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, according to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). In January, Moroccan security services also arrested a French-Algerian national wanted by France for financing terrorism.

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita is expected to take part in the Middle East Conference in Warsaw, Poland. The conference, co-hosted by the US, will see the presence of several Arab countries. Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jacek Czaputowicz announced on Monday that 60 countries will attend. The list includes “Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Israel, Yemen, Jordan, Kuwait; Morocco, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.” Czaputowicz added that Egypt and Tunisia might participate by sending vice ministers. The official also confirmed that “all EU countries will be present at the conference.” The conference will discuss the challenges and humanitarian issues facing the region. The symposium comes after rumors that Morocco had recalled its ambassadors to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. With all three countries attending the conference, representatives may be under enhanced scrutiny in their interactions. Earlier this month, a Saudi pro-government television channel aired an unfriendly documentary against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Read Also: Saudi Television Airs Polisario-Friendly Documentary, Crosses Red Line in Relationship with Morocco International news outlets widely reported that the Moroccan government recalled its ambassadors from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. However, the Moroccan government denied any tension in Moroccan-Gulf diplomatic ties. Nasser Bourita said that summoning Moroccan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mustapha Mansour back to Rabat last week was only for “consultations.” In a previous interview with Al Jazeera, Bourita confirmed that Morocco has no issue with any Gulf country, emphasizing that the diplomatic ties between Morocco and Saudi Arabia are strong.

Rabat – The European Parliament adopted the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement in a plenary session in Strasbourg today. The fisheries agreement received 415 votes in favor and 189 votes against. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), 49 MEPs were absent for the vote. Morocco and the EU signed the fisheries deal on January 14, one of the final steps in the process before ratification at the EU Parliament. The deal will allow European vessels to fish in Moroccan waters for a set amount of compensation. The deal covers the fishing area from parallel 35 and Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to parallel 22 and Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. The agreement specifies the fishing areas and access conditions for EU vessels. It also increases the EU’s financial contribution from the previous agreement’s annual payment of €40.0 million to €52.2 million. In addition to the fisheries agreement, the European Parliament also adopted the EU-Morocco agriculture deal on January 16. At the EU Parliament, 444 MEPs voted for the renewal of the agreement. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that the adoption of the agriculture agreement required intense efforts. After the adoption of the agreement, the High Representative of the EU Federica Mogherini commended the partnership between Morocco and the EU. She added that  the two partners are aspiring to make a qualitative leap in their ties to build a regional partnership, particularly in the Mediterranean, the Arab world, and Africa. The adoption of the two agreements comes despite Polisario’s threats to hamper the agreement process. Polisario threatened to appeal to the European Court of Justice and the United Nations. The Moroccan government, however, emphasized that it had already informed the UN of the adoption of the agriculture agreement. 
Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale said the EU decision would create a “legal structure that would facilitate many economic and development activities and opens the way for arranging other cooperation aspects between the two parties.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Royal Armed Forces recovered F-16 fighter planes a few days ago after several months at Edward’s Air Force Base in California, where the aircraft received upgrades.

According to the Spanish Ministry of Defense, a US air force KC-135R refueling airplane escorted the two fighter jets from the US to the sixth Ben Guerir air base north of Marrakech.

The American Harris Corporation company had won a $91 million contract to equip the Moroccan F-16s with an advanced defensive electronic warfare suite. The system has the ability to detect radar waves and protect aircraft from ground and air missile attacks.

The Moroccan Block-52 F-16 fleet is also undergoing maintenance at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Corporation, after a $16 million contract was signed in November 2016.

According to Scramble, last year Morocco expressed its interest in acquiring 12 F-16 Viper airplanes, an updated model introduced in 2012. The F-16 Viper is equipped with an advanced mission computer, a field monitoring display, and an active antenna radar.

Morocco has 36 F-16 jets. One was shot down in May 2015 in a Houthi group attack in Yemen. Since then, Morocco has withdrawn its planes from the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.

Rabat – Morocco “accounts for 50 percent of the private flights sector” in North Africa, said Zouhair Mohamed El Aoufir, CEO of the National Airports Authority (ONDA).  El Aoufir made the remarks at a press conference for the 3rd Middle East and North Africa Business Aviation Association Show (MEBAA) Morocco.  Last September, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani inaugurated the Moroccan Private Aviation Academy (MAPA) in Benslimane, near Rabat. The school offers training for ground engineers and pilots. The aviation school was reopened following protests from pilots of the state-owned airline, Royal Air Maroc (RAM). The pilots called for reestablishing the school after RAM closed their training center for pilots in 2014. El Othmani said that MAPA would meet the growing needs of the aviation industry.  Last year, the American embassy in Morocco called aerospace “the largest sector in Morocco’s economy.”  In 2017, Morocco exported more than $1.2 billion worth of aeronautical products, and jobs in the industry increased by 50 percent. The same year, more than 20 million passengers passed through one of the kingdom’s 17 airports, according to ONDA. The growth was most dramatic at Tangier’s Ibn Battuta Airport where passenger traffic was up by 26 percent compared to 2016. Last year, the Marrakech Air Show, a military parade show, took place at the RMAF military base in Marrakech. The show convened 200 exhibitors and 100 foreign delegations. The air show gives aviation business leaders in the region a marketing platform and promotes the growing aviation business in Africa. MEBAA Show is one of the largest business aviation shows in the Middle East and North Africa. The biennial business aviation show is scheduled for September 25 and 26 in Marrakech. Last year, the three-day show took place in Dubai.  MEBAA is a non-profit Emirati organization that acts as a “platform for members of the business aviation industry in the MENA region to gather, understand and communicate the needs and benefits of the industry,” according to MEBAA.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba will receive the new defense minister he appointed in January after the foiled coup attempt. Gabon’s new Minister of National Defense and Territorial Security Rose Christiane Ossouka at the Gabonese embassy in Morocco, where she will swear an oath to officially assume her office. According to a statement from the presidential office, several members of the constitutional council will attend the ceremony. Bongo also appointed a new prime minister after the attempted coup d’etat. Bongo has been in Morocco since November recovering from a stroke he suffered in Saudi Arabia in October 2018. In January, a group of rebels seized a state broadcaster and announced their plans to establish a National Restoration Council. Security officers killed two rebels and retook the National Radio Office. Bongo visited Gabon briefly in mid-January to chair a ceremony of the new government swearing in. Bongo then came back to Morocco to after a one day visit to continue his recovery.

Rabat – The Democratic Labor Confederation (CDT) plans to hold a national general strike on Wednesday, February 13, according to a statement received by Morocco World News. The secretary general of CDT, Ali Lotfi, said that the union decided to protest because of delays in “social dialogue” negotiations. Lotfi also accused the Moroccan government of hampering the social dialogue, which King Mohammed VI had urged the government to conduct quickly. Labor unions in Morocco have been calling on the government to increase government employees’ wages. Lotfi accused the government of presenting insufficient offers to increase wages. He added that CDT “was forced to carry out this strike because the Moroccan working class is suffering from low purchasing power as there are continuous rises in prices of basic food products and excessive demand.” Lotfi argued that the government “has no real political determination to negotiate with labor unions and employers.” He also threatened that the organization would file a complaint against the Moroccan government to the International Labor Office. The complaint, according to Lotfi, aims “to draw attention to the government’s gross violations of the rights of workers and labor unions.” On July 29, 2018, King Mohammed VI expressed his concern over the socio-economic disparities that hamper Morocco’s development during his speech on the eve of Throne Day. The King urged the government to take concrete measures by “restructuring national social welfare programs and submitting proposals for evaluations.” He also called on the government to reinforce social dialogue because it is “necessary and it should be an ongoing process.” He also urged the government to meet more frequently with labor unions “regardless of the potential outcome of that dialogue.” In January, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the dialogue would continue between the minister of the interior and the most representative unions. “The social dialogue is not stalling,” El Khalfi said. He also added that the head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, ordered Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit to lead the social dialogue on behalf of the government.

Rabat – A group of sub-Saharan students took the street over the weekend to protest at the cold blooded murder of a Zimbabwean student in Sidi Amar, Annaba, a town in north eastern Algeria. Prosper Nduzso, a 22-year old senior electronics student at the town’s university, was stabbed by a group of three Algerian men.  A friend of Nduzso’s, who was with the murdered student in his final hours, later told the group of the mourning and protesting sub-Saharan students that the incident occurred as he and Nduzso walked to the market to get “vegetables and chicken” for dinner.  As the university restaurant was closed, the two friends decided to go out to the nearest market and get provisions to cook for themselves, the friend explained.  Fighting back his tears, the emotional and heartbroken friend told the group of protesters that three Algerian men attacked them on their way to the market. While he battled with and punched one of the attackers in self-defense, the two others assaulted Nduzso, stabbing him in the chest and leg. “I noticed that there was lot of blood coming from his leg. Then I took him and put him inside the road. I was stopping cars but they were just passing us. They saw that the road was covered in blood but they never stopped,” he said. He stressed the total indifference that greeted his efforts to get help to transport his injured friend to the nearest hospital. It was only moments later that two Malian students, who were also going to the market and saw the incident, ran to inform the police. However, the police took a long time to come to the scene, and by the time they arrived, Prosper had already lost a lot of blood and was barely conscious. The police then called an ambulance, which also took a long time to arrive, according to the friend. At the hospital, instead of an emergency treatment to stop the bleeding and attend to Nduzso’s serious injuries, “they just banded him and put him inside the room.” He later died telling his friend that he wanted to speak to his father. In a letter that has gone viral on Facebook, the same friend recounts the whole incident in a more vigorous and emotion-filled language.  The tone of the letter is visceral and condemnatory, decrying racism and xenophobia in Algeria. “Please tell my parents that I had come to claim a diploma, but I will return in a coffin,” read part of the post. The racist murder of Nduzso comes against the backdrop of a global outcry against racism and black shaming in Algeria. In early January, Khadidja Benhamou, a dark skinned Algerian from Adrar, in Southern Algeria, won the North African country’s beauty contest. On social media, however, the young woman was bullied and insulted by hordes of Algerians who said she was “not beautiful” and did not deserve to represent Algerian women.  For the people who bullied the 2019 Miss Algeria online, her darker skin and differently shaped nose is no representative of “Algerian beauty,” which they associated with lighter skin and a more Eastern—or Arab— looking body complexion. Most recently, footage circulated of Ria Mohammed Bin Shanat, a barber in the Algerian city of Oran, ridiculing and racially abusing a black “child refugee” in his barbershop.  The video showed the barber playing with the child’ head and making racist jokes about his color. Amused, Algerian customers at the shop joined Bin Shanat in laughing at the child’s body color and hair. Apart from Libya, where, according to the latest UN report, “migrant and refugee men, women and children at the mercy of countless predators who view them as commodities to be exploited and extorted for maximum financial gain,” Algeria is widely considered as North Africa’s most unwelcoming place for sub-Saharan migrants.  Organizations including UN HCR and the International Organization for Migration have repeatedly called out Algerian authorities on their “racist,” “discriminatory,” and “inhumane” treatment of migrants and refugees.  There have been reports of migrants being rounded up to be abandoned in the mercy of unsustainable temperatures and extremist militias in the Sahara desert at the land border between Algeria and Niger. Compared with Morocco, Algeria offers more work opportunities for migrants, a group of Guinean migrants recently told Morocco World News. They added, however, that Morocco is far safer for sub-Saharans when it comes to security and racial abuses by the general population. They said they went through “hell” in Algeria. “Work is abundant there. We could work there, but at the expense of our lives and security,” one of them noted, speaking of Algeria.

The ministry added that the visit reflects the “depth and quality of bilateral ties thanks to the shared will to foster the multidimensional strategic partnership uniting the two neighbouring and friendly countries.” In July 2018 at the 5th World Congress of Middle East Studies, King Felipe said that “the relations between Morocco and Spain are strategic because we are neighbors who have shared concerns and who face common challenges and threats that we can transform into opportunities for close cooperation together with will and determination.” The King’s statement was echoed by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who paid an official visit to Morocco in November 2018. Sanchez, who was received by King Mohammed VI and held talks with Moroccan senior officials, said that his country was determined to reinforce diplomatic ties with Morocco. This will be the second time the Spanish royal family will visit Morocco since the coronation of King Felipe VI. The Spanish monarch visited Morocco in 2014. As the visit coincided with the holy month of Ramadan, King Mohammed VI and Princess Lalla Salma received them in an iftar attended by more than 300 guests.

Rabat – Morocco has invested $2.8 billion in renewable energy and is one of the 22 countries that have invested more than $2 billion in clean energy according, to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF).  Bloomberg NEF, a clean energy data provider, researching and reporting on energy trends at the global level, published the report, relayed by Moroccan media, last month. According to Bloomberg NEF, Morocco’s Noor Midelt project was the largest major solar project financed worldwide last year. The cost of the project has been estimated at $2.4 billion. Global investment in clean energy reached $332.1 billion last year, down 8 percent for 2017. The drop is due to an 24 percent decrease in commitments in favour of solar energy, NEF’s date showed.

The investment scale allocated to solar energy fell by 24 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. Despite this decrease in investments, photovoltaic capacity reached a record high—over 100 gigawatts for the first time.

Bloomberg NEF noted that there have been strong contrasts between the clean energy sectors and investment trends. Wind energy investment jumped 3 percent to $128.6 billion, whereas solar energy investment fell to $128.6 billion. The contrast, NEF noted, was due to a sharp drop in capital costs. As a result, the global benchmark for the installation costs of a megawatt of photovoltaic capacity fell by 12 percent in 2018, as manufacturers reduced their selling prices in response to the oversupply of solar panels on the global market, concludes Bloomberg NEF. Morocco has a strong renewable energy potential given its varied geography. In Ouarzazate, central Morocco, the annual averages of daily global horizontal irradiation vary from 3.86 to 7.85 kilowatt hours per square meter per day, or 7.9 to 11.2 hours of sunshine per day on average. 

In terms of wind power potential, the annual average wind speed at 10 meters in the Tangier area, north eastern Morocco, is 10 meters per second. For the Dakhla area, in the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, it varies between 7 and 8.5 meters per second.

Rabat – On February 7, Moroccan state-owned television channel 2M TV tweeted a Saudi-damning UN report on the ongoing international probe into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “The preliminary results of the investigations indicate a ‘brutal and premeditated murder’, planned and carried out by Saudi authorities,” the tweet captioned. It quoted the UN’s coverage of Agnes Callamard’s recent trip to Istanbul to launch an investigation in the Khashoggi affair. Callamard is the UN’s special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary executions. The tweet came amid growing tensions between the two countries, despite the official Moroccan line continually denying the “seriousness” of the Rabat-Riyadh spat. News reports last week indicated that Morocco had recalled its ambassadors to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The move, the Associated Press reported on February 7, meant that Morocco, whose involvement in the Yemen war had gradually “changed,” was now poised to definitely “freeze involvement in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.” In the Moroccan media and public, meanwhile, the reported move was welcomed. But the emphasis was placed on Saudi Arabia repeatedly undermining Morocco’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Giving the example of a Polisario-friendly documentary by Saudi television outlet Al-Arabiya, Moroccan media noted in chorus that beyond mere symbolism, recalling ambassadors was overdue in the increasingly frosty relations. They pointed to Riyadh’s recent history of Morocco-hostile moves, including the Morocco 2026 fiasco. The Saudi kingdom, reports overwhelmingly suggested, is still intent on “punishing” its Moroccan ally for not siding with its blockade over Qatar in the ongoing Gulf crisis. On Saturday, however, new reports cast serious doubts on earlier stories of Morocco’s rift with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Russian outlet Sputnik quoted Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita as saying, “The news is not correct, unfounded, and was not issued by an official.” Bourita added, according to Sputnik, “The history of Moroccan diplomacy confirms that it expresses its position through its own channels and not an American news agency.” Opacity, hesitation, and proxy war of words Saudi media quickly picked up Bourita’s denial.
“Recent reports in the media have been rife about diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Morocco being on a downward slide,” Al Arabiya English wrote on February 9. The point, the Saudi outlet seemed to suggest, is that things are not as serious and dramatic as reported in news stories. But even then, the Saudi newspaper gave hints of Saudi displeasure at a number of supposed Moroccan moves. Not only did Al Arabiya fail to mention its controversial documentary on Western Sahara, but it suggested that rather than being neutral in the Gulf crisis, Morocco is siding with Qatar. “It was recently noted that Moroccan-Qatari co-ordination has crossed the border beyond the region. Morocco was mentioned in a case involving allegations of a hacking operation that was carried out by Qatar within the United States,” wrote Al Arabiya. Of Morocco’s official reaction after its failed bid to win the hosting right of the 2026 World Cup, the paper said: “Twenty-four hours after the vote, King Mohammed VI chose Qatar alone from the countries that voted for his country to thank for its support.” (King Mohammed VI had thanked all African and Arab “brother countries” that voted for Morocco 2026, but he did relatively single out Qatar. He especially thanked the Qatari emir for his readiness to “financially and morally” support Morocco’s plan to host the 2030 World Cup.) While officials in Rabat and Riyadh remain apparently unconcerned by mounting evidence of the deteriorating relations between the two countries, the Al-Arabiya report and the 2M TV tweet tell a different story. In addition to the proxy war of words, one critical point for regional politics that Moroccan analysts have recently raised is the Trump administration’s “deal of the century” to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is believed to be one of the foremost champions of the deal. The plan proposes substantial compromises on Palestine’s part, including the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. “Now it’s off the table. There is nothing to negotiate,” President Trump dismissively said in late 2018 when questioned about Palestinians’ stance that East Jerusalem should be an independent Palestine’s capital. Meanwhile, Morocco, which does not support the deal, believes that Riyadh wants to impose its own agenda on other Arab countries, according to reports. Morocco’s King Mohammed VI is the current chair of the Al Quds Committee, the branch of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation tasked with “implementing all Islamic Conference resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.” As far as Morocco is concerned, Palestinians’ “right to return,” which Trump’s deal has repeatedly sidelined, should be a founding element of any resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict. No resolution without considerable territorial compromise in favor of Palestinians, Morocco and the majority of Arab countries have maintained. In addition, when Saudi Arabia’s MBS proclaimed himself the region’s focal point for resolving the conflict, it did not sit well with Moroccan policy quarters. As the current chair of the Al Quds Committee, King Mohammed VI, not MBS, should have been the region’s focal point, they have suggested. Are Riyadh and Rabat resorting to venting their frustration through news agencies instead of overtly hurting each other? Moroccan Arabic newspaper Al Ahdath Maghribia thinks so. In its February 11 edition, the Casablanca-based paper called on Bourita to end “the diplomatic opacity he has been knowingly championing for days.” According to the paper, while the Saudi Arabia-Morocco diplomatic spat is real and unmistakable, both parties are mobilizing a “diplomatic technique.” The technique is to “protest officiously” through proxies and news reports, while keeping the official tone of a “strong” and “historical alliance.” The point of the strategy is to explore one’s options and discover how far the other party is ready to go in crossing sensitive and unforgivable boundaries. Moroccan outlet Akhbar Al Yaoum agrees with the assessment. However, the paper noted, there are “obvious cracks” in Rabat-Riyadh relations, and Riyadh “has already crossed a red line.” One unmissable suggestion is that, judging by Saudi and Moroccan media reports on each other’s positions on an array of regional affairs, there are underlying disagreements between Morocco and Saudi Arabia about some basic aspects of their bilateral ties.

Rabat – Football website Transfermarkt has reported that Achraf Hakimi’s market value has jumped three times after a successful half-season with Borussia Dortmund. Transfermarkt, specialized in defining the market value of players, has valued Achraf Hakimi’s at €25 million, after being esteemed at €7.5 million with Real Madrid when he left in July 2018. When Hakimi played with Real Madrid, he rarely featured in matches. He was deemed surplus to requirement, pushing Real Madrid to loan him to Borussia Dortmund for two years. According to many football reports, Hakimi does not want to return to Real Madrid to be a substitute again, especially after improving his footballistic skills and guaranteeing a permanent spot as an undoubted starter at his current German club.  With 49 points and 20 matches played, Borussia Dortmund is ranked first in Bundesliga,  the top German football league.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has allegedly proposed to pay the Argentine Football Association MAD 10 million for an Argentina-Morocco friendly, on the condition that Lionel Messi plays. Morocco’s national football team will face off with Argentina in a friendly match on March 26 at Tangier’s grand stadium. According to Moroccan daily Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, if Messi does not show up, Morocco will allegedly pay the Argentine Football Association MAD 5 million. The match will serve as a preparation for the Atlas Lions for the coming Africa Cup of Nations championship in Egypt (CAN), planned for June 15 to July 13. Boycotting the friendly match Many Moroccans expressed their discontent at the alleged sum, arguing that Morocco could instead use the money to save “hundreds of people” dying in the Atlas and Riff mountains from the cold. They also brought up the misery of Moroccans who struggle to earn a living and die in hospitals without primary medical care. Some Moroccans started a boycott campaign on Facebook recently calling for the match to be suspended and the money to be used to improve the lives of needy people. The campaign also sent a message to Messi fans and Moroccans who will buy match tickets.  “For those who buy tickets on the pretext of support and patriotism, we all love the national team and we want the sport to evolve, but not at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged.” Friendly match viewed from an economic perspective In contrast to the boycotters’ claims, FRMF’s spending does not come entirely from the government’s coffers. However, the FRMF fund is partly filled by FIFA contributions. For instance, Morocco’s qualification for the the 2018 World Cup in Russia earned FRMF $9.5 million from FIFA.   The FRMF is financed mainly by broadcasting rights and sponsors’ donations, such as the MDJS—the body responsible for sports gambling in Morocco. It is also sponsored by Coca Cola (MAD 2.4 million), Sidi Ali (MAD 4.7 million), and Maroc Telecom (MAD 32 million), in addition to several Moroccan food companies. Morocco World News attempted to contact FRMF to obtain more information about the speculations. However, FRMF was unreachable. Morocco’s insistence that Messi play with his national team in March may help promote the country, due to the Argentinian legend’s advertising value, as the player is followed by hundreds of millions of fans around the globe.  When Cristiano Ronaldo joined Italian club Juventus F.C., the club reportedly sold more than 600,000 of Ronaldo’s jerseys in 24 hours, raising €60 million. In contrast, Juventus sold only 850,000 jerseys for all its players in 2016. FRMF may gain more than the $1 million to be paid to the Argentinian governing body. FRMF will cash in on revenue through broadcasting rights from the Doha-based sports broadcasting company beIN Sports which will televise the match. In addition, Argentinian broadcasting companies will pay to televise it.

Rabat – American insurance website Squaremouth has reported that Morocco tourism sector is doing great. Morocco was among its top four fastest growing travel destinations. Egypt, Tanzania, and Colombia also made the list. Morocco had the second highest year-by-year increase at 73 percent. Egypt ranked number one with an increase of 146 percent. Tanzania pulled in a 61 percent increase and Columbia 60 percent. The four countries surpassed Israel, Iceland, Portugal, and Vietnam, last year’s fastest growing travel destinations.  The data was based on Squaremouth’s statistics revealing where its customers bought travel insurance for the most.  The website reported that their average traveler to Morocco spent $3,673.32 on their trip, a 7 percent increase from 2017. Interestingly, the website noted a large boom of tourists from the “Silent Generation” to Morocco, at a 76% increase. The Silent Generation generally refers to those born between 1925 and 1942, who are in their 70s and 80s today. According to Morocco’s tourism observatory, Marrakech, Agadir, and Casablanca are the most popular tourist destinations in Morocco. Statistics released by the observatory in November 2018 show the largest increase in tourist arrivals that year came from the US, with a rise of 28 percent. Statistics from the observatory clearly show that Morocco is becoming a more popular tourist destination for Americans. In 2010, just 159,508 tourists arrived from the US from January to October. In the same period in 2018, however, 316,450 tourists arrived from the US. US tourists still only make up a small percentage of tourists in Morocco, and only increased from 2 percent to 3 percent from 2010 to 2018. Morocco still gets most of its foreign tourists, 31 percent, from France. Tourists from Spain are the second most common at 20 percent. It is safe to assume tourism from the US will increase even further in 2019, especially with Royal Air Maroc (RAM) adding more direct flights between the two countries.  Just last week, the airline announced it will launch a direct flight between Boston and Casablanca this summer, bringing the number of flights offered by RAM across the Atlantic to seven. RAM also serves New York and Washington, D.C., and will launch a flight to Miami in the spring. Morocco appeals to tourists due to its reputation as a safe destination and its rich culture and history.

Rabat – On Sunday, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a map to condemn the threat posed by Iran’s missile program, targeting Europe. In a tweet shared on Sunday, the ministry said that “Iran has deployed ballistic missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), placing dozens of countries, including part of Europe, under the regime’s range of fire.” To explain the Iranian threat, the ministry used a map that cuts off northern Morocco. Several internet users condemned the map. Several people commented on the absence of the northern part of Morocco. “The map does not make sense at all … what happened to the northern part of Morocco, disappeared because of the global warming?” one wrote sarcastically. The same commenter also wondered if the graphic designer “has issues with editing layered vector maps or is it just a joke…!” The map doesn’t make sense at all… what happened to the northern part of Morocco, disappeared because of the global warming? 🧐 or is it your graphic designer that has issues with editing layered vector maps 😐 or is it just a joke…! — Simo Ben (@simo_online) February 11, 2019  Another Twitter user also asked, “so basically, Iran tried their missiles on Morocco and the country disappeared.” Several other commenters asked Israel to delete the post and share another map with the entire map of Morocco.

By Amal El Attaq  Rabat – Yesterday, based on an ‘official’ document, many news outlets reported that former Moroccan Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane monthly receives an “additional pension.” The document indicated that Benkirane receives an exceptional pension of 7 million centimes (MAD 70,000) at the end of each month as a supplementary pension on top of the regular civilian pension he receives. The document, called a dahir, includes three items: The first mentions the pension amount. The second says that “the exceptional pension is given at the end of each month as a supplementary pension for the civil pension he receives.” The item added that the pension comes out of the government budget. Abdelilah Benkirane denied receiving the additional pension. He said he only received a pension as a parliamentarian which he began collecting after King Mohammed VI appointed him as head of government. On a Facebook Live video, he said, “This is fake news, the only pension I receive now is the exceptional one under instructions from King Mohammed VI, as I explained before,” said Abdelilah Benkirane. He commented the exceptional pension pleased him. “I challenge them to bring evidences for this, but I am sure they will not find, and this requires an apology,” added Benkirane. Speaking in a video last night, Benkirane promised to leave the country if there was evidence proving he gets an additional pension. “These are just lies, and I am challenging them to bring any evidences. If they do so, I promise to leave the country definitely,” said Benkirane. Benkirane threatened that he would resort to the judicial system and ended his video asking the head of the Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou, to investigate his assets and “if anything is found, then I will ask him to expose me in front of public.” he said. After receiving criticism on social media last month, Benkirane admitted getting a pension estimated at MAD 70,000 monthly under instructions from King Mohammed VI. The King granted the pension when he heard Benkirane had financial problems.

In addition to Laura Prioul and another woman from Saint-Tropez in southern France, several other women declared to the “Sept A Huit” program on French television channel TF1 that Moroccan pop singer Saad Lamjarred had raped them.  The Sept A Huit program dedicated a report, called “Saad Lamjarred, star and rapist?” to the singer’s rape scandals on Sunday. The report provided testimonials from Lamjarred’s first French plaintiff, Laura Prioul, who had agreed to speak up in an interview with the Sept A Huit. Prioul, who had already released online her version of the story in a video in 2016, told Sept A Huit that after she posted the video, other women contacted her, saying that they were also victims of Lamjarred, including “a Moroccan woman and an Algerian woman.”. Prioul said that she still continues to receive harsh and insulting messages ever since she posted the video. Sept A Huit reported that its journalists received emails from women who said they were raped by the Moroccan star. Lamjarred’s Saint Tropez accuser, a young French seasonal worker, has declined to speak out about the rape to the media. The report stated that Lamjarred “has been shielded” by Moroccan authorities but still “lost many of his fans.” French news channel LCI described his rape cases as an instance of “omerta” in which there was a conspiracy to protect Lamjarred from facing justice, a circumstance his accusers have denounced. The 33-year-old singer, who has been in and out of jail several times since his first arrest for the sexual assault of Prioul, spent more than two months in southern France’s Draguignan prison, following his second arrest on rape charges last August 26. On December 5, the French judicial system released Lamjarred on probation after he paid a €150,000 bail bond. Following his release, many Moroccan celebrities congratulated Lamjarred through social media posts, welcoming him back. Lamjarred’s first rape accusation came in 2010 in New York. US prosecutors dropped the case when the plaintiff withdrew her testimony.

Rabat – Government subsidies of butane gas and sugar cost 13 percent more in 2018 than in 2017. The government spent MAD 15.5 billion according to a report from the subsidy fund published on February 8 and relayed by Moroccan media.  The government’s butane gas subsidy costs also increased in 2018 while the cost of the sugar subsidy decreased. 
Between January 2018 and 2019, the government’s butane gas subsidy expenses cost MAD 12.1 billion, including MAD 370 million as transport costs.  The butane gas expenses are up 17 percent compared to 2017. In 2017, the subsidy fund only spent MAD 10.3 million on butane gas subsidies. 

The increase is linked to a rise in international prices over the past year. Butane gas prices peaked in September and October, surpassing $600 per metric ton, before falling in November and December, the report explained. 

Despite the sharp drop in prices at the end of 2018 ($383 per ton in December), the average price of butane gas for 2018 was 11 percent higher than in 2017. 

As a result, the cost of subsidizing each bottle of gas increased in 2018. The unit subsidy averaged MAD 69.4 for a 12 kilogram bottle and MAD 15.34 for a 3 kilogram bottle in 2018, compared to MAD 62.5 and MAD 13.39 in 2017.  Stagnant sugar charges  Sugar prices were on a downward trend in 2018, bottoming out in May at $286 per ton. Sugar prices were at an annual high in January at $323 per ton, according to the report. 

The annual average sugar price on the international market was down by 22 percent compared to 2017. Morocco’s sugar subsidy costs remained the same in 2018 as 2017, estimated at MAD 3.4 billion. 

The flat-rate subsidy for sugar per kilogram is fixed at MAD 2.8. The payment of the subsidy for gas and sugar products, approved at the end of 2018, amounted to MAD 12.4 billion—MAD 9.6 billion for butane gas and MAD 2.8 billion for sugar, the report states.

The subsidy fund’s outstanding costs at the end of January 2019 amounted to MAD 5.27 billion, including MAD 4.4 billion for butane gas and MAD 828 million for sugar.

Rabat – The competition, named “Into Orbit” this year, did not only focus on space science and robotic engineering but also on teaching participants the value of teamwork to qualify for international robotic contests. Nearly 500 Moroccan students aged 6 to 16 from different cities in the country participated, making up 44 teams, each made of 2 to 10 students who competed to win one of LEGO League’s six categories. The competition’s jury of local experts honored 11 teams as winners in various categories. In the “project” category, the teams called “Apollo” and “Flexius” won first and second place; the “Galaxy Pioneers” and “FBF” won the “solutions” category; and “Space X” and “Astronauts” won the “best performance” category. Team “Winners” won “best programming”; “Galactic Warriors” won “best strategy”; “Steamlab” won “inspiration and creativity”; “Space Techno” won “best teamwork”; and “Smartbolt” won “best design.” The students were highly encouraged by their families who were also present at the competition. On the sidelines of the event, a small LEGO competition, “First LEGO League Jr,” was dedicated to children aged 6 to 8 and focused on life in the moon. The competition was organized by Loop Technology in partnership with Play Academy, an education center in Casablanca. Young Moroccan students have also competed internationally in robotics. Last November, for the first time a Moroccan delegation of 4 teams aged 7 to 17 represented their country at the final phase of the World Robot Olympiad, a robotics competition in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The teams had won a qualification phase on June 9, in Casablanca, attended by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani.

Rabat – In power since 1999, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is down for a fifth term as president after receiving support from his ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN). On Saturday, the FLN coordinator, Mouad Bouchareb, said that FLN “designated President Bouteflika as the party’s candidate.” On Sunday Bouteflika announced his determination to run for a fifth term. He said that he agreed to run “in response to all pleas and calls.” While some activists question Bouteflika’s decision, the Algerian president said that “the firm willpower to serve” his country has never left him. “…It will enable me to overcome difficulties related to illness,” said Bouteflika, acknowledging that he is no “longer as physically strong as” he was before. In response, some Algerian activists launched a campaign online against a fifth term. Using the hashtag Let_Him_Rest or Khaliwh Yertah, activists are implying that Algerian elites pressured Bouteflika into running for a fifth term. Online activists created a Facebook page under the same hashtag. “A president who cannot carry out his duties towards the country and the people, a president who does not give speeches, does not sign decrees, does not appoint, does not isolate, does not make field visits, does not meet invitations, does not receive heads of state, a [president] who does not declare war and peace is an illegal president according to Article 102 of the Constitution,” read a post on the Facebook page. The post added that Bouteflika “is a president who does not rule but [Algeria] ruled through him.” Algerians and international analysts have criticized Bouteflika for being absent at international summits and for not receiving officials. In December 2018, internet users mocked the president when his office announced that the president could not meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman because he had the flu. Seizing the flu comment, some asked whether Bouteflika is capable of running for a fifth term. Last year, former French Ambassador to Algeria Bernard Bajolet also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead, saying that the president is kept alive “artificially.” In December again, the CEO of Cevital Algerie, Issad Rebrab, also criticized Bouteflika, saying that the president is not even “aware” of recent developments in the country He argued there is an “invisible hand” governing Algeria.

Rabat – Spanish news outlets are widely reporting that King Felipe VI of Spain will arrive in Morocco this week. Melilla Hoy wrote that the Spanish King and his wife, Queen Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano, are set to arrive in Morocco on February 13 for a two-day visit. The visit, according to Spanish media, has been on the royal agenda since 2016 but has been postponed several times. Despite the postponement of the visits, King Felipe VI expressed satisfaction with the Moroccan-Spanish diplomatic ties. Spain and Morocco maintain a strong diplomatic ties. The prime minister of the Iberian country said as much during his first official visit to Morocco in November 2018. King Felipe VI spoke positively about the strategic ties in July 2018 at the 5th World Congress of Middle East Studies. “The relations between Morocco and Spain are strategic because we are neighbors who have shared concerns and who face common challenges and threats that we can transform into opportunities for close cooperation together with will and determination,” he said. He also said that the two countries’ strategic bonds are based on “mutual trust, respect, and cultural affinity.” The Spanish monarchs made their last visit to Morocco in 2014. King Mohammed VI and Princess Lalla Salma received them in an iftar attended by more than 300 guests. In addition to their strong diplomatic ties, Morocco and Spain are also strong business partners. According to data from the European Statistics Office, Moroccan exports to Spain increased by 5.4 percent during the first 11 months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Moroccan imports of Spanish goods also recorded an increase of 2.6 percent from a year before.

Rabat – Head of Government and Chairman of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Saad Eddine El Othmani stated during a meeting with party members that “there are rumors and misinformation about H1N1 on social media” instilling panic. El Othmani expressed surprise that some schools had closed because of rumors exaggerating the H1N1 outbreak. He argued, “It is very normal and only affects people with a weak immune system or suffering from chronic diseases.”  He added that H1N1 is “living its last days” this year. He said the seasonal virus was more stable than previous years, reflecting the Ministry of Health’s statement last week. H1N1 killed 16 people in recent weeks in Morocco. According to the health minister, Anas Doukkali, of the patients with flu-like illnesses or respiratory tract infections, 20 percent have H1N1 flu. The epidemic reached its peak during the week from January  7 to 13. El Othmani said that there are many entities who are envious of Morocco and want to shake its stability and destroy its ability to attract investors, which is “understandable,” given its achievements. Although conflicts within the government are a given, El Othmani stressed that harmony between the ruling government coalition is vital to the success of the country’s projects. El Othmani said: “Moroccans should be proud of their country’s achievements instead of belittling them.” He added, “It’s the government’s duty to solve” their problems, mainly the lack of employment.  According to a High Commission for Planning (HCP) briefing note published on Tuesday, the unemployment rate in the country dropped among diploma holders from 2017 to 2018, while the highest unemployment increases were among university graduates. Morocco created 112,000 jobs in 2018; 91,000 in urban areas and 21,000 in rural areas. The figure is up from 86,000 new jobs in 2017.

Rabat – Italian media outlet Analisi Difesa published a report about the scourge of terrorism in the Sahel region. The 13-page analysis written by Anna Rita Palamerio said that the Tindouf camps in southwest Algeria suffer “serious social conditions,” where thousands of Sahrawis live in alleged unbearable living conditions, furthering “the spread of terrorism in the Sahel-Saharan region.” The author of the analysis added that the camps serve as the main source of recruitment for several terror organizations, including  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJW). Like several Moroccan senior officials, the writer of the feature emphasized that the region has become a breeding ground for terrorism and drug trafficking networks. Analisi Difesa added that the situation in the camps encourages illegal activities, leading the recruitment of young people into rebel movements, armament and training of terrorist groups. The feature also mentions the kidnapping of foreign nationals in the Tindouf camps by the Polisario. It is not the first time the Polisario have been accused of kidnapping. In 2018, Spanish news outlet El Confidencial said that Polisario members were involved in the kidnappings of Spanish citizens working in the Phosboucraa site, Laayoune, in 1974. The situation in the Sahel has been front and center in the work of  Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ). Abdelhak El Khiame, head of the BCIJ said last year that many gangs and criminal networks consider the Sahel region a safe haven for terror cells. Khiame also addressed the overlap between terror groups and drug trafficking criminals due to poverty. He added that illegal activities serve as a means of escaping poverty for many separatists living in the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria. Khiame also emphasized that the Polisario can also be considered a terror group in the Sahel. He added that the BCIJ managed to identify more than a hundred Polisario Front members, who are operating in AQIM and “they have been involved in attacks in northern Mauritania.”

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – Behind massive walls in Midelt, central Morocco, lies the small Catholic community of Notre Dame de L’Atlas. The walls enclose a large courtyard, a small chapel, and a memorial for the seven brothers of Tibhirine who were killed in Algeria.  The community, belonging to the Cistercian order, was originally from the Atlas Abbey of Tibhirine near Medea, Algeria. During the Algerian Civil War, seven monks from the order were kidnapped, held for two months, and found decapitated in May of 1996. The Algerian government announced later that month that the heads of the clergymen had been discovered. Two monks, Father Jean-Pierre and Father Amedee, managed to escape the kidnapping and survived the deadly attack.  In 2010, a film about the tragedy, “Des Hommes et des Dieux” (Of Gods and Men), won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival. The two surviving monks left Algeria and traveled to the current Notre Dame de l’Atlas monastery in Midelt, Morocco. The new order, which began in 2001, was formed by a community of monks who joined the two survivors of Tibhirine. Inside the compound, the monks work, pray, live, and welcome visitors. Father Amedee died in 2008, and Father Jean Pierre Schumacher is the only living survivor of the 1996 tragedy. Living within the monastery are six brothers from France, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal. The brothers follow the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, also called Trappists, a Roman Catholic contemplative order dedicated to prayer.  Brother Anthony McNamara, a monk from Ireland, came to the monastery after recognizing the increasing anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of ISIS killings. McNamara became invested in the Syrian crisis and learned about the devastation that Muslim people experience attributed to ISIS. It was after McNamara saw powerful images and news stories about victims in Syria that he came to the realization that the violence was affecting everyone. “This brought home to me how we are all, Christian and Muslim, caught up in this terrible violence,” said McNamara. “We all believe in the same God, and here are these terrible murders being carried out in His name.” As he celebrated midnight mass on Christmas Eve of 2015, McNamara decided to go to Notre Dame de L’Atlas to become a member of what he calls “a praying community amongst a praying community.” Since Notre Dame de L’Atlas is a praying order, the monks come together seven times a day to pray. “Our Muslim brothers and sisters are called to pray five times a day. So together in this little spot of Midelt, Christians and Muslims pray to the same God,” said McNamara. Even though the monastery is hidden, the surrounding community nonetheless plays a key role in the church. During Lent, the six-week Christian religious observance leading up to Easter, the Midelt community supports the brothers in their daily fasts. At times, members prepare an evening meal for the brothers in order to show their support.“We are supported by prayer, kindness, love, generosity, and their acceptance,” said McNamara. Likewise, during Ramadan, the brothers in the monastery fast in solidarity with the Muslim community around them and are often included in their celebrations. The monks attend weddings and funerals and celebrate birth and death alongside their neighbors. McNamara hopes the community “feels that we show respect and love to them, I certainly hold them in great esteem. They are a God-loving community.” On December 8, 2018, the 7 monks and 12 clergymen, victims of the Algerian civil war, were beatified in Oran, Algeria. It was the first beatification ceremony in a Muslim nation, and Muslims and Christians alike attended the ceremony.  The distinction means the Catholic Church considered the 19 to have performed at least one miracle on earth and to have entered heaven. After beatification, the Catholic Church looks for a second miracle before the canonizing, or making the individuals saints. Five of the monks from Notre Dame de L’Atlas travelled to Algeria for the ceremony. However, due to passport issues, McNamara stayed in Morocco and watched the ceremony on television. In McNamara’s opinion, the highlight of the ceremony was when two men, both named Mohammed, were celebrated. One of the men, a policeman and father of 10, saved the life of Prior Christian de Cherge of the Cistercian Community in Tibhirine. The two had formed a spiritual friendship. One day, Mohammed protected De Cherge’s life from the National Liberation Front. He was assassinated the next day.  “This supreme act of love by a Muslim friend was to mark Christian profoundly for the rest of his life,” said McNamara. Before Christian de Cherge was kidnapped and killed in 1996, he wrote a testament to be opened if he was killed by the war. In the testament, he asked that his death be associated with other equally violent ones that are forgotten.  “If it should happen one day – and it could be today – that I become a victim of the terrorism … I would like my community, my Church, and my family to remember that my life was given to God and [Algeria],” said the testament. Additionally, De Cherge forgave the person who would ultimately kill him. De Cherge proclaimed a great love for Islam in his testament. “I will be able to see the children of Islam as He sees them—He whose secret joy is to bring forth our common humanity amid our differences.” The other man celebrated at the beatification ceremony, also named Mohammed, was 22 and a friend of Bishop Pierre Claverie of Oran. Despite the risk he took by working with the bishop, Mohammed remained loyal. In August 1996, Mohammed picked up Bishop Pierre from the airport. When they arrived at the bishop’s residence that evening, a remote controlled bomb was ignited. The two died together. For McNamara, it is important that the ceremony remembered the two men. “The ceremony was a great tribute not only to the 19 Christian Martyrs but to the thousands who died during those violent years,” said McNamara. “The two Mohammeds represent for me how the blood of Christians and Muslims was mingled together in great violence.”  As for the future of Notre Dame de L’Atlas, the monks are excitedly anticipating the visit of Pope Francis to Morocco in late March. “We feel it is a very important occasion both for Christians and Muslims and that it will bring both faiths closer together,” stated McNamara. The pope’s visit will be the second time a pope has visited Morocco. Pope John Paul II made the first visit in August 1985. Despite challenges and conflict between faiths around the world, McNamara remains hopeful that the Christian and Muslim faiths can come together as demonstrated by Notre Dame de L’Atlas and its surrounding community in Midelt. “In a world where there is so much violence, it is good to be a part of a praying community of Christians and Muslims living side by side in peace and love adoring and praising the same God.”

Rabat – In recent years, the Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad has been focusing on programs designed to protect their rights and to promote their interest in Morocco’s development and integrity. This time, the ministry convened dozens of Moroccan lawyers residing abroad in Marrakech in their third forum held under the theme “Family Code in the Light of Comparative Law and International Conventions.” The symposium, which was attended by Morocco World News, aimed to address  family law challenges that Moroccan expats encounter in their host countries.  The two-day conference, which took place on February 8-9, attracted Moroccan lawyers from several countries, especially European ones. During a press conference the Minister Delegate in Charge of Moroccan Expats, Abdelkrim Benatiq welcomed his guests participating in the forum, pointing out the development that Morocco has witnessed in recent years. Benatiq opened the conference, emphasizing that the meeting aims to discuss several topics of interest to all Moroccan overseas. Referring to the Family Law, Benatiq said that the topic is “of interest to the Moroccans of the world, whether in the countries of transition or in relation to the legal system in the country of origin.”  Panelists and attendees discussed two main topics: “The effects of judgments rendered and contracts concluded abroad, in the field of family law, in the light of international conventions” and “the protection of the child in the light of international conventions.” The discussions aimed to face the challenges that Moroccan families face due to the disparities in family law as a result of differences between Muslim legal systems and secular legal systems. Acknowledging the challenges faced by Moroccans, Benatiq said that “we should not be afraid of the challenges and difficulties facing societies and families.” Speaking on Morocco’s family law, also known as Moudawana, Benatiq added that the effectiveness of Morocco’s family code “depends not only on its relevance to solving problems at the national level but also on its ability to be coherent and to resist the profound changes that the family institution and legal regimes in the host countries.” Morocco introduced the family code in 1956 after gaining its independence. The text witnessed reforms in 2004 to address women’s rights and gender equality within an Islamic legal framework. It also regulates marriage, polygamy, divorce, inheritance, and child custody. MREs contribute to the development of Morocco The official also commended the five million Moroccans living abroad for their attachment to their motherland. Benatiq said that Morocco’s continuous development relies on its MREs.  He also invited Moroccans to engage in debating and proposing solutions to Morocco’s challenges.  MREs also received special thanks from the official for instilling Moroccan spirits to preserve their identity and traditions. In July 2018, Benatiq said that Moroccans overseas always show concern for issues related to their country. Migration, which is a major topic for the Moroccan government, was also the heart of the event. Benatiq said that Morocco became a destination rather than a transit country, especially for sub-Saharan migrants. According to the official, 50,000 sub-Saharan migrants have their status regularized and now have access to several services, including health, vocational training, and education. The General Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Abdelillah Lahkim Bennani, and the public prosecution, Mohammed Abdennabaoui, commended the effective role of the Ministry in Charge of MREs in preserving the rights of expatriates to ensure their smooth integration, in addition to helping them overcome their struggles.  President of the Association of Moroccan Lawyers Abroad, Hilal Tarkou Lahlimi, and several Moroccan lawyers living abroad also attended the symposium.

Rabat – Algerian ruling party National Liberation Front (FLN) announced on Saturday its candidate for April’s presidential election. Unsurprisingly, FLN chose President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as its candidate to run for the fifth term in this year’s election. The FLN coordinator, Mouad Bouchareb, said that the party “designated President Bouteflika as the party’s candidate.” Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said on February 2 that he backs Bouteflika, emphasizing that he remains the “best candidate.” Rally for Culture and Democracy, an Algerian opposition party, is against Bouteflika’s re-election. The party’s spokesperson Yassine Aissiouane said that “there will be no election but an appointment of the head of state.” This is not the first time politicians and journalists have criticized Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth term. Adalberto Agozino, an analyst at the Alternative News Agency of Argentina, said in September 2018 that Algeria’s sacking of military officials was a way to “steal” the next election and questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead in the fifth term. The Algerian government launched a purge of the military in 2018, sacking several top military officers for alleged officers. Former French Ambassador to Algeria Bernard Bajolet also criticized Bouteflika, questioning his ability to lead. He said that Bouteflika is being kept alive “artificially.” Last year, Algerian journalist Lila Haddad recorded a video at the European Parliament’s studio in Brussels, denouncing the Algerian regime for “undermining”  the dignity of Algerian citizens. The journalist, who is based in Brussels, also said that Bouteflika is “nothing more than a heap of flesh exposed to the world.” Two other candidates will run for election, including former Prime Minister Ali Benflis and Major General Ali Ghediri. Bouteflika has been in power since 1999.  He suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013.

Rabat – The Vatican has released Pope Francis’ program to Morocco. Vatican News said that King Mohammed VI will receive the Pope on March 30, a Saturday. The agenda shows that the Pope will also meet with civil authorities and senior officials during the visit. Pope Francis will also meet with migrants at the “offices of the local branch of aid agency Caritas.” On his second day in Morocco, the Pope will also visit a “rural center for social services in the town of Temara,” near Rabat. Pope Francis will also meet with priests, and religious men and women, as well as members of the “ecumenical council of churches.” The Pope’s visit will be closed by the celebration of a “solemn papal Mass” on Sunday evening. Last week, the pope arrived in the UAE to advance the principles of religious freedom and coexistence. Pope Francis announced that his visits to the UAE and Morocco “represent two important opportunities to advance interreligious dialogue and mutual understanding between the followers of both religions.” The pope’s visit will be the second of its kind from a pope to Morocco after the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1985. Late King Hassan II invited Pope John Paul II as an opportunity to build a bridge between Muslims and Christians.

Rabat – The Canadian shooter who killed 6 people in a Quebec city mosque in 2017 received a life sentence. According to BBC, the 29-year old will not be eligible parole for 40 years. The judge of the court,  Francois Huot, refused to accept a prosecution request for a 150-year prison sentence against the defendant, explaining that it exceeds his life expectancy. The judge added that this sentence, which would have been the longest in Canada’s history, would be an unusual sentence in Canadian law. The judge, however, condemned the crime. Quoted by Times of India, the judge said, “With your hatred and racism, you’ve ruined their lives, yours and your parents and the crime you’ve done deserves the greatest denunciation.” In the courtroom, the defendant said that he regretted his deeds, denying that he is Islamophobic. The armed man carried out the attack during the evening prayer, entering the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec and opening fire in all directions. The terrorist killed six people and injured several others. On Monday, February 4, the Quebec government gave several victims of the shooting awards. Azeddine Soufiane, a Moroccan man killed in the shooting, received the Good Citizen medal for bravery posthumous.  Canada gave the Moroccan man the medal for trying to hold the murderer back when he was attempting to reload his weapon. However, the terrorist freed himself and killed Soufiane. Soufiane’s wife and his three children received the medal on his behalf.

Rabat – The adviser to US President Donald Trump, Jared Kushner, is expected to visit Morocco after his Middle East tour, which will also include Qatar. Anadolu Agency said that the US official is expected in other Gulf countries, such as UAE, Oman, and Bahrain. Israeli news outlets reported that Trump’s special envoy to the region Jason Greenblatt will accompany Kushner during his tour, which aims to discuss the economic aspects of the US peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. According to American media, the Trump administration is expected to release details of the peace plan immediately after the April 9 elections in Israel. Since the Trump administration announced its intention to rekindle the peace process, it has so failed to garner the necessary support from most of its Arab allies.  With the exception of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt who initially supported Trump’s plan, most countries of the region have expressed skepticism about Trump’s ability to broker a fair plan that respects the rights of the Palestinians to statehood.  Arab countries’s skepticism became more apparent following Trump’s unilateral decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the Jerusalem. After Trump’s announcement, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that Palestine will boycott the US peace plan for the conflict. “The United States are no longer an honest mediator in the peace process. We will not accept any plan put from the United States,” he said during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macro in December 2017.  Morocco was among the countries that deplored Trump’s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Rabat – Marriott International has announced its plan to expand in Africa. The company is planning to team with the United Real Estate Company, part with Kuwait Projects company to open a resort near Marrakech. The project, ST. Regis Marrakech, is set to open in 2024, said the two companies in a joint statement. The project is part of three deals the company signed to expand its presence in North and West Africa. The company announced the new agreements on the sidelines of the Forum de L’Investissement Hotelier African in Marrakech. According to Business Report, the event aims to drive “investment into tourism in the region.” The company is set to open new resorts in Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. Marriott has not revealed the budget allocated for the projects. Marriott’s St Regis, however, will be owned by Morocco’s Assoufid Properties Development. Marrakech is one of Morocco’s top destinations for both local and international tourists. The red city recorded over 2.4 million tourist arrivals from January to November 2018 in addition to 2.6 million scheduled hotel stays through the end of 2018. Tourists choose Morocco for its stable and safe atmosphere, a key element that attracts international investors.  Morocco, which maintained this level over the last three years, is the only country to have a low-risk level in North Africa, according to the  2019 Travel Risk Map. Morocco is deemed as safe as most European countries, as well as the US and Canada, who else have a low-risk level.

Rabat – The country is well on track to hit its target too with 35% of its energy is already renewable thanks to sites such as Noor Ouarzazate,” the source added, noting that it’s not just on the track that “Morocco is aiming to become a world leader in renewable energy.” As well as a host nation of a Formula ePrix, the country is also home to the world’s largest concentrated solar farm, CNN said. Built on an area of more than 3,000 hectares in area – the size of 3,500 football fields — the Noor-Ouarzazate complex, produces enough electricity to power a city the size of Prague, or twice the size of Marrakech, it noted. Situated at the gateway to the Sahara Desert, the whole complex provides 580 megawatts — saving the planet from over 760,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. Unlike conventional solar panels which deliver energy direct to the grid, curved mirrors concentrate radiation to heat tubes of fluid which are pumped to a power unit, the source said, noting that the unit holds the energy for use at a later time — specifically at night when demand is greater. A cylinder full of salt is melted by the warmth from the mirrors during the day, and stays hot enough at night to provide up to three hours of power, according to World Bank, who financed construction of the plant with a $400 million loan combined with $216 million provided from the Clean Technology Fund. Morocco has one of most ambitious energy targets in the world: The goal is for 42% of its power to come from renewable sources by 2020, the US TV channel said. Imported fossil fuels currently provide for 97% of Morocco’s energy need, according to World Bank. As a result the country is keen to diversify and start using renewable energy. “Morocco is an emergent country,” Yassir Badih, senior project manager at the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN) told CNN. “Electricity demand has doubled since 2010 and by 2030 we want Morocco to be one of the first countries in the world for renewables to exceed share of fossil energy,” he added.

Rabat- In a reported follow-up to its recently reported Saudi Arabia move, Morocco has purportedly recalled Mohamed Aitouali, the country’s ambassador to the UAE. Morocco is resorting to symbolic, but bold measures to stress its sovereign and independent foreign policy, anonymous Moroccan diplomatic sources “confirmed” to online newspaper Maghreb Intelligence. They explained that Rabat is poised to reassert its relations with its longtime strong Gulf allies in a context of mounting tension. But the newspaper’s sources did not elaborate. They simply emphasized that “all evidence” indicate that Rabat wants to stress its commitment to national sovereignty. Aitouali was reportedly already in Rabat when his ministry decided to “recall him for consultations.” The ambassador has now been in Morocco for a week, and it is not sure when or whether he will resume work in Abu Dhabi. “Consultations” in such cases may take days or years, depending on how the parties deal with the disagreement. Symbolic in nature, the recalling of ambassadors is a move countries often resort to in order to highlight displeasure at a policy or position from a partner country, or the need for a fundamental shift in the bilateral relations. What is it in the Morocco-UAE case? Again the sources did not elaborate. They simply stressed that “it is natural” for Morocco to recall its UAE representative after doing the same with the country’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Only Rumors? Reports began circulating on Thursday this week that Rabat recalled its Saudi representative in protestation at the proliferation of anti-Morocco discourses in the Gulf kingdom. The UAE news came against that background of reported hostilities between Rabat and Riyadh, giving a pretence of validation that a follow-up was needed as far as Morocco’s relationship with two of its strongest Gulf allies is concerned. Earlier today, however, Russian outlet Sputnik reported (link in Arabic) that news of Morocco recalling Saudi Arabia and UAE ambassadors were fabricated. Quoting Moroccan foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita, the Russian newspaper reported that “Morocco had done no such things.” Bourita allegedly said that Morocco does not need to pass through an American newspaper to announce such important decisions, referring to the Associated Press, which on Thursday reported that Morocco had recalled its Saudi Arabia representative. Instead, Bourita noted, Rabat has its own information mechanism through which announcements pertaining to the country’s critical diplomatic decisions are made, if authentic. However, Bourita’s alleged denial of the Associated Press story does not seem to align with recent statements made by Mustapha Mansouri, Morocco’s ambassador to Riyadh. In an interview with Moroccan outlet Le 360, the Moroccan ambassador confirmed that he had been recalled for consultations, even if he attempted to dismiss the exaggerated press coverage of what he called “a temporary crisis.” Mansouri said “divergences are normal” between partners and he hoped that relations between Morocco and Saudi Arabia “will soon go back to normal.” While contradictory narratives pile up and it is not yet sure which one to cling to, news of Morocco taking bold measures against its Gulf allies come against the backdrop of deteriorating relations. Denial does not whitewash existing tension Last week, Saudi Television outlet Al-Arabiya aired a documentary that challenged Morocco’s claims on Western Sahara. Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara is a foundational part of Morocco’s identity, and many Moroccans took the Al-Arabiya documentary as a blatant disregard for Moroccan interests. MENA observers have overwhelmingly agreed that the Al-Arabiya episode was the last straw in a series of latent rift in the “brotherly” and “historical” ties that used to characterize the two kingdoms’ relations. But even Maghreb Intelligence’s sources refrained from dramatizing the signs of fissure in Morocco’s historical ties to its Gulf allies. They said that a definitive rift will be avoided through “brotherly” dialogue. Meanwhile, they suggested that the symbolic moves were needed to stress, especially in the Gulf crisis in which Morocco has opted for “constructive neutrality,” that for Rabat strong alliance does not imply following allies’ guidelines. And while Bourita’s alleged denial of the “rumored” news come as a blow to the series of celebratory messages that greeted the much-circulated news on social media, it remains that a substantial portion of Moroccans have consistently urged the country’s authorities to “revise” their diplomatic priorities with Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – An Italian designing giant and a group of Moroccan business owners are cooperating to bring Morocco’s designing and architecture industry to a higher standing in excellence in the global market. The project, called Bretone Design Africa (BDA), is the fruit of the collaboration between world-renowned Italian industrial design brand Bretone Italia, Rabat-based city planning giant Marita Group Holding, and Moroccan businessman Moulay Youssef El Alaoui. At a press conference yesterday in Rabat, the collaborators expressed their desire to better industrial design and modern architecture in Morocco and Africa. Through their innovative collaboration, they said, they will produce art “destined for the African market.” “The agreement that we’ve signed today symbolizes the start of Bertone Design Africa’s activities,” said Bretone Design Italia President Aldo Cingolani in a press statement. The statement added that for the past three months, the group has developed a continental vision in which Morocco will be Africa’s focal point of creativity and state-of-the-art production in industrial design and architecture-related productions. El Alaoui noted that the whole venture is part of the “royal vision” to invest in Moroccan capabilities to further the country’s South-South agenda.
He said that the creation of BDA is “another step forward” which will grant BDA representatives “the honor and possibility to successfully contribute to the realization of the royal vision aiming to promote excellence, innovation, and last generation technologies in Morocco and the entire African continent.” Among BDA’s many projects in the coming months is a school of industrial design to train Moroccan and other African youth in the Afro-Italian style of architecture and digital design, the Moroccan businessman stressed.

Rabat – The Spanish government adopted a resolution on Friday during a ministerial council to offer the Gran Teatro Cervantes (Grand Theater Cervantes) to Morocco. The decision came after Morocco pledged to renovate and manage the theatre and preserve its Spanish identity in exchange for ownership.  The transferring of ownership will take place after the Spanish Parliament’s two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate approve the agreement, announced the Spanish government in a statement. Spain stated that theater is “one of the most prestigious” landmarks in Tangier, emphasizing its architectural and historical value as well as the need to maintain it as a piece of Spanish cultural heritage. Built in 1913 by a wealthy Spanish merchant, Esperanza Orellana, the theater was considered as one of the most prestigious theaters in North Africa where renowned artists performed. The theatre has a capacity of 1,400 seats. The Spanish government has owned the theater since 1928. In 2015, Spain announced its intention of offering the theater to Morocco, however, the signing of the agreement between the countries took a long time.

Rabat – Qatar’s recent victory at the Asian Cup is an instance of the inescapable link between politics and sport and may deepen regional tension, according to experts. On Friday, February 1, Qatar made history by beating Japan 3-1 and winning the Asian Cup for the first time. In a run of an impressive month-long display of footballing prowess, Qatar emerged victorious from a continental tournament featuring countries with more footballing pedigree. The team scored 19 goals, conceded only 1, and collected individual prizes for best goalkeeper, best player, and top scorer. Blockading countries embittered by Qatar’s win Qatari striker Almoez Ali, whose nine goals set a new record for the number of goals scored at an Asian Cup, won global admiration. On social media, even the Argentinian ace Lionel Messi joined the conversation on Ali’s brilliant performance. Kristian Coates Ulrichsen of Rice University recently told Al Jazeera that traditional narratives of football as a venue for social cohesion and peace are naive and irrelevant in the context of the ongoing Gulf crisis. Qatar’s victory, he explained, is more likely to deepen tension than defuse them. “Any sense of embitterment in Abu Dhabi at the way the tournament they hosted turned out may translate into an escalation of rhetoric against Qatar.” The point was a striking reference to the fact that, en route to its continental crown in the final, Qatar thrashed the UAE, the host country, 4-0. But the bitterness at the defeat by Qatar is not the only element of the potential escalation of tensions, according to Ulrichsen. He explained that the celebratory mood that greeted Qatar’s triumph in other Arab countries, such as Kuwait and Oman, is bound to outrage Abu Dhabi and Riyadh even more. “Omanis and Kuwaitis have rejoiced in Qatari success and have done so in extremely public fashion, visibly emphasizing their rejection of the blockading states’ attempt to isolate Qatar in the region.” More than just sport Other experts who spoke to the same newspaper agreed with Ulrichsen’s grim reading of the implications of Qatar’s victory for Gulf geopolitics.
More than a mere instance of footballing joy, Qatar’s triumph in Abu Dhabi is “a modern-day sporting parable soaked in geopolitics and symbolism,” noted the enthusiastic Al Jazeera report. James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s Rajaratnam School of International Studies, buttressed the media outlet’s enthusiasm. He said the victory was an emphatic message to blockading countries that “Qatar can stand on its own, whatever the obstacles.” The Qatar-UAE game gave some hints of the expert’s pessimism for peace prospects in the Gulf. Not only did Qatar play without fans because of the UAE’s travel ban on Qataris, but the Qatari squad was booed and greeted with projectiles of shoes and bottles when they celebrated their goals. Referring to that incident in which Almoez Ali and company kept their composure, Salford University’s Simon Chadwick suggested the tournament could be seen from the perspective of a public relations competition. In that case, Chadwick elaborated, Qatar improved its public image at the expense of its “rancorous rivals.” “Qatar’s image and reputation has gained advantage over its rivals, especially given the apparent calmness on Qatar’s team when faced with sometimes rancorous rivals.” Two days before the Al Jazeera report, the Guardian reported the arrest of a British citizen by UAE authorities for showing up with a Qatar jersey at one of the Asian Cup games. The report noted that “promoting” sympathy for Qatar is an “offense” punishable by imprisonment or a “substantial fine.”

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani will fly to Addis Ababa this weekend with a Moroccan delegation at the request of King Mohammed VI. The delegation will represent Morocco at the 32nd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU). The symposium will take place February 10-11 in Ethiopia. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is also expected to take part in the symposium. Migration and refugee challenges have recently been the focus of the pan-African organization. Since the return of Morocco to the union, the North African country has expressed determination to find solutions to ease tension resulting from African migration. In 2017, the monarch talked about issues such as youth immigration in a message to the 29th AU summit. The King said that “African population growth, African institutions, migration and youth issues are opportunities we should leverage together.” During the intergovernmental conference on migration held in Marrakech in December 2018, the monarch renewed Morocco’s commitment towards the rest of Africa. In his message, the sovereign reiterated that Africa should not be the subject of the Global Compact, but the African continent “will be an actor—a key one.” The King also introduced an African agenda on migration to the AU, which was unanimously adopted by the African Union Conference in January 2018. The monarch described the agenda as a “flexible, scalable, and legally non-binding document.” The King also said that migration should not be considered as a negative phenomenon but rather as a “natural” phenomenon that should be celebrated. “We should adopt a positive stance on the issue of migration by highlighting the humanistic rationale of shared responsibility and solidarity.”

Rabat – Soufiane Al-Nguad may not have realized the consequences of his decision to, condemn the Royal Moroccan Navy shooting of a young migrant, Hayat Belkacem, in September. Through Facebook posts, he called on people to mourn Belkacem’s death and protest at a football game in Tetouan in northern Morocco. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has launched a call on the Moroccan government to free al-Nguad, the 29-year-old co-owner of a real estate agency sentenced on September 25 to two years in prison for “inciting people to participate in an unauthorized protest,” hate and violence on Facebook. Al-Nguad had also criticized the Moroccan government and kingdom, which authorities described as an “insult to the Moroccan flag,” a way of “spreading hatred,” and “calling for civil insurrection.” HRW wrote in a statement published on Friday, titled: “Morocco: Free Facebook Commentator,” that Morocco’s sentencing of al-Nguad was “a violation of his right to free speech.” The organization called on the country to “review his conviction given its abusive nature.” Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, expressed condemnation over the court’s decision to convict al-Nguad, saying: “Soufian al-Nguad did nothing but express his anger and urge protests over the killing of an innocent woman…. The charges against him are illegitimate, and he should be freed immediately.” Al-Nguad’s case is on appeal, and the trial will continue on February 11. In addition to the prison term, a Court of First Instance in Tetouan fined al-Nguad MAD 20,000. The court also charged the football fans who participated in the protest. Some of the fans were as young as 14, and the oldest arrested was only 23. The Royal Moroccan Navy opened fire on a migrant boat off the coast of M’diq and Fnideq in the Mediterranean on September 25, killing Hayat Belkacem, a 20-year-old native of Tetouan. The shooting made international headlines and sparked large condemnation.

Rabat – While Saudi Arabia denied the direct involvement of its crown prince in the killing of prominent Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, a New York Times article has cited US officials who spoke of a damning statement by the prince that US intelligence intercepted. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, had said he would shoot Khashoggi, if he refused to come back to Saudi Arabia and refrain from criticizing the Saudi regime and if he could not be forcibly repatriated. The New York Times article said that “current and former American and foreign officials” related the conversation between Mohammed bin Salman and a top aide, Turki Aldakhil. The conversation, which was intercepted by American intelligence agencies, dates back to September 2017. During the conversation, MBS said that Khashoggi must be returned to Saudi Arabia by force if he refused to come back. The newspaper considered the conversation evidence that bin Salman had considered murdering Khashoggi more than a year before his death. Four months since his murder, Khashoggi’s body has not been found. The journalist was killed by Saudi operatives inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018. The report added that US spy agencies and security services began searching MBS’ communications they had intercepted after Khashoggi’s murder. UN human rights expert Agnes Callamard described the murder on Thursday as a “brutal and premeditated killing” planned by Saudi officials. Callamard, who was on a trip in Turkey, said that Saudi Arabia also hampered Turkey’s efforts to investigate the case at the consulate. The UN official said, “Woefully inadequate time and access was granted to Turkish investigators to conduct a professional and effective crime-scene examination and search required by international standards for investigation.” While US congressmen have been urging the Trump administration to sanction Saudi Arabia, Trump has been defending the crown prince. In response, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan slammed the US and Saudi Arabia again in an interview aired by Turkish television channel TRT on February 3. Erdogan said, “I cannot understand America’s silence when such a horrific attack took place, and even after members of the CIA listened to the recordings we provided.”  Erdogan explained that the murder was planned by 22 people. He added that 15 of the suspects arrived in Istanbul on two separate planes and entered the consulate on the day of the murder.

Rabat – Polisario appears to be satisfied with the recent development in Morocco-Saudi Arabia diplomatic ties. In a recent interview with Algerian news agency APS, Polisario’s “Ambassador” to Algiers Abdelkader Taleb Omar thanked Saudi Arabia for reconsidering its position on the Western Sahara conflict. He also commended the grand reforms made by King Salman of Saudi Arabia, including Western Sahara, because the conflict has enjoyed “reconsideration” from Saudi Arabia. The separatist also condemned the EU-Morocco fisheries and agriculture agreements, claiming that Western Sahara is “separate” from Morocco. While Morocco and the international community consider Morocco’s autonomy plan a realistic solution to the conflict, Omar implied that Polisario will not accept it. “Morocco’s representative said that there is no negotiations outside autonomy. We reject this statement,” said the separatist. Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale made the remarks about the autonomy plan in January. On January 29, the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Horst Kohler briefed the Security Council on the conflict and announced his plan to invite the parties involved in the conflict to a second roundtable. After the meeting of the Security Council, Hilale qualified how much Morocco is willing to negotiate while speaking to the press. “We are ready to negotiate it and give it the largest operative power for the autonomy. Outside autonomy, nothing. We are not ready to negotiate anything.” The Moroccan government participated in the first roundtable in years in December to evaluate the parties’ readiness to discuss negotiations to end the conflict. Morocco also went to the roundtable to remind the international community of its principles, that it will accept no solution if it is against its territorial integrity and sovereignty over the region.  Kohler is set to meet with the parties involved in the conflict again to discuss the date and place for the second roundtable. The meeting is expected in March.

Rabat – A Saudi pro-government media outlet, Al Riyadh, has published an editorial touting Moroccan diplomacy under King Mohammed VI’s leadership. The editorial comes after Saudi-owned television channel Al Arabiya aired a documentary on Western Sahara last week putting Morocco on the same footing with the Polisario Front. The video clip referred to Western Sahara as an “occupied” region and presented Polisario as recognized by the international community. However, the Polisario Front has lost recognition from several countries in recent years. In a possible attempt to defuse tension between the two kingdoms, Al Riyadh, known for its proximity to the Saudi royal family, has written about the conflict with a more Morocco-friendly narrative. In its editorial, Al Riyadh called the region the “Moroccan Sahara” while  Al Arabiya had called it Western Sahara. The term “Western Sahara” is probably not an issue, but Al Arabiya’s timeline and its mentioning pro-Polisario concepts like “occupation” and “colonization” seem to have provoked Morocco’s withdrawal from Saudi Arabia’s Yemen coalition. Too little too late, Riyadh? Al Riyadh commended the new strategy that Morocco has adopted in the conflict under the leadership of King Mohammed VI. The newspaper wrote: “If Moroccan diplomatic efforts had previously been characterized by improvisation and mismanagement of means … King Mohammed VI created a breakthrough in dealing with the conflict through a series of speeches dedicated to the memory of the Green March.” Al Riyadh added that Morocco’s strategy has more precise components and objectives “in accordance with the pillars of the firm faith of the Moroccan people and their national rights and territorial integrity backed by historical evidence.” Saudi Arabia-Morocco relations may have suffered from Morocco’s neutral position in the Gulf crisis. Morocco offered to mediate between the Saudi coalition and Qatar instead of siding with one of the parties. A year later, in the first months of 2018, Morocco found Saudi Arabia to be hostile to its bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Turki Al Sheikh, then head of the Saudi sports authority, lobbied against Morocco’s 2026 bid and implied it was because of Morocco’s friendliness to Qatar. The second anti-Moroccan action came in December 2018, when the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA), chaired by Al Sheikh, posted on social media a Moroccan map divided into three parts, excluding Western Sahara from Morocco. While UAFA apologized and deleted the map, Egypt’s Pyramid football club, owned by Al Sheikh, posted a similar map, making the maps associated with Al Sheikh appear uncoincidental. Moroccan Western Sahara expert Abdelfattah El Fatihi told Morocco World News that the  “schism in diplomatic ties between Morocco and Saudi Arabia is now a reality.” He added that the tension is in its “initial phase.” The hostility behind the video clip  “appeared to be clear” since the television channel, which is “loyal to Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia,” attempted to “spoil the diplomatic ties between the countries through a detrimental report to Morocco’s territorial integrity.” El Fatihi agreed that the crisis was preceded by Saudi Arabia’s decision to vote against Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid and its objection to Morocco’s mediation proposal in the Gulf crisis. “The reality of an aggressive practice towards Morocco was evident in a documentary that included many historical and political inaccuracies about the issue of Morocco’s territorial integrity,” he added. Tension shift Al Riyadh said that Rabat’s challenge in Western Sahara “remains the process of mobilizing all the components of the Moroccan people and the official bodies of the state” to inform citizens of the legal and historical grounds for Morocco’s claims. “This will provide an elite capable of assuming historical responsibility in defending the territorial integrity in a rational and realistic manner.” The Moroccan government has reportedly recalled its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mustapha El Mansouri, to discuss the diplomatic ties between the two kingdoms, especially after the display of the documentary by Al Arabiya. El Mansouri told a Moroccan media outlet that the situation is just a phase that both countries will end soon. He added that the diplomatic ties will resume their previous strength because both countries have strong historical bonds. But it remains to be seen if Morocco and Saudi Arabia will shed the tension for good since Rabat announced its withdrawal from the Saudi coalition in the Yemen conflict. Last night, a source from the Moroccan government reportedly told AP of Morocco’s withdrawal from the coalition due to Saudi Arabia’s provocative move against Moroccan territorial integrity. Commenting on the withdrawal, Fatihi said that Morocco’s participation in the Saudi alliance “was based on a consensual course aimed primarily at protecting the country’s territorial integrity and supporting the legitimacy of Yemen.”  Last month, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita told Al Jazeera in an interview that Moroccan participation in the Yemen civil war has changed for humanitarian reasons. He added that Morocco supports the Gulf’s plans and would be against anything from Yemen that undermined the stability of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Bourita, however, expressed Morocco’s concerns over the humanitarian aspects of the Yemen war, emphasizing that the Yemeni people do not deserve the suffering they are experiencing. A week after Bourita’s interview, Al Arabiya, an Al Jazeera competitor, released its pro-Polisario documentary on the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – Speaking with Morocco World News, Omar Chennafi, a passionate photographer and founder of the Fez International Artists Gathering, shared his aspirations to create a space where local people can experience all forms of art freely.  Chennafi is no stranger to artistic expression. Besides photography, he is also interested in sculpting. Chennafi has already created a platform where international artists, musicians, painters, photographers, and authors, meet every year to discuss their art and share views on modern issues in Morocco’s “cultural capital,” Fez. This year, too, artists, intellectuals, and academics from different countries, ages, and backgrounds, but with a deep understanding of how the cogs fit in modern society, met in Fez. While the Fez gathering offers a ticket to the works of renowned artists and the minds of intellectuals, establishing a platform that would be a “visa or window” for normal people to explore and be in touch with art is Chenafi’s dream. And it may not be too far-fetched.  Chennafi wishes to “design a program and projections that everybody can benefit from not just the intellectuals or educated people, but also people that have a normal life,” including street art performers or street painters. “My dream is to give them an experience and make art more accessible, open their perspective, and show that art is not just a luxury, but could also hold an educational approach,” he said. Chennafi believes that art plays a vital role in educating people and heightening social awareness. Chennafi’s statement elicits a question: Could new forms of expression influence or lead to new social and governmental policies?  Chennafi believes that art can lead to unity and diversity as well as contribute to social change. Chennafi emphasized that art “can help us understand our problems,” whether social or political, so “we can solve them in a systematic way.” But, he said, it cannot immediately change governmental policies. “Our generation is fortunate to experience so many different arts, and opportunities,” Chennafi mused.  The same applies for photography, as “you don’t need to be an academic to be a photographer,” said Chennafi. Chennafi sees photography as “a gift” that people can explore. “I hope that people can take photography as a way of telling a story, as a way of helping people connect and reconnect, and as a way of appreciation and giving back to the world and expressing love.” Chennafi is more pulled toward capturing the lives of people and showing diversity. To him, “the most interesting things in our existence are people. Us.” All artists have moments when their muse decides to slumber. Chennafi likened the feeling of being uninspired or the tendency toward procrastination to fighting a giant wave while holding on to a wooden board. “You are fighting a huge wave and you’re sticking to this wood which is your only hope until the wave stops. If you don’t have faith, I think your ideas will fall,” Chennafi said. He nuanced his view, saying, “It’s all about passion and having faith” in oneself and “finding the right balance in our lives.” “It is important to be practical and realistic and to find a balance because we have responsibilities also about our lifestyle, family. It’s not just about focusing on finding ideas, because ideas are always there.” The biggest challenge in dealing with ideas, to Chennafi, is “how to make them come to life.” Chennafi criticized the act of sacrificing one’s health and time with loved ones to work, not excluding artwork.  “A lot of people sacrifice their bodies, sleep hours. You have to sacrifice in a way not damaging yourself. Don’t be scared of your fear. We all have fears and doubts but the question is: ‘How can I deal with it, stay focused and continue my journey?’”

Rabat – The Moroccan government has recalled its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mustapha El Mansouri, to discuss the diplomatic ties between the two kingdoms in light of the broadcast of a hostile documentary by television channel Al Arabiya. El Mansouri told a Moroccan media outlet that the situation is just a phase that both countries will end soon. He added that the diplomatic ties will resume their previous strength because both countries have strong historical bonds. But it remains to be seen if Morocco and Saudi Arabia will overcome this unprecedented the tension for good since Rabat announced its withdrawal from the Saudi coalition in the Yemen conflict. Morocco’s decision to recall its ambassador comes after Saudi television channel Al Arabiya broadcast a documentary on the Western Sahara conflict hostile to Morocco’s territorial integrity. The documentary referred to Western Sahara as an “occupied” region and presented Polisario as the sole “legitimate representative of the Saharawi people.”   The documentary was aired weeks after Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita told Al Jazeera that Morocco’s participation in the Yemen war has changed due to humanitarian reasons. Moroccan analyst Abdelfettah El Fatihi told Morocco World News, that “the reality of an aggressive practice towards Morocco was evident in a documentary that included many historical and political falsehoods about the issue of Morocco’s territorial integrity.” The documentary caused a backslash in Morocco, prompting many Moroccans on social media to express their rejection of the Saudi “ultimate provocation” and to urge the Moroccan government to reconsider its relations with Saudi Arabia.  Morocco has also withdrawn from the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen civil war. Morocco’s withdrawal from the war in Yemen was no longer a matter of if but when, especially after the intensification of the Saudi-led offensive and seemingly indiscriminate killing of innocent Yemenis. Several UN reports accused Saudi Arabia of committing what amounts to war crimes against the Yemeni people. In addition, ties between Rabat and Riyadh deteriorated unprecedentedly following the ascension of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to power.

Amsterdam – The Moroccan government announced on Tuesday, February 5, that 16 people had died during the outbreak of H1N1, a seasonal virus also known as swine flu. The government received backlash from Moroccan citizens, who accused the government of not warning them about the flu. Some citizens were more concerned with the government’s statements regarding the deaths from H1N1 than the illness itself. A new virus In Morocco, cases of influenza sharply increased along with the increase of the influenza strain H3N2 in Egypt in December 2018 and the continued increase of H1N1 in Europe in January 2019. The WHO regional office of the MENA region in Cairo (EMRO) reported that in the fourth week of 2019, Morocco had identified 64 positive cases of influenza out of 186 documented cases with respiratory illness.  The highest number of positive influenza cases were found in Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine.  Most people with the flu do not have H1N1 Based on the WHO surveillance report on February 1, 11 to 20 percent of the respiratory specimen in North Africa tested positive for Influenza A (H1N1 and H3 subtypes), compared to 30 percent in Western Europe, the Arabian peninsula, and South-East Asia.  Besides viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, coronavirus, and bacteria also cause respiratory illness like Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Large studies have shown that rhinoviruses were shown to be the major cause (34 percent) of upper respiratory illness.  The seasonal influenza vaccine is available to protect against H1N1. Improving the implementation of seasonal vaccination planning could benefit Morocco. In this case, Morocco could target high-risk populations such as the elderly, chronically ill, pregnant women, children under age 5, and healthcare workers for vaccination. Vaccination would prevent 57 percent of influenza cases and 72 percent of deaths. Read Also: Health Office: H1N1 Situation in Casablanca Region is Stable, Normal A total of 375 health units cover only a third of the whole Moroccan population which are involved in influenza surveillance. The Moroccan Ministry of Health is establishing a national influenza surveillance initiative by funding laboratory activities.  Regional hospitals are linked to the ministry’s National Influenza Center and Epidemiology Directorate through a website to improve surveillance. The Moroccan surveillance system faces limitations and problems in the continuity of specimen collection due to the lack of laboratory supplies in some collecting sites.   However, the Pasteur Institute in Casablanca participates in the national influenza surveillance by collecting samples from all regions in Morocco. The surveillance data come from patients who reported to one of the health units. The data might be an underestimation of reality since not every active case gets reported nor is the entire population surveilled.  Government reassurances Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and health minister Anas Doukkali emphasized that the seasonal flu is not “unusual” and said citizens should exercise normal precautions. The government then called on citizens, especially the most vulnerable groups, to wash their hands with water and soap, avoid crowded places, and stay home if they have the flu symptoms. The Mutual General Staff of Public Administration (MGAP) also launched a campaign called “Achamil” to facilitate access to health care for people with symptoms of H1N1. MGAP offers its services for free, telling citizens to call 0522464666 in case of emergency, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). It also provides funeral services across Morocco regardless of the distance between the place of death and that of burial and facilitates procedures and paperwork related to death, according to the statement shared by MAP. Like the government, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Moroccans should not panic about H1N1. In a joint statement with the Moroccan Ministry of Health, the WHO told Moroccans that seasonal influenza “should in no way worry the population.” The WHO also emphasized that it is teaming up with “the ministry to monitor the situation very closely and recommended the usual preventive measures.”

Rabat – German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Visegrad Group have announced their intention to work together on a project in Morocco to ease tension and reduce irregular migration and poverty in North Africa. Merkel met with leaders of the Visegrad Group, including Slovakian Prime Minister Pellegrini, on Thursday. The group is a political coalition of four EU countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.  Merkel, who attended the UN summit on migration in Marrakech in December 2018, said that the adopted Global Compact for Migration is a “clear commitment to multilateralism.” Read Also: Why The World Needs the Global Compact for Orderly Migration More than 160 countries officially adopted the migration compact in Morocco. In a speech at the conference, Merkel said that the compact is “about the foundations of international cooperation, and this is why it is well worth our while to fight for the survival of this compact.” She also promised that the UN project would ensure better living conditions for migrants and refugees, saying, “We can render this planet a better one.” The UN migration pact sets global policy guidelines for better managing global migration. The document lays out 23 objectives to improve international migration policy. Prior to the intergovernmental UN summit, Morocco also hosted the 11th summit of the World Forum on Migration, co-chaired by Germany and Morocco. The event took place on December 5-7 and aimed to tackle questions related to migrants’ rights to decent working and living conditions in their host countries.

Rabat –In 2018, 84,000 unemployed Moroccans despaired of finding a job. Eighty-seven percent of them live in urban areas. Of those, 53 percent are young people between 15 and 29 years old, and 8 percent of them have a graduate certificate. The High Commission for Planning’s data report, published on Tuesday, noted that 1,168,000 Moroccans are unemployed. The report, which focused on the 2018 labor market, stated that the unemployment rate is higher among women, 14 percent, compared to among men, 8.4 percent. According to the report, Morocco opened 112,000 new job opportunities in 2018. Of those, women were hired for 27,000 positions, and men for 85,000. “All sectors contributed to create job opportunities,” the report noted. “Despite the increase of job opportunities, [the overall] employment rate decreased from 41.9 percent to 41.7 percent,” added the report. According to HCP’s data, 57.9 percent of unemployed Moroccans have never worked, and two-thirds of the unemployed have been jobless for one year more. The report pointed out that 30.4 percent of the unemployed previously had jobs. Some had been fired (24.3 percent), and others lost their jobs when their company closed (6.1 percent). Compared to 2017, HCP stressed that there were 48,000 fewer jobless people in 2018 for 1,168,000 total. The national unemployment rate decreased from 10.2 percent in 2017 to 9.8 percent in 2018.

Rabat – The mandatory military service was at the heart of the ministerial council  meeting. During the ministerial council, King Mohammed VI asked the government to recruit 10,000 Moroccans in the obligatory military service in 2019, according to a statement by the spokesman of the royal palace, Abdelhak Lamrini. The order is in accordance with Law 44.18 on military services.  The number  of conscripts will increase to 15,000 in 2020, according to the statement During the meeting, two draft decrees relating to the military service were approved  The two  draft decrees aim to determine  the procedures for recruiting and integrating conscripts in the military service. The decrees concern also optional applications for women and Moroccans residing abroad aiming to join the military service. People over the age of 25 who are eligible for an exemption can still be called to service up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant. In November 2018, Minister Delegate for the National Defense Abdellatif Loudiyi reportedly said that compulsory military service would cost Morocco MAD 500 million. The ministerial council also ratified eight agreements aiming to reinforce cooperation ties with several international countries. The agreements include the establishment of the headquarters of the African Observatory for Migration in Rabat, the establishment of the National Office of the kingdom of Morocco on the United Nations Human Settlements Program.

Rabat – MINURSO informed the United Nations Secretary-General it received threats from members of the Polisario Front. The head of MINURSO Colin Stewart allegedly addressed a message to Antonio Guterres after a Polisario member incited violence against members of the UN mission after a Sahrawi burned himself in the buffer zone of Guerguerat. After the incident, a member of the Polisario Front wrote a Facebook post, inciting Sahrawis to burn MINURSO vehicles instead of burning themselves. “Before thinking about harming yourself; take gas and sprinkle it in MINURSO’s vehicles.” He also accused MINURSO of not being able to “protect Sahrawi human rights.” Stewart then called on the members of the mission to stay alert to the threats received from the Polisario member. The MINURSO president also instructed his staff to be careful in the headquarters or the buffer zone. He also warned them to exercise caution while driving with windows open. He told the staff to return the cars to the headquarters at the end of the day. Ould Lamghimed died on Tuesday fromsevere burns.

Rabat – On Thursday last week in Rabat, State Secretary for Vocational Training Mohammad Rherras held talks with the head of cooperation for the European Union delegation in Morocco, Philip Mikos, on measures to step up bilateral cooperation in vocational training. Both officials discussed the progress of the EU program, which aims to support Morocco’s reforms of the vocational system. The two officials also discussed how to advance Moroccan cooperation with the EU. According to the State Secretariat for Vocational Training, Morocco received a financial support of €60 million. The program focuses on the development of a broader and integrated vocational training system, the adaptation of the training offer to the employers’ needs, the improvement of the quality of the vocational training system as well as the strengthening of coordination between the various actors and stakeholders. The Moroccan government believes that vocational training is a solution that can curb unemployment. During a working session in October 2018, King Mohammed VI instructed the government to create a committee to elaborate specific solutions for youth unemployment. He also called for new vocational training programs and new training centers and to reinforce youth entrepreneurship programs. The unemployment rate remains high among young people aged 15-24, 27.5 percent.  El Othmani’s government offers more opportunities  Last  Friday, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the current cabinet under Saad Eddine El Othmani created more job opportunities than former governments, including that of Driss Jettou and Abbas El Fassi. El Khalfi, who is a member of the ruling Islamist Justic and Development Party (PJD) said that El Othmani’s government created 130,000 job opportunities for Moroccan youth. El Khalfi made his remarks during a seminar under the theme “status of Moroccan youth in society,” which discussed unemployment challenges. El Khalfi said that Morocco needs a shift in its economy and development in order to integrate Moroccan youth. El Khalfi also spoke about the importance of  foreign investments, adding that it is “a key element in the operation, and we have achieved high rates of foreign investment. This year we exceeded MAD 42 billion in 2018, an unprecedented rate of 41 percent compared to the last year.”

Rabat – The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) has ranked Morocco among countries with low cybersecurity. The GCI scores published by the UK-based company Comparitech assessed 60 countries with low to high cybersecurity based on seven criteria, from malware rates to cybersecurity-related legislation. Not all countries that scored well in some areas scored the same in others. “There were some countries that lacked significantly in a variety of areas and others who outperformed the majority of countries,” stated Comparitech. Morocco ranked 25th out of the 60 listed countries, scoring 36.47 points out of 100. The country scored 10.61 points in the percentage of mobiles infected with malware; in 1.5 points in the percentage of financial malware attacks; 21.7 points in the percentage of computers infected with malware; 0.11 points in the percentage of telnet attacks by originating country; and 3.01 points in the percentage of attacks by cryptominers. In the category of the best-prepared countries for cyber attacks, Singapore scored the highest point, 0.925, whereas Morocco recorded a medium score of 0.541 points. Morocco ranked 4th out of 10 countrie with the most up-to-date legislation against cyberattacks. Algeria is the least cyber-secure country of the 60 studied countries, recording the highest percentage of mobile and computer malware infections with worst up-to-date legislation for cybersecurity and poor preparation for cyber attacks. Other countries with poor cybersecurity are Indonesia, Vietnam, Tanzania, and Uzbekistan. Japan is the most cyber-secure country in the world, outperforming all listed countries and other top-performing countries such as France, Canada, Denmark, and the US, in most of the categories including the preparation for cyber attacks and legislation. “Despite some countries having clear strengths and weaknesses, there is definite room for improvement in each and every one,” in terms of better protections from malware and cyber attacks, and strong legislations, the report concluded.

By Hannah Finnerty Meknes – Clio and Maurice, an Italian voice-violin duo, are making their way around Morocco on their first international tour. Clio Colombo, singer, and Martin Nicastro, violinist, are playing at American Language Centers in eight cities across the country. The combination of violin and voice is piquing the interest of Italians, and now, Moroccans. While the couple have been together for nearly six years, it was only a year and a half ago that the two musicians began composing and playing together, somewhat out of the blue. One of Colombo’s friends asked the duo to open for her, effectively launching the two into their paired performance career. From there, Colombo said the gigs came one after the next. Their abrupt beginnings have led the couple to develop their own brand of music, a blend of their backgrounds and techniques as classically-trained musicians. Nicastro studied at the conservatory in Milan and now teaches violin. Colombo is currently studying music as well.  Pop is the dominant genre of their music, but flares of blues and soul in the vocals complement the electric violin. Nicastro uses multi-effect pedals which allow him to record, loop, and manipulate the music of the violin, introducing electronic elements. While the use of the pedal adds interest, Nicastro said that the unusual pairing of violin and voice makes the duo stand out.  Despite their somewhat unorthodox style and a foreign audience, Clio and Martin have been pleased by the turnout for their Morocco sets. In Tangier, they had a crowd of nearly 250 people, their largest audience yet at a performance. They hope these high turnouts continue, as their goal is to perform and create music full time. The duo is currently working on their first Clio and Maurice EP which is set to be released early this year. But first, they will finish spreading their tunes around Morocco. The duo have two more stops on their tour, Fez tonight and Oujda tomorrow.

Rabat – Morocco has signed two financial cooperation arrangements with Germany to boost its economic activities in sustainable development. The signing of the arrangements took place Tuesday in Rabat between Morocco’s Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun and the German ambassador to Morocco, Goetz Schmidt-Bremme. According to Benchaaboun, the two agreements are intended to support renewable and electric energy, water supply, and desalination of seawater. He also highlighted Morocco’s readiness to improve cooperation with Germany, while emphasizing Morocco’s willingness to sign more agreements. The minister noted that Moroccan reforms will benefit from Germany’s support program, particularly in business climate and investment promotion, whether for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or start-ups. Schmidt-Bremme said that the signing of the finance and credit arrangements are part of a strategic partnership to support Morocco’s renewable energy, water, and sustainable economy.  In December, Morocco was classified among developing countries that notably improved their renewable energies sector and policies since 2010. The survey was conducted based on data provided by the government from 2010 to 2017. Morocco produces 28,000 gigawatt hours of electricity and imports the rest of its energy needs from Spain. Morocco is seeking to boost its production capacity by 6,500 megawatts by 2020, with solar and wind energies each representing 2,000 megawatts, according to a US International Trade Administration 2017 report.

Rabat – The Netherlands has responded to outcry over its decision to arrest three Moroccan hip hop dancers and hold them for five days in a detention center for undocumented migrants. The spokesman for Consular Affairs for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Willemien Veldman, said that his country understood the three Moroccans’ views. “Of course we understand the disappointment,” she told AFP. The official, however, said that holding a visa does not “automatically give access to a country in the Schengen area.” She added that the “border police are allowed to make their own assessment on admission” in the Schengen area. The three dancers, Hamza, Ahmed, and Omar, expressed frustration over their detention in Rotterdam. Aged 20 and 21, they arrived in the Netherlands on January 10 to take part in a dancing competition. Maria Daif, former head of the Touria and Abdelaziz Tazi Foundation and of l’Uzine—the cultural center in Casablanca where the dancers rehearse—said that the Moroccan dancers were mistreated by the border police. The dancers were asked to sign a document and asked intrusive questions like if they were suicidal or if they had ever had sex. “They sign documents in Dutch that they don’t understand,” said Daif. Hamza said that they felt scared after their arrest. “I am not a criminal, I am an artist,” Daif quoted Hamza. Another young Moroccan woman faced a similar issue in Brussels after after deciding to transit through Belgium on her way back to university in France. Unfortunately, she only had a receipt of her application for a French residence permit, which only allows her to land in France, where she studies at Lille University. Rania Akrach’s plan did not pan out, and Belgian authorities arrested her and put her in a detention center, threatening to send her back to Casablanca because she did not have a Schengen visa.

Rabat – Carrying banners, flags of the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and chanting slogans, Sahrawi people rallied yesterday near Rabouni Camp, in an unprecedented demonstration against Algeria.  The protesters are calling on the United Nations to intervene in the case of Ahmed El Khalil to uncover the truth behind his kidnapping and disappearance. Former Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ould Mouloud, El Khalil’s colleague, shared videos and pictures of the peaceful demonstration on his Facebook account, writing: “Strikingly and for the first time, the [Sahrawi] camp population leads a protest against Algeria and not against the Polisario Front.” Mustafa Salma wrote that Algeria was to blame for the suffering of Sahrawis. “Algeria is the one responsible for the suffering of the [Sahrawi] people camps. It is the one that breaches their human rights, not the Polisario who have no power whatsoever.” Mustafa Salma also pointed out that El Khalil’s case is “taking a serious turn, which will put Algeria and the Polisario Front in a delicate situation during the upcoming roundtable.” In March, the parties involved in the Western Sahara conflict will meet in Geneva under the auspices of the UN.  Salma announced that the Sahrawis recently founded a committee seeking to follow El Khalil’s case at the request of his family. The committee seeks to reveal the circumstances of El Khalil’s disappearance and bring him justice. The protest followed another peaceful demonstration in front of the Secretariat of the Polisario Front in Rabouni, Algeria. El Khalil’s family had already reached out to the UN in 2017, to pressure Algeria and the Polisario to reveal El Khalil’s fate. While it is not known yet whether El Khalil is dead or alive, Mustafa Salma had announced he died in prison last month. Mustafa Salma said that the Algerian intelligence forcibly imprisoned El Khalil for more than 10 years. Born in Tan-Tan in southern Morocco, El Khalil moved to Fez to finish his high school studies, and he decided to join the Polisario in 1977. El Khalil was tasked by Polisario with monitoring human rights in the Tindouf camps before his disappearance. According to Mustafa Salma, El Khalil was one of the most renowned intellectuals in the camps.

Rabat – Morocco and the US held the first session of the Africa working group under the Morocco-US Strategic Dialogue on Tuesday in Washington, D.C.  Morocco is the first African country to hold such a meeting with the US. The purpose of the meeting was to enhance American cooperation in Africa based on shared interests, the US Department of State said on Wednesday.

The delegations discussed the need to build on ongoing initiatives to address the political, economic, and security issues facing Africa, said the department’s office of the spokesperson. 

The delegations also reviewed new opportunities for triangular cooperation in Africa in finance, trade, youth empowerment, counter-terrorism, and capacity building for the region’s security services and governance. 

At the meeting, Moroccan Minister Delegate for African Cooperation Mohcine Jazouli said Africa is a top priority in Morocco’s foreign policy, evidenced by Morocco’s reintegration into the African Union in January 2017. He added that more than 100 Moroccan businesses are active in 42 African countries with a $4 billion investment over a period of 15 years. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita arrived yesterday in Washington, D.C., to meet and hold in-depth discussions with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on security-related issues and take part in a symposium with the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Morocco is expected to join the US in a military training in Burkina Faso and Mauritania in the coming months. Many countries will take part in Exercise Flintlock 2019, the biggest African-hosted military and law enforcement training in Africa and the US. Morocco has had a Free Trade Agreement with the US since 2006. In January, US President Donald Trump told the 100th Annual Convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation on January 14 that multiple countries, including Morocco, have opened their markets to previously restricted US exports. Morocco opened its market to poultry exports from the US.

The president of the Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou, has presented Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani with a list of 44 elected members of local councils who have not submitted a declaration listing their assets.  Jettou requested on Tuesday that El Othmani follow procedure and dismiss the 44 elected members who evaded submitting the mandatory declaration despite previous warnings. In addition to the 44, Jettou forwarded to El Othmani a list of 23 members who failed to submit their declarations because they had not been notified accordingly. According to paragraph 6 in article 1 of Law No. 54.06, it is compulsory for senior officials, elected representatives of local councils, and public officials to submit a declaration of their assets. The Court of Auditors maintained in a statement released online that the 44 had ignored the deadline and warnings asking for the documents within 60 days.  The majority of the unnamed 44 council members operate in the regions of Casablanca-Settat, Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, Guelmim-Oued Noun, Fez-Meknes, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, and Beni Mellal-Khenifra. Since the beginning of February, the Moroccan Court of Auditors has been monitoring the wealth and properties of elected officials in the framework of the annual compulsory declaration of assets.

Rabat –  A roundtable at the Cervantes Institute in Rabat yesterday emphasized Moroccans’ interest in the Spanish language. The director of the institute, Javier Galvan Guijo, said that academic activity at Cervantes Institutes in Morocco grew by 16 percent in 2018 over 2017. In 2017, according to Guijo, 11 percent more Moroccan students showed interest in learning the Spanish language compared to 2016. “Moroccans are proving more and more that Castilian is not a foreign language; moreover Spanish and Moroccan cultures are so closely linked to one another that we cannot understand them separately.” According to Jose Sarria, a researcher in Hispano-Maghreb literature, the challenge is how to make the Spanish language more prevalent language in the cultural and literary fields in Morocco. He also called for more initiatives to offer Spanish language learning opportunities for Moroccans. The participants of the roundtable called for more coordination between Moroccan and Spanish authorities to promote the Spanish language in high education institutes and universities. In addition to Spanish, English is also emerging as a popular foreign language in Morocco. Although courses in English are available in Moroccan universities, French remains the language of instruction and the primary foreign language in the North African country. Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said recently that French will continue to be the dominant foreign language in Moroccan schools “at least throughout the next ten years.” Amzazi received criticism from Moroccan internet users, who argued that English should be integrated into school curricula as the first foreign language because it is perceived to be the language of globalization. French remains the dominant foreign language, owing to 44 years of French rule from 1912 to 1956. Many Moroccans are demanding change, seeing the dominance of French language in Morocco as an unwanted leftover from French colonization. The only official languages in Morocco are Arabic and Tamazight (Berber). People in northern Morocco, due to the area’s proximity to Spain and having been partially colonized by Spain, tend to prefer Spanish as a foreign language over French.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi told the Chamber of Councillors Monday that the large number of Moroccans working abroad indicates the “quality of education and training” they received in Morocco.

Amzazi added that Morocco is working hard to define strategies to address brain drain, one of which is promoting the International Forum of Moroccan Skilled Workers Abroad (FINCOM). 

The minister had been replying to criticism from a Moroccan Workers’ Union representative. The union representative responded to Amzazi’s promises, saying the current programs have failed to stop or reduce brain drain.

FINCOM promotes partnerships between Moroccan expatriate skilled workers and Moroccan institutions.

In October, hundreds of unionists and teachers demonstrated in Rabat, demanding better education conditions, reported the Middle East Monitor.  Also in October, 130 public sector doctors from Casablanca issued a statement over the “catastrophic conditions in the health sector” saying they would emigrate collectively to find better opportunities. In July, Amzazi lamented the fact that 600 engineers leave the country every year in search of better conditions and, ultimately, job satisfaction and better pay in a more academically-progressive environment. According to a 2018 ReKrute study, 91 percent of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and below are interested in working abroad. In some cases, holding a more advanced degree translates to a higher likelihood of employment. In 2018, the unemployment rate among holders of a vocational training diploma was 23.3 percent, higher than that of general education graduates (15.4 percent) and that of all graduates aged 15 and over (17.1 percent), according to High Commission for Planning statistics. In contrast, unemployment among diploma-holders was 17.1 percent compared to 3.5 percent among non-diploma holders.

Rabat – UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said he is full of hope for Africa’s future because he expects positive returns from a number of peace and security challenges that the UN is helping resolve on the continent. According to Guterres, Africa is experiencing a “quantum leap,” especially in its relations with the UN and UN-sponsored bodies for peace, security, and confidence-building at local and national levels. What’s left, the Portuguese diplomat went on to argue, is for promises and agreements to materialize in Africa’s crisis zones. “I am totally committed to the cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations,” Guterres told the US government-funded Voice of America (VOA) media agency. “We are working more and more together in addressing a number of situations in Africa.” Need for African leadership to solve African problems As the highest ranking authority of the UN, Guterres knows about the continent’s persisting challenges. From repressive regimes to politico-ethnic conflicts, or even the wave of African migrants leaving the continent for Europe, a number of African countries are still going through hard times. For all the ongoing conflicts and related traumatic effect, the UN official chooses to look on the bright side. “Our objective,” he offered, “is to make Africa a continent of hope … to make Africa a pillar of the world in which we live, not seen as a problem, but seen as an opportunity.” He explained, “We see negotiations between Djibouti and Eritrea, and we see reconciliation between Eritrea and Somalia that already took place. We see in many other areas movement in the right direction, and we are totally committed to work together — the African Union and the African subregional organizations — to support this wind of hope.” He acknowledged Somalia is in a relatively bad situation, but hastened to add that the UN will not give up on its commitment there. Guterres said he is encouraging financial institutions to support the country in the economic reforms it has recently launched. The Portuguese diplomat spoke in a similarly upbeat tone of Congo, where the post-election period’s fragile atmosphere has led many Africa observers to fear a resurgence of violence.
Guterres mentioned that one core principle of the growing relations between the UN and the African Union is that “African leadership is the best way to resolve African problems.” Of Congo, he said, “We consider that what’s important now after the elections, with the new government, is to create the conditions for inclusive dialogue among all the parties, and to make sure that we have a transition of power that allows for the country to move ahead and we will be supporting the country to move ahead,” he said. Western Sahara and the UN-led process While his VOA interview made no overt reference to the delicate security situation in Western Sahara, it is safe to suggest that Guterres is also optimistic about the UN-sponsored process to end the four decades-long territorial dispute. Since Guterres appointed former German President Horst Kohler as his personal envoy for Western Sahara, hopes have risen in diplomatic circles about the process. Many observers and diplomats have argued that Guterres’ approach may broker unprecedented overtures in the conflict. In December last year, Kohler succeeded in committing all four parties—Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and the Polisario Front—to sitting at the same table for talks. A second such meeting has been scheduled for March, and reports indicated last week that the Portuguese diplomat is preparing to travel the Maghreb to lay the ground for their second meeting in Geneva. The approach has been applauded by UN diplomats, many of whom have argued that the ongoing process, once it completes the required confidence building, can progressively broker a lasting, commonly agreed upon, and sustainable solution to the Western Sahara question. Christoph Heusgen, Germany’s permanent ambassador to the UN, said, “I do see hope. The unity of the Security Council is a very important factor. This is a conflict we can resolve.” At the institutional level, the AU for the first time in July last year agreed to commit to the UN-led process for Western Sahara. While the AU used to have its own parallel agenda, the organization’s latest report pledged full allegiance to the UN process. The report said the AU would confine itself to an observer role and let the UN do the necessary work for resolving the conflict. The “AU’s role will be that of supporting and accompanying UN efforts,” the report said. It added, “The UN Secretary general personal envoy has initiated discussions with concerned parties, all of which have expressed their desire to negotiate.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Atlas Lions lost three places in the most recent monthly FIFA ranking, now sitting at 43rd place out of all national football teams, with 1,440 points. The national football team maintained its regional ranking of third in Africa ahead of Nigeria and DRC. FIFA ranked Senegal as Africa’s top team and Tunisia second. The teams have been taking turns at the top of the Confederation of African Football. FIFA’s October ranking put Morocco at 47th globally and fifth in Africa. In November, Morocco ranked 40th globally and third in Africa. The Belgian national team is FIFA’s favorite this month, with the World-Cup winner France coming in second, Brazil third, and Croatia fourth. Morocco is now preparing to face the giant of Lionel Messi’s Argentina, ranked 11th globally, on March 26 in Tangier. Morocco also will meet Malawi in March for a last qualifier game before the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). The Atlas Lions have already qualified for the continental championship. The African competition will take place in Egypt in June.

Rabat – The Moroccan government, considered to have one of the best approaches to combating terrorism locally and internationally, is attending the foreign ministerial meetings for the Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita is leading a delegation to the symposium to emphasize Morocco’s role in countering radicalization and terrorists. Bourita said in Washington that Morocco has put in place a unique and recognized approach to fight violent extremism, reported AFP. “This approach is based on a series of measures that have demonstrated their relevance,” said Bourita. He referenced Morocco’s program of training imams and Islamic counsellors, called mourchidat and mourchidin. Bourita said that Morocco implemented training programs at the Mohammed VI Institute for the training of imams and preachers in order to disseminate the values of Islam and to fight the spread of radical ideologies. He added that Morocco’s approach also focuses on deconstructing extremist ideologies through media and social media. Bourita also recalled Morocco’s mousalaha (reconciliation) programs that aim to prevent the spread of violent extremism in prisons. “Morocco is resolutely committed to continuing to promote the importance of developing and building the capacity of civil society so that it can guard against the resurgence of Daesh or any other group sharing the same violent extremist designs,” Bourita said. He added that Morocco will fulfill this commitment in its capacity as co-chair of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Bourita also emphasized that Morocco’s priority is to keep cooperating on a multilateral platform to encourage the implementation of good practices against the emergence of threats linked to terrorism and violent extremism. An 8-year process of increasing security Ever since the Marrakech terror attack in 2011, Morocco has modernized and upgraded its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime. The North African country then introduced the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) in 2015 to monitor security threats in cooperation with other Moroccan security services. The country’s success is recognized by the international community and gained it several security partners, including Spain, France, and the US. Like the head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame, Bourita said that the ISIS threat is still present in Iraq and Syria. Bourita also warned against the presence of ISIS affiliated groups in more than 20 countries across the world, including North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. ISIS, according to Bourita, carried out more than 280 attacks in 2017. He added that ISIS also is now shifting towards the internet, using information and communication technologies.

Rabat – A 24-year old Moroccan woman died in a fire that consumed an apartment building in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. A Moroccan consular employee in Paris told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Wednesday that local police confirmed the death of the young Moroccan woman. Police arrested another woman on suspicion of starting the fire in the eight-storey apartment building. The fire killed at least 10 people and injured another 30 people, including eight firefighters. The fire was the first of its kind in Paris in 14 years, added MAP. French Minister of the Interior Christophe Castaner said that firefighters had “entirely risked their own lives to save 50 people” from the incident.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita arrived in Washington, D.C., to meet and hold in-depth discussions with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on security-related issues. Throughout the day, Pompeo hosted a series of meetings with the 79 members of the Coalition to Defeat ISIS to lead discussions focused on  “the impending territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria.” The participating ministers planned to discuss the campaign’s next steps to eradicate extremist group affiliations outside of Iraq and Syria, destroy their remnants, and protect against a resurgence of ISIS in Syria and Iraq after the withdrawal of US forces from Syria. The coalition is committed to a “coordinated fight” against ISIS “through stabilization and security assistance.”  “As ISIS is defeated on the battlefield, the Coalition will continue its stabilization efforts to facilitate the safe and voluntary return home of those who have been displaced by the violence,” read a statement by the US Department of State. The Global Coalition regularly organizes meetings to enhance combined efforts to combat ISIS. The most recent meeting was on July 12, 2018, in Brussels, Belgium. In June, a similar meeting took place in Morocco, between Bourita, the US Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (ISIS) Brett McGurk, and other members. The meeting’s program focused on eradicating the extremist group in Iraq and Syria, combating its global networks, halting its financing, and curbing recruitment. Morocco maintains its crackdown on terrorist cells recruiting and planning attacks in the country and abroad. Recently, the 2018 Global Terrorism Index deemed Morocco safer than Algeria, the US, and France.  The country ranked the 132nd least dangerous country for terrorism out of 163, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd.  The report indicates that Morocco has two strategies to deal with Moroccan fighters returning from conflict zones: Deradicalization programs and imprisonment, a policy that has allowed law enforcement to apprehend returnees for investigation and put them in custody in 2015.

Rabat – An Indian man from Bombay has shared his plan to sue his parents for giving birth to him, saying that they ought to have asked for his consent first. Raphael Samuel, a 27-year-old businessman in India’s most populous city, made headlines this week after he took to various social media platforms to politely rebuke his parents for compounding the suffering of the world by giving birth to him. Samuel, in an interview with Indian outlet Latestly said that he enjoys a friendly relationship with his parents, who are “very proud of me for my independent thinking.” He said that he is not suing them for any mistreatment he may have suffered. He said he had an “amazing” childhood. Instead, he is suing his parents because they were only interested in their own “joy and pleasure” when they decided to have him. Not only did they not ask his consent, but they were also being “narcissistic.” Samuel is a proponent of anti-natalism, a school of thought—reportedly surging in India—which contends that humans are destructive and negative beings. In addition to aggravating human misery such as wars, extreme poverty, and famine, humans are also a negative force for the environment, according to anti-natalists. He said in his interview with Latestly, “Procreation is the most narcissistic act on Earth. Ask anyone why they procreate it will always start with ‘I wanted.’ Introducing a child into a world that is suffering is wrong. An antinatalist’s agenda is to convince people to stop reproducing. Why? Because life involves a lot of suffering.” Another point Samuel raised is that humans “should be paid”—he did not say by whom—to live because coming into the world was not their choice in the first place. For Samuel, a considerable amount of the world’s suffering could be avoided if people did not exist at all. According to antinatalists, the Guardian caricatured, “the optimal outcome for humanity is extinction.” Samuel agrees. In one of his Facebook posts, he likened living, school, and a professional career to “slavery” and “kidnapping.” He asked, “Why must I suffer? Why must I work?” Surprisingly perhaps, Samuel’s parents are supposedly ready to go to court to challenge their son’s case. Both his parents are “good lawyers” and seem eager to prove that he does not have enough judicial elements to challenge them, according to a statement from his mother, which Samuel shared on his Facebook. The statement said: “I must admire my son’s temerity to want to take his parents to court knowing both of us are lawyers. If Raphael could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault.”

Rabat – Despite implementing reforms to improve democracy by fighting practices like corruption and censorship, freedom has not been totally achieved in Morocco. The mixed assessment comes from the latest Freedom House report on the state of “Freedom in the world.” The report spoke in somber terms of the global state of democratization and accompanying values like respect of political rights, checks and balances, and political dissent. “Freedom in the World assesses the real-world rights and freedoms enjoyed by individuals, rather than governments or government performance per se,” the report noted. This year, Freedom House evaluated political rights and civil liberties in 195 countries and 14 territories. They were assigned “between 0 and 4 points on a series of 25 indicators, for an aggregate score of up to 100.” Based on how each performed on freedom conditions, they were categorized as “free,” “partly free,” or “not free.” Morocco, which scored 39 in aggregate, was ranked 144th out of 209 countries and territories worldwide. With that score, Morocco was categorized as “partly free,” suggesting that in spite of recent political reforms, challenges remain. MENA: Repression grows as democracies stumble At the same time, Morocco’s not-so-good performance in freedom and “democratic values” is not an isolated case. In fact, Morocco was among the best performers of the MENA region. Regional trends in MENA point to a pattern of slumbering democracies, limiting political climate for rights advocacy groups, and surging authoritarianism. Many in Moroccan policy quarters continue to refer to Morocco as a regional exception and torch bearer. Algeria (34 and not free), Mauritania (32 and not free), and Egypt (22 and not free) languish far below Morocco and attest to North Africa’s longstanding pattern of democratic erosion under power-seeking elites eager to “suppress dissent” and block democratic transitions, the report suggested. Speaking of Egypt’s score, the report noted, “Political repression worsened in Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was reelected with 97 percent of the vote after security forces arbitrarily detained potential challengers.” In the Arab world beyond North Africa, the situation of freedom and civil liberties is no less dire. Some countries which grabbed global headlines for their perceived commitment to a democratic transition by implementing liberties-friendly reforms have “suffered from self-inflicted wounds,” according to the report. Saudi Arabia, which at some point last year drew enthusiastic commentaries and news stories in global media for its crown prince’s progressive reforms, stood out in the category of countries that did not live up to expectations. The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi dealt a serious blow to the Saudi kingdom’s standing, revealing troubling patterns of state-sponsored repression. “In Saudi Arabia, after the government drew praise for easing its draconian ban on women driving, authorities arrested high-profile women’s rights activists and clamped down on even mild forms of dissent. Evidence also mounted that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had personally ordered the assassination of self-exiled critic and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, dashing any remaining hopes that the young prince might emerge as a reformer,” Freedom House noted. Only three countries outranked Morocco in the entire MENA region: Israel and Tunisia, the region’s only two “free” countries with scores of 78 and 69, respectively, and Lebanon, “partly free,” with a score of 45. Morocco’s pattern of mixed results While Freedom House has yet to publish an overview to explain the reasons for Morocco’s “partly free” character, the North African kingdom is no stranger to such assessments. On January 29, Transparency International assessed Morocco’s anti-corruption efforts as mildly successful. Transparency reported that while there have been clear signs of government commitment to curbing corruption and related practices, “political and economic elites influence government and divert public funds at the expense of citizens.” Prior to that, the Economist’s 2018 Democracy Index report also suggested that it is not clear whether Morocco can be called a democracy. The report used terms like “flawed democracy” or “hybrid regime” to explain that Morocco is neither a consolidated democracy nor a full dictatorship. Meanwhile, it is not solely in the MENA region that democracy had a rough time in 2018. “Between 2005 and 2018, the share of Not Free countries rose to 26 percent, while the share of Free countries declined to 44 percent,” according to Freedom House. “Democracy is in retreat,” the report added. “The pattern is consistent and ominous.”

By Amal El Attaq Rabat – The Rabat-Sale-Kenitra Region and the Brussels-Capital Region signed a cooperation agreement on Tuesday in Rabat to strengthen partnerships in tourism and culture. The minister-president of the Brussels Capital Region, Rudi Vervoort, and the president of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra Region, Abdessamad Sekkal, agreed on the partnerships focusing on four main areas: accessibility and connectivity, territorial marketing, skills training, and tourism entrepreneurship. Sekkal and Vervoort also signed a four-way agreement with Abdel Moneim El Madani, general director of the National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Competencies (Anapec), and George Chapel, general director of the Belgian Foundation for the Promotion of Employment and Youth Support (ACTIRIS). Read Also: Tourism in Essaouira Grows, Hotels Booked Out for New Year’s “We have set a lot of projects we intend to work on that will implement training in tourism professions, as well as developing tourism start-ups,” Sekkal said. Talking to the press, he mentioned that the meeting was “an opportunity to improve consultations between the two countries and to strengthen cooperation on tourism, culture and employment.” Sekkal also pointed out the excellent relations between Belgium and Morocco, and he hoped Morocco would take advantage of Brussels’ experience to promote Moroccan monuments. Sekkal and Vervoort’s delegation also met AbdelKarim Benaitiq, the minister delegate to the minister of foreign affairs, who is in charge of immigration. The representatives discussed their bilateral cooperation, especially in light of the Moroccan community in Brussels, and how to facilitate Moroccans’ integration into Belgium. The Brussels delegation has scheduled several meetings for their February 5-8 visit to discuss the progress of bilateral projects and future projects in areas of Belgian expertise. In November 2018, Moroccan and Belgian business actors signed 21 agreements and MoUs, which covered various sectors, such as pharmacy, agro-food, renewable energy, chemistry, and metallurgy.

Rabat – The counterterrorism symposium kicked off today in Washington D.C. with the participation of a Moroccan delegation led by Bourita. During the meeting, the two officials discussed questions of common interest such as the Western Sahara dispute, Iran malign influence in the Middle East and North Africa, the latest development in Venezuela, as well as the upcoming Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East, which will be held in Morocco. According to a readout of the meeting, which was obtained by Morocco World News, Secretary Pompeo “acknowledged Morocco’s constructive participation in talks with the UN Personal Envoy for Western Sahara and thanked Morocco for its resolute efforts to counter Iran’s malign influence in the region.  The US official also “thanked the Foreign Minister for his support of Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guiadó.” Bourita and Pompeo’s meeting comes a week after the bilateral meeting held between the US official and the Algerian foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, in Washington. This is the second meeting between the two officials in less than six months. During their first meeting last September, Bourita and Pompeo agreed to hold the US-Morocco strategic dialogue in the US this year. The US is among Morocco’s main partners in several cooperation areas, including counterterrorism. It is also Morocco’s first supplier of military equipment. Morocco seeks to secure the Trump administration’s support to its position on the Western Sahara.  The meeting comes against the backdrop of Morocco’s concerns that the US might abandon it positive neutrality on the conflict after the appointment of John Bolton as National Security Adviser.  Bolton, who has worked on the Western Sahara for many years when he was assistant of former United Nations Secretary General personal envoy, James Baker, has made no secret of his willingness to end the Western Sahara conflict and to pressure the United Nations peacekeeping to show more realism and effectiveness in their work.  In December, Bolton said that he wants to see the conflict resolved, criticizing MINURSO for not finding a mutually acceptable solution despite its presence in the region. “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Bolton said as he expressed frustration. Nasser Bourita is due to meet with John Bolton, a source who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity told Morocco World News.

Rabat – Jilali, 42, a Moroccan immigrant who has been living and working on farms in Italy for 18 years, wanted to spend the last days of his life with his mother and family in Morocco. Back in August, Jilali traveled to Morocco to visit his mother. When he returned to Italy, his health began to deteriorate, and he soon discovered he was suffering from neurological cancer. After Jilali learned that he only had a few months to live, according to his doctor at a hospital in Eboli town, Italy, he wanted to go back to Morocco but knew he could not afford his travel expenses. A Moroccan cultural mediator in Italy, Fatiha Chakir, learned about his situation and called for charitable people to donate and help Jilali cover his travel expenses to Morocco and even some of his treatment. Jilali was thankful that the donations were even sufficient to cover his medical expenses, especially since his “hospital only opens three days for take-away medicine.” Donations poured in, and Jilali landed safely in Casablanca on Monday.  Chakir has shared pictures of Jilali at home with his mother on her Facebook account. 
The mayor of Eboli, Massimo Cariello, applauded the initiative, saying, according to Italian news outlet La Republica: “We are proud of this wonderful initiative by our citizens.”

Rabat – A video of a Sahrawi woman condemning the Polisario Front leader, Ibrahim Ghali, for raping her has been shared on Twitter. A Twitter account called Western Sahara Scene, created two months ago, shared a video clip of a Sahrawi woman named Khadijatou Mahmoud saying that she was raped by the leader of the separatist group. Mahmoud said Ghali raped her in the separatists’ secretariat in Rabouni, Algeria. Mahmoud said: “I see [Ibrahim] in meetings in Rabouni and during visits by international organizations.” She continued, “There was nothing going wrong between us.  When I arrived there, the embassy guard told me that my appointment was scheduled for 7 p.m.” Mahmoud said she agreed to meet with Ghali at 7 because she needed some documents to be signed to get a visa. “I sat and introduced myself. It is difficult to remember the memories from the beginning to the end. He raped me. And what happened happened.” She said that she left the embassy feeling dizzy. She then visited a friend who was staying at a hotel, and she told her what happened. Mahmoud’s friend then advised her to talk to her family. But when Mahmoud told her mother, her mother told her to keep it secret. “But you know. We are ignorant,” she said, referring to her mother’s advice. “My mother told me, ‘If you tell this, you will have no future.  You may find someone who will accept to marry you.’ It is about tradition, virginity.” HEINOUS watch victim of rape by #Polisario leader Ghali. #Khadijatou seeks #justice@ENF_EP @GreensEP @EFDgroup @ecrgroup @EPPGroup @GUENGL @TheProgressives @ALDEgroup @Europarl_EN @EU_Commission @FrontLineHRD @USUN @rightsofwomen @WomensRights @women_rights @UrgentAct @UAFAfrica pic.twitter.com/c5QXHb5ZKy — Western Sahara Scene (@SaharaScene) February 5, 2019  In December 2007, the Spanish National court accepted a complaint against Polisario leaders and Algerian security and army officers for “genocide, torture, enforced disappearances, illegal detention and serious violations of human rights.” The list of the suspects involved in committing the alleged illegal acts included Ibrahim Ghali, leader of the Polisario Front. Ghali was also featured in a 2017 documentary called “Embarrassing Witnesses: The Real Face of the Polisario” broadcast by Moroccan state-owned television channel 2M about the front’s violation of human rights and Ghali’s involvement.

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Mehdi Benatia said that one of his reasons behind signing a contract with Al Duhail club in Qatar was to see his children grow up in a Muslim culture, in a press conference yesterday in Qatar. In an interview published on the official website of his new club Al Duhail, Mehdi Benatia said that he made a conscious choice to move to Qatar.  “I’ve played with great teams like Bayern Munich, AS Roma and Juventus. I’ve won a lot of titles with them. Today, I want to win the Asian Cup with Al Duhail,” said the 31-year-old Moroccan player.

Benatia, who transferred from Juventus last month, also said that his choice was not just about the sport. “I want everyone to respect my decision. I want my children to grow up in a Muslim culture. I could have gone to the UAE or Saudi Arabia but I chose Qatar,” he said.

Benatia also hoped his choice would not influence his future with Morocco’s national team and his relationship with its coach, Herve Renard.  “There are plenty of players who play in the Gulf and continue to have the support of the coach. Herve Renard knows me well. If he sees that I can no longer play for the national team, I will respect his choice,” he said. The footballer joined Juventus from Bayern Munich, initially on loan in 2016. He was later signed permanently by the club in the 2017-18 season. Benatia is the captain of the national football team and played in the 2018 World Cup with Morocco. However, he missed out on several of Morocco’s qualifying games for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, leading to speculations of a rift between him and Renard.

By Amal El Attaq The Hassania School of Public Works (EHTP) will host the second Hassania Electro Day on March 30. Located in Casablanca, EHTP is one of the most popular graduate engineering schools in Morocco.  EHTP’s ElectroPower club will lead the event, which aims to answer questions from curious and passionate people about electricity. The club hopes also to innovate and reflect on the present and future challenges related to electrical energy. “We aim to make all visitors understand the wide application of electricity; it is not just electrotechnics, but also programming and industry,” said Rachida Ounarain, president of the EHTP ElectroPower club. EHTP was founded in 1971 by the Ministry of Public Works, to develop Moroccan professionals in sectors such as construction, water, information technology, electrical power, civil engineering, and meteorology. Other than the ElectroPower club, the school has an Olympics club, a cultural club, a business forum, and others. The club is planning a range of activities, such as stands, workshops, training, and the sharing of experiences led by engineers for students.  They will also host competitions and a conference under the theme “Electricity: The lifeblood of our modern world.” Ounarain stressed that electricity is a necessity in daily life. “If you gave a task for 100 people to do, those people will take more than 10 days to finish it. However a machine can do the whole work in 24h. This is the power of electricity,” argued Ounarain. The club aims to simplify concepts of embedded systems, electronics, and robotics because they believe that electricity faces many challenges today in Morocco.  “While preparing for this conference, we tried to make the theme more general, so as to be useful for all students, even those who are not engineering students,” Ounarain told Morocco World News. The student related that the conference will focus on four main areas: medicine, astronomy, energy, and telecommunications.  One conference guest, Leila Sedki, will give a presentation about how electricity contributes to energy and how Ibn Khaldoun contributed to astronomy.  She stated that attendees are also going to meet startups and other companies to explain how electrical energy works. Ounarain added that the club’s team are still contacting their previous partners to be present in this year’s exposition, such as Fablab and Nextronic.  “We are aiming to contact other companies and startups that are related to aeronautics, and still working in that,” said Ounarain. The event’s first competition will be for students’ projects. The best projects, in terms of idea and technicality, will win a prize of MAD 500. The second competition is called “Capture the Flag,” a hacking competition in which teams resolve enigmas to get a flag. The student related that the club has not selected a prize for the competition yet, but she promised it would be greater than the first. Regarding their future projects, she said that the club is working on another project called “the meeting,” which will match an engineering student with an engineer mentor who will try to share work experience and knowledge with the student. At the first Hassania Electro Day last year, called “National Day of Electricity,” 150 persons attended. According to Ounarain, last year’s theme was “connectivity and performance.” Several professors and engineers, such as Mohamed Elaaroussi, Benmir Fouad, Elbakri Mohamed, and Mohamed Reffadi, shared their expertise at the event.

Rabat – Unemployment in Morocco dropped from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent between 2017 and 2018, according to a High Commission for Planning (HCP) briefing note published on Tuesday.
 In 2018, the economy created 112,000 jobs, 91,000 in urban areas and 21,000 in rural areas. The figure is up from 86,000 new jobs in 2017.  The services sector created the most new jobs at 65,000; followed by agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (19,000); construction (15,000); and industry and crafts (13,000). In 2018, urban areas had a higher unemployment rate (14.2 percent) compared to rural areas (3.5 percent).   Rural youth unemployment dropped from 11.4 percent to 10.4 percent. Unemployment in urban youth aged 15 to 24 increased 0.4 percent. The gap between men and women’s employment rates persisted in 2018. Women’s unemployment rate was 14 percent, compared to 8.4 percent among men. The unemployment rate was significantly higher among women with vocational training (34.2 percent) than men (19.1 percent). Despite the male-female job disparity, unemployment in women dropped 0.7 percent between 2017 and 2018.  In some cases, holding a more advanced degree translated to a higher likelihood of employment. For example, the unemployment rate among holders of a vocational training diploma was 23.3 percent, higher than that of general education graduates (15.4 percent) and that of all graduates aged 15 and over (17.1 percent). In contrast, unemployment among diploma-holders was 17.1 percent compared to 3.5 percent among non-diploma holders.  For young people aged 15 to 24, the rate was 26 percent, compared to 7.2 percent among people aged 25 and over, says the HCP.

Rabat – Archeologists have discovered stone structures dating back thousands of years on the northwest coast of the Western Sahara in southern Morocco. The stone structures come in various shapes and sizes, and some of them are more than 10,000 years old. Although many of the stones’ functions are not clear, the archeologists suggest that some of them were most likely used as gravestones and burial mounds. Joanne Clarke, a researcher at the University of East Anglia, and Nick Books, an independent researcher behind the discovery, co-authored a book on their work. The researchers wrote: “The archaeological map of Western Sahara remains literally and figuratively almost blank as far as the wider international archaeological research community is concerned, particularly away from the Atlantic coast.” Clarke and Brooks studied hundreds of the stones, noting their different forms, from straight lines and rectangular to circular and crescent-like shapes, between 2002 and 2009. Terrorist groups like al-Qaeda are the primary reason behind the archaeologists’ inability to move freely and explore more archeological monuments telling the long-lost history of the ancients in the area. Western Sahara is the subject of a long-running dispute between Morocco and Polisario separatists.

Rabat – The Islamist association of Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane, or Justice and Spirituality, violated three Moroccan laws by using unlicensed premises in three different regions for unauthorized meetings. Moroccan administrative authorities shut down three unlicensed premises owned by the banned movement on Tuesday. While some members of the movement decried the decision, authorities said that the move came in accordance with the law because using residences as “public spaces” for secret meetings is a violation of laws. The first violation was of Law  12-90 on urbanism, which makes it illegal to use a residence as a public place for meetings. People charged with changing a residence into a meeting place can be subject to  a fine ranging between MAD 10,000 and MAD 100,000. The second decree violated by the movement is Law 1-58-377, which stipulates that the organizers of public meetings should send a statement with the time, location, and purpose of the meeting to the local government administration. The movement also redesigned some of the areas seized by authorities as mosques, which is illegal without license. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs is usually the department that gives licenses for places of worship. The ministry is also the only legitimate body that can assign imams and preachers. On Tuesday, Moroccan authorities closed the unlicensed premises for the movement in three cities: Casablanca, Kenitra, and Inezgane. Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane movement was founded in the 1980s by Sheikh Abdessalam Yassine, a former teacher and the late spiritual guide of the group. The Islamist movement has been banned from political activities because of what the government calls its antagonistic approach towards the Moroccan government.

Rabat –  Earlier this week, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch flew to Australia to look for more opportunities for cooperation in agriculture and fisheries. Akhannouch told the press after his talks with the agricultural minister for the Australian state of Victoria,  Jaclyn Symes, that “Victoria has shown great interest in supporting Morocco in the development of its agriculture and fisheries sectors.” The minister added that the meeting also gave Morocco an opportunity to learn about the Australian experience in the areas of training, research, and biosecurity, in addition to other projects such as aquaculture and the development of fish markets. “Australia’s vision focuses on product quality and biosecurity, aspects that are of particular interest to Morocco,” Akhannouch said. Symes said that both countries are determined to develop agriculture and fisheries, emphasizing that such development “requires innovation and the adoption of new technologies.” She added that the two factors are key aspects to “ensure the prosperity of these sectors.” The Australian MP also tweeted about her meeting with Akhannouch. “Great to meet with the Moroccan Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries,  Mr Aziz Akhannouch today. Key on the agenda; Victoria’s game-changing move to Sheep EID, climate change, trade access and young farmers,” she wrote. Great to meet with the Moroccan Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr Aziz Akhannouch today.

The ambassador added that “Australian exports comprised around AUD 40 million [MAD 272 million], mostly in wheat, meat and paints, and imports from Morocco were valued at around AUD 57 million [MAD 338 million], including fertilisers, clothing and vegetables.” The diplomat also expressed satisfaction with the cooperation between Rabat and Canberra. “As the Australian Ambassador to Morocco, I am pleased by our significant and diverse economic relationship.  However, I see potential to grow our commercial links further particularly in the areas of food and agriculture, water management, cyber security, infrastructure, planning and extractives,” she said. Akhannouch’s trip to Australia this week is his second visit to the country. He is leading a delegation of more than 20 people.  Opportunity for further collaboration “Against the background of the visit to Australia by the Moroccan Minister of Agriculture, I am pleased that Australian companies have participated in components of Morocco’s Green Morocco Plan – including a bovine traceability review and an agriculture education, training and research review and strategic plan,” Owen-Jones stressed. The ambassador said that the visit of Akhannouch will increase cooperation between the two countries. Akhannouch will  meet with several senior officials, including Minister of Agriculture David Littleproud. Throughout the week-long visit, Akhannouch will also meet with representatives from business sectors in multiple states.  According to the diplomat, Akhannouch will “will see first-hand that Australia, as a world leader in sustainable agriculture and fisheries, is  well placed to become a partner of choice for Morocco in areas such as research, biosecurity, dry land agriculture, aquaculture, agricultural technology, horticulture and livestock management.” According to the Australian government, Morocco’s mining sector is one of its key developed areas because it accounts for 9 percent of its Gross Domestic Product. The government also said that the mining sector represents 30 percent of its exports. The government emphasized the importance of phosphates for Morocco since the North African country contains two-thirds of the world’s phosphate reserves. Australia is also aware of Morocco’s licensed permits granted to international companies to explore natural gas and fuel in its land. “Mining (except for phosphates) can be carried out by any individual or corporate entity, regardless of nationality, but under the new code, they must prove technical and financial capabilities,” added the Australian government on its profile market. It also emphasized that Morocco is considered a gateway to Francophone West African countries through its diplomatic ties with other African countries. The Moroccan involvement in Francophone West African nations creates opportunities for major reviews and consultations as well as exploration and development for Australian companies looking to engage with Morocco and Francophone West Africa. The government of Australia considers Morocco as a dynamic economic landscape due to its “proximity to Europe and a diverse geography.” It also acknowledged Morocco’s position as “a stable, business friendly hub for North-West Africa.” In a previous interview, Owen-Jones told Morocco World News that her country is also determined to increase cooperation on counterterrorism issues, including in global forums with Rabat. Morocco has several international cooperations with international security services due its tightened security measures to combat terrorism.

Rabat – The Quebec government posthumously awarded Azzedine Soufiane, a Moroccan, the Good Citizen medal for bravery on Monday.  Canada gave medals to people killed and injured in a terrorist attack on a mosque in Quebec City on January 29, 2017. An armed man carried out the attack during the evening prayer, entering the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec and opening fire in all directions. The terrorist killed six people and injured several others. According to Radio Canada, Soufiane, 57, tried to hold the murderer back when he was attempting to reload his weapon. However, the terrorist freed himself and killed Soufiane. Quebec honored the Moroccan man for his act of heroism at the Salon Rouge of the National Assembly. “[Azzedine Soufiane] tried everything to help his friends. The bravery he has shown is the most beautiful proof of all the goodness that inhabited this man,” the ceremony host was quoted by the radio. Soufiane’s wife and his three children received the medal on his behalf. His eldest daughter Zined said that she felt honored, thanking the organizers “We will keep this medal in our family,” she said. After Soufiane’s death, members of the Moroccan community in Quebec said that Soufiane was a “beloved member of the community.” The Moroccan had immigrated to Canada and been living there for more than 20 years. He owned a halal butchery. Several Moroccans residing abroad have been honored for bravery. In December 2018, Italian President Sergio Mattarella honored Moroccan immigrant Mustapha El Aoudi with a merit award for his heroic act in saving an Italian doctor from a murder attempt. El Aoudi acted quickly on December 4 in the Italian city of Crotone when a 50-year-old man attacked and stabbed Dr. Maria Carmela Calindro in front of the San Giovanni di Dio Hospital, blaming her for the death of his mother.Another Moroccan living in Italy received a job offer after returning a lost wallet with €900 inside it.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI inaugurated a primary health care center and the Mellah District Rehabilitation Center on Tuesday in Marrakech. According to a statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the solidarity-based projects are in line with the El Mellah neighborhood urban upgrading program. The Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity funded the projects. King Mohammed VI launched their construction on January 10, 2017. The projects’ objective is to improve medical services for the populous neighborhood with pressing medical needs, especially vulnerable groups. The primary health care facility is 630 square meters large. The center, which is the fruit of a partnership between the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity and the Ministry of Health, has an emergency care room and a unit for chronic diseases. The rehabilitation center is the second of its kind funded by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity in Marrakech. The project is part of the national program against drug addiction launched in 2010. The program aims to protect young people from psychoactive pills and to improve care for addicts, especially drug users. The new center aims to develop awareness and prevent drug use; ensure individualized, medical and social care for people suffering from addictive behavior; and increase families’ involvement in addiction prevention.

Rabat – Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi announced today that the H1N1 virus claimed five more lives, bringing the number up to 16 people. The H1N1 outbreak has hit Morocco in recent weeks, surprising Moroccans due to the deaths among infected people. However, the Moroccan government reassured citizens that the flu season is not unusual and advised them to take normal precautions. The Ministry of Health said that the virus is generally not serious unless it affects vulnerable people, including pregnant women, children, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases. To avoid getting the virus, the ministry advises Moroccans to use water and soap to wash their hands often. The ministry also advises people who have chronic diseases to get the flu shot to avoid getting affected. Symptoms of H1N1 include a sore throat, fever, a stuffy and runny nose, headaches, body aches, and continuous fatigue. People with such symptoms are advised to stay home, get treatment, and cover their nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Labor and the Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad signed an agreement on Monday to monitor the situation of strawberry pickers in Spanish farms. The agreement entails the founding of a joint commission to organize visits to the Spanish farms where an estimated 19,000 strawberry pickers work, to examine their working conditions in the company of Spanish authorities, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The workers who have already undergone training to harvest strawberries and other berries this season will receive a wage of €37 per 6.5 hours each day in addition to accommodations.  The workers were scheduled to leave Morocco for Spain on Tuesday. Upon their return, they will be accompanied by Morocco’s National Agency for Employment and Skills (ANAPEC). Last year, Spain agreed to hire over 10,000 Moroccan agricultural workers to pick berries for the April to June harvest season. In May, some Moroccan women working in Huelva farms filed complaints against their employers for sexual assault. News of the assault allegations broke internationally. In June, Moroccan and Spanish women rallied in Huelva in a march of solidarity with the seasonal workers, denouncing the sexual assaults. Later, a Moroccan-Spanish delegation visited the farms to monitor the workers’ situation. Before that, the Moroccan Ministry of Employment had maintained that “no specific case of abuse or violation against Moroccan workers was found.” While in previous seasons, 11,000 went to Spain’s Huelva province to harvest and fulfilled their commitment to return home to Morocco afterward, some did not comply with the condition. In October, some 2,500 (17 percent) of the workers declared their wish to stay in Spain, according to the Moroccan-Spanish commission, which had organized the workers’ travel last season.

Rabat – Moroccan administrative authorities have shut down a series of unlicensed headquarters used by the Justice and Spirituality movement (Al Adl Wa Al Ihssan) in several places, including Inezgane, Kenitra, and Casablanca. A source told Morocco World News that the movement has been using the unlicensed headquarters to hold secret unauthorized meetings.  Several people who live near or in the same building also filed complaints against the members of the movement, saying those who gathered in the headquarters caused a disturbance. Morocco has banned the movement from political participation because of what the government calls its antagonistic approach towards the Moroccan government. The anti-monarchy movement claims to support democracy of the state but refuses to participate in elections, considering them undemocratic. The movement was found in the 1980s by Sheikh Abdessalam Yassine, a former teacher and the late spiritual guide of the group. The movement was also active during the most notable protests in Morocco, including the Arab Spring protests in 2011 and the 2016-2017 Hirak Rif protests in the Al Hoceima province in northern Morocco.

Rabat – The World Health Organization has issued a joint statement with the Moroccan Ministry of Health to reassure Moroccans that the seasonal influenza “should in no way worry the population.” “The WHO and the Ministry of Health are monitoring the situation very closely and recommended the usual preventive measures,”Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) wrote. The  press release added that the influenza surveillance system in Morocco is “fully functioning and gathers all the necessary data for prevention and response actions.” The ministry and the WHO said that the H1N1 strain is the “predominant circulating virus this season in Morocco and worldwide.” The virus has existed every year since 2010. “Every year, influenza epidemics can affect all age groups but most cases heal quickly without the need for medical treatment,” the statement said. Just as Minister of Health Anas Doukkali has explained in the two last weeks, the statement reminded Moroccans that some groups are more vulnerable to complications than others, like pregnant women, children from 6 months to 5 years old, the elderly, and people suffering from chronic diseases. The statement also advised vulnerable people to get vaccinated every year. The WHO and the ministry also reassured Moroccans that they will continue to “monitor the seasonal flu situation in the country and provide additional advice if needed.” H1N1 has so far killed 16 people in Morocco this season.  Last week, the ministry said that an analysis of 684 samples of people with influenza or severe acute respiratory infections showed the virus in 160 samples. The people who died all had at least one factor of vulnerability, including pregnancy, chronic disease, and age.

Rabat – The Saudi National Information Center has developed a mobile application called “Absher” (Arabic for “Enjoy”) that allows male guardians, usually husbands and fathers, to monitor women’s movements.

The app, available on iOS and Android, is designed to help guardians with tasks like renewing a driver’s license or paying fines, but also to monitor women and stop them from leaving the country without their consent.

The app sends a notification when a woman presents her passport at border control. Border police will deny the woman travel if her guardian says so.

In early January, a Saudi teenager named Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun tried to flee to Australia with a connecting flight in Thailand. In Bangkok, a Saudi official met her to take her back to Saudi Arabia, but she refused to return. After a days-long standoff, Canada finally granted the teenager asylum.

Over the past two years, Saudi Arabia has lessened several restrictions on its female citizens. Women are now allowed to drive with their guardians’ permission, go to sports stadiums, and start their own business without the permission of a male guardian.

Rabat – Christians in Western countries have expressed fears of a rise of Islamic extremism, believing that Islam is not compatible with their cultures, different from how Muslims in the Middle East and North Africa view Christianity. According to a poll by UK-based market research firm YouGov in January, half of Western respondents, 46 percent in France and 47 in Germany, noted a “fundamental clash” between Islamic values and their societal values. The majority of respondents from the UK, the United States, France, and Germany were concerned about the possible increase of extremism in Islam. “Clear majorities of Western respondents in the study also described themselves as either very or fairly concerned about the possible rise of extremism in Islam, including 72 percent in both France and Germany, 66 percent in Britain and 56 percent in the United States,” stated YouGov. Meanwhile, in a similar YouGov poll, the majority of respondents from the MENA region did not have similar views of Christianity. Only 7 percent of respondents in Egypt, 13 percent in the UAE, 25 percent in Saudi Arabia, and 22 percent in Algeria said there was a clash between the societal values in their counties and those of Christianity. The poll was released this week during the first papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula. Pope Francis is attending an interfaith conference today in Abu Dhabi and led an open-air mass which expected to have 120,000 in attendance, according to the Guardian. The UAE’s ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, said: “The pope’s visit will send a strong signal across the region and world: people with different beliefs can live, work and worship together.” Although the survey did not display statistics on the views of Belgians on Islam, the country has been in the headlines recently for vicious Islamophobic attacks. According to data gathered from victims by a local anti-Islamophobia association, 76 percent of Islamophobic attacks in Belgium targeted women in 2017. One publicized Islamophobic assault was against a veiled Moroccan woman in December.

Rabat – Morocco and Chile are poised to give a more solid foundation to their newfound diplomatic relations by committing to becoming closer on the cultural front. Meeting yesterday with the Chilean ambassador to Rabat, Alex Geiger Soffia, Morocco’s Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj, said that Rabat is grateful for the friendly and growing bilateral ties with Chile. In the Americas, Chile has been an illustration of Morocco’s increased diplomatic outreach and assertive public relations to garner international support for its Western Sahara stance. Laaraj suggested Morocco can only show commitment and reciprocity to such a supportive country like Chile. Meantime, the Chilean ambassador spoke warmly of the North African nation, saying that more actions are needed to bolster cultural cooperation. Both officials said their countries are working to “establish mechanisms to strengthen their bilateral cooperation in the cultural, literary, and artistic domains,” state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported today. In January last year, the Chilean Senate passed a resolution in support of Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan. The resolution acknowledged the seriousness and credibility of Morocco’s Western Sahara position. It noted that the referendum, one of the Polisario Front’s highest priorities, is “inapplicable.” Morocco’s plan, the resolution concluded, “will undoubtedly enable the Sahara population to exercise their right to self-determination, by democratically managing their own affairs through legislative, executive and judicial bodies with exclusive powers under the sovereignty of Morocco.”

Rabat – The Netherlands held Ahmed, Omar, and Hamza, three Moroccan hip-hop dancers for at least five days in a detention center for undocumented migrants in Rotterdam. The artists, aged 20 and 21, had come to the Netherlands for a dance event. Maria Daif, former head of the Touria and Abdelaziz Tazi Foundation and of l’Uzine—the cultural center in Casablanca where the dancers rehearse—published the story of their “misadventure” yesterday on her Facebook account. The artists arrived at the Eindhoven airport on January 10, according to Daif. The immigration officer asked them about the reasons for the trip, their place of stay in the Netherlands, and how much money they were carrying. The three had about €300. Dutch immigration held them on the grounds of “lack of means of subsistence and lack of evidence of the reasons for their travel.” A foreigner visiting the Netherlands should be carrying €34 a day, according to Schengen Visa Info. “Their return air tickets are paid and scheduled for January 17 (Hamza and Omar) and 22 (Ahmed),” said Daif. Daif related that the officer made them wait several hours in an office where other officers interviewed them. Immigration officers searched the artists and then transferred them to a police station outside the airport where they were asked intrusive questions.  “Are you suicidal?” police wanted to know. “Have you ever had sex?” 

“They sign documents in Dutch that they don’t understand: ‘We were scared. When we signed, we thought we would be released,’” Daif narrated. “I am not a criminal, I am an artist,” Daif quoted Hamza. Police then put the three artists were then put in a van and transferred to a detention center for illegal immigrants in Rotterdam. Despite having visas, Omar and Hamza were held until January 15 and Ahmed until the 17th. 
 “They did not know how long they would stay there,” reported Daif. Ahmed and Hamza, the youngest, were locked in one cell and Omar in another.  The young men could leave their cells except between noon and 2 p.m. and then again over night starting at 10 p.m. At the detention center, Hamza, Omar, and Ahmed called their families and l’Uzine.  On January 12, they met a court-appointed lawyer. The lawyer asked general questions about their planned stay in the Netherlands and promised to come back the next day. The lawyer did not return, however.  Made aware of the case by l’Uzine, a Moroccan senior official visited the artists on January 13. The official informed them that they would be sent back to Morocco but was not sure when.  On January 15, Hamza and Omar, but not Ahmed, were again loaded into a police vehicle, each locked in a box, and transferred to the post in Eindhoven and then to the airport.  They waited several hours in the vehicle before being handed over to a Ryanair flight crew on a plane heading to Marrakech.  In Marrakech, Ryanair delivered them to the local authorities upon landing. “We crossed the entire airport accompanied by police officers, as if we were dangerous criminals. Everyone at the airport was watching us.”  Omar and Hamza ended up at the Marrakech police prefecture where police interrogated them at length before releasing them. “On January 17, Ahmed undergoes the same treatment,” Daif concluded in her Facebook post. Omar and Hamza are members of the Lions Crew collective. The group is not unknown; the New York Times published an article featuring the group in May. Last year, Daif boycotted the Moussem Cities Festival in Brussels to protest the reduced mobility of Moroccan artists in Europe.

Rabat – A 19-year old Moroccan student is facing an unexpected visa issue in Belgium. Rania Akrach was planning to fly to France via Belgium to get to Lille University after a brief holiday in Morocco. Because there are no direct flights between Casablanca and Lille Akrach bought a ticket that had a connection in Brussels. But the Moroccan student did not realize that her application for French residence only allowed her to land in France, unlike the Schengen visa. Belgian security services detained Akrach at the airport and then put her in a Belgian detention center called Caricole de Steenokkerzeel.  Belgian immigration officials are now threatening to send her back to Casablanca. According to Belgian outlet RTBLF, the student said she was subject to “mocking remarks and threats.” Akrach, according to the news outlet, spoke with her family from the detention center. Her sister, Rim, said that Akrach is traumatized after the incident. “She is just crying, she is not allowed to ask questions, and when she says she is having trouble breathing, she is not being answered,” Rim told the news outlet. The security services also asked the Moroccan student if she needs a translator sarcastically, even though she is studying in France. Police at the Zaventem airport also threatened they would keep Akrach for 10 days in the interrogation room if she did not resign herself to signing a paper saying that she would spend the night in a detention center for immigrants before being sent back to Casablanca. “She is not used to such incidents,” her sister added. The Moroccan embassy in Brussels is following the situation and attempting to solve it. The embassy also emphasized that in order for a person to transit through Belgium, they need to have a visa. The attachee of the Moroccan General Consulate in Belgium, Fouad Mejloufi, said that in cases like Akrach’s, nine out of ten are deported directly to Morocco. The news outlet added that Mejloufi insisted that residence permits are only “valid in the country where they are issued and that nationals should be better informed.”

Rabat – Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou’s stellar performance with Girona is gaining him recognition across the European footballing spectrum. Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo has ranked Bounou 10th among “brilliant goal keepers who are having a great season in Europe’s top 5 divisions,” based on their number of saves so far this season. Bounou has earned the trust of both Girona and the Moroccan national team, where he is the starting goalkeeper. Of the 10 goalies whose performance outshone the rest of Europe’s elite leagues, only Manchester United’s Spanish goalie De Gea, ranked 4th, was a household name of acknowledged class and reputation. While keepers like Bounou or Lukasz Fabianski (5th) may not have the flamboyance of Real Madrid’s Courtois or Manchester City’s Ederson or the price tags of Liverpool’s Alison and Chelsea’s Kepa, their performance and importance for their respective teams is no less significant. In Bounou’s case, while Girona, his current club, languishes in 17th place in La Liga, Spain’s top league, the club’s place in the championship table would have been far lower had it not been for the Moroccan’s form. Mundo Deportivo’s rankings:
1) Oier Olazabal (Levante, Spain), 96 saves
2) Michael Esser (Hannover, Germany), 94 saves
3) Luis Sepe (Parma, Italy), 92 saves
4) David De Gea (Manchester United, England), 90 saves
5) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham, England), 88 saves
6) Marco Sportiello (Frosinone, Italy), 88 saves
7) Neil Etheridge (Cardiff, England), 88 saves
8) Sergio Asenjo, (Villarreal, Spain), 86 saves
9) Regis Gurtner (Amiens, France), 83 saves
10) Yassine Bounou (Girona, Spain), 83 saves

Rabat – Kevin Zoller Guervos, arrested in the case of the Imlil murders, appeared before the investigating judge of a court in Sale on Monday. Guervos’s lawyer, Saad Sahli, told AFP that the dual-nationality suspect is pleading innocent of the charges made against him by the Moroccan prosecutor. The prosecutor is charging Guervos with forming a criminal network to undermine Morocco’s stability and teaching other suspects how to murder Maren Ueland and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen. The bodies of the two suspects were found decapitated on December 17 near Imlil, a tourist destination in the Atlas Mountains. Sahli also described the hearing as positive, saying that they will wait until his client confronts the other suspects before asking for Guervos’s release. All 22 suspects, who already appeared before the court before, also were questioned by the investigating judge on Monday. Among the suspects, four defendants appeared in a video pledging allegiance to ISIS. However, the murders were committed without coordinating with ISIS.  After his arrest, Guervos’s mother, Gema, said that all the charges made against her son were lies. His friend also said that the 25-year-old suffered mental disorders, believing that he had demons in his head. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation, Abdelhak Khiame, said that although the  suspect had no direct involvement in the murder, he knew the main suspects.

Rabat – Former far-right Dutch politician Joram van Klaveren changed his view on Islam while writing a book criticizing the second most common religion in the world. The 39-year-old opened about his conversion to Islam on Monday with Dutch digital newspaper NRC. The politician, who was a member of the Freedom Party (PVV), had previously called Islam a lie. He quit Geert Wilders’ PVV in 2014 after Wilders asked  his supporters if they want more or fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands at a rally. The crowd then chanted “fewer.” Klaveren told a Dutch radio station that he came “across more and more things” that made his view of Islam “falter.” In his interview, the politician was asked if he felt guilty about his former sentiments on Islam. The politician said that he had been “simply wrong,” because it was a “PVV policy.” “Everything that was wrong had to be linked to Islam in one way or another.” Klaveren is not the first convert to Islam from PVV. Arnoud van Doorn, another PVV politician, converted to Islam in 2012. On his Twitter, Doorn congratulated Klaveren, saying that he had never “thought that the PVV would become a breeding ground for converts.” Euro-Islam speculates there are almost 1 million Muslims in the Netherlands. Muslims represent 5.8 percent of the Dutch population. According to the same website, “Dutch Muslims come primarily from Turkey and Morocco.” Other substantial minorities come from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Somalia. Over the years, several renowned celebrities have announced their conversion to Islam. In 2018, Arthur Wagner, a leading member of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party known for its anti-Muslim rhetoric, resigned from his post after deciding to become a Muslim.  Irish rock singer Sinead O’Connor also converted to Islam in October 2018.

Rabat – Spanish Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Luis Planas expressed hope that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement will be finalized soon. “I would like it if the Spanish vessels would be able to fish again in Moroccan waters before summer,” said the Spanish minister in an interview with Spanish news outlet EFE. A plenary session at the European Parliament will vote on the fisheries agreement on February 13. In January, Morocco and the EU signed an agreement setting out the conditions of access for European vessels in Moroccan waters and laying down requirements for sustainable fishing. The European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries adopted the agreement on January 23, but it will not go into effect until after a full Parliament vote. It is not the first time Planas has urged the European Union to speed up the ratification of the agreement. In November 2018, the Spanish official, Spanish MEPs and the European Parliament’s agriculture and fisheries commissions asked that it be approved in the first quarter of 2019. On January 16, the European Parliament passed the agriculture agreement between Morocco and the EU by a large majority. The deal received 444 votes in its favor.

Rabat – The family of Ahmed El Khalil, a Sahrawi intellectual missing since he was kidnapped in 2009 by Algerian intelligence services, is threatening to organize demonstrations in European capitals if their demands are not met. For several years, the Sahrawi family has been calling on Algeria and Polisario to explain what happened to El Khalil, who was arrested under unknown circumstances in 2009. In an interview with Future Magazine quoted by pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara, the family said that they are planning  to protest the disappearance of their relative in front of Algerian embassies in Paris, Brussels, and Madrid. The protest will follow a peaceful demonstration held in front of the Secretariat of the Polisario Front in Rabouni, Algeria. Prior to announcing their intention to protest in Algerian embassies abroad, El Khalil’s family and friends launched an international online campaign to draw attention to his disappearance. Creating a Facebook page, they called for El Khalil’s freedom and condemning his forced disappearance. It is unclear whether the activist is still alive because former Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud announced the death of his colleague. Born in Tan-Tan in southern Morocco, El Khalil moved to Fez to finish his high school studies, and he decided to join the Polisario in 1977. El Khalil was tasked by Polisario with monitoring human rights in the Tindouf camps before his disappearance. According to Mustafa Salma, El Khalil was one of the most renowned intellectuals in the camps.

Rabat – A 24-year-old Moroccan died while he was trying to fulfill his dream and reach Europe irregularly. The young man, named Soufiane, hid in the wheel well of a truck on January 15 in the Spanish enclave of Melilla. Soufiane hoped to get on one of the ships traveling from Melilla to Spain. Soufiane’s brother told Spanish news outlet Publico that one of his siblings went to finish the process of repatriating the body back to Morocco. He said it would be expensive. Publico said that the family had to pay about €3,500. Soufiane’s family buried him in Fez on January 28. Quoted by the Spanish news outlet Hamza, Soufiane’s brother said of his family, “We did not imagine” that Soufiane was risking his life.  “We thought he was in Melilla working, that was what he told us.” Growing up in Fez along with three other siblings, Soufiane had been working as a barber in Morocco. According to Publico, as many as three young Maghrebis have died in the port of Melilla, including Soufiane, since 2017. Morocco and Spain have experience increased irregular migration attempts in the last year, prompting them to cooperate more to strengthen security monitoring at the border. Moroccan security services thwarted 88,761 irregular migration attempts in 2018. Nearly 80 percent of the migrants were non-Moroccans.On December 30, 2018, the Spanish Civil Guard found two underage sub-Saharan African migrants inside two mattresses mounted on top of a vehicle crossing from Morocco into Melilla.

Rabat – Morocco’s Tangier Med port exported MAD 139 billion worth of products in 2018, over 50 percent of all Moroccan exports, according to a statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). According to the statement from the port authority, the volume confirms the port as the leading export site in Morocco and the biggest in Africa. The port processed an overall tonnage in the past year of 52,240,806 tons, an increase of 2 percent compared to 2017. The port surpassed Durban port in South Africa by handling a total volume of imports and exports worth MAD 317 billion in 2018. The two ports handled more than 3.4 million containers, an increase of 5 percent compared to 2017. Tangier Med’s passenger traffic has steadily increased with a traffic of 2,802,108 passengers, a slight increase of 1 percent from 2017. International Road Transport (TIR) ​​traffic has recorded a net annual growth of 14 percent in Tangier, “particularly driven by exports of industrial and agri-food products, registering a total traffic of 326,773 TIR units,” according to the statement. About 479,300 vehicles were handled at the two Tangier Med port terminals, an increase of 11 percent compared to 2017. More than 383,700 vehicles were handled at the Renault terminal. The statement added that the port recorded a total of 254,190 tons of imports, a decrease of 18 percent from 2017 “mainly due to lower cereal imports.” The port authority added that liquid bulk traffic experienced a decrease of 21 percent compared to 2017. Liquid traffic recorded a total of 5,920,477 tons of treated fuels, which variation “is due to decreased imports, especially of fuel.” In addition to the number of goods and vehicles, the press release said that 13,293 ships landed at the port in 2018, providing direct sea connections to 186 ports and 77 countries.

Rabat – The secretariat general of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) announced an international campaign to attract international investors to renovate railways linking Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. On January 31, the AMU published a statement on Facebook, emphasizing that it is preparing a promotional campaign for the “big project.” The secretariat said it was looking to hire an adviser “whose task is to accomplish the promotion of the study on the economic feasibility of the project, and to communicate with international banks, international companies, and public and private sector companies.” The project would include the renovation of the 363-kilometer railway line between Morocco and Algeria and another 503-kilometer railway between Algeria and Tunisia. The project was previously proposed in 2015 when  the general director of the Algerian National Railway Transport company (SNTF), Yacine Bendjaballah, talked about a high speed line linking Tunisia to Morocco via Algeria.  Al Jazeera reported that the project might cost $875 billion.  The AMU predicted that such a project “revived the hopes of the peoples of the region for a Maghreb unity that would bring them prosperity and well-being.” Morocco maintains good diplomatic ties with Tunisia. However, political observers cannot say the same about Moroccan-Algerian diplomatic ties since the border between the two neighbors has been closed since 1994. Algeria made the decision to close its border with Morocco after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. But tension between  Rabat and Algiers dates back further than that. In October 1963, the countries fought the Sand War over the border near Figuig in eastern Morocco. The war ended a year later when the US, the African Union, and the Arab League mediated the conflict. Since then, the border has only been open for six years between 1988 and 1994. Morocco also accuses Algeria of undermining its territorial integrity by supporting the Polisario Front. But King Mohammed VI offered to break the stalemate by proposing a mechanism of dialogue and consultation on November 6. Algeria, however, has ignored Morocco’s request up to this point, but AMU did not. The secretary general of the AMU said that the proposal would ensure integration in the Maghreb. The secretary-general also called on Algeria to accept Morocco’s offer.

Rabat – “I absolutely don’t care about this boycott threat, I’m going to Morocco,” said Enrico Macias, the pro-Israeli French singer whose Valentine’s Day concert Moroccans have vowed to boycott.  Following news of Macias’ February 14 concert, the Moroccan Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (MACBI) called for a boycott of the singer, describing him as “a strong defender of the Israeli occupation of Palestine.”  Speaking on the French Radio network RMC on February 1, Macias said that he does not care about “the few” who want to boycott his concert, and he will still travel to Casablanca.  “My victory will be to go and perform in Casablanca … I am going and whomever wants to attend is welcome,” he stated. #GrandOral – “Je m’en fous éperdument de cette menace de boycott. Je vais aller au Maroc et advienne que pourra !” Enrico Macias #GGRMC pic.twitter.com/WdmIJXsOzU — Les Grandes Gueules (@GG_RMC) 1 February 2019  The French singer of Algerian-Jewish descent said that Morocco is a country of tolerance, and he would not change his mind about that because of “some individuals who want to hurt” him. “I know the Moroccan people…. I compare Morocco to the Andalusia of yesterday because it is a country of tolerance.” He continued, “If you want to do something to me, now you know that I’ll be arriving at the airport on February 14.” MACBI considers Macias’s presence on stage at Megarama a “shame and an insult to the Casablanca public.” The association emphasized in a statement released on January 13 that Macias is giving his “blood, sweat and tears” to the association Migdal, which supports the Israel border police, Magav. The boycotters stated that Magav is “known for its war crimes against the civilian population.” They also cited Macias’ pro-Israeli statements from 10 years ago. In a video interview, Macias said: “From the beginning of my life, I have always devoted my body and soul to the State of Israel but primarily to Tsahal, but now to Magav … I do this neither for my advertisement, nor for my career, nor anything at all … I always gave for the State of Israel, for Tsahal, Magav, and for Migdal. Believe me, that’s the miracle of Israel.” Born in December 1938 in Constantine, Algeria, Macias’s birth name is Gaston Ghrenassia. He is a songwriter and musician who left Algeria with his wife in July 1961 to live in France.

Rabat – The medical journal Prescrire has published its 2019 black list of medicines that are “more dangerous than useful” and that should be avoided due to their “excessive health risks.”

The articles lists 93 drugs the journal deems to have “an unfavorable benefit-risk balance in all clinical situations for which they are authorized,” says Prescrire.

On the list is Toplexil, a drug marketed since the 1950s to treat coughing; Detractyl, a muscle relaxant; and Cimetidine, an anti-allergy medication used for stomach disorders. Treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease, skin disease, allergies, muscle aches, coughing and colds, stomach aches, psychiatric diseases, gynecological disorders, eye problems, and nicotine addiction are on the list.

The Mieux Prescrire Association, which publishes the journal, is a French subscriber-funded non-profit. It is “independent from the influences of firms and organizations in charge of managing healthcare systems.”

Rabat – In order for Morocco to reduce its budget deficit this year, the government plans to privatize its stake in public companies. Although the government adopted several tax reforms for 2019, they will not generate enough revenue to maintain Morocco’s current deficit to GDP ratio. In its recent report about Morocco’s economy, Fitch Solutions, a unit of Fitch Group, forecast an increase in public wage spending and noted that the government allocated more money to social sectors, primarily education and health, in the 2019 Finance Bill. Spending is expected to grow this year, mainly on public wages and capital projects. However, the report also anticipates rapid growth in revenue which will “rely on the successful privatisation of state assets.” The 2019 budget ‘relies on’ selling Maroc Telecom shares To achieve its revenue targets, the government needs to make at least MAD 5 billion in the sale of its 30 percent stake in Maroc Telecom, Morocco’s largest telecommunications operator. In an interview with Morocco World News, Fitch Country Risk Analyst Axel Dalman said that the revenue target “can likely be met by a partial sale of Maroc Telecom given its high valuation and the government’s large stake.” The sale, according to Dalman, needs to go through before the end of this year “to avoid ballooning fiscal deficit.” “In the absence of the expected privatisation proceeds, and without proportional spending restraint, we would see … the fiscal deficit rise to 3.9% of GDP in 2019,” reads Fitch Solutions’s report. The move will also give “a good signal to foreign investors about the government’s fiscal reform willingness,” Dalman said. Fitch Solutions forecast the fiscal deficit at 3.4 percent of GDP in 2019 and 3.3 percent in 2020. The 2019 Finance Bill, according to Dalman, “is realistic in the sense that it envisions a very gradually declining fiscal deficit.” Privatizations, he continued, “are often counted as below-the-line items and not as ordinary inflows (such as taxes), so the pressure on the government to pull its asset sales off is rather high.” The government believes it will generate MAD 2 billion in 2019-2020 from a 2.5 percent corporate income tax on companies with annual profits exceeding MAD 40 million. It also hopes to take in an estimated MAD 1.2 billion in 2019 from taxes on tobacco consumption. When asked about other companies Morocco might privatize, Dalman replied: “We don’t expect any other privatisations will be necessary in 2019” since a Maroc Telecom sale would meet the government’s revenue target. However, the government will likely consider privatizing other companies in 2020. Morocco’s ONCF and ONDA may be next Dalman mentioned the intention of former Moroccan economy minister Mohamed Boussaid to restructure some state-owned companies, such as the National Airports Office (ONDA) and the National Railway Office (ONCF). “That seems to be less prioritised by the current minister Benchaaboun in the short term, but is likely part of a longer-term fiscal strategy,” the financial analyst said. The sale of ONDA and ONCF, explained Dalman, “will probably be longer and more complicated” since the government would want to ensure they do not cause “lower investment levels into public transport infrastructure or higher ticket prices for domestic consumers.” In October last year, the Moroccan Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun declared that Morocco would privatize some public companies to help reduce the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019. Privatizing, according to Benchaaboun, would improve the governance of public companies and increase state resources.  Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi announced in November 2018 that the government approved Draft Law 39-89 permitting the privatization of public institutions and had decided to sell La Mamounia Hotel in Marrakech. Morocco planned to sell its 51-percent stake in the hotel this year, according to Bloomberg. La Mamounia’s value is expected to be more than MAD 3 billion. On February 20, 2001, Morocco sold 35 percent of Maroc Telecom’s shares to French mass media company Vivendi. In November 2004, Vivendi acquired an additional 16 percent of the shares. Three years later, the French company bought 2 percent more of Maroc Telecom, increasing its ownership from 51 to 53 percent.

Rabat – Morocco’s Islamist ruling party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), received backlash after MP Amina Maelainine removed her hijab while on a trip in Paris. Pictures of Maelainine, who typically wears a hijab, emerged on social media weeks ago, showing her without a hijab. She received criticism from other PJD members, public figures, and her followers. After an initial denial, saying the pictures were doctored, Maelainine acknowledged the authenticity of the widely-circulated pictures. Now, it is the PJD Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid criticizing Maelainine. Ramid said that people voted for Maelainine because, wearing a hijab, she presented herself in a certain way that reflected several values. “Therefore, she has no right to remove her veil once abroad.” The MP quickly responded to the remarks.  In a Facebook post, Maelainine wrote, “The decision to wear the veil, now or in the future, is a private matter. It has nothing to do with the party. This does not fall under the conditions of membership or contracts with activists.” Commenting on Ramid saying she was hypocritical, the MP said that she only has one face. “This is what has made my positions unchanged since I joined the party when I was student.  She added that changing her attitudes might have saved her from what she has experienced, including defamation, slander, and diligence. Maelainine received especially harsh criticism from Moroccan lawyer Lahbib Haji, who attacked her after she claimed the pictures were faked. Lahbib said that he knew the pictures were not “fake” because they reflected PJD’s culture of deceit and “fraud.”  “Your party knows this with certainty, which means that it adopts this type of fraud,” he commented.

Rabat – The social media giant Facebook announced last week that it had identified and taken down hundreds of fake accounts linked to Iran which were disseminating Iran-friendly narratives to shape political discourse in a number of countries, especially in the Middle East and South Asia. Facebook announced on January 31, “Today we removed multiple Pages, groups and accounts that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook and Instagram. This activity was directed from Iran, in some cases repurposing Iranian state media content, and engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior targeting people across the world, although more heavily in the Middle East and South Asia.” The accounts users concealed their identities to “mislead” online followers and spread discourses in tune with the Iranian regime. Facebook said it has so far taken down 783 pages, groups, and accounts, all of which were engaging in generating and disseminating fake news.  Countries targeted included Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, US, and Yemen. The practice is not recent as Facebook found that some of the accounts date back to 2010. While operating in a context specific manner, with group admins taking on local names based on the targeted country, the overarching goal was to generate news and commentaries on society and current world affairs. Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cyber security policy, said that the accounts’ most recurring narrative “included commentary that repurposed Iranian state media’s reporting on topics like Israel-Palestine relations and the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, including the role of the US, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.” While Facebook said it is still working to detect and remove similar “inauthentic behaviors,” what the social media giant has found so far indicates that the groups were actively participating in the public debate of the country they targeted.  They had a robust online following. Of the activity detected so far, 262 pages, 356 accounts, and 3 groups operated on Facebook, while 162 accounts focused on sharing pictures on Instagram. Most worryingly perhaps, according to Facebook, “about 2 million accounts followed at least one of these pages, about 1,600 accounts joined at least one of these groups, and more than 254,000 accounts followed at least one of these Instagram accounts.” In addition to disseminating information on world affairs, the suspicious pages also sent out notifications for eight events. The first of these events was scheduled for May 2014 and the most recent for May 2018. However, Facebook said they “cannot confirm whether any of these events actually occurred.” Asked at a press conference on Thursday afternoon whether the Iranian regime was behind the accounts, Gleicher said there is no clear indication at this moment that Tehran sponsored the activities.  “We’re not in a position to directly assert who the actor is in this case,” he offered. “We’re asserting what we can prove.” The news comes just five months after Facebook detected over 600 fake accounts also linked to Iran and working to spread similar narratives in French, Hebrew, Arabic, and English, to influence politics in countries traditionally believed to be Tehran’s strategic or ideological foes. Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the so-called Russiagate in the 2016 US elections revealed some of the perils of the digital age, especially the enormous potential of social media to influence political behavior, Facebook and other tech giants have vowed to adopt more draconian measures to cthwart “coordinated inauthentic behaviors.” And while Facebook’s investigation has yet to find conclusive evidence linking Tehran to the fake accounts, the Iranian regime is infamous for exporting its ideology to other countries. In May 2018, Morocco severed diplomatic ties with Iran. While Rabat cited Tehran’s “military and logistic” support for the Polisario Front, some analysts, referring to Iran’s well-documented attempts to export Shi’a Islam to countries like Morocco, remained convinced that the rift between the two countries also had some elements of ideological divergence. “Make no mistakes: Iran’s problems with Morocco are ideological,” Pentagon official Michael Rubin wrote in an op-ed after Morocco gave Iran the cold shoulder.

Rabat – Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is seeking re-election for his fifth term in this year’s presidential election. During a press conference on Saturday, Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia announced his belief that Bouteflika will run for a fifth term in the April 18 election. Ouyahia said that Bouteflika remains “the best candidate.” Two other candidates will run for election, including former Prime Minister Ali Benflis and Major General Ali Ghediri. The opposition party, Rally for Culture and Democracy, is opposing Bouteflika’s re-election. The Punch quoted RCD spokesperson Yassine Aissiouane as saying, “There will be no election but an appointment of the head of state.” Several analysts and journalists recommended Bouteflika withdraw from the presidential election, questioning his ability to lead. Some have also accused the Algerian regime of maneuvers to make Bouteflika’s campaign successful. In 2018, the Algerian government sacked several top military officers for alleged corruption. Several analysts said that the purge of military officers was a clearing of the way for Bouteflika’s candidacy. In September 2018, the Alternative News Agency of Argentina published an op-ed by Adalberto Agozino who analyzed the political earthquake in Algeria’s military. Agozino interpreted Algeria’s sacking of military officers as a means to “steal” the next election and questioned Bouteflika’s ability to fulfill a fifth term. Former French Ambassador to Algeria Bernard Bajolet also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead. He said that Bouteflika is being kept alive “artificially.”

Rabat – Two more people in Morocco have died from H1N1, raising the total number of deaths to 11. According to the Ministry of Health, the ongoing “epidemiological situation remains normal compared with the previous season.” The ministry said that an analysis carried out on 684 samples of people with influenza or severe acute respiratory infections showed the virus in 160 samples. “For cases in public and private health facilities, the Ministry found that out of a total of 58 people who tested positive for H1N1, 15 patients were cured, while 32 patients are still receiving treatment.” The 11 people who died all had at least one factor of vulnerability, including pregnancy, chronic disease, and age. Symptoms of H1N1 include a sore throat, fever, a stuffy and runny nose, headaches, body aches, and continuous fatigue. People with such symptoms are advised to stay home, get treatment, and cover their nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing. People who have a weakened immune system or chronic illness, including diabetes or heart conditions, should see a doctor if they begin to experience any flu symptoms. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said today that all facilities are mobilized to treat the virus. El Othmani also visited Ibn Sina Hospital in Rabat on Sunday to stress the importance of high vigilance by health sector employees to combat the virus. He added that the virus does not “require a sense of panic” because it is not unusual or greatly different from previous years. He also advised citizens to visit a health facility if they begin to experience symptoms. Several Moroccan media reported that 20 children are being treated for H1N1 in Casablanca’s Ibn Roshd Hospital. The regional health directorate for the Casablanca-Settat region issued a statement to reassure citizens that the situation of H1N1 is normal and stable. “Cases identified so far should not cause concern, because they are either cured or under treatment,”  said the statement. A Moroccan doctor in Canada, OumKaltoum Harati, told Morocco World News that H1N1 is “highly contagious and might in some cases lead to complications, like what we call pneumonia (pulmonary infection), respiratory failure, worsening of heart diseases and asthma.” A Moroccan Ph.D. researcher in airborne-transmitted infections at the University of Amsterdam, Charifa Zemouri, also told MWN that the virus needs to be handled by preventive measures, like vaccination, ventilating houses and workspaces to dilute the air from virus particles, and refreshing the air constantly.

Rabat – Police in Cape Verde said on Friday that they seized 9.5 tons of cocaine and arrested 11 people on a Russian vessel. The vessel, which was traveling from Panama to Tangier port, docked at the Praia port following the death of a crew member. Police then found dozens of packages of cocaine wrapped in plastic and cloth sacks on board the vessel. Moroccan authorities also continue to crack down on international drug networks. On December 8, 2018, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) seized one ton of cocaine and arrested seven individuals linked to a Colombian criminal network smuggling cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. In the same month, the BCIJ seized a boat loaded with cocaine in El Jadida, near Casablanca.

Rabat – The Casablanca-Settat regional health directorate issued a statement aiming to reassure citizens about the recent cases of H1N1 in the region. The press release said that the situation of H1N1 in the Casablanca-Settat region is “stable” and “normal.” “Cases identified so far should not cause concern, because they are either cured or under treatment,” read the statement. The regional office added that infections of this type of virus “are recorded each year during this season by the national system of epidemiological vigilance and  control, as is the case in other countries across the world.” According to the statement, the directorate is setting up an awareness campaign for health workers, as well as in schools in the region. Yesterday, Minister of Health Anas Doukkali said that H1N1 had killed 9 people in Morocco. He added that the situation remains normal compared to previous years. Of the 80 percent of patients with flu-like illnesses or respiratory tract infections, 20 percent have H1N1 flu, according to Doukkali. Like the government, a Moroccan Ph.D. researcher of airborne-transmitted infections at the University of Amsterdam, Charifa Zemouri, agreed that the “pandemic always results in the deaths of those who are immuno-compromised such as the elderly, those with cancer or HIV, and children.” Zemouri told Morocco World News that “unlike a bacteria, viral diseases are not treated with medicine which could be an equivalent of antibiotics.” She added that influenza can be treated without medicine if people give the “body a chance to wipe it way.” The researcher, however, acknowledged that people need to take preventive measures to avoid contamination, including getting the flu shot prior to flu season. A Moroccan doctor in Canada, OumKaltoum Harati, also spoke with Morocco World News regarding H1N1. She said that the “symptoms differ from a person to another. Common symptoms are fatigue, chills, cough, and sore throat, sometimes red and runny eyes, sometimes runny nose, and diarrhea, fever.” She added that H1N1 is “highly contagious and might in some cases lead to complications, like what we call pneumonia (pulmonary infection), respiratory failure, worsening of heart diseases and asthma, as well as having neurological problems such as confusion, in rare cases seizures.” The dominant H1N1 subtype does not exceed 80 percent, which is the rate set by the World Health Organization, the minister of health said on Saturday. The minister, who emphasized that Morocco has launched a campaign against the virus, added that the Drugs Directorate and the Supply Division are working to provide all hospitals and health centers with the necessary medicines. Doukkali saidthat medical teams are constantly mobilized in rural areas within the framework of the RIAYA operation, which covers 28 provinces. Zemouri said, “It’s never too late  to launch a campaign against the flu. It’s urgent to do so and I agree with the government.” “Based on epidemiological data we know when the flu season starts. So now the government will set up a campaign, run the pilot, test the efficacy of the campaign and then improve it and put it in place prior to the next outbreak,” she added. The cases of H1N1 in Morocco caused concerns among Moroccans, who also criticized the Ministry of Health and the minister for describing the H1N1 outbreak as normal. “Regarding the Moroccan minister of health, the reason he could not give such clear answers is because the journalists themselves ask questions which have nothing to do with the ongoing epidemic,” Zemouri told MWN. The Moroccan government launched an awareness campaign to advise people of what to do to avoid the virus. People with flu symptoms should stay home, get treatment, and cover their nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing. The unaffected public should also take general precautions like using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if using public restrooms, washing hands thoroughly and frequently, and avoiding contact with people who have flu symptoms. Zemouri also shared with MWN a set of measures people should take to avoid being infected, “such as ventilating their houses and workspaces to dilute the air from virus particles, refresh the air constantly.” Moroccan Gvernment Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi  said the seasonal outbreak had a late start this year. The epidemic reached its peak during the week from January  7 to 13.

Rabat – In addition to the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) responded to Ahmed Zefzafi’s comments regarding the health of his son, the prominent leader of the Hirak Rif movement, Nasser Zefzafi. On Saturday, DGAPR said that Zefzazi has received medical care since his imprisonment and he received several medical tests that showed that his health was fine. The statement added that the first medical tests showed no signs of torture. Up to this point, according to DGAPR, Zefzafi has received 42 medical tests and 11 others at the University Hospital Center of Ibn Rochd (CHU). The detainee also received 25 biological tests and 11 X-rays. According to the office, a medical test carried out in March 2018 showed a cerebral angioma, of which the detainee was informed by a medical report. Another medical test carried out in January 2019 confirmed the same problem. Zefzafi’s father, however, said in a Facebook post that it was only on January 26, 2019, that the prison administration told Zefzafi that “MRI tests for the past year revealed he had an arterial contraction on the right side of the head.”  Denying the allegations, DPAGR said that the X-ray was performed on Zefzafi in January 2019, and “contrary to his father’s comments, it was taken by an external hospital that requested additional examinations without specifying a particular institution to perform them.” The statement added that Zefzafi’s father is spreading “slander against the medical team responsible for monitoring the health status of the detainee.” The office added that the prison directorate did not refuse to grant a certificate or a medical report to the detainee but declined to give a copy of the medical file to his relatives because it is against the law. Zefzafi and three other Hirak activists received 20-year prison sentences in June 2018. Zefzafi was charged with inciting activists in the Al Hoceima province to participate in unauthorized demonstrations and with undermining the stability of the county.

Rabat – Morocco’s Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan flew to Saint Louis Royal Chapel in Dreux, northern France, to represent King Mohammed VI at the funeral of Count of Paris Henri d’Orleans. The crown prince, wearing a white djellaba and a traditional Moroccan cape, took his place in the front row alongside Queen Sofia of Spain and Prince Albert of Monaco. King Mohammed VI’s advisor, Fouad Ali El Himma, and Morocco’s Ambassador to France Chakib Benmoussa accompanied the prince. Henri d’Orleans, who died on Monday at the age of 85, was a descendant of the last king of France, Louis-Philippe I, who ruled from 1830 to 1848. It is not the first time the prince caught the world’s attention in France. In November 2018, photographers at the Armistice Day Commemoration in France captured the elegantly dressed Moroccan prince in a classy black suit and again in a black Moroccan cape.  The 15-year-old prince also accompanied King Mohammed VI to the One Planet Summit in France. His participation in international events was welcomed by international officials, including Emmanuel Macron, who warmly received him at the Elysee Palace.

Rabat – A documentary on Western Sahara, aired on Saudi-owned Television Al-Arabiya, has put forth pro-Polisario claims, putting Saudi Arabia’s Moroccan ally in an uncomfortable position regarding its Western Sahara claims. While refraining from overtly espousing a number of pro-Polisario concepts like “occupation” or “colonization,” the historical time frame presented in the show unequivocally buttressed the claim that Morocco “invaded” and “occupied” Western Sahara when Spain left the territories. Al-Arabiya added insults to injury, however. In addition to its pro-separatist historical timeline, the documentary’s narrative suggested that the international community recognizes the Polisario Front, the separatist group claiming independence for the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), as “the legitimate representative of the Sahrawis.” Morocco and Saudi Arabia are historically strategic allies, with especially strong bonds between the two royal families. But the recent months have seen a pattern of gradual decline of warmth in relations that the two kingdoms used to enjoy. For all the pedigree of the increasingly complicated diplomatic ties between Rabat and Riyadh, Morocco’s position of “constructive neutrality” in the ongoing spat between the Saudi-led group—Egypt, Bahrain, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—and Qatar may be the main reason for the sustained tension, observers have suggested. The suggestion was reinforced in a recent wide-ranging interview that Morocco’s foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita gave to Qatar-owned Al Jazeera. Speaking to Al Jazeera journalist Jalal Chahda on the Bila Houdoud (Without Borders) program, Bourita gave a wide-ranging view of Morocco’s diplomacy, touching on the kingdom’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis. “If the parties so wish, the Kingdom of Morocco is ready to offer its services to foster a frank and comprehensive dialogue,” Morocco said in the wake of the crisis in July 2017. Bourita reiterated Morocco’s belief in “Muslim solidarity,” calling the now defunct Gulf Cooperation Council “the only point of light in the Arab world.” As Al-Arabiya, which considers itself to be a counterbalance to Al Jazeera, aired its Western Sahara missile barely a week after Bourita’s interview, it is safe to assume that Morocco’s refusal to pick sides in the Gulf crisis, or more precisely Morocco’s refusal to side with the Saudi-led blockade against Qatar, has still not been swallowed in Riyadh. In the weeks before June 13, 2018, Saudi Arabia actively lobbied in favor of the US-led North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. The June vote followed a number of anti-Moroccan sentiments from Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of the Saudi General Sports Authority. The episode ignited strong feelings in Morocco, with many Moroccans calling on the government to revise its diplomatic stance vis-a-vis Riyadh. Other events pointed to the “historical lie” that pan-Arabism has always been. But while the gradual rift received considerable news coverage, both countries have been careful enough not to openly attack each other on highly important issues. Morocco has been especially diplomatic even when declining to cater to Saudi demands that did not dovetail with its interests. “If relationships are measured by different schedules, this trivializes the relationship,” Bourita said in his Al-Jazeera interview. Bourita was explaining why Morocco, which was initially part of Crown Prince MBS’s infamous world tour, finally removed itself from the Saudi prince’s itinerary. However, in response to Al-Arabiya’s documentary, many have suggested that Morocco’s diplomatic attitude towards Riyadh’s undiplomatic moves will have to change sooner rather than later. The documentary, one report contended, is a “violation of the historical friendship” between Saudi Arabia and Morocco. The point is that while Moroccans have come to expect mild anti-Moroccan sentiments from some quarters in Riyadh, an overt attack on Morocco’s territorial integrity cannot be put in the same basket as other occasional mood swings or miscommunication from the likes of Al-Sheikh. In his Al-Jazeera interview, Bourita said that Morocco’s sovereignty over its southern territories is non-negotiable. Bourita’s firmness on that occasion was reminiscent of his statements when Morocco severed ties with Iran, which it accused of “militarily and logistically” helping Polisario through its Hezbollah proxy. Most recently, on January 29, Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale said that Morocco is unfailingly adamant when it comes to its territorial integrity. “That’s the top. That’s the bottom. That’s everything, and within the sovereignty of Morocco…. Outside autonomy, nothing,” the Moroccan diplomat said of the ongoing UN-led talks on Western Sahara. He pointed out that the 2007 Autonomy Plan, which grants local Sahrawis the “largest operative power” under Moroccan sovereignty, is the furthest Morocco could concede. And, like Bourita, Hilale went on to argue Morocco’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and non-negotiable. But now that a Saudi-owned channel has crossed what Rabat considers a red line, how will Rabat respond? As narratives hostile to Moroccan interests continue to flourish in Saudi public discourse, it remains to be seen whether this time Rabat will at least formally notify Riyadh that there are some things that Morocco does not tolerate.

Rabat – The Ministry of Health stated that the H1N1 epidemiological situation in Morocco, which killed nine people this week, is so far “normal” compared to previous years. It is, however, worth taking preventive measures against the highly contagious virus, which is the dominant influenza subtype this year.  As defined by the World Health Organization, “Influenza A (H1N1) is similar to seasonal influenza but has been characterized by higher activity during the northern summer season, higher fatality rates among healthy young adults and higher incidence of viral pneumonia.” H1N1 outbreaks tend to occur in fall and winter all over the world, with several peaks during the winter flu season.  Symptoms of H1N1 include fever, sore throat, a stuffy and runny nose, chills, headaches, body aches, and continuous fatigue. Children under the age of two, elderly people with pre-existing diseases, and pregnant women are most susceptible to the virus. The types of virus transmission, according to the WHO, are: Respiratory transmission, which occurs “mainly by droplets disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes”; short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses, which occurs particularly in crowded enclosed spaces; and hand contamination or direct inoculation of the virus. Getting the H1N1 vaccine is the first step to take as a precaution against the virus. Following news of the deaths from H1N1, the Moroccan Ministry of Health emphasized the important role of vaccination in curbing the spread of the virus. Other preventive measures include regular precautions against the flu: Wash hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after touching any object, avoid crowded spaces, use disposable tissues when coughing or sneezing, and most importantly, avoid direct contact with ill people. During an H1N1 seasonal outbreak, people should also avoid travelling to affected places.

Rabat – Since the popular referendum on Brexit, the impending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the government of Theresa May has been entrusted with negotiating Britain’s pullout from EU. The task has been torturous and painful. The long and bitter bickering with Europe has, somewhat, opened the eyes of the British people to the disastrous future outcome of such a divorce politically and economically. They have, as such, come to the bitter conclusion that they will, no doubt, lose so much in this undertaking for so little gain, if any, in the end.  Britain is a big island, an insular but mighty and civilized nation. Its empire ruled the world, like no other, to the extent that “the sun never set” on it. Its flag fluttered proudly in distant lands and its ships sailed all seas and oceans discovering new territories and colonizing known continents, but Britain, all the while, remained insular. Even in its language, insularity is so strong and highly meaningful. For the British, people who come from overseas are known as aliens, even if they are next door neighbors, Europeans. When I went to study in England in the 1970s, I was shocked to be called an alien when I registered at the police station. For me, rightly or wrongly,  an alien was a hideous creature from outer space, brutal and shapeless like in the 1979 science fiction cult film “Alien.” The word overseas has a strong connotation, too. If you are coming from another country, you are an overseas individual because Britain is surrounded by water. The word “ferry” and the word “ship” are both strong lexical items in this country; everything is ferried out or into the country. If Britain became a big colonial power, it is mainly thanks to its navy. The British navy merchant or military has been everywhere over the globe, discovering them, trading with their people, or colonizing the land. Actually the only time insularity lost some of its meaning, strength, and attraction was when the Britons joined the European Common Market on January 1, 1973. But since they have shown so much reticence towards the Brussels bureaucracy and held onto their strong concept of sovereignty with both hands. They fought any transfer, no matter how small, of their sovereignty to the central European bureaucracy. They refused the 1985 Schengen Agreement establishing external European borders and abolishing internal borders which became effective on March 26, 1995. The United Kingdom also did not join the eurozone which became effective on January 1, 2002. On June 23, 2016, the citizens of the UK and Gibraltar voted to leave the EU. The referendum counted in 51.9 percent of voters in favor of leaving the European community. Although the referendum was not legally binding, the government had promised to implement the result. The following spring, the government initiated the official EU withdrawal process on March 29, 2017, which put the UK on course to leave the EU by March 30, 2019, after a period of Brexit negotiations. On January 15, 2019, the British Parliament rejected Theresa May’s negotiated deal with the EU for Brexit, and it seems that a growing number of ministers around the cabinet table are coming to the conclusion that a second referendum is now required, more than ever. However, the question is, is another plebiscite feasible now, and would it mean the political debacle of the Tories’ political domination? In the speech she gave following the results of the parliamentary vote, May told the opposition that they could put forward a vote of no confidence. They did so, but it failed in the house. Now May must come up with a Plan B for the nation. But will the plan be accepted by Brussels to start another around of lengthy and difficult negotiations? Nevertheless, for the time being, there does not seem to be a Plan B. What there is is only the initial plan with a few amendments to please dissenting Tories and the opposition. May announced that she will keep the House of Commons aware of any developments on Brexit and will initiate serious talks on the subject with economic actors, trade unions, and civil society. She also told the Labor party that she would safeguard the right of employment and protect the environment. She further announced that European nationals residing in the UK would not have to pay the £65 pounds required to live in the country. May was banking on renegotiating the accord with the EU, but European officials dashed her hopes by declaring that such a thing was not possible. On the question of the “safety net,” the European chief negotiator Michel Barnier has declared to the Irish television station RTE that the measure had been settled with the British government and the actual agreement is the last they will make for the time being. He wondered why Europe should renegotiate: Does the UK want the EU to be the bigger loser? In the House of Commons, many MPs have announced their willingness to make amendments to delay Brexit to avoid a “no deal” agreement which May is contemplating, according to the BBC. The Labor party, on the other hand, is considering putting forward an amendment on the Custom Union and is calling upon MPs to consider the possibility of a new referendum on a plan that must be devised, discussed and voted by the House of Commons. Other amendments, in the making, will ask May to delay the enactment of the Brexit accord. It seems that many members of the government are threatening to quit if conservative MPs are not allowed the possibility to vote for a plan disallowing Brexit without an agreement and, as such, push the date forward. In the light of this turmoil and cacophony, Queen Elizabeth II, aged 92, used the annual meeting of the West Newton chapter of the Women’s Institute last week to call on British MPs to find a middle ground and reach a compromise on Brexit. The Queen coming out of her traditional political silence means that “something is rotten” in the Kingdom, as the great Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet. May has stated her opposition to a new referendum that will, according to her, threaten social cohesion. She emphasized that her duty as a prime minister is to see through the first referendum. However, British public opinion seems to favor another referendum. According to a study YouGov undertook in January, 56 percent of surveyed Britons would choose to stay in the EU if they had a chance to vote again. Even Nigel Farage, a leading political figure of the Brexit campaign in 2016, thinks that there could possibly be another referendum, and the “Remain” group are preparing for this possibility. Over 170 personalities from the Business community have made a public call for a new referendum. They fear dire economic consequences in the case of a bad deal or a no-deal Brexit. For Tony Blair, a former prime minister, a second referendum is the only way possible to end the debate. Will a second referendum ever take place? Only time will show.

Rabar – In the midst of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease on Moroccan farms, the National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) has decided to grant financial compensation for farmers who lost their cattle to the disease, starting this month. The amount of financial compensation may vary depending on the age and breed of the affected animals in relation to their market value. ONSSA announced on Friday that it was conducting a vaccination campaign among susceptible animals across Morocco. So far, the disease has broken out in the provinces of Fquih Ben Saleh, Khouribga, Sidi Bennour, Tangier, and Kelaat Sraghna. ONSSA’s veterinary services launched their January 2019 plan against the disease, vaccinating more than 500,000 cattle, 17 percent of the cattle in Morocco, ONSSA said in a statement on Friday. FMD is an infectious and fatal viral disease that only impacts cloven-hooved animals, such as cows, goats, sheep, and pigs. Contrary to rumors, it does not affect the health of humans, as the head of ONSSA’s veterinary services, Farid El Amraoui, clarified yesterday.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Health Anas Doukkali announced Saturday that the H1N1 influenza has killed four more people. Doukkali said today in a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the outbreak is “normal” compared to previous years. The flu’s first victim was a pregnant woman, 34, who died on Monday in Casablanca and whose baby, delivered by emergency caesarean, also died. The ministry did not confirm whether H1N1 also caused the baby’s death. On Thursday evening, a second death was reported.  At Thursday’s weekly government press conference, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi announced that only two people had died of the flu, the pregnant woman and a 68-year-old woman who had other chronic diseases. The Ministry of Health announced Thursday night that five people had died of H1N1 in both public and private health facilities.  Following the news of the H1N1 outbreak, Moroccans expressed concern about their health. To prevent panic, the ministry said earlier this week that seasonal cases of H1N1 are “normal,” reassuring Moroccans that the epidemiological situation is stable. Symptoms of H1N1 include fever, sore throat, a stuffy and runny nose, headaches, body aches, and continuous fatigue. People with such symptoms are advised to stay home, get treatment, and cover their nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing. The H1N1 virus emerged in 2009 in the US. “Influenza A (H1N1) is similar to seasonal influenza but has been characterized by higher activity during the northern summer season, higher fatality rates among healthy young adults and higher incidence of viral pneumonia,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Rabat – After audio recordings from Moroccans warning about foot and mouth disease (FMD) went viral on social media, the National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) announced on Friday that it was carrying out a vaccination campaign among susceptible animals across Morocco. As the viral recordings warned Moroccans from purchasing or consuming beef for fear of the spread of the epidemic among people, the head of ONSSA’s veterinary services, Farid El Amraoui, stressed that FMD “does not affect humans” and poses no threat to their health. El Amraoui explained: “People may play a role in the spread of the virus (among cloven-hooved animals) by moving from an animal farm affected by the virus to another farm.” The virus can live on the surface of farmers’ clothes. Read also: ONSSA Slaughters Entire Herds to Stamp out Foot-and-Mouth Disease Throughout the past two weeks, ONSSA’s veterinary services launched their January 2019 plan against the disease, vaccinating more than 500,000 cattle, 17 percent of the cattle in Morocco, ONSSA said in its Friday statement.  Animals in certain regions are more likely to contract FMD. So far, the disease has broken out in the provinces of Fquih Ben Saleh, Khouribga, Sidi Bennour, Tangier, and Kelaat Sraghna. ONSSA has concentrated its vaccination campaign in the affected regions. Forty-five 45 percent of cattle have been vaccinated in Khouribga province, 43 percent in Fquih Ben Saleh, and 30 percent in Sidi Bennour province. ONSSA is currently carrying out cleaning and disinfection operations on affected farms and putting down all animals affected by the disease. FMD is an infectious and fatal viral disease that only impacts cloven-hooved animals, such as cows, goats, sheep, and pigs. The virus causes a high fever that goes on for days and inflicts blisters inside the mouths and on the hooves of susceptible animals. FMD first appeared in Morocco in 2015. Morocco has ever since launched vaccination campaigns against the disease.

By Charles Catania While municipal and regional governments across the globe grapple with the high societal burden of crypto mining, one startup is offering a new path forward.  Instead of taxing local resources where electricity is inexpensive, Soluna, a blockchain company backed by private financing, is turning the tables.  Soluna is breaking ground with its own power supply, building computing centers supplied with 100 percent renewable energy. To accomplish this goal, the company plans to develop a 900-megawatt wind farm in Dakhla in southern Morocco to power its computing operations. According to Reuters, the project will begin this year and take five years to complete. Later, the company may connect the farm to the national electric grid. While the total cost is expected to be more than $1.4 billion, the company is investing just $100 million in the initial phase, which is anticipated to generate 36 megawatts of power. The plan is to vertically integrate the blockchain ecosystem, using internally-owned electricity to power blockchain operations.  To do this, the company acquired 37,000 acres of land zoned as a Class I wind site, indicating that it has an average wind speed of at least 22 miles per hour, according to the company’s website. Additionally, Soluna plans to invest in the local community, recruiting and training local talent and “partnering with colleges and trade schools to employ the top technologists of tomorrow.” According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin operations, collectively, consume more electricity than the entire country of Peru. On the local level, this has inspired controversy in areas where electricity costs are low. Soluna’s wind project, in contrast, will aid the Moroccan government in its goal to power the country with 52 percent of its electricity from renewable sources.  For a long time, my colleagues and I at Modulus have been saying that the blockchain economy offers more than meets the eye. In order to make innovation work for everybody, both innovators and host communities, we can no longer view the problem through a traditional lens.  It is not enough to slice up a static pie. Instead, we must look for ways to expand the size of the pie and do it sustainably. If Soluna finds success in its initial phase, look for more blockchain companies to begin to vertically integrate their operations, bringing an additional net positive to the communities in which they are headquartered.

Rabat – Qatar surprises Japan with a deserved 3-1 win Asian cup final, making history as it prepares to host the 2022 World Cup. If there is one message to get from Qatar’s impeccable performance at this year’s Asian cup, it is this: come 2022, the underdog gulf country will be hoping to be counted not as a glamorous host country with a toothless football squad, but rather as a host with a winning team that has  proved itself in major tournaments.… There was, as has been case with tale Qatar’s display impeccable at this tournament, pace, width, and aggression in the first half. While the pace and width was Japan’s, the aggression was Qatar’s.  Japan may not have made the miracle of the 2018 World Cup when they honorably lost 3-2 against Belgium. But many of us still remember the Blue Samurais as the revelation of the latest world cup, showing glimpses of great and exquisite football capable of achieving the kind of victory that eluded them in Russia 2018. Japan was good, as usual. With an unswerving faith in their attacking philosophy, the Samurai evinced depth and tactical brilliance, mainly mastering the middle field and operating through beautiful one-two passes to try and unseat Qatar’s defensive citadel that registered no single goal until this phase of the tournament. But try as Japan did, there just seemed to be an inescapable sense of purpose to Qatar’s play. Sometimes, dominance and superiority make one blind to obvious weaknesses. And Qatar was quick, through a succession of rapid transitions down the flanks, to exploit the intermittent errors of Japan’s attack-minded play. The effect was quick to come by as Qatar slowly grew into a math they may have entered with most suspicion and reserve than they had in previous outings.  At the 12 minute, Almoez Ali, feeling that the onus to was his breathe some fresh into his mates was, thumped in  Qatar’s and the game’s first goal. By resorting to direct play to unnerve Japan’s otherwise formidable team, Qatar went again and again to threaten and impose pace and grace. That resulted in a second goal barely a quarter of hour after the first. Receiving a lovely earth-bound ball, midfielder Abdulaziz Hatem attempted a magnificently curled ball from distance, trumping Shuichi Gonda, the Japanese keeper. At 2-0 down against a side that had succeeded to keep clean sheets in all their previous outings here in the UAE, Japan knew this could be it for them. But the Samurai’st first reaction was to attack even more, showing belief that perhaps a miracle was possible.  In the second half, the Japanese squad pushed indefatigably, spiritedly looking for a goal that could revamp their aspirations of continental championship.  Meanwhile, Qatar waited, tactically counting on rapid transitions and the counterattacking prowess of the Qatari youthful squad to hammer home a third goal, a final straw to smash Japanese hopes. With a 60 percent ball possession, it hard to say that Japan was utterly dominant, but the energy and the will was there. If anything, the first 15 minutes of the second half registered no major eventful occurrence, with both sides putting in their best to thwart transitions. By the time the clock read 60 minutes, Japan seemed rejuvenated. In a moment of inspiration fifteen minutes before the final whistle, forward Takumi Minamino sliced up a brilliant ball over the Qatari goalie. That goal, the first that Qatar conceded at the tournament, changed the dynamics of the game. At 2-1 ten minutes before full time, the question was no longer whether Qatar could end the tournament without conceding any goal. Rather, the question now was if the Gulf country could resist the regained buoyancy of a Japanese squad that kept coming for an equalizer. But those sour minutes did not last long, at least from Qatar’s perspective, as a 83 rd minute penalty ensured a 3-1 victory by full time, giving Qatar the undisputed upper hand in the final of a tournament where most people would have written them off.  Who can now say that this team does not have what it takes to pass the group phase at the World Cup they will host in 2022?

Rabat – Saudi analyst and author Abdelhameed El Ghabin has received backlash on social media after making pro-Israeli statements. The Saudi public figure told I24News in January that there are not many Palestinians in Saudi Arabia and Saudis refuse to deal with them. He said Saudis would prefer to work with Israelis instead. El Ghabin added that his country wants peace and stability, but some “Palestinian parties don’t want peace, like Hamas.” He said that in his opinion, after 20 years, “there will be overall peace” between Arab countries and Israel.
 El Ghabin noted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit several Arab capitals this year and next year. He argued that all Arab countries have been “ruined” because of the Palestinian cause, including Iraq and Syria, Libya, and even Lebanon. “Should we make 500,000,000 Arabs homeless for 7 million Palestinians who reject all solutions?” he questioned. He also asked Palestinians to stop insulting Saudi leaders. “If you do not stop, you will not find even one Arab child to sympathize with you.” After the controversial remarks, El Ghabin appeared in another interview with RT Online to repeat his pro-Israeli statements. “I am ready to visit Israel now as a friendly country,” he said.  “I am telling Israelis to prepare hotels and expand their airports from now on. All the people who oppose them are the first to visit Israel, and in the near future you will not find a hotel [room] or airplane [ticket] … because they will all be booked.”

Rabat – More than 2,000 soldiers representing 30 African and Western partner countries will participate in Exercise Flintlock 2019, the biggest integrated African-hosted military and law enforcement training in Africa and the US. The exercise will take place in several locations in Burkina Faso and  Mauritania. Sixteen African countries will participate, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mali, and Mauritania. The US, Japan, and thirteen European countries will also join the exercises. Flintlock has been “U.S. Africa Command’s premier and largest annual Special Operations Forces exercise,” since 2005, said the US military’s Africa Command. It seeks to “strengthen the ability of key partner nations” in combating violent extremist organizations, protecting their borders, and providing security for their people. The exercise is also an opportunity for African and Western nations to collaborate on a multinational level for the shared goal of countering terrorism. Morocco is resolute in its fight against terrorism. The 2018 Global Terrorism Index deemed the country safer than Algeria, the US, and France. Morocco ranked the 132nd most dangerous country for terrorism out of 163, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. The report showcases that Morocco has two strategies to deal with foreign fighter returnees: Deradicalization programs and imprisonment. The country founded a policy that allowed law enforcement to apprehend returnees for investigation and put them in custody in 2015.

Rabat – The minister of general affairs, Lahcen Daoudi, said a “cap mechanism is to come” in a video shared on the website of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) on Wednesday.

Daoudi, who said last year that the government would monitor fuel prices for a year, noted that the decision would come into effect “between the end of February and mid-March.”

The minister pointed out that the Competition Council, the Moroccan authority responsible for combating anti-competitive practices, would have to examine the government’s “request on fuel prices on 14 February.” 
Last week, the Moroccan Workers’ Union (UMT) raised concerns that fuel prices are rising due to lobbying, speculation, and monopolies. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi responded that price fluctuations result from price freedom and competition.  Gasoline and diesel prices in Morocco during 2018 remained high until mid-December, according to Global Petrol Prices. Between October 1, 2018 and January 7, 2019, the average gasoline price per liter in Morocco was MAD 11.05. The lowest price, MAD 10.21, was recorded on December 17 and the highest price, MAD 11.46, on October 1. However, Morocco’s average price of gasoline has been lower than the average world price of MAD 14.57 per liter during the same period.

Rabat – The 15 members of the Security Council issued a press statement after holding a meeting on the Western Sahara conflict on January 29. In the statement issued by Council President Jose Singer Weisinger, the members reiterated their support for the UN-led political process and the efforts of the Secretary-General’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler, who is committed to convening the parties involved in the conflict for a second time in March. The statement said that the council members welcome “the Personal Envoy’s briefing and stand ready to continue to support the Personal Envoy in the fulfilment of his mandate.” The statement also recalled Resolution 2440, which called on all parties to work constructively with the envoy to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to end the conflict. “In line with resolution 2440 (2018), the members of the Security Council welcomed the participation of Morocco, the Frente Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania in an initial round-table discussion on 5 and 6 December 2018.” The Security Council also confirmed that Kohler will convene the parties in another roundtable of talks in the first quarter of 2019. The council “voiced support for their ongoing and constructive engagement with the Personal Envoy.” The statement of the Security Council further explained the importance of the involvement of all parties in the talks to resolve the conflict. Kohler is set to meet with senior officials from all the parties to discuss the date for the second roundtable. Ahead of the meeting, the Moroccan government announced its firm position that its Autonomy Plan is all it can offer for the conflict. Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, Omar Hilale, said that Morocco is ready to negotiate but only within the framework of its Autonomy Plan, introduced to the UN in 2007. “That is everything, and within the sovereignty of Morocco,” Hilale added.

Rabat – The 25-year old Spanish-Swiss suspect arrested in Morocco in December 2018 in connection to the double murder of two Scandinavian women, Kevin Zoller Guervos, will appear before the investigating judge on Monday. The suspect’s lawyer, Saad Sahly, told AFP on Friday that Monday’s hearing will be more “detailed” than the preliminary hearing. The hearing will “last for a long time, with more detailed questions.” Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested Guervos on December 28, in addition to at least 21 other suspects. Gema, the suspect’s mother, said that all allegations against her son are a “lie.” The head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame, said that Guervos was not directly involved in the murder, but he knew the primary suspects. The dual national is believed to have trained some of the other arrested suspects to shoot, according to BCIJ. Guervos also recruited sub-Saharans with whom he planned to join ISIS in northern Mali. Guervos was in contact with ISIS members in Syria through Telegram messaging The suspect was also planning to undermine Morocco’s stability by targeting security services and tourists when he was radicalized. Authorities found the decapitated bodies of Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian tourist Maren Ueland near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains on December 17.

Rabat – Facebook announced on Thursday that it had removed 783 pages, accounts, and groups on both Facebook and Instagram that day. The accounts were linked to “inauthentic behavior” targeting people in 26 countries, including Morocco. In an attempt to conceal their identities as Iranian operators, the page owners represented themselves as locals from various countries to “repurpose” Iranian state media reports on issues like Israel-Palestine relations; the conflicts in Syria and Yemen; and the role of the US, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.   The page administrators spent about $30,000 on advertisements on Facebook and Instagram accounts to “manipulate” others perceptions of political events. “There were multiple sets of activity, each localized for a specific country or region, including Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, US, and Yemen,” according to a press release from Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy. Facebook’s manual review identified the accounts as coming from Iran. In addition to 8 events hosted by the suspicious accounts, there were about 2 million Facebook users who followed at least one of the pages, 1,600 users who joined one of the groups, and more than 254,000 users who followed at least one of the Instagram accounts. Facebook could not confirm whether the events took place.  “We are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don’t want our services to be used to manipulate people… We’re taking down these Pages, groups and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they post,” Gleicher said. Morocco and Iran have not had diplomatic relations since Morocco cut ties with Iran in May 2018. Morocco argued that Iran gave financial and military support to the Polisario Front through its proxy, Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party and militant group. It was not the first time that Rabat severed ties with Tehran. In 2009, Morocco broke ties with Iran after the Persian country threatened Bahrain’s territorial integrity and was spreading Shiism in Morocco, which saw it as interference in its domestic affairs. Although the two countries resumed their bilateral relations five years after the first rupture, in 2014, but relations between them continued to be shaky.

Rabat – Moroccan Government Spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi appeared to discredit the news reported by the Moroccan media a week ago about a planned visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Morocco.

“I will not respond to rumors,” El Khalfi told a press conference following the weekly Government Council in Rabat on Thursday. Israeli media outlets shared rumors that Netanyahu would visit Morocco in March or April. Activists have demanded Morocco refuse his visit.

Responding to a call by the Moroccan Anti-Normalization Observatory, dozens of activists took part in a protest against the normalization of relations with Israel in front of Parliament on Monday. The observatory said in a statement on Sunday that the purpose of the visit was to announce a US-proposed solution to the Sahara crisis.  The secretary general of the observatory, Aziz Hanawi, told Morocco World News that those promoting a visit by Netanyahu to Morocco are trying to “convince us that it is a matter of mediation on the Sahara issue.” 
Moroccan newspapers announced that Netanyahu would come for the inauguration of the Attia Synagogue, or “Slat Attia,” in Essaouira. In previous statements, the Moroccan government denied “any official, political or commercial ties with Israel.”

“The visit would take place around March 30, right after a visit to the African country by Pope Francis,” the Times of Israel reported last week.   Israeli news outlets claimed that Morocco hopes to use diplomatic overtures with Israel to bargain for US government support on the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – After launching an online campaign to draw attention to the kidnapping of Polisario member Ahmed El Khalil, some Sahrawis took to the desert in Rabouni, where the Secretariat of the Polisario Front is located to condemn his disappearance. Several Sahrawis chanted and carried banners to condemn his disappearance under suspicious circumstances. Among the slogans protestors chanted were: “Where are human rights?” and “No alternative to determining the fate of Ahmed El Khalil.” The protest is not the first of its kind. Several activists created a Facebook page to raise awareness about the fate of El Khalil, who was arrested and kidnapped under unknown circumstances in 2009. El Khalil is considered a renowned scholar of the Tindouf camps, where he briefly served as a human rights official in 2009. A few months after his appointment to the post by Polisario, the separatist group arrested him. Some Sahrawis believe that El Khalil died in prison. Former Polisario member Mustapha Salma Ould Mouloud said that Algerian intelligence forcibly imprisoned El Khalil for more than 10 years. El Khalil was born in Tan-Tan, in the region of Guelmim-Oued Noun in southwestern Morocco. He then moved to Fez to finish his high school studies, and he also gained a degree in philosophy from the Department of Social Psychology at Mohammed V University in Rabat. El Khalil joined the first group of young Sahrawis in southern Morocco who called for the liberation of the Sahara from Spanish colonizers after finishing his bachelor’s. He then decided to join Polisario in the Tindouf camps in Algeria in 1977. Now, the family and friends of El Khalil are launching a campaign to call on Algeria and Polisario to announce the fate of the kidnapped activist. In addition to protests for El Khalil, Rabouni saw a yellow vest movement from Sahrawis who denounced Algeria’s policy to restrict freedom of movement in the camps. “We have been obliged to stay in Tindouf for one month,” one protester fumed. He complained that in most cases, people like him who were visiting from Europe only had two or three weeks of vacation time and needed to return to their jobs in Europe.

By Amal El Attaq Morocco and Italy signed a partnership agreement on January 25 in Marrakech to organize the export of snails to Italy and to implement projects for breeding, valuing, and transporting snails. The partners say the projects will create more job opportunities. The agreement includes snail research and training centers in Marrakech to benefit from Italian experience in the sector. The Regional Center for Investment in Marrakech-Safi; the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Services in Marrakech-Safi; the Professional Federation of Snail Breeding in Morocco; the International Snail Institute of Shirasco; and the National Snail Breeding Society of Italy all came together for the agreement. “This partnership aims to develop emerging markets for Moroccan production towards Italy, and to exchange experiences between Morocco and Italy on the snail sector,” said Nadia Ibrahimi, president of the Professional Federation of Breeding Snails in Morocco. Talking to the press, she added that the agreement would implement joint technology development projects that meet international standards. Barbara Bregato, the Italian ambassador to Morocco, said that “Italy has an international experience in snails breeding, and is willing to develop Morocco’s experience in this sector.” She pointed out that Italy views Morocco as a gateway to African markets. Morocco produces more than 15,000 tons of snails per year, collected from nature, and exports 85 percent of its snails, mostly to Spain. On international markets, snails cost €3-5 per kilo. Snail breeding farms can produce 10 tons per hectare in one production cycle. The molluscs are in high demand in Europe. Snails’ physical and chemical properties benefit human health, and they are also commonly used in cosmetics and health care.

Rabat – Marrakech’s Court of First Instance has sentenced an American man to four years in prison for raping  minors and married women and filming the acts in Chichaoua, near Marrakech. The criminal used a house that belonged to his cousin, an American immigrant living in the city of Chichaoua in the Marrakech-Safi region, to rape and film his victims. The American cousin who owned the house filed a complaint against the rapist in March, accusing him of occupying it without his consent. When searching the house, police found a memory card with videos of rape, Moroccan newspaper Al Akhbar reported Thursday. The American was on the run for 15 days before he handed himself in to the police after Moroccan police issued a national arrest warrant to find him. In another widely-publicized case of edophelia, a 60-year old man attempted to rape a child in October in a public hammam (sauna) in Fez. A group of men in the hammam caught him and confronted him for trying to rape the child, filming a video to expose his actions, which soon went viral. Fez’s Court of Appeals sentenced the man to five years in prison on October 9, although the boy’s father reportedly dropped the charges.

Rabat – A deadly H1N1 outbreak has killed at least five people in Morocco, announced the Ministry of Health yesterday. The flu’s first victim was a pregnant woman who died earlier this week in Casablanca. Until Thursday evening, only two deaths were reported. In the weekly government press conference Thursday afternoon, journalists expressed concerns over the outbreak of the H1N1 flu. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi told the press that only two deaths were reported: A pregnant woman, 34, and a 68-year-old woman who had other chronic diseases. Thursday night, however, the Ministry of Health announced that five people had died of H1N1 in public and private health facilities. Minister of Health Anas Doukkali said that the H1N1 flu is the “dominant subtype this year, like all countries in the world.” He added that the ministry is still “maintaining an epidemiological watch.” Doukkali also reassured the public that the situation is not exceptional and called on Morocans not to panic. The director of Pasteur Institute in Morocco, Abderrahman Maaroufi, also reassured Moroccan citizens that cases of the flu in Morocco is common and normal, and the situation is not concerning at all.  Ali Lotfi, the chairman of the Moroccan Network for the Defense of Health Rights,  argued that it is not really normal to have five deaths. Lotfi wrote on his Facebook, “We have five deaths already … is it perfectly normal?!”  “Tomorrow, the same director will tell us that scorpion bites do not require serum against venom in the summer,” he said. Lotfi explained that the disease is “highly contagious and easily spread.” Lotfi added that the Ministry of Health should have mobilized counter influenza medicines. He said that 98 percent of the cases could be cured if the medicines were offered in the first 48 hours after diagnosis. “This is what did not happen,” Lotfi said about the deaths in Casablanca and Fez. After the death of the 34-year-old pregnant woman in Casablanca, her husband  criticized the “negligence” and belated intervention of doctors to treat his wife. He also condemned the ministry’s initiative to “reassure” people while his son was fighting for life, saying: “I lost my wife because of other people’s mistakes and now I am losing my son.” The baby, whom doctors delivered via emergency caesarean section, also died, but it is unclear whether he died because of H1N1. The government is certain that the situation is under control. Like Doukkali and Maaroufi, El Khalfi also reassured the press that the health department is taking measures to counter the virus. According to El Khalfi,  the seasonal outbreak had a late start this year: Curing the week from December 17 to 23, 2018. The epidemic reached its peak during the week from January  7 to 13. He also warned citizens to take precautions and emphasized the importance of vaccination, which is key to preventing the spread and contraction of the virus. Doukkali informed the weekly government council on Thursday that his ministry has put in place a communication plan with the media to raise awareness about influenza, which is not unusual. Doukkali said that the measure is only to warn citizens of prevention measures and how to react if they get the flu. According to the minister, an analysis of 541 samples from flu victims found that the epidemiological situation is similar to that recorded internationally. Symptoms of H1N1 include fever, sore throat, a stuffy and runny nose, headaches, body aches, and continuous fatigue. People with such symptoms should stay home, get treatment, and cover their nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing. The unaffected public should also take general precautions like using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if using public restrooms, washing hands thoroughly and frequently, and avoiding contact with people who have flu symptoms. If people have a weakened immune system or chronic illness, including diabetes or heart conditions, they should see a doctor if they begin to experience any flu symptoms. The H1N1 virus was first discovered in April 2009 in California. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the illness a pandemic in June 2009. The virus killed 575,400 people in that year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
