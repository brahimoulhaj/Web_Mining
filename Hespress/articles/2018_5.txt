By Dana Leger Rabat – The US Department of State (DOS) released its International Religious Freedom Report for 2017 on Tuesday. The report found that Morocco has made strides to promote religious tolerance and moderation since 2016, but there are still instances of minority faiths facing societal pressure.  The US government estimates that Morocco’s population of 34 million is comprised of more than 99 percent Sunni Muslims, less than 0.1 percent Shia Muslim, and less than 1 percent combined of Christians, Jews, and Bahais.  The kingdom’s constitution states that citizens are guaranteed freedom of thought, expression, and assembly as well as the freedom to “practice his religious affairs.” At the same time, the constitution prohibits undermining the Islamic faith or persuading a Muslim to convert to a different religion. Both the constitution and the law governing the media prohibit any individual from criticizing Islam on public platforms, such as in print, online media, or public speeches. Such acts are punishable by two years imprisonment and a fine of MAD 200,000.  Among the most prominent steps Morocco has taken towards religious tolerance includes opening a dialogue between Rabat and Rome in order to bridge the divide between Muslims and Christians, for which an agreement was signed in May of 2017 with the Vatican Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.  Plans were made for a symposium to be held every two years, alternating between the two respective cities, in order to address issues such as “hate speech, extremism and violence, and the exploitation of religion for political ends.” Accordingly, King Mohammed VI recently extended an invitation for Pope Francis to visit Morocco, which will be the first time a pope has visited the kingdom in 33 years.  In an effort to preserve the kingdom’s religious and cultural heritage and in a symbol of tolerance, the monarchy has also continued support for the restoration of synagogues and Jewish cemeteries throughout the country.  Conversely, a number of Christian, Bahai, and Shia Muslims reported feeling pressured by society, the local culture, and their families. According to the State Department, it is common for members of minority religions to conceal their faith from friends and family in fear of being criticized or becoming a target of violent extremist acts.  Specifically, Christians and Shia Muslims described fear of government harassment for practicing religious meetings in public; therefore many opted to hold such meetings privately in members’ homes.  The State Department reported that the government has at times detained and questioned Christian citizens about their beliefs, a number of whom stated that authorities pressured converts to renounce their faith.  In December 2016, the media reported that authorities in Casablanca prevented a group of local Christians from obtaining legal permission to hold a public gathering for Christmas.  In May of 2017, Spanish media reported Morocco’s minister of endowments and Islamic affairs “used the term ‘virus’ when referring to Christians and Shia Muslims in the country.” In a follow-up, the minister explained that he meant that the people of his country were “immunized” and resilient because of Sunni Islam, and that he was not insinuating that any religious practice or belief was a virus.  The report listed one case of some passersby attacking a Christian European teenage girl of Moroccan heritage for drinking juice in public during Ramadan in 2017. During Ramadan in 2016, one man in Marrakech and another in Rabat were attacked by other civilians for smoking cigarettes during fasting hours. Media also reported that during the same time, authorities arrested two men in Zagora for drinking water in public during fasting hours, and at least three people were arrested in Rabat for smoking cigarettes.  The content of sermons in mosques, Islamic religious education, and the dissemination of Islamic religious material by the broadcast media is guided and monitored by the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (MEIA) in efforts to combat violent extremism and open the door for tolerance and moderation. Authorities also introduced new religious textbooks following a review of the content with the aim to remove extremist or intolerant references. The government has also restricted the distribution of non-Islamic religious materials and those it deems inconsistent with the Maliki-Ashari school of Sunni Islam. According to the State Department report, all publicly funded educational institutions are required by law to teach Sunni Islam in accordance with the traditions of the Maliki-Ashari school of Islam. Foreign-run and private schools have the option to teach Sunni Islam or to not include religious instruction within their curriculum. Private Jewish schools are permitted to teach Judaism.

Rabat – The Atlas Lions did not score in their first pre-World Cup game against Ukraine (0-0) on Thursday night in Geneva. Two weeks before the kick-off of the World Cup in Russia, Hervé Renard’s team failed to score against the Ukrainian team, despite their cohesive play and thefew opportunities created by Hakim Ziyech and Nordin Amrabt. On social media, public opinion regarding the faceoff was divided. Some were convinced by the Atlas Lion’s presentation, praising Hakim Ziyech and Mehdi Benatia, while others criticizedsome players’ performances, including that of Hamza Mendyl and Younès Belhanda. The next Atlas Lions friendly game is scheduled to take place June 4 against Slovakia in Switzerland, followed by a third match against the Estonian national team on their home turf on June 9, six days before Morocco’s first World Cup match against Iran on June 15.

Rabat – The Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and Royal Air Maroc (RAM) have set up a program of flights between Casablanca, Tangiers, Oujda, Marrakech and the cities of Saint Petersburg, Moscow and Kaliningrad, allowing supporters to fly to Russia to support the Atlas Lions in the 2018 World Cup. In a joint statement, RAM, the FRMF, and the Ministry of Youth and Sports indicate that in order to allow supporters to travel to Russia to encourage the national team, Royal Air Maroc will mobilize 13 aircraft to allow nearly 2,500 passengers to attend the competition. According to the same source, these additional flights will be specially programmed to allow the fans to attend the match and return home after the end of the tournament at the subsidized fixed price of MAD 5,000. The offer, exclusively for match ticket holders, went on sale on Tuesday, May 29, through the commercial agencies of the company and through the network of travel agencies. This program comes in addition to the initial offer presented by Royal Air Maroc last January, which covers approximately 3,000 tickets to Moscow and St. Petersburg, particularly the Russian capital, the statement said.

Rabat – The 3000-meter steeplechase world vice-champion, Moroccan Soufiane El Bakkali, was prevented last week from going to the United States to take part in the Eugene Diamond League. The US diplomat who refused to issue the visa has offered some explanations. “Around the world, some visa applications may require additional administrative processing that can lead to delays. The time required to perform this additional administrative treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each case,” he explained to TelQuel via email from the American Embassy in Rabat. Essentially, the denial is due to the increasingly complicated procedures for obtaining US visas imposed by the Trump administration.. Contacted by Morocco World News, the US Embassy has explained that a P-1 visa is required for anyone traveling to the US temporarily to perform in a specific athletic competition as an athlete, individually, or as part of a group or team, at an internationally recognized level of performance.  Despite a letter of invitation and promise of the special  P-1 procedure from the organizers, the athlete has still not received his passport. El Bakkali unfortunately missed the Diamond League competition, which took place May 26 in Eugene, Oregon, USA. However, Moroccan athlete Rabab El Arafi was able to compete in the 1500 meter race. She finished in fourth place, with a time of 3 minutes and 59 seconds, recording the second best women’s performance in Moroccan history. Meanwhile, El Bakkali has competed in multiple other international sporting events. In 2016, he qualified for the men’s 3,000-meter steeplechase final at the Rio Olympics and placed fourth after a personal best of 8:14:35 minutes. A year later, the sportsman won a silver medal at the IAAF London 2017 World Championship. El Bakkali claimed second place behind Kenyan Conseslus Kipruto in the 3,000-meter steeplechase race. The 22-year old Moroccan is one of several promising athletes that Morocco has pinned for greatness and  gold on the world stage.

By Jamal Laoud Washington D.C – Four-peat is what the NBA is offering in the 2018 Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers facing the Golden State Warriors.  The talk is, what is the likelihood that LeBron James, Cavaliers’ main man and the best player in the NBA today, would pull this off and win a fourth Championship? The consensus, highly unlikely! It is not hard to understand that argument. While Cleveland has LeBron, the Warriors are loaded with superstars like Kevin Durant and the Steph Curry. Instead of getting into what each one of these two can do and bring to the table, I think it is best to mention some of their accomplishments, and let you imagine what it would take to get that done.   Durant’s has won the 2017 NBA Championship and Finals MVP, and has four scoring titles to-date, just to name some of his accolades. All of this under LeBron’s nose.  Steph Curry has the 2015 and 2017 NBA Championships and the MVP honors under his belt. Add to that a scoring title in 2016, under LeBron’s nose as well. His most impressive accomplishment may well be his influence on the game. Steph is a notoriously great three-point shooter. So much so that he and his teammate, Klay Thompson, another potent three-point shooter, are nicknamed The Splash Brothers. Furthermore, The Steph Effect was coined to acknowledge Curry’s impact on the NBA. Thanks to him, more NBA and College teams are taking three-point shots today than any other time before.   I cannot not mention other Warriors, most notably Klay Thomspon, the still injured Andre Iguodala, and the Scottie Pippen of the Warrios Draymon Green.  I am already doing them injustice by not elaborating on their contributions and accomplishments. Suffice it to mention that this team set the record for the best team record of the regular season, previously held by Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls, of 73 and 9! The three previous championships went like this, Warriors, Cavaliers, Warriors. Noteworthy that Kevin Durant was not featured until the third championship.  Getting back to LeBron, his main challenge is lack of serious help. So much so that Saturday Night Live did a skit mocking his teammates, and boiling them down to personal assistants who fetch towels and drinks for him. The perception was embarrassing.  Many also argue that LeBron’s road to the Finals this year was easy, given that he faced no major experienced opponent, and no other major star. The championship he has won against the Warriors was made possible partly by Kyrie Irving who has since left for the Boston Celtics. Kyrie has taken the load off LeBron James many times during that series, and allowed him to take breaks and relieved some of the pressure from him.     Furthermore, he had serious help during the three previous three championship he has won. The first and second championships, he enjoy much support from two superstars Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. The third one, the impact Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving had is undeniable.  And no, I am not beating up on LeBron. He is an amazing player and is the best player in the world today. What I am saying though is that this is an opportunity for him to curtail the GOAT talk significantly. He can seriously impact the LeBron vs. Jordan debate, and sway many doubters, like myself, to his camp. No one is seriously giving him a chance. It is James against the world!

Rabat – Donald Trump has kept up with a Kardashian. The Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian meeting has caused much ink flow. The reality television star has met with the president of the United States to “advise him about prison reform,” according to several media outlets. However, people were not happy to see Kanye West’s wife at the White House and harshly criticized the unexpected meeting. As usual, Trump went on Twitter where he shares his daily thoughts and activities. “Great meeting with Kim Kardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing,” he wrote, sharing a picture of him with the star of “Keeping up with the Kardashians” in the Oval Office.  The one-hour gathering, set up by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, gave Kardashian a chance to talk with the president about a campaign to pardon a nonviolent drug offender named Alice Marie Johnson. American tabloids and social media users were not as happy as Trump to see Kardashian in the White House. According to most of them the Kim had no business meeting with the president of the United States. The New York Post, for example, did not hesitate to make puns based on the celebrity’s body, referencing President Trump’s meeting scheduled with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  “The other big ass summit”, headlined the New York Post, a double reference to Kim Kardashian’s body and the summit with North Korea. “Trump meets rump”continued the New York Post, and in a final comment inspired by the young mother’s physique, “Kim Thong Un.” Social media users seem to agree with the media. “Trump has tweeted to say that he and Kim Kardashian talked about sentencing. Next week he’ll be asking the cast of Jersey Shore [reality television show] about punctuation.” “When rich person turned reality TV star Kim Kardashian is meeting with reality TV star turned president Donald Trump to talk prison reform, safe to say the GOP has completed its hollowing-out of American intellectualism and successfully undermined expertise and experience,” wrote American feminist and attorney Jill Filipovic.    Even Moroccans had something to say. “Awesome, next time he will ask Said Naciri about cinema and music,” wrote a Moroccan Twitter user, referencing Said Naciri’s widely mocked “Malhama” musical  tribute to the Atlas Lions.

Rabat- Morocco’s price index of industrial production decreased by 0.2 percent in April 2018, according to a report by the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (HCP). With the exception of oil refining, the price index of industrial production declined by 0.2 percent in April, compared to March when it increased by 0.1 percent, said HCP, which manages economic, demographic, and social statistics. The decline in prices extended to the food industry by 0.3 percent,  the clothing industry by 0.5 percent, pulp and paper industries by 0.8 percent, metallurgy by 1.2 percent, and non-metallic mineral products by 0.6 percent. In March 2018, prices of metallurgy increased by 0.7 percent, pulp and paper industries by 1.0 percent, and clothing and textile prices rose to 0.4 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, some industries saw a price increase in April: textile manufacturing by 0.7 percent, leather and shoe products by 0.2 percent, and cork and wood products by 1.2 percent. In contrast, wood and cork production prices each rose by 0.4 percent in March, according to the same source. Prices of extractive industries, electric power, and water distribution experienced no change since January, still amounting to MAD 115.3 per kilowatt for electricity, and MAD 119.0 per kiloliter for water. In a recent report, HCP revealed an increase in the prices of fuel, meat, fruit, and vegetables in April, as the consumer price index (CPI) climbed 0.3 percent, after rising by just 0.1 percent in March. Due to the increased demand for fish in Ramadan, some consumers have said fish prices increased in May. As a result, calls for a fish boycott echoed in the country, in addition to the ongoing boycott of three prominent Moroccan companies.

Rabat – The Saudi government set the record for the most expensive home ever purchased in the Washington D.C. region last week, with its acquisition of the Steve Case estate, “Merrywood.” Case, co-founder of AOL, sold the “Merrywood” residence to the embassy of Saudi Arabia for USD 43 million, breaking the region’s residence sale records, the buyer’s representative told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. The final price tag nearly doubled Case’s original purchasing price in 2005, at USD 24.5 million. The sprawling 2,100-square meter residence features nine bedrooms, a study, indoor and outdoor pools, changing rooms, a gym, a tennis court, gardens, a wine cellar, a 4-car carriage house, staff rooms, and a security office.  Situated on 2.8 hectares of land, the expansive estate holds an equally significant place in the American, and indirectly, Saudi history. Built in 1911, the property was purchased mid-century by the heir to the Standard Oil fortune, Hugh D. Auchincloss, before he married the mother of former first lady, Jacqueline “Jackie O” Kennedy Onassis. Kennedy Onassis spent her childhood in the Georgian-style estate. Auchincloss’s maternal grandfather, Oliver Burr Jennings, was an original shareholder in Standard Oil, one of the first companies to invest in the exploration of Saudi oil reserves in the 1930s. “Merrywood” will now host Saudi government officials and visiting dignitaries on trips to the US, becoming Saudi Arabia’s third multi-million dollar home purchase—the first two occurring in the early 1990s—on the same Chain Bridge Road. “The Saudi government understands the historical significance of the Merrywood home and has tremendous respect for its place in American history,” reported a spokesperson of the Saudi government, as reported by the WSJ. Accumulating luxury estates in the upscale neighborhoods of Washington, D.C. is not an action exclusive to the Saudi government. In July 2017, the Moroccan government purchased a residence for USD 14 million in Massachusetts Avenue Heights, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the D.C. area.

By Karen Duarte Rabat – Ramadan is the month-long Islamic holiday celebrated each year. During this holy month, tourists visiting Morocco will experience unique Moroccan and Islamic traditions and rituals.  Although Ramadan presents a few challenges to tourists, it is a beautiful time of the year to reflect on the blessings that life has to offer and to understand the suffering of those who go without basic necessities, such as food and water.  If you are visiting Morocco during Ramadan, you will experience distinctive aspects of the culture that are only apparent once a year. Muslims fast from all food and water from dawn until sunset.  When it is time to break the fast you will hear the evening call to prayer, which is announced through a loudspeaker. After a long day fasting, the prayer excites many Muslims as they enjoy iftar (the breaking of the fast) with their family and friends.  After iftar, you will witness rows upon rows of people praying at mosques for the evening prayer, followed by a special prayer that is only recited during Ramadan. Around 11 p.m. or midnight dinner is served.  If you are visiting during the spiritual month of Ramadan, it is impossible not to connect with the unique local foods and traditions.  As days become nights and nights become days, adjusting to the time and eating schedule might be challenging, so you may need a good measure of patience.   Everyone stays up late, and the following day do not expect to find anything open before 10 a.m. as people will sleep in much later than usual.  You might come upon some shops and restaurants that are not open at all during the day. Also, the majority of businesses (banks, supermarkets, and more) will have different store hours, closing early so that the workers can make it home in time for iftar.  Another thing to keep in mind when visiting is that monuments, historical sites, museums, and other tourist attractions might adjust their hours and will most likely close early.  Around 5:30-6:30 p.m. you will find a fast-paced crowd hurrying to prepare for iftar. Everything is quiet by 7:30 p.m. when family and friends are gathering to eat iftar. Then, at 9:30 p.m. restaurants, cafes, and local vendors in the medina (old walled city) begin to open again. Business booms as everyone takes a stroll through the medina to shop and to walk off all the food they ate during iftar.  Most importantly, you should be aware of the time change. While Morocco adopts Daylight Saving Time in the spring, the country moves back to standard time just before Ramadan, so the time changes back to Greenwich Mean Time.  The answer is no. There are a few restaurants and cafes that remain open during the day and expect to serve non-fasting tourists or foreign residents.  It is forbidden for Moroccans to eat and drink in public, unless they have special conditions where they do not need to fast, such as an illness or pregnancy. The rules do not apply to visitors or non-Muslims; however, everyone fasting will greatly appreciate it if you avoid eating in public.  You may consider eating inside a restaurant or wherever you are staying (hotel, airbnb, host family, etc).  Everyone visiting Morocco during Ramadan should experience a traditional Moroccan iftar, which consists of spiced harira soup, Moroccan brochettes, hard-boiled eggs, dates, sweet pastries, batbout (bread), and fresh-squeezed juices.  Being invited to someone’s house for iftar is ideal, because you will experience a traditional iftar with family and friends celebrating an exciting holy month.  Do not worry if you cannot attend iftar at someone’s house. Many restaurants and hotels offer traditional, authentic iftar meals, which will still make a wonderful experience.  During the evening, make sure to stroll by a mosque and witness hundreds of Muslims worshipping together as it is truly a memorable experience. One mosque that you might want to visit is the largest mosque in Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque located in Casablanca.  Lastly, interact with Moroccans you encounter and ask them questions about Ramadan and learn what this holiday means to them.  Ramadan might present challenges to tourists visiting Morocco, but it is also an eye-opening cultural experience that you will not discover elsewhere.  This feature is part of an exclusive series at Morocco World News for Ramadan. Also in the series is:

Rabat – The convergence of communication and computing in smartphones has influenced many aspects of students’ social life. A new research paper from Moulay Ismail University in Meknes has studied the behaviors related to smartphone use. Smartphones are entrenched in students’ daily activities, but their exhaustive use may have problematic repercussions. The study, conducted by Dr. Mohammed Larouz, professor of applied linguistics at the School of Arts and Humanities in Moulay Ismail University of Meknes, and Mohamed Mliless, PhD candidate at the same university, explored problematic use, addiction, and dependency predictors among 254 Moroccan students from the Department of English Studies and 250 students from the National High School of Art and Business (ENSAM) in Meknes. The study investigated students’ attitudes on the effect of smartphones on their overall well-being on multiple levels: the internet content for which the smartphone was used; the length of use in day and night time; and the impact on social and learning outcomes. The study confirmed that “students, who are a multitask community of smartphones users, manipulate the device to access different social networks sites, receive and send calls and texts, play games, share videos, read news, and retrieve scientific documents.” Most of the respondents use social networking sites (SNS) extensively. Constant use of the smartphone to access SNS “augments internet connection and favors access to a big amount of unfiltered and untreated data,” a behavior which may develop into addiction because the technology represents for many respondents a “source of distraction that problematically affects their social relationships.” Additionally, the study investigated the frequency and length of students’ smartphone use. During the day, there were significant differences between departments and gender. The study concluded “students from the English department and females of both departments spend more time on their devices.” The same holds true for night time use. Equally important is the length of time that students spend without smartphones, as a parameter to test students’ dependency on the device. “More than half of the respondents said that one hour is the maximum of time they stop using the tool.” Extensive use of smartphones by Moroccan students could be problematic when it comes to the frequency of use, the time spent, and the internet content viewed. For example, the study comments that “late night use may expose students to sleep disturbance and contributes to the high prevalence of sleep dysfunction since long evening use may fatally increases short sleep duration, promotes later sleep, causes insomnia, postpones sleep, causes lag waking, and potentially affects the psychological and physical well-being.” In regards to the relationship between students’ learning outcomes and smartphones, respondents largely agreed that having a smartphone “does not help them acquire Information Communication Technology related competences, it does not develop their listening and writing skills, and it does not help them with their homework as well.” In addition, users can easily manipulate highly sensitive personal information which makes them “victims of cyberbullying and even easy targets for criminal attacks and behavioral or technological addictions.” On the social level, the researchers acknowledged that the smartphone is a “source of distraction and a means to waste time.” They posit that the device “permits dissemination of fake news, perpetuates immorality, and does not help students build self-confidence.” More importantly, the study claims that the technology “impedes direct social interaction, weakens family ties, favors immorality, and leads to seclusion.” Although the study deals with a very limited community of Moroccan students, it warns that further research is needed to consider “the excessive use of smartphones among a large community of students given the fact that the behaviors of misuse are preponderant among this population.” In light of the results, the study concludes that the social and learning implications of smartphones are linked to excessive use and dependency. The study provides a foundation for future researchers and policy makers to “minimize the threats of the technology and to adjust and contain its problematic impacts on students’ overall well-being.” Constant use of the device, anytime and anywhere, puts students’ personal, social, and learning outcomes at risk.

Marrakech – International migration from sub-Saharan Africa towards Europe and the United States has significantly increased over the past decade. These migration trends, especially towards Europe, directly influence migration patterns to other North African countries.  The specific migration pull and push factors vary depending on each country and individual, but economic reasons remain a primary factor. According to Pew Research Center, in 1990, 40 percent of sub-Saharan African migrants moved for economic reasons, by 2013, this number had increased to 90 percent. In 2015, the UNHCR gathered that over 1 million refugees, displaced people groups, and migrants fled to the EU in order to escape conflict or seek better economic opportunities. This resulted in further militarization of EU borders in attempts to manage what the European Commision called an “unprecedented displacement crisis.” They confirmed that EU’s stricter border control initiatives have lowered the number of irregular migrants (those without legal paperwork) entering and have made “transit countries” more permanent residences for many migrants. The Kingdom of Morocco is one such country. According to Mehdi Lahlou from Istituto Affari Internazionali, an estimated 5,003 irregular migrants in 2010 used the western Mediterranean route, primarily Morocco, to access Europe. In 2014, this number increased to 7,842. The number of illegal entrances into Europe has decreased since 2015 due to these border restrictions, but migration flows to and from Morocco continue. Morocco is seen as being one of the few stable and secure countries in the MENA region. With the EU’s tighter security, it is becoming a destination of both passage and residence for many migrants. Morocco’s long migration history has led to well-established sub-Saharan African migrant communities throughout some of its major cities like Rabat, Casablanca, and Tangier. Germany’s GIZ identified that these established social, religious, and economic networks act as appealing factors for increased settlement in Morocco. Further signs of Morocco’s growing migration mediary role is reflected by Pope Francis’ planned visit to Morocco, next December, for an international migration conference.  However, four years after Morocco implemented its more humanitarian migration policy reform, many migrants and refugees continue to live in clandestine conditions, lack working opportunities, face tension within local communities, and remain unaware of their legal rights under Moroccan law. The students of University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah (USMBA) in Fez diagnosed the need to help the growing number of refugees and asylum seekers and improve the conditions for their societal integration. In this way, they desire to launch a Law Clinic to guide civil society by taking a model already established by Hassan II University’s Faculty of Law, Economics, and Social Sciences in Mohammedia––a program for marginalized families funded by the National Endowment for Democracy. USMBA President Omar Assobhei explained that Fez has become a necessary stop on Morocco’s transportation highways for migrants heading to Tangier, and then potentially Europe. Fez already hosts a large sub-Saharan student population in institutions and higher education, but this increased traffic has created a dire need for legal support for those that fall into precarious situations. University students propose creating a Law Clinic that aims to: 1) provide leaders of civil society organizations (CSOs) with legal skills to better integrate vulnerable migrants; 2) strengthen the capacity of law students’ as well as those of these vulnerable populations through business development and legal practice; and 3) advance community cohesiveness and sustainability. University officials would identify 10 CSOs, 40 law students, and 100 migrants and refugees to participate in joint legal workshops covering new migration policies, integration, and entrepreneurial development. This 1st phase will be followed with specific legal aid given by law students to benefit participating migrants and refugees. The idea is to bring the students, migrants, and the associations together to assess the situation. The members of each group benefit from the participatory workshops they experience together and from hearing differing perspectives regarding problems facing the community. Students gain experience interacting with real people requiring legal aid, associations will be better informed on legal aspects of their work and feel empowered to advocate, and migrants are equipped with legal knowledge and entrepreneurial skills. This Law Clinic’s legal provision will enable more irregular migrants to socially integrate into society, which in turn, will help alleviate tensions between sub-Saharan African and local Moroccan communities. Using the same participatory development method from the first initiative, this Law Clinic will be sufficiently equipped to tackle all legal concerns presented by the community. Due to its adaptable nature to different academic institutions and its tendency to spark community involvement, this symbiotic education and learning model holds positive future benefits for surrounding regions and universities. St. Andrew’s Church in Cairo, Egypt established a similar refugee legal aid program that provides 3,000 refugees annually with everything from referrals, representation, rights advocacy, and education. It is an example that reveals the potential outcomes that can be realized in Morocco. This Law Clinic’s implementation is a solid bridge for fostering intercultural, societal, and economic dialogue essential for perpetuating a harmonious future of coexistence for Morocco’s growing diversity.

Rapat- A new video showing a group of masked men violently assaulting a woman and a van driver in the coastal city of Safi, for allegedly engaging in sexual acts during Ramadan, has circulated on social media. One of the men yelled: “it’s Ramadan, it’s Ramadan” at the woman whose face was covered in tears and blood. The attacking men hid their faces with jackets and pieces of cloth. The woman insisted that she had nothing to do with the driver, except that she had to run an errand and he was driving her. The aggressors refused to listen. “Shame on you,” the driver repeatedly said to the abusers, trying to assist the woman who was panicking and trying to escape the men’s sticks inside the van. Although the driver was also insulted and pushed around, it seems that the men attacked the woman more, causing blood to drip down her face.

Rabat – There have been a lot of big news stories about cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, in the last year.  Currencies that are managed using blockchain technology are becoming more and more widely accepted and known about, and there are certainly more than a few people now wishing they had gotten involved in them earlier! Cryptocurrencies have also started to be traded in a similar way to conventional currencies. In order for cryptocurrencies to become widely adopted, and integrated into economics on a serious level, it would require policymakers to become properly comfortable with the concepts. At present, this isn’t really the case, with even some of the countries that were big early adopters of cryptocurrencies on a popular level like South Korea seeing the potential for things to go badly wrong, and warning the population not to go all in with things like Bitcoin.  Some governments have an even stronger dislike of cryptocurrencies, for instance there has been a long running war between the Federal Bank of China and the Bitcoin industry, and cryptocurrency brokering isn’t legal in every country. This reticence is likely because, as in many other fields, technology has advanced faster than the understanding needed at a policy making level to make good decisions about how to best leverage it. Making economic strategies that include cryptocurrencies is going into untested waters for governments, and this is not something that risk-averse economists would ever advise, even if it does open up some exciting possibilities. However, economics is only managed by governments – it is driven by businesses and consumers, and in many cases, cryptocurrencies have a strong appeal to these. Regulatory issues can, however, make it difficult to launch complex business structures that could really make the most of cryptocurrencies, and this is where the fact that laws and regulations all over the world don’t yet really know how to handle cryptocurrencies causes obstacles.  There is, for example, a lot of potential for groups of nations that trade together a lot but have different currencies, such as Caribbean island nations, to streamline how they do business very significantly by making better use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, because this would cut out all of their local currency conversion headaches when trading. While there is a long-term initiative to do this in the Caribbean, supported by various local banks, technology companies and governments, it is a very complicated thing to implement from a legal point of view and this will mean it will be a long time before the businesses and customers will start to see the benefits of technology that actually already exists. In other countries, governments and businesses are getting involved in the industry itself and creating jobs and boosting their own economies. A good example is Norway, who have something of a boom in cryptocurrency data centres.  However, just because these countries want to build expertise in the growing industry, doesn’t necessarily follow that they would support other types of investment into making cryptocurrencies have a more significant presence in the mechanics of the global economy. As you can see, there are some deep seated and difficult issues that are likely to mean that if cryptocurrencies do ever even begin to become a major economic force, it will take a lot of work to get there.

Rabat – Zidane’s shocking exit has shaken up the football world. This is the end of the road for Zinedine Zidane. The French coach of Real Madrid is leaving the Spanish club after winning three champions leagues, he announced in a press conference on Thursday in Madrid. After two and a half seasons and three Champions Leagues, the iconic football player has made up his mind. “I made the decision not to continue next year as Real Madrid’s coach. I think that the team will continue winning without me,” said Zidane in front of the journalists. “It’s my time to stop. After three years, the club needs changes and other methods of working to evolve. I love this club, but today I need a change,” he added, saying that he already spoke with the captain of Real Madrid, Sergio Ramos. As for Florentino Perez, the president of the Spanish club, he told the media that he tried to convince Zidane to stay but it was “impossible.” Earlier this year, Zidane expressed his wish of leaving the Merengues as he told the press that coaching was “extremely tiring.” The coach became exhausted from the constant pressure posed by the demands of leading the Spanish football club. He is in his third year as coach of the team. “It’s extremely tiring, no doubt about it, and more so at a club like Real Madrid.” The 45-year old Frenchman added that, “of course there will be a moment when there will be changes, but that applies to all of us – the players too. The job takes it out of you but more here than in other places.” Zidane said, “I don’t look at where I might be, only where I am and what I am doing now in the present and I want to finish this season.” He added “The most important thing is to take the job one day at a time.”

Rabat – Mohamed Salah may miss Egypt’s first World Cup game. Injured in the final of the Champions League May 26, Egyptian international football player Mohamed Salah may not be available for three weeks, according to the Egyptian football association (EFA). But Salah’s fans can rest assured that the Liverpool right winger will not miss more than the first game of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, if that. “Salah will be at the World Cup and will not be absent for more than three weeks,” EFA tweeted yesterday. The competition begins June 14, and Egypt’s first game falls on June 15, exactly 21 days after Salah’s injury May 26. EFA President Hani Abo Rida and the association’s doctor met Salah in Spain on Wednesday. The striker of the Reds was there to receive a medical examination.  After the meeting, the news of his three-week unavailability was confirmed. Salah wanted to reassure his fans by himself. “Despite the odds, I am confident that I will be in Russia to make you all proud,” he wrote on Sunday. On Saturday, the football star was sent off the field with a dislocated shoulder he received from Real Madrid’s captain, Sergio Ramos, in the first half of the Champions League final. French sports news outlet L’Equipe went as far as to say the Spanish player committed several “highly controversial actions in the final between Real and Liverpool.” Ramos has been castigated by Egyptian football fans and Liverpool followers. Football fans have launched a petition on Change.org, urging FIFA and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to punish Ramos for forcing Salah out of the Champions League final and nearly removing him from the 2018 World Cup. When the global competition begins, Egypt will face Uruguay on June 15, followed by Russia on June 19, and Saudi Arabia on June 25.

Rabat- Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) has revealed that authorities seized 14 tons of spoiled dates in Marrakech and 795 kilograms of rotten meat in Ain Atiq, near Rabat. Authorities also seized 500 kilograms of perished garlic and 500 kilograms of expired pastry products May 23-24 in the Safi-Marrakech region, thanks to monitoring operations during Ramadan in food markets, according to the ONSSA.  The Al Karam Association, which manages dates and dried fruit in Marrakech, said that the seized dates were meant for animal feed, not for human consumption.  ONSSA added that the association is working to provide refrigerators to store the dried fruit. Similar measures may need to be considered for meat storage in rural souqs or flea markets, as ONSSA also recorded the seizure of approximately 795 kilograms of white meat unfit for human consumption in Ain Atiq. Authorities found the meat stored in an unhealthy environment by an owner who supposedly paid no regard to the impact the meat could have on customers’ health. Dates are widely consumed during Ramadan in Morocco and in other Muslim countries, as people usually break their fast with several dates. While the fruit is high in sugar and calories, they are also a source of various vitamins, minerals and fiber.

Rabat – After calling Moroccans criticizing the “Malhama: Abtal Al Watan” music video as enemies of the nation, Moroccan actor Said Naciri has repeated his now-infamous comments in an interview. This time, however, Naciri labeled critics of his music video “Polisario.” In a phone interview with Moroccan radio station Chada FM, Said Naciri accuses the Polisario Front of being behind the backlash against his music video. “The offenses and insults against the Malhama are from the Polisario. There are fake accounts run by enemies of the kingdom,” said Naciri. He backed his arguments, saying, “It is impossible for a Moroccan to criticize a product that concerns citizenship and patriotism.”  According to Naciri, the low quality of the video is explained by the lack of funding. “The production of a spectacular video requires a 4 to 5 full days of availability from the artists, as well as a large budget.” Since its release on Friday, May 25, the 13-minute music video received wide backlash on social media, with critics characterizing the music, lyrics, and video as lacking creativity.  In his first statements in response to the negative comments on the music video, Naciri labeled people criticizing the song as “enemies of success and enemies of the Moroccan state.” “These people we call reptiles… it should have been enough for them to hear the word ‘king’ [in the song] it should have been enough that they heard the word nation, and saw a large number of artists. Still, they went and called it garbage. Shame,” he said. Malhama aims to show support for Morocco’s 2020 World Cup bid and the Atlas Lions, who will travel to Russia next month to participate in the 2018 World Cup. Participants in the music video include model Leila Haddioui, actor Mohamed El Jem, actress and former Minister of Culture Touria Jabrane. Earlier this week, Naciri told media that his song was “highly” admired during a press conference held to introduce the song in the presence of 150 people. “At first, everyone expressed admiration for the song, but once it was released online, it was attacked.”

Rabat – The General Director of Centrale Danone, Didier Lamblin, has opened up about the consequences of the boycott campaign and the company’s decision to reduce milk orders from Moroccan farmers by 30 percent. “It makes me sad because the situation has damaging consequences for the company and the country,” said the chief executive of the company in an interview with Media24. He added that the company “spared no efforts” to reconcile with customers during the holy month of Ramadan. “Despite the efforts…attacks continue against the quality of our products after all the accusations.” On Monday, Centrale Danone informed its farm partners that they would be purchasing 30 percent less milk due to the consequences of the boycott that has been ongoing for five weeks. Recalling the Centrale Danone letter addressed to the Moroccan farmers on Monday, Lamblin said that company has not “given up” on any of the partners. “We have continued to collect all the milk produced and we pay the same price as before,” he added. An  ‘untenable situation’ The director general of the company confessed that Centrale Danone has failed at all attempted to keep its level of purchase the same. Lamblin said that the company first attempted to use unsold milk products to produce other dairy products, including milk powder and butter. “However, we had an alert in the company, Saturday, May 26, that it has become untenable and that we had to reduce the order.” Defending his company, Lamblin said that Centrale Danone had been planning several projects to serve the interests of small farmers during the early days of the boycott. “I was announcing wonderful things at the Agricultural Show [in Meknes] to help 20,000 of our small products double their income.” He also pledged other projects in concert with the government to “revive the consumption of fresh dairy products.” ‘We cannot share numbers’ When asked about the reasons behind the estimated 30-percent reduction in volume, Lamblin refused to share data with the news source, emphasizing that the information might be announced officially later. However, the chief executive of Centrale Danone did not deny that the impact of the boycott is “very significant” and has led to the adoption of several measures, including stopping all donations to foundations and the freezing investment and recruitment. In addition to the reduction of milk orders, Centrale Danone has also terminated all temporary contracts of less than six months “to cope with the numerous shutdowns of production lines and the reorganization of our truck tours.” ‘People don’t know what the boycott is about’ According to Lamblin, some people are supporting the boycott campaign without knowing what is it about. “What concerns us is when we ask people who boycott why they do so, many say they do not know and they are just supporting the boycott.” Lamblin claimed that Centrale Danone is a “collateral victim of the boycott,” adding that the company has been present for decades in Morocco. He also denied that the company increased prices five years ago “despite difficulties.” Despite the resistance of the boycott, Centrale Danone has refused to meet the demands of consumers and lower its prices. Instead, the company will reduce the milk orders from Moroccan farmers. “There was no attempt to reduce anything or change prices during my time at the head of Centrale Danone,” he said. Moral boycott for Centrale Danone? According to Lamblin, Centrale Danone should make more work to show consumers what the company has done for the country. He further explained that the company understands that boycotters want changes to their  prices and ways of communication, adding that the company “should be more humble and show consumers all the good initiatives Centrale Danone has been taking.” The ongoing boycott, which started on April 20, targets also Sidi Ali mineral water and Afriquia gasoline.

Rabat – “Some goals can take 300,000 years to achieve…”  In its 2026 World Cup bid video, “A brief history of Morocco,” Marocopedia traverses time and space to reveal the key aspects of Morocco’s ancient past and dynamic present that make it the ideal 2026 World Cup host country. As one of the final 30 projects of the #Imagine2026 initiative, the Marocopedia team illustrates Morocco’s ties to antiquity and the present in five “chapters”: prehistory and the earliest humans, the Phoenician and Roman period, the Medieval era, the Colonial period, and modern-day Morocco. History ‘that grooves’ The video opens with gorgeous panoramas of Moroccan mountains, plateaus, caves, and desert, punctuated by a basic drum beat and metal clangs symbolizing early metal tools.  Suddenly, the drum deepens and a strings section sounds ominously as the video cuts to fantastic shots of the remnants of Morocco’s ancient Roman and Phoenician civilizations at Lixus, Banasa, Tamuda, and Volubilis. The beat picks up again and voices mesh with the sounds of a nai flute as the golden age of Islamic history, the medieval period, takes the spotlight. The screen pans in sweeping air shots over douars in the southern provinces, as men and women are seen performing the traditional Ahaydous singing and dancing with drums, tambourines, and chanting.  Traditional music such as “Tamawayt” and “Bendir” pair with the impeccable Islamic geometry of Al-Karaouine—the oldest university in the world—between flashes of the tunneled medina streets of Fez and the class tbouriga, or Fantasia, horse performances. The colonial period begins with a musical halt and cuts to delicate colonial architecture, both in the northern Spanish style of Tetouan and the French style that characterizes the central provinces, including Casablanca and Rabat. This period also highlights Morocco’s religious diversity, as church bells and Christian images fuse with shots of Jewish synagogues and mosques and echoes of the Islamic call to prayer. The present-day begins as the beat drops to a scratching turntable and Tangier’s bustling trade port. Rabat and Casablanca’s unmistakable street art cuts with shots of gnaoua spiritual music concerts and flashes of urban Morocco. Here, the history and culture of the past merge with the exciting development of the present to reveal Morocco’s electric potential to host the football world’s premier tournament. 
In a press release, the Marocopedia team shares that this style is meant to “emphasise the journey of the land and its people through the ages progressing to the vibrant and diverse country that Morocco is today…[with] a musical piece that grooves!” The Team Bringing together cinema, journalism, and audiovisual professionals, the Marocopedia team is committed to the preservation and promotion of Moroccan cultural heritage on the web. After launching in 2015, the Marocopedia website creates and shares compelling high-quality Moroccan content, including mini-documentaries, photography and academic articles. Above all, the Marocopedia team believe that the creation of an online encyclopedia dedicated to the culture is indispensable for the creative and educational development of present and future generations of Moroccans. As for the #Imagine2026 competition, the team shares that they are “both excited and humbled to share the privilege of being among the 10 finalists chosen from this incredible group of talented artists and filmmakers.” “A brief history of Morocco” is ultimately a rare form of collaboration that brings together prominent cultural and institutional actors from around the country: A3 Communication, L’Boulevard Association, The National School of Circus SHEMS’Y, MASEN, SLI PRODUCTION, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture and Communication, and the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water.  Launched by the president of Morocco’s 2026 bid committee, Moulay-Hafid Elalamy, the #Imagine2026 competition is a citizens’ initiative to highlight Moroccan talent and promote the Moroccan World Cup bid.

Rabat – Morocco’s Istiqlal Party, led by former Minister of Economy and Finance Nizar Baraka, has urged the government to rectify the Finance Law for 2018 to overcome the “difficult social and economic situation” the country is currently experiencing. The party presented a set of recommendations at the parliament meeting on Tuesday. The list of recommendations proposed by the party includes the protection of purchasing power, support for employment, and income improvement through social dialogue. Baraka’s coalition called on Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to increase the salaries of employees by MAD 200 starting in July 2018. The party also proposed an increase to the annual income tax-free income from MAD 30,000 to MAD 36,000. The political party demanded the inclusion of an annual tax deduction for private school tuition fees capped at MAD 6,000 per child enrolled. 
The Istiqlal party also criticized the purchasing power in Morocco, proposing a flexible system to calculate internal consumption taxes on the import of hydrocarbons in relation to international prices. According to the party, this strategy seeks to alleviate the impact of increases to international prices on the purchasing power of citizens. The recommendations came in conjunction with the ongoing boycott campaign targeting three companies: Sidi Ali, Afriquia, and Centrale Danone. As head of the Istiqlal Party, Baraka announced his support for the boycott campaign in April, calling on the government to listen to the message underlying the boycott, rather than looking for people behind the campaign. “The important thing is not to know who is behind the campaign, but rather to understand the message conveyed,” he said. The party also introduced a set of measures aimed at improving employment in the country, including the extension of tax and social security exemptions granted to companies created between January 2015 and December 2019. The party added that the government needs to unlock funds to revive regional investment centers and set up new employment opportunities for Moroccans. The party further said that the government needs to provide funding for the implementation of measures related to paid training for graduates in administration and public institutions.

Rabat – Security forces have linked the Marrakech shooting in November 2017 to cocaine dealings between the Dutch mafia and the Le Crème cafe where the shooting occurred. The Le Crème owner, known by the pseudonym “Moss,” allegedly stole 200 kilograms of cocaine, worth billions of dirham, from Dutch mafia members in 2012, Al Massae reported Wednesday. The cafe owner, who owns several other Marrakech cafes and a nightclub in Rotterdam,  was reportedly the target of an extensive family operation tied to an “international drug lord.” Two Dutch nationals—known by Moroccan authorities for previous cases of international drug trafficking, kidnapping, armed robbery, and attempted homicide—carried out the shooting last November but missed their target, killing one medical student and injuring two others. Last week, ten senior officers of the royal gendarmerie across several cities (Larache, Tangiers, Tangier Med, Tetouan, Agadir, Settat, and Marrakech) were arrested for their involvement in an international criminal network linked to the shooting. The robbery suspect and drug trafficker is currently wanted by the Dutch authorities, with a EUR 25,000 reward for any information about his place of residence.

Rabat – The five-member FIFA task force met with Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee and the North American bid committee today in Zurich. The meeting is the last chance for the committees to convince the task force that their bids are viable. During the meeting, the committees answered questions from the FIFA task force. FIFA is set to publish the assessments of the task force in the first week of June. The FIFA task force can eliminate a bid if it scores less than 2 out of 5 points before the FIFA vote, scheduled for June 13. Chairman of the Moroccan committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy said on Tuesday that if task force eliminates Morocco, it should “explain why in a sufficiently convincing way.” The Moroccan committee has pledged to host a tournament with international standards. CEO of the bid committee Hicham El Amrani said that hosting the tournament in Morocco “would be like staging it in Europe,” according to sports news outlet Goal. El Amrani told BBC that Morocco was confident that European countries will support the African bid. “There is confidence from our meetings with member associations across Europe, they understand where we come from,” he said. “They know Moroccan hospitality and vibrancy.” El Amrani has also touted Morocco’s assets, including its proximity to European countries and the fact games would be conveniently played in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). “We’re just a few hours’ flying distance from capital cities across Europe, and the European countries will provide a huge number of fans.” El Amrani’s arguments were present in the Moroccan bid, which was publicly published in March. Morocco’s bid book underscores the importance of football in the North African country. The briefing describes Morocco as a land of football, where the games’ passion “run through every vein” in Morocco. Morocco officially submitted its bid book to FIFA on March 15. The application has received the support of many countries from different corners of the world, including Russia, Serbia, Luxembourg, Botswana, Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, and France.

Rabat- Two Moroccan Christian converts in Rabat are reportedly awaiting the official visit of Pope Francis to Morocco in the coming days to hold their wedding ceremony, followed by protests from Moroccan Christian community before the Parliament. The couple will hold their wedding ceremony at the headquarters of the Moroccan Liberal Party organization in Rabat at the same time as Pope Francis’s arrival in Morocco. The pope’s visit will be the first time a Vatican Pope has come to Morocco in 33 years, after John Paul II visited the country during the late King Hassan II’s rule. According to Moroccan news outlet Hespress, the prospective groom filed a complaint against the city mayor for refusing to grant him a certificate of no impediment or a celibacy certificate which would enable him to marry his pregnant partner. President of the Moroccan Association for Religious Rights and Freedoms Jawad Hamidi said that the association’s Christian committee has approved the marriage of the couple and will organize their Christian wedding rituals, the same source stated. The Christian committee will hold protests near the Parliament coinciding with the Pope’s arrival.Morocco World News contacted the Moroccan Liberal Party organization for comment, but administrators claimed that they had no knowledge whatsoever on the matter. Hamidi did not respond to MWN’s request for comment. There are an estimated 2,000 to 6,000 Christian converts in Morocco, according to statistics from the United States State Department. Though Article 3 of the kingdom’s 2011 constitution dictates the freedom to practice religious rituals, Moroccan converts to religions other than Islam continue to keep a low profile for fear of social judgment or persecution.

Rabat –People during Ramadan are increasingly into building a better shape, as it coincides with the last month of spring, the perfect time to prepare the summer body. The idea of not eating for 4-5 hours is already terrifying for bodybuilders. Fasting for more than 16 hours is like torturing them mentally and physically. Fasting for many hours makes your body dehydrated and out of energy. Food and water are the body’s main sources of energy; without them people feel weak and tired. Bodybuilding and sports in general require a source of energy like food that contains carbohydrates and natural sugars, such as bananas, oat flakes and sweet potatoes. Throughout Ramadan it is nearly impossible to build muscle. Bodybuilders must dedicate the month to maintain muscularity or losing fat. Even after breaking the fast, it is hard to satisfy your body’s need for protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fat in the same way as normal days. Some people believe that eating from sundown until dawn will help them compensate for the long fasting hours. But they are wrong. Medical research says that testosterone, the male hormone responsible for muscle growth, is released in high amounts during sleep. The more you sleep, the more your testosterone increases. There is a debate between bodybuilders on when to train during Ramadan. Some prefer to train right before f’tour, believing that it is better for muscle growth as they go immediately after to feed their bodies. Others believe that training two to three hours after f’tour is more beneficial. Morocco World News sought the expertise of a Moroccan national and continental champion bodybuilder, Mustapha Bouden, known as “Mustapha Rasta.” He confirmed that training before breaking the fast may bring terrible results to the body. He rather encourages people to train after f’tour. “Many people approach me with questions about how and when to train during Ramadan,” said Bouden, adding that “the perfect timing to train is after feeding your body by two hours,” arguing “during Ramadan the body is out of food and water which mean out of energy.”  “People may have a headache while training and may have muscle loss instead,” he said. “In order to grow your muscles, you must feed them properly at least five time a day with meals rich in calories, carbohydrates and protein which is hard to keep up with during Ramadan. If lucky the muscle can be sustained if not lost.” Fasting and fat loss  On the other hand, the 30 days of fasting can be beneficial for losing fat. Given the number of hours of starving, the body starts fueling itself through the glycogene that is stored in the liver and muscles. Once the glycogene is gone, the body breaks down both muscle and fat to refuel itself.  To enhance fat loss, consider adding some cardio sessions to your training program and eat a f’tour high in protein and low in carbohydrates. The amount of fat loss will depend on the food eaten and on the amount and type of activities engaged in during the fast. Maintaining muscle Thus, to reduce body fat without losing muscle, bodybuilders need a calorie deficit program. By decreasing the amount of calories that your body needs, it will eventually start burning fat. The best way to lose fat while sustaining the muscle is to adopt a carb cycling program, which is recommended by Jamo Nezzar, a retired professional bodybuilder and internationally renowned personal training expert. Carb cycling is the consumption of carbohydrates through rotations. It alternates between high, medium and low-carbohydrate days. The amount of carbohydrates eaten depends on your training days. If it is a four-day training program (divided into two intense sessions, one rest day and then two moderate sessions, saving the weekend for resting), consider consuming high carbohydrates and protein on intense days, lower the carbohydrates or cut them out during rest-days, and moderate carbohydrate intake in the moderate sessions. Cardio sessions are always necessary, whether a person wants to lose fat or to build muscle, as they helps improve endurance and heart function. This feature is part of an exclusive series at Morocco World News for Ramadan. Also in the series is: 10 Places to Have a Delightful F’tour during Ramadan, 15 Types of People During Ramadan and How Moroccan Pass Their Time during Ramadan.

Rabat – Four days after its release, YouTube has deleted the music video “Malhama: Abtal Al Watan” (A Saga: Heroes of the Nation) dedicated to Morocco 2026 because of a copyright claim by producer and director Hatim Naji. The video, intended to hype up excitement for Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup, was released Friday and deleted Tuesday. Naji told Moroccan news outlet Hespress that he was obliged to report the music video for including scenes that he filmed himself. The director added that he “did not receive any message from the team to ask for permission and negotiate the images used to show the city of Casablanca from above.” Both the lyrics and the music video were widely mocked on social media; thousands of Moroccans characterized the music as lacking creativity.  The director of the song and Moroccan comedian Said Naciri spared no efforts to defend the song. Naciri labeled people criticizing the song as enemies of success and enemies of the Moroccan state. Naciri said that “these people we call reptiles… it should have been enough for them to hear the word ‘king’ [in the song] it should have been enough that they heard the word nation, and saw a large number of artists. Still, they went and called it garbage. Shame.” Moroccans expressed their anger and dissatisfaction over the video, saying that they had been waiting for something more fun and creative. A Twitter user described the music video as “13 minuts [sic] of pure cancer.” 13 minuts of pure cancer ! https://t.co/yvN64mJQXb — Ahmed EB-BANA (@Ahmedebbana) May 28, 2018  “I am disappointed but not surprised about the low quality of this Malhama,” said another.

Rabat – Moroccans’ support for the national team is indescribable. The number of Moroccan fans who will travel to Russia to support the national team in the World Cup, after 20 years of absence, is expected to exceed 11,000 people, according to English outlet the North Africa Post. Approximately 8,500 supporters will travel from the kingdom to attend, while 3,000 others will depart from different European countries. Meanwhile, a sizeable number of Atlas Lions fans are already residing in Russia.  The Moroccan embassy in Russia is preparing to welcome the thousands of supporters who will arrive, noting that the travel will be organized between the cities that will host the games of the Atlas Lions. The embassy has also planned several projects to establish communication units and facilitate countrywide access for Moroccans. Moreover, a joint collaboration between Morocco’s Ministry of Sports and Youth, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), and Royal Air Maroc (RAM) offers Moroccan fans hoping to travel to Russia the option of flying from Casablanca, Oujda, Tangier, or Marrakech to three Russian destinations for as low as MAD 5,000 roundtrip. A joint statement from FRMF, RAM, and the ministry said that the flag-carrier will mobilize 13 airplanes to carry 2,500 passengers to see the Atlas Lions’ games in Russia. The Moroccan national team will play their first game against Iran on June 15 in St. Petersburg. Their second game will be against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow.

Rabat – French police forces removed over 1,000 Sudanese, Somalian, and Eritrean migrants from the “Millénaire” migrant camp in Paris on Wednesday morning.  The regional prefect Michel Cadot announced the number of migrants dislocated from Millénaire, which is Paris’s largest camp, totaled 1,016, including 11 minors and 64 women, children, and elderly people. Cadot announced that the migrants would be split into two groups and sent to facilities in Paris and another facility in the Île-de-France region. Furthermore, he stated that two additional camps in Paris will be “evacuated” within the next week: Canal Saint-Martin and Porte de la Chapelle. An estimated 800 Afghani, Sudanese, and Eritrean migrants currently reside in the two camps. The camp dislocation followed a battle in which Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo refused to allow security forces to break down the camp, which was ordered by French Minister of the Interior Gerard Collomb. While Collomb has said that some migrants must be expelled from France, Hidalgo has called for increased efforts to integrate migrants into society. The French minister of the interior ordered the “evacuation” of 2,300 migrants, many of whom travel through Morocco en route to Europe, at the Millénaire and other camps around Paris on Wednesday, May 23. The camp breakdown on Wednesday marks the 37th migrant camp “evacuation” in Paris since 2015. Approximately 28,000 migrants have been dislocated from the camps during the same period.

Rabat – He will finally face justice for his crimes. Authorities are charging the imam of a mosque near Marrakech with “rape of several minors between 7 and 12 years old.” The suspect, aged 45, was the imam of Douar “Bihalwane” Mosque in Sti Fadma. He allegedly used Qur’anic lessons as an excuse to rape minors. The case erupted a few days ago when one of his alleged victims, now aged 17, told police she had been raped by the imam when she was 10. The girl who was about to get married and had no other recourse but to disclose the assault to her family and to the Royal Gendarmerie, which immediately charged the imam. After a search, the gendarmerie intercepted the imam on Friday at the bus station in Oulad Ziane, in Casablanca. He was taken into custody and an investigation was opened under the supervision of the Prosecutor General’s Office. According to the association “Touche pas à mon enfant” (Do not Touch My Child), investigators have heard allegations from several victims who were aged 7 to 12 at the time of the assault. The association has asked the country’s judiciary to impose the maximum penalties against the alleged criminal. The imam is expected to appeal in front of the judge for a first appearance on June 26. According to local sources, investigators are currently looking for other victims.

Rabat- A video of two women interrogating a swindler who pretended to be mandated by the king to take money from people has circulated on social media networks since Tuesday. The video reveals the suspect being interrogated by two women, who brought him into their house to make him confess his lies.  The first woman yelled at the man and accused him of deceiving one of her relatives by pretending to be the King’s cousin and taking MAD 800,000 from her. The suspect later confessed to the woman that he has an accomplice living in Touarga, near Rabat, with whom he deceived people claiming that they were both “chorafa”(noble or highborn) sent by King Mohammed VI. The suspect used fake royal business cards to extort large amounts of money from citizens, tricking them into believing that he would solve their problems.  The second woman was Moroccan author Nicole Elgrissy, who filmed the video and called on people to keep sharing it on social media: “Here is ladies and gentleman, the business card they used to swindle money from people, pretending that they’re part of the Alaoui royal family…shame on you to defraud the people.” The business card says: “Alaoui Sidi Mohammed, grandson of Sultan Moulay Hassan I, cousin of his majesty the King, Royal Palace-Rabat.”  
The incident is not the first time that frauds deceived citizens and gained money while pretending to be members of “chorafa.” Recently, Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) arrested a police commissioner in possession of chorafa cards with which he pocketed MAD 60,000 from people, claiming that he would find jobs for them.

Rabat – Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita reiterated Morocco’s commitment to a political solution in Libya to regain peace, stability, and development, in Paris on Tuesday. In a speech before the attendees of the Paris summit on the Libyan crisis, Bourita affirmed, “The Maghreb needs a stable Libya, as Europe needs a stable Maghreb.”  Bourita conveyed King Mohammed VI’s greetings and affirmed that the King is “closely following developments in the situation in Libya, and giving full support to the conference on Libya.” The Moroccan official added that the conference came at the right time because the prolongation of the Libyan conflict is not an option. “On the contrary, it is an ongoing motivation to redouble our efforts to bring  Libyan protagonists closer together.” The minister also saluted the dynamism of the special envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for Libya, Ghassan Salamé, to find a mutually acceptable solution to end the conflict. “Morocco will be at the side of Libya and its people. It does not have a hidden agenda or interests other than Libya itself: to return to the path of peace, stability and development,” Bourita said. The conference, which was held under the auspices of the UN, convened many delegations from twenty countries, including the US. The symposium brought together Libya’s Chief of Staff Marshall Khalifa Haftar, Speaker of the Libyan House of Representatives in Tobruk Aguila Saleh, Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya Fayez al-Sarraj, and President of Libya High Council Khaled Mechri. The four Libyan leaders agreed to “work constructively with the United Nations to hold credible and peaceful elections on December 10 and to respect the results of the elections,” but they did not sign their names to the agreement. The leaders also pledged to ensure funds and “strong security arrangements” for the voting.

Rabat – Mehdi Benatia will not be left out during the summer mercato (transfer window). The captain of the national team has already attracted the interest of big clubs, including l’Olympique Marseille, and now he is being eyed by Arsenal. After being courted by l’OM, its manager Rudi Garcia and its president Andoni Zubizarreta, who is ready to offer EUR 25 million for his skills, Benatia has another club ready to fight for him. However, the French-Moroccan footballer player made it clear that he does not want to be recruited for now by the French club where he was formed. “I really like Rudi Garcia and his staff. But no, all that is said … I still have two years of contract. My priority is the World Cup. And we’ll see what’s best for me, for my club,” said Benatia to RMC Sport.  Hope for Arsenal? According to Italian sport outlet Corriere dello Sport, OM could be outshined by competitor Arsenal and its president Unai, who is ready to line up numbers during the transfer window for the Atlas Lion. The newly appointed head of the Gunners, Unai Emery has set his sights on the Juventus defender coming off an accomplished season with a respectable profile in the Premier League. According to Corriere dello Sport, Unai intends to personally interfere in the negotiations, as evidence of his willingness to recruit Benatia. Unai wants to fill Arsenal’s defensive sector, a priority of his for many seasons. To convince Benatia to leave the Juve, Arsenal will have to be very convincing, especially since the Atlas Lion is very attached to the Italian club where he won the Italian Cup earlier this month. Mehdi Benatia’s contract with Juve expires in 2020 and Allegri is counting on his defender to come out of a full season. Benatia, 31, has spent most of his career in Italy, where he has played for Udinese, AS Roma, and Juventus. He joined the latter on loan from German football giant Bayern Munich.  Earlier this year, Benatia was voted best Maghreb player in 2017 by France Football, ahead of Algeria’s Riyad Mahrez and Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech. World Cup first With the 2018 World Cup in Russia coming soon, Benatia must not be distracted by the transfer window. The national captain is busy training in Switzerland where he will battle against Ukraine in a friendly pre-World Cup game on Thursday night. “EL Capitano” is confident about taking the Atlas Lions all the way in the competition. In an interview with France 24, he said that he sees himself in the finals as he wants to make Moroccans proud of the Atlas Lions. “I want the Moroccan supporter to be happy in the streets of Moscow,” he added.

Rabat – While President of Uganda’s Football Association (FUFA) Moses Hassim Mogogo announced his official support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, he said that he does not have the last say when it comes to the interests of his country and the executive committee of FUFA. Uganda’s support for Morocco’s bid is pending approval from FUFA.  Mogogo told Uganda Radio on Monday that he “personally” support the Moroccan bid. “I am for our own African brother to win this bid to host the World Cup. But I cannot decide because we shall meet as an executive and make the final decision on who to vote for.” Mogogo added that he believes the continent is ready to host the second African World Cup after South Africa hosted in 2010. “We executive members of the Confederation of African Football decided that since we are Presidents of football back in our countries then we should support the Morocco bid,” he added. The FUFA president has made it clear that the last word on Uganda’s support will come after consultations with the executive committee. If Uganda agrees to vote for Morocco, the kingdom can only hope the promise will last longer than South Africa’s fairweather support. Change of heart? A month ago, the president of South Africa’s Football Association, Danny Jordaan, expressed his full support for the Moroccan bid, saying that the federation will surely vote for the Moroccan bid. However, the government of South Africa took a different stance.  South Africa’s Minister of Sports Tokozile Xasa said: “We are very clear that we cannot support Morocco.” The country’s parliament “was very straightforward in this regard, it is the mandate of the country, and it is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is.” Only 14 days remain until the big day when 211 football federations will gather in Moscow to vote for their favorite bid on June 13. Morocco’s bid committee, however, seem to be aware of what may happen during the vote. CEO of the Moroccan bid Hicham El Amrani told the BBC  earlier this month that no one is “forced” to back the Moroccan bid “if he believes that it doesn’t serve the country or the country’s football interest.” “Even if Africa has always acted in unity, unity does not mean 100% of all the member associations, this is part of the democratic process,” he added. Several football federations might have changed their minds and chosen to support the US bid after Donald Trump’s threats.  Addressing countries that receive US financial support, Trump said “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid…”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has personally supervised a humanitarian aid transport for the benefit of Palestinian people at the Casablanca airport. Along with food aid from the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity, the King deployed a Royal Armed Forces (FAR) medical unit and field hospital, stocked with blankets and medicine. The 113 tons of aid will benefit the people of Gaza, Al Quds (Jerusalem), and Ramallah. Food aid will be sent through Jordan to Ramallah and Jerusalem, and aid to Gaza will be sent after transit permits are obtained from Egyptian authorities. The food aid contains essential products, especially the foods most consumed in  Ramadan. In addition, 5,000 blankets will be shipped. The field hospital is to be built in the Gaza Strip and will  serve Palestinian victims of the recent violence as well as the general population. It is equipped to handle vascular surgery, abdominal surgery, pediatrics, traumatology, ENT, ophthalmology, and other medical needs. The FAR field hospital has  97 staff, including 13 doctors and 21 nurses. A total of 25 tons of medicine will be sent to enhance the hospital’s services. The operation is a symbol of the historical and humanitarian solidarity of King Mohammed V towards Palestinians.

Rabat- Moroccan actor Said Naciri, who is the director and producer of the ridiculed “Malhama: Abtal Al Watan” music video said Tuesday that the people who mocked his song are enemies of success and enemies of the Moroccan state. In an interview with Moroccan news outlet Ya Biladi, Naciri came to the defense of the Malhama song, describing people who mocked and called it “garbage” and “cringeworthy,” as enemies of their own country, saying that the buzz the music video created signifies its success: “These people who we call reptiles…it should have been enough for them to hear the word ‘king,’ [in the song] it should have been enough that they heard the word nation, and saw a large number of artists. Still, they went and called it garbage. Shame,” Naciri expressed. He added that the “70 percent or 80 percent,” before correcting the latter to “60 percent” of people who encouraged the initiative are the real and original Moroccans. Naciri said that he was not against constructive criticism “because no work can be perfect,” claiming that the celebrities who took part in the music video sang about “depth,” peace, security, and stability, while the ones who mocked them are against national stability: “We should protect our nation from these people who attack similar patriotic works,” he said. Naciri informed the same source that he first presented the music video to the National Society of Radio and Television (SNRT), however SNRT’s CEO Faycal Laaraichi refused to broadcast it. Naciri said he did not know why it was rejected from the first place: “I do not understand why patriotic works done by great artists are not broadcasted on television,” he chastised.  Naciri said that there was a press conference about the song that was attended by 150 people: “At first, everyone expressed admiration for the song, but once it was released online, it was attacked,” Naciri said. Naciri told the same source that Malhama had a limited budget, but managed to implement a green screen and new cameras for shooting. In a different statement to the news outlet Medias 24, Naciri informed the interviewer that the Malhama was financed by Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), while refusing to reveal its exact budget. One thing is certain: the costs of the video were not high,  judging by Malhama’s features, as many social media commentators pointed out: #Mal7ama dial lkilo ??#Tfou#Tar9a3 pic.twitter.com/QsUbKrL1oF — K.E (@ANTIJRADA) May 28, 2018  Ever since its release on Friday, May 25, the 13-minute-long Malhama music video has attracted more mockery than admiration, contradictory to Naciri’s figures: 70, 80, or 60 percent of people who encouraged the initiative. Malhama is intended to show support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid and to encourage Morocco’s Atlas Lions, who will play their first match in the World Cup June 15. Participants in the clip include singers Abderrahim Souiri, Tahour, Abdelali Anouar, Rachida Talal, and Aicha Tachinouite; rising singer Hamza Labyed; model Leila Haddioui; actor Mohamed El Jem; and actress and former Minister of Culture Touria Jabrane.  Previously, Naciri vaguely defended Malhama on a post on his official Facebook page with a statement equivalent to the French saying “Chassez le naturel, il revient au galop,” or the English proverb “What’s bred in the bone will come out in the flesh,”describing that which is inherent to a person’s nature. Taking his latest statements into account, Naciri was clearly referring to the people he now calls “enemies of the nation.”

Rabat- Minister of Education, Vocational Training, and Higher Education, Said Amzazi has instructed baccalaureate students that they should not show up to their final exams with any communication devices.  In a meeting at the Parliament’s House of Councillors Tuesday, Amzazi warned baccalaureate exam candidates from sneaking smartphones or other mobile devices into exam halls. Amzazi urged parents to cooperate with the ministry’s anti-fraud law against cheating in baccalaureate exams by preventing their children from taking their phones with them into exams. Amzazi stated that the ministry has taken firm measures to guarantee a better exam atmosphere for students, who will sit for baccalaureate exams for the 2017-2018 school year June 5-8. Among the ministry’s measures was the installation of classroom cameras to catch cheating and thereby ensure equal opportunities for students. The ministry hopes the move will raise awareness of the seriousness of cheating, but cameras will not be installed in all exam rooms due to the cost. Those caught with electronic devices, attempting to cheat, or helping other students to cheat, will be penalized with six months to five years in jail and a fine ranging from MAD 5,000-100,000. Candidates will also be prevented from taking the exam for two years. Amzazi recalled the anti-fraud law’s achievements beginning in 2017, recording 6,300 cases of cheating in baccalaureate exams, in comparison with the 16,000 cases in previous years. In 2016, several people illegally distributed the content of the baccalaureate exams and were surrendered to security authorities. In the same year, the ministry recorded 3,048 cases of cheating, saying that the instances of cheating were reduced from previous years.

Rabat – The video has stirred up public uproar. Footage of a woman punched and strangled by police on Wildwood Beach in New Jersey (USA), Saturday, May 26, has been viewed more than six million times. “You do not have the right to hit me and choke me like that,” said Emily Weinman after she was roughly assaulted while she was resting in the company of her husband, daughter, and friend. To celebrate the American holiday Memorial Day, they had brought alcohol, but they had not drunk any yet when the police arrived and asked her to breathe in a Breathalyzer, which turned out to be negative. “I asked them if they had anything better to do than prevent people from drinking on the beach,” she said in a Facebook post. Emily Weinman said the police then asked her for her ID. She refused to give it to them. “At that moment, he told me that if I did not give it to him, he would stop me,” she added. Wildwood police gave a different version of the incident. City Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr. spoke of “shame” after the incident but also said the police had a video of Emily Weinman spitting at police officers and insulting them.

Rabat – The ongoing boycott against the high prices of products has pushed dairy company Centrale Danone to reduce its order of milk from Moroccan farmers by 30 percent on a daily basis. The company has addressed a letter to Moroccan farmers supplying Centrale Danone with milk, informing them of the company’s decision. The letter, obtained by Moroccan news outlet Telquel Arabi, includes Danone’s reasons: the consequences of the boycott. The decision took effect today, according to the letter. Danone ‘spared no effort’ “Dear partners, as you know, Centrale Danone is experiencing a boycott since April 20. The boycott has negatively affected the sales of this brand and its other products,” the letter said. Centrale Danone said that it has “spared no effort” to purchase the milk farmers produce and to “protect” farmers from the consequences of the boycott. The company added that it has been trying to use unsold milk products to produce other dairy products, including butter, sterilized milk, and milk powder. Their efforts, however, could not help the company to overcome the consequences of the boycott. “Despite all these serious attempts, and given the average decline in sales, we regret the decision to cut milk supply by 30 percent nationally,” concluded the letter. Fumbled attempts to reconcile with consumers Centrale Danone has been trying to reconcile with its customers since the launch of the boycott on April 20.  The company has issued four statements to date. The first and second statements denied that prices increased and apologized to customers for statements by its purchasing director Adile Benkirane, who said that the boycott is a “betrayal of the nation and its products.” In the third statement, the company provided its customers with a special promotional offer, claiming that it has listened to the demands of citizens. The offer included a 20 percent discount on its yogurt throughout the holy month of Ramadan. Customers, however, have been reluctant to accept Centrale Danone’s apologizes, urging the company to save its words and lower its prices instead. Several government officials, including Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid and Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi defended the company, claiming that Centrale Danone makes a reasonable profit. “I am asking Moroccans, who have always been known for their wisdom and rationality, to suspend the boycott of milk.” According to him, the boycott came in conjunction with the spring peak yield in milk production. El Khalfi also singled out Centrale Danone in a press conference held earlier this month, emphasizing that “the profit margin of the company is reasonable and does not exceed 20 centimes [per liter].” The boycott, which started on April 20, also targets Afriquia gas and Sidi Ali mineral water.

Rabat – A former member of the National Rally for Independents Party (RNI), Rachid Sassy, has urged Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch to resign from his position as president of RNI, as it ”clashes with his business” interests as the owner of a boycotted company, Afriquia. Sassy wrote a post on Sunday on a Facebook account which he later disabled, denouncing Akhannouch’s presidency of RNI, saying that both RNI and the country’s reputation are at stake because of Akhannouch’s “personal matters.”  Sassy thanked boycotters who did not “confuse” between Akhannouch’s position as president of RNI and owner of one of the three boycotted companies, Afriquia. Sassy said that he previously warned Akhannouch and all members of the party from choosing the latter as RNI’s president saying:”The election of [Akhannouch] as president of RNI is not acceptable, and is a result of submitting to a man with power and connections, not a decision based on political legitimacy or recognition of his qualification to empower [RNI].”    According to Forbes 2018 lists, Akhannouch’s fortune is worth USD 1.94  billion, down from 2.2 billion in March 2018, which had earned him the title of “the richest man in Morocco.” Sassy addressed Akhannouch directly, “I advise you to make the right and most courageous decision for the sake of the country and the party.” Recently, the RNI coordinator, Abdelkader Tatou, announced his support for the boycott campaign, which is aimed at three major companies in Morocco: Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone, and Afriquia. Tatou blamed the government for not responding to the demands of citizens regarding exorbitant prices. After Tatou made his stance clear, other members of RNI joined in support of his statements and the boycott campaign, suggesting that it should include all products with high prices in the country.

Rabat – The Minister of Energy, Mining, and Sustainable Development, Aziz Rabbah, concluded his official talks with Spanish Minister for Energy, Tourism, and the Digital Agenda, Alvaro Nadal Belda, on Monday in Rabat. The two ministers centered their meetings on improving interconnectivity between the two nations’ networks to maximize and secure national electricity supply, according to Maghreb Arab Press. The talks fall within the framework of regional energy integration situating Morocco as a “relay between Europe and Africa.” They also discussed extending the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline (GME) project and creating opportunities for further cooperation between Moroccan and Spanish businesses in the energy sector. Minister Rabbah explained Morocco’s development of a third power line to meet increasing energy demand between the two countries, which falls within the Morocco-Spain memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the integration of energy networks and markets, the development of renewable energy, energy savings, and energy efficiency. Belda emphasized the need for further cooperation beyond negotiations alone; the Spanish minister also detailed Spain’s development of liquid hydrocarbons as a sustainable energy source that abides by international climate agreements. The two countries will expand bilateral cooperation through an additional MoU during the king of Spain’s next visit to Morocco. In the meantime, the parties agreed to develop a plan of action. Morocco signed an MoU with India on sustainable energy development last week. Earlier this year, Morocco signed an additional MoU with Spain in the nuclear energy sector.

The host of the conference, Macron, commended the agreement, saying, “We now have clear commitments for the country, an approved calendar for parliamentary and presidential elections,” reported The Guardian. The four leaders, however, have not signed the agreement yet. Macron, according to the Guardian, explained that the Libyan officials have not signed because they need to “consult.”

Rabat – Qatari sports channel beIN Sports has officially urged FIFA to take measures against a Saudi-based piracy network called “BeOutQ.” The general counsel of beIN Sports told French press agency AFP that his company “requested FIFA to take direct legal action against Arabsat and the indications we have shown that they are behind that.” Saudi-based BeOutQ, according to Europe 1, will pirate the transmission of FIFA’s 64 games of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The Saudi channel is “geo-locked,” so internet users across Saudi Arabia can access the channel for GBP 80. Last week beIN Sports, which owns the broadcast rights to the World Cup in Saudi Arabia, invested GBP 12,000 to stop BeOutQ from stealing broadcasts of sports events. The Independent quoted Managing Director of beIN Sports Tom Keaveny, saying that “the pirated signal is being transmitted by the Riyadh-based satellite provider Arabsat, whose largest shareholder is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” A number of Arab countries are boycotting the Qatari-owned sports channel since Saudi Arabia and its allies decided to cut ties with Qatar in June 2017, allegedly for its involvement in funding terrorist groups. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia announced its intention to launch the largest sports network in the Middle East, PBS Sports, to compete with the Qatari sports network. International news sources, including Europe 1, announced that beIN sports will offer free broadcasts of the 22 games featuring Arab countries in the 2018 World Cup. The Moroccan team is gearing up for the world’s premier tournament. The World Cup opening game for Morocco will be on June 15 against Iran,  and the second will be against Portugal on June 20. The last game of the first round of the World Cup will be against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – On April 24, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the Institute for Specialized Training, an institution expected to strengthen the kingdom’s intelligence and counter-terrorism related operations. The new institute, which will operate under the DGSN–DGST security umbrella, has been described as the fruition of the king’s vision for a modernized, citizen-oriented, and responsive security apparatus. Reporting on the inauguration of the new institute and its significance for Morocco’s bid to remain the regional moderator in terms of peacekeeping, MAP remarked that the institute seeks to equip recruits with the skills to thwart the growing threats to the country’s security and territorial integrity. MAP further reported that with its state-of-the-art training facilities—a well-equipped library, a laboratory for the teaching of foreign languages, 11 lecture rooms, and a conference hall, among other things—the newly-established institute will focus on intelligence services, criminal investigations, and “communication decoding and interceptions.” The aim is to defeat violent extremism, terrorism, and organized crime, the outlet specified, adding that the ultimate goal is to “develop mechanisms to anticipate and neutralize terrorist threats, thereby securing territorial integrity and citizens’ safety.” But if the branding and concept are new, in the larger scheme, it is the integration of new elements into an established system, rather than the creation of a whole new approach or philosophy. Moreover, as Morocco is already widely acknowledged as North Africa’s fort of security and counterterrorism, it has been observed that the move is an attempt to upgrade and improve a system that was already effective. Speaking under condition of anonymity, a researcher who is currently working on a thesis on Morocco’s counterterrorism strategies told Morocco World News that the new institute cannot be isolated from the general security overhaul that Morocco initiated in the immediate aftermath of the May 16, 2003, Casablanca bombings. The country’s deadliest terrorist strike claimed 45 lives (including 12 suicide bombers). “When the 2003 bombings took the kingdom by surprise, Morocco had not yet reformed its security apparatus and counterterrorism strategies to fit in the post-9/11 schema of ‘inter-agency process,’ a homeland and overseas defense philosophy resting essentially on a more intricate and almost inextricable linkage between the different agencies tasked with providing security and ensuring citizens’ safety.” The 16 May shocking event, he explained, proved to be a watershed moment in the recalibration of the Moroccan Security Strategy (MMS), including a strategic rapprochement, and sometimes merging, of the kingdom’s numerous security agencies and institutions: the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), the internal intelligence agency of Morocco; the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN); and the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), to name the most notable ones. “They cooperate in a smooth and efficient chain of activity, with timely intelligence sharing from one unit to the next in the operating hierarchy.” Although the new MMS vision has dealt effectively with various threats, including the dismantling of terrorist cells and the thwarting of planned strikes targeting both Moroccan and European cities, two more events plunged the country into a relative state of panic and worry about its security—the March and April 2007 Casablanca bombings and the 2011 Marrakech blast. But, to put things into context, the 2007 Casablanca incident was relatively minor, as only one victim was registered in addition to the perpetrators who blew themselves up. Rather, it was the Marrakech incident, with its 17 victims (including a number of foreign tourists) that really rang the alarm bell with Moroccan authorities, pushing them to set the standards very high and outperform their already commendable records of counterterrorism and crisis management operations. According to Abdelkader Filali, a political science and international politics researcher at the University of Ottawa, who spoke to Morocco World News via email, a major step after the Marrakech trauma was for Morocco to adopt a “proactive security strategy.” This was mainly done through a policy of “bold merger” and the appointment of Abdullatif Al-Hamouchi as the General Director of the DGST-DGSN. Since then, Morocco has been hailed by several international observers and security analysts as North Africa’s ultimate model of peace and security, a beacon of tranquility for a “region of troubles and instabilities.” While allowing for more “efficient cooperation” in the short-term, the “proactive” approach to security has also meant “the institutionalization and modernization of security services,” Mr. Filali added. Mr. Filali’s optimism is matched by other academics, though with more reserve and calculated reticence as to the kingdom’s response, management, and pre-emptive capabilities regarding the mounting challenges posed by an amorphous and fast-moving network of global terrorism. In a recent article, Anouar Boukhars wrote: “With the exception of the Marrakesh bomb blast in 2011, Morocco has been safe from the terrorist attacks that have roiled Algeria and Tunisia. The country’s proactive security approach has made it harder for AQIM and other terrorist groups to establish a foothold in the country.” Another recent study has also presented Morocco as the least affected country in the North African surging market of illicit arms and drug trafficking, arguing that the country’s security mechanism has been noticeably effective in keeping major threats at bay. But both Mr. Boukhars and the study on illicit arms showed some level of caution, hinting that the challenges ahead are numerous, and there is still room for improvement. Mr Boukhars remarked: “Few security experts doubt that there are still security gaps in need of filling.”  The Institute for Specialized Training, which will be placed under the supervision of the BCIJ while operating from DGSN’s headquarters, may be the additional ingredient needed to fill the gaps that Mr. Boukhars mentioned. On May 14, the BCIJ arrested four ISIS-linked suspects, with BCIJ Director Abdelhak Khiam saying in an interview with AFP that over 150 terrorist cells have been dismantled since 2002, Moroccan outlet l’Observateur reported. Khiam explained to AFP that Morocco’s success on the counterterrorism front showcases the kingdom’s improved capabilities in crisis management, border security, and terrorism investigations. Morocco is a bastion of regional security, he suggested. “So why do you think Morocco needed yet another intelligence-focused institute when its existing system is doing just fine?” Morocco World News asked a security specialist who requested anonymity. “The substantive focus here is to preempt terrorist threats, but also integrate new elements such as special units to fight against cyber criminality, a growing trend in global politics. The point is no longer to only protect citizens; instead, the initiative is to recruit and train multi-skilled agents with the most advanced techniques and state-of-the-art intelligence equipment to identify, preempt, contain, and effectively neutralize ideology-related crimes.” Besides, he interjected enthusiastically, “When it comes to territorial integrity and national security, Moroccans are adamant, inflexible, and perfectionist.”  Yet he also believes that Morocco seeks to secure its continental presence and further its South-South agenda, especially by providing similar training to security and intelligence agents from “ally countries, from the rest of Africa, in particular.” Abdelkader Filali, the Ottawa University researcher, agrees. He said: “The new Institute for Specialized Training (IST) is the first step towards a constitution of a project that could be called a Common Foreign and Security Policy as an African instrument for foreign policy.”

Rabat – A joint collaboration between Morocco’s Ministry of Sports and Youth, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), and Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has offered Moroccan fans willing to travel to Russia options to fly from Casablanca, Oujda, Tangier, and Marrakech to three Russian destinations for as low as MAD 5,000 roundtrip. A joint statement from FRMF, RAM, and the ministry said that the flag-carrier will mobilize 13 airplanes to carry 2,500 passengers to see the Atlas Lions’ games in Russia. The MAD 5,000 offer is specifically for passengers with tickets to the Atlas Lions’ games. The airplane tickets will be sold starting today at RAM’s agencies throughout the country. The Moroccan national team will play their first game against Iran on June 15 in St. Petersburg. Their second game will be against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow. Morocco will play the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25 in Kaliningrad. Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported last week that the government is setting up a program to assist Moroccan fans while they are in Russia. The newspaper said that the Ministry of Health will send a medical staff to surround the Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Kaliningrad stadiums. The Moroccan embassy in Russia will also deliver mobility booklets containing information on the host stadiums and cities. The booklets will also offer assistance with public transportation, travel documents, and the FAN ID required by Russian authorities to attend matches.

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has revealed the government’s new resolutions to give additional benefits to public and private sector employees after social dialogue meetings with trade unions, employee representatives, and entrepreneurs, aimed at solving employment challenges for the national economy. During a meeting at the House of Representatives on Monday, El Othmani briefed Parliament on the key results of social dialogue that began five months after he took office. In October 2017, he opened social dialogue with representatives of economic sectors, including general contractors, trustees, and national trade union centers. El Othmani stated that the purpose of the first social dialogue meeting was to find mutual goals between the government, capital markets, and management sectors, to consider proposals, and to develop a plan to improve financial regulations. After a number of talks and agreements, the government formed three committees: a private sector committee lead by Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim, a public sector committee lead by Minister of Civil Service and Modernization of Administration Mohamed Ben Abdelkader, and a committee concerned with income improvement lead by El Othmani.   A fourth committee was established to coordinate and organize schedules for future meetings between the three committees that El Othmani claims will provide a new perspective for social dialogue and a stable ground for negotiations. The government’s financial support for employees El Othmani said that the government signed a three-year draft agreement in April with social and economic partners committed to social dialogue. The agreement includes an MAD 6 billion financial offer by the government to increase the salaries of low-paid employees starting July 2018 and to increase social security payments for child benefits by MAD 100 for each child with a parent employed in either the public or private sector. Approximately 390,000 employees in public administration will benefit from the child benefit, at a cost of MAD 981 million to the government, starting July 1. The government will also create a new promotion degree for employees, increasing the number of promotions available to teachers, professors, newly appointed tutors, and administrative workers. El Othmani further announced that he is calling the Administrative Council of the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) to enable the same benefits for workers in the private sector. The agreement also includes compensating employees in rural areas at MAD 700 per month, complementing social protection by improving retirement income, and compensating job loss or unemployment. El Othmani is encouraging citizens to declare their employment status in order for the government to create jobs for the unemployed. The government’s door is open for social dialogue Concluding, El Othmani spoke of the government’s willingness for social dialogue with groups from all backgrounds, saying: “No matter the circumstances or differences in opinions, the government will continue to be open for social dialogue.” He emphasized that the government will assist in reinforcing investment and employment opportunities. With respect to the private sector, El Othmani insisted that the government is making efforts to enhance the financial conditions of employees in the sector. El Othmani declared that the government’s offers are still open to institutions that did not respond to the social dialogue meetings. It is to be hoped that the government’s aforementioned initiatives will prove beneficial to the national employment rate. According to a recent report by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP), the number of unemployed individuals rose from 1,167,000 to 1,216,000 people between 2016 and 2017, mostly in urban areas.

On a different light, the government’s financial offer may further contribute to the increase in debt, given that the borrowing requirements of the country’s treasury stand at MAD 13 billion. This may hamper the government’s attempts to narrow its debts through lowering salary expenditures, according to the Directorate of Treasury and External Finance (DTFE).

Rabat – Morocco’s world reserve champion of the 3000-meter steeplechase Soufiane El Bakkali has been denied a visa to travel to the US to participate in the third phase of the Eugene Diamond League. Moroccan newspaper Al Akhbar reported today that the champion was prevented from taking part because he was refused a visa. The visa denial is unexplainable as El Bakkali had an official invitation from the organizing committee of the Eugene league.  El Bakkali has competed in multiple international sporting events. In 2016, El Bakkali qualified for the men’s 3,000-meter steeplechase final at the Rio Olympics and placed fourth after a personal best of 8:14:35 minutes. A year later, the sportsman won a silver medal at the IAAF London 2017 World Championship. El Bakkali claimed second place behind Kenyan Conseslus Kipruto in the 3,000-meter steeplechase race. El Bakkali made his senior debut at the 2014 African Championships in Athletics, taking 10th place in the 3000-meter steeplechase. The 22-year old Moroccan is one of several promising athletes that Morocco has pinned its hopes on to win a gold medal in a world competition.

Rabat – FIFA has challenged rumors that it is planning to disqualify Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid before it gets to the vote, scheduled for June 13. An unidentified FIFA spokesperson told Moroccan media that FIFA and its Secretary General Zvonimir Boban, “categorically denied these rumors.” Boban is also a member of the FIFA task force, which visited Morocco on April 16 to evaluate Morocco’s assets and readiness to host the World Cup in 2026. Rumors of Morocco’s disqualification have gone viral after sports journalist Juan G. Arango tweeted “it is being mentioned that United 2026 would be getting World Cup bid w/o a vote.” It is being mentioned that @United2026 would be getting World Cup bid w/o a vote because of issues in logistics in five main cities in Morocco found by FIFA evaluation committee. Let’s keep an eye on this story as it is beginning to develop. Will definitely have more on this. https://t.co/mpGYbYlQQO — Juan G. Arango (@JuanG_Arango) May 27, 2018  He argued that the news was mentioned by Boban last Friday night. The reason for Morocco’s alleged disqualification was supposedly “issues in logistics in five main cities in Morocco found by [the] FIFA evaluation committee.” The task force committee was expected to publish its assessment on its visit today. However, international news outlets, including L’Equipe, reported that the FIFA delegation will announce the decision in the first week of June.  FIFA’s committee has delayed the release date of the assessment as it will meet with both 2026 World Cup bid committees on May 3rd in Zurich. The task force has the right to disqualify either of the bids on the table if they do not meet FIFA requirements.  Morocco’s bid scored positive points in the first months of the year, collecting the support of several countries from all corners of the world. This was mentioned by Zvonimir Boban on Friday night. Let’s keep an eye out on this story… https://t.co/ntCRRIooKG — Juan G. Arango (@JuanG_Arango) May 27, 2018  The list of Morocco’s supporters includes: Luxembourg, Russia, Qatar, Botswana, Belgium, France, Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria, and  Saint Lucia. The countdown for the FIFA vote has begun. It remains to be seen whether FIFA’s assessment will give Morocco a passing score. The June 13 poll will take votes from 211 football federations.

Rabat- After mocking Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid logo, social media users have expressed fresh disappointment at a new music video, “Malhama: Abtal Al Watan” (A Saga: Heroes of the Nation), dedicated to Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup. The music video, featuring the country’s most popular celebrities singing “Malhama Abtal Al Watan,” has become the latest subject of public mockery. The lyrics, the singing, and the celebrities have all been severely criticized and labeled “cringe-worthy,” “uncreative,” and “humiliating.”   The initiative is also intended to encourage Morocco’s Atlas Lions, who will play their first match in the World Cup June 15.  Participants in the clip include singers Abderrahim Souiri, Tahour, Abdelali Anouar, Rachida Talal, Aicha Tachinouite; rising singer Hamza Labyed; model Leila Haddioui; actor Mohamed El Jem; and actress and former Minister of Culture Touria Jabrane. Actor Said Naciri produced the music video. Naciri defended the ridiculed clip with a statement equivalent to the French saying “Chassez le naturel, il revient au galop,” and the English proverb “What’s bred in the bone will come out in the flesh,”referring to that which is inherent to a person’s nature. 
While some social media users on Twitter and Facebook saw nothing wrong with the music video, the majority wrote comments like: “This song screams: no to creativity!” 
One Facebook user said with utter sarcasm: “FIFA has decided to organize the [2026] World Cup in Morocco as it was deeply touched with the “Malhama” words…” 
Another wrote: “Have you seen, only a qualification for World Cup caused this Malhama…Now imagine what will happen if we win the 2026 bid, we will have an eight-year-long Malhama!” Vous avez vu cette mal7ama pour une qualif en Coupe du Monde? Imaginez maintenant ce que ça serait si on gagne l’organisation de 2026. On aura des mal7amates pendant 8 ans ! — SiMo (@SiMo___H) May 27, 2018  #Mal7ama dial lkilo ??#Tfou#Tar9a3 pic.twitter.com/QsUbKrL1oF — K.E (@ANTIJRADA) May 28, 2018  In January, Morocco’s World Cup bid Committee unveiled the long-awaited official logo, garnering mockery, criticism, and disappointment from many Moroccans. According to the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the logo reflects the country’s national unity and plural identity. “I could have done a better logo at home and on my computer. This is an important matter, and I don’t think hiring amateurs is a wise thing to do. International marketing firms are highly recommended. Not a good start, as far as I am concerned,” one Facebook user, Zachary M. Lahlou, expressed to Morocco World News online. “It looks so unprofessional, I wouldn’t spend a single dollar on such a low quality logo! It’s rubbish and it doesn’t make any sense to me! A great nation with a centuries-old culture was represented by a green pentagram with a few red leaves around it? Seriously!” another one expressed, joining the many people noting the absence of creativity in the management and design.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani reiterated on Monday that Moroccan diplomacy has reaped benefits in the Western Sahara question, owing to the mobilization of the country’s institutions to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity. In a meeting at the House of Representatives on Monday, El Othmani renewed his call to the cabinet to mobilize against the Polisario Front, which has defied the United Nations and violated the ceasefire agreement through illegal actions supported by Algeria. Government mobilized against adversaries El Othmani said that his cabinet has made Morocco’s territorial integrity a priority to defend the national cause. The head of government added that today’s meeting at the parliament is “another message to adversaries, emphasizing that the sovereignty of Morocco is not negotiable.” El Othmani also denounced the recent provocative action of the Polisario Front in Tifariti, east of Morocco’s defense wall.  On May 20, the separatist group conducted a military parade to celebrate the “anniversary” of their “armed struggle.” The UN condemned the action, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urging the front to refrain from violating the ceasefire agreement and Security Council resolutions. El Othmani added that the Polisario Front “has no legitimacy” to represent the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. The Western Sahara issue, according to El Othmani, experienced “important developments,” which reinforced Morocco’s position in the conflict. El Othmani further explained that the achievement could not have been reached without the contribution of all Moroccan institutions, including Parliament, political parties, trade unions, the press, intellectuals, and civil society. Sovereignty over Western Sahara non-negotiable  El Othmani added that King Mohammed VI’s instructions and speeches, delivered on Throne Day July 30, 2017, and on the 42nd anniversary of the Green March in November 2017, served as a basic reference for the government’s efforts on the issue. El Othmani also recalled the report Guterres submitted to the Security Council on March 29. He said it was balanced, “taking into account the urgent and serious developments” of Polisario’s actions in the region. The Security Council adopted Resolution 2414  in accordance with the report. The head of government echoed King Mohammed VI’s statement on the 42nd anniversary of the Green March, emphasizing that “there will be no solution to the conflict outside the sovereignty of Morocco over Western Sahara.” El Othmani concluded his statement by informing his government of a conference scheduled to take place in Marrakech from June 20-23, convening NGOs and officials to discuss means to defend the territorial integrity of the kingdom.

Rabat – Head of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh called Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to discuss the Palestinian cause. Hamas said in a statement published today that Haniyeh expressed gratitude to Morocco for its solidarity and efforts to defend the Palestinian cause, especially after the Casablanca protests in solidarity with Gaza. Haniyeh informed El Othmani of the latest developments on the Palestinian question as well as the consequences of the Trump administration’s decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem and to declare the city Israel’s capital. Haniyeh entreated Morocco, which has a historical relationship with the Palestinian cause and the Jerusalem issue, to deploy all efforts to “confront the steps that affect the Arabism and Islamism of the Holy City.” The leader of the resistance movement also called on Morocco to provide urgent medical assistance to injured protesters. In response, King Mohammed VI ordered Royal Armed Forces to deploy a medical-surgical unit to assist protesters in a field hospital. Sixty-two Palestinians were killed on Monday, May 14, which marked the inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem. El Othmani commended the bilateral ties between Morocco and Palestine, stressing Morocco’s position against the Israeli blockade.

By Karen Duarte Rabat – Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), tweeted last week assuring Morocco that WHO will support Morocco’s ambitious health coverage goal.  On April 7, 2018, Morocco’s new Minister of Health Anas Doukkali restated his department’s plan to execute a health insurance system that will cover approximately 90 percent of the Moroccan population by 2021.  The minister is determined to keep and revise the existing Medical Assistance Plan (RAMED).  Morocco legislated two health financing reforms in 2005. The first was the payroll-based Mandatory Health Insurance (AMO) for public and formal private sector employees. The second, RAMED, created a publicly financed fund to cover services for the poor.  Morocco faces difficulties in trying to identify and classify the poor that are eligible for free goods and services. In order to fill in health financing gaps, RAMED’s goal was to provide households with an income of less than MAD 300 (USD 34) per capita per month with free health insurance. Households with a monthly per capita income of MAD 300–600 (USD 34–68) were also given the opportunity to purchase insurance according to a sliding scale.  Over 10 years into implementing RAMED, Morocco’s health coverage has not expanded at the rate planned by the government.  Morocco is now setting a higher standard by announcing “universal health coverage” to cover not only low-income and disadvantaged people, but to cover 90 percent of the population by 2020.  Morocco will receive aid to reach the extended health coverage goal from external sources, including Global Citizen, a movement of engaged citizens using their collective voices to end extreme poverty by 2030.  Global Citizen responded to Ghebreyesus’s tweet by stating that they look forward to working with Morocco to achieve health for all and tagged Moroccan-American rapper, French Montana.  Great news! @GlblCtzn looks forward to working with Morocco to achieve #HealthForAll #BeatNTDs ??? @FrencHMonTanA @Morocco_UN https://t.co/f0H5FV2NEV — Global Citizen Impact (@GlblCtznImpact) May 23, 2018  Following Global Citizens’ tweet, French Montana showed his appreciation and encouragement by tweeting, “Health is a right not a privilege. Let’s go Morocco. Thank u.”  HEALTH IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE ?? let’s go Morocco ?? thank u @GlblCtzn #ramadanmubarak pic.twitter.com/sES6Mttglc — French Montana (@FrencHMonTanA) May 26, 2018  Like French Montana, Anas Doukkali concurs that healthcare is a “universal right,” and providing Moroccan citizens with an affordable health insurance system is among the pillars of good governance.

Rabat- Egypt’s administrative court ordered authorities on Saturday, May 26, to block YouTube for a month over a controversial short film made in the US in 2012, disrespecting the Prophet Mohammed peace be upon him. Egyptian authorities have ended an appeal that began in 2013 over a low-budget 14-minute film uploaded on YouTube called “Innocence of Muslims.” The short film depicted the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) as a “buffoon and a paedophile” reported the Guardian and AFP.  In 2013, the court ordered the Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology to block YouTube temporarily, however the latter said that blocking YouTube would automatically hamper the Google search engine since the video-sharing website is owned by Google, which might result in large job losses in the country. Until Saturday, May 26, YouTube has been accessible while the case has been under review. The Egyptian lawyer who filed the case at a lower administrative court, Mohamed Hamid Salem, said that the court ordered that all links to the film be blocked. The Egyptian court’s ruling is final and cannot be appealed, however the lawyer said that YouTube was still accessible in Cairo on Saturday. The film, released in July 2012 in California, was written and produced by Egyptian Coptic Christian filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. The controversial film provoked demonstrations by Muslims in the US and the Arab World. In Pakistan, over 30 protesters were killed amid hostile clashes with authority forces. Meanwhile, US officials claimed that they were not aware of the film until its release since it was privately made, adding that they could not prevent it due to freedom of speech rights.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI’s Ramadan initiatives continue. Following the inauguration of at least four facilities, the King inaugurated on Sunday a medical psychosocial center in Tit Mellil, Mediouna Province in the Casablanca-Settat region. The Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity carried the project for MAD 8 million. The project fell within the framework of the King’s instructions to offer access to medical services and make this right one of the main pillars to achieve durable, comprehensive, and integrated human development. The project is also a part of the 2016-2020 social-medical program of the region, which was initiated by the Foundation at the royal instructions. The King launched the construction on the center on June 9, 2017. The facility, according to Maghreb Arab Press, will meet the deficit in medical infrastructure to offer psychological and social care for people with mental health problems. The building is built over 2,851 square meters and consists of a medical department with consultation rooms for general medicine, psychiatry, and psychology; a pharmacy; a community area; and workshops for hairdressing, plastic art and cooking. The center also includes a therapeutic garden, a meeting room, and halls for gymnastics and computer sciences, as well as a multi-purpose room. The center is the second of its kind in the region. During the first week of Ramadan, the King inaugurated a training center in Rabat and a mosque in Sale. The King also launched three humanitarian projects in Kenitra to improve the economic and social conditions in the city.

Rabat – The citizens of Paris, France, witnessed a spectacular scene Saturday night. A Malian man saved  a 4-year-old child suspended from a balcony. His spontaneous act was filmed and has been seen millions of times on social networks. Amazed passersby saw Mamoudou Gassama climbing up what appears to be four stories with his bare hands, and in approximately 30 seconds reaching the child, who was suspended over a balcony, holding on with his hands.  The deputy to the Paris mayor tweeted, “The young man who saved a baby on Rue Marx-Dormoy by climbing three floors is undocumented, arrived from Mali in September. This is to remind the people who talk bad about the migrants all day long. Thank you Mamoudou Gassama.” A little earlier, Paris Mayor Hidalgo had said of Gassama on Twitter: “Congratulations to Mamoudou Gassama for his bravery that helped save a child’s life last night, and I enjoyed talking with him today on the phone, to thank him warmly.” “I saw a lot of people screaming, and cars honking,” explained the man who has been presented as a hero by many media outlets. “I went out, I ran to look at the solutions to save him, I managed to catch the balcony, I climbed like this and thank God I saved him.” The incident happened in the eighteenth arrondissement around 8 p.m. The child’s father was taken into custody as part of an open investigation into neglect of parental responsibility in a case assigned to the juvenile protection brigade. Gassama’s actions did not go unnoticed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who invited the hero on Monday to become a “naturalized Frenchman” and to work for the fire department, according to AFP.

By Leo Wolfson Rabat- With Ramadan in full swing in Morocco, a common perception exists that tourist travel drops off during the month-long holiday. However, numbers from Observatory Tourism Morocco tell a different tale. Tourist visits actually increased by approximately 5 percent in 2017 from May to June, when Ramadan occured (May 26 to June 24). The casual observer may attribute this to the typical influx of summer travellers, but visits to Morocco also increased by 13 percent in June 2017, compared to tourist numbers from June 2016 and 2015, two months which did not coincide with Ramadan. No statistics are yet available for tourist travel to Morocco during Ramadan in 2018. However, some business owners assert that they notice a drop off during the holiday. Majid Elourrate owns and runs Explora Watersports, a surf shop in Essaouira. He said that although business is a little slower, there is a silver lining for those who do come. “It’s OK, a little slower, but that’s OK. Some people say they don’t like to come because it’s slow but other people say they like that.” Due to the quieter feel at certain parts of the day, visiting Morocco during Ramadan can actually be a blessing in disguise. Streets are often less crowded, hotel and hostel rates can be lower, and lines shorter. Furthermore, witnessing a major Muslim holiday firsthand is a wonderful cultural experience. Many tourists have the misconception that they will be unable to access certain businesses like food, shops, and lodging. Though many shops do shift hours, very few close entirely. Although there are noticeably fewer people in the markets and medinas during the daytime, the streets come alive at night, with people crowding into the bazaars, buying and hawking goods for the breaking fast meals, known as iftar. Many shops will stay open until sunset or will at least reopen their doors shortly after. “Ramadan is a good month to do business in Morocco. So they shift hours and sometimes activities too. For instance a restaurant will serve Iftar at sunset and bakeries will sell Ramadan specialty sweets,” said Chakib Ghadouani, a representative of Observatory Tourism. This year’s Ramadan comes slightly earlier in the year than it did in 2017, concluding June 16. Through the first three months of the year, 24 percent more tourists flocked to the country than in the same time period in 2017, according to Morocco’s Ministry of Tourism, Air Transport, and Handicrafts, generating an estimated MAD $15.8 billion. Moroccan business newspaper L’Economiste reported that 1.5 million tourists visited in the first two months of 2018, a 12 percent increase from 2017. Tourist numbers increased by 8 percent in 2017, according to the Ministry of Tourism.

Rabat – Journalist Souad Mekhennet, a German national of Moroccan origin, has received the 2018 Ludwig Börne Prize, one of the most esteemed literary prizes in German-speaking countries. The Washington Post national security reporter becomes the first Arab and Muslim to win the award since its launch 25 years ago. At the award ceremony in Frankfurt Sunday, jury president and well-known TV journalist Maybrit Illner highlighted Mekhennet’s meticulous work as a journalist in Iraq, Afghanistan, Algeria, and Libya, but also her excellence as a writer through her investigations in radical circles. Mekhennet is famous for her reports on terrorism and especially her international bestseller “I was Told to Come Alone: ??My Journey Behind the Lines of Jihad,” where she investigated Islamic extremism in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The 368-page memoir discusses the reporter’s personal experience as a Muslim reporter with a bicultural identity. As a Muslim, Mekhennet has had access to some of the most wanted members of jihadist groups, including Al Qaeda and ISIS, who have refused to talk to Western reporters. The mayor of Frankfort, present at the ceremony, said he was proud that the award was given to a typical woman from the city “who embodies, by her plural identity, the multicultural diversity that characterizes Frankfurt.” Mekhennet won the Daniel Pearl Award for courage and integrity in journalism in 2017. According to the Washington Post, the Ludwig Börne Foundation “honors outstanding achievements in essay, criticism and reportage.” Maybrit Illner said of the journalist: “Mekhennet combines great courage, clear reasoning and genuine passion. The child of immigrant workers became an investigative reporter of international acclaim. Discrimination, arrogance and hypocrisy make her just as angry as it once did Ludwig Börne.” The Moroccan journalist has worked for internationally renowned media outlets, including the New York Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Daily Beast and German television ZDF. She currently works at The Washington Post.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has wished a year full of success to students who are preparing to take the regional and national baccalaureate exams this year. El Othmani began his speech in government council on Friday, May 25, by calling on students to be reassured and confident to take their exams in a good atmosphere with positive thoughts. After El Othmani stressed Morocco’s quality of education, he asked students to stay away from cheating. El Othmani said, “We regret that we observe the phenomena of cheating; students should rely on themselves and on their own abilities, because cheating is not beneficial for them; the one who passes the exams by cheating will weakly continue his path, and cannot continue it in a positive way.” He also renewed his call to students to be diligent and ready, warning of the legal ramifications for cheaters.  “The government council today, will approve an executive decree of the legal requirements, the importance of which does not necessarily appear in deterrence, so as not to exaggerate, but the importance appears in  the existence of the will, which we all must have, and it is not only the ministry, educators, teachers, and administrators who are responsible, but also families and parents who should make sure that their children have the virtue of self-reliance, and should advise them to avoid cheating and encourage them to be self-confident.” The Ministry of Education declared that the national baccalaureate exam will be given June 5-8 and the regional baccalaureate exam will be given June 1-2.  The ministry indicated that there are nearly 440,000 candidates taking the exam this year, an increase of 9.7 percent from 2017.

Rabat – President of Casablanca’s Bar Association Hassan Birouaine has denounced the “rabid” behavior of Taoufik Bouachrine’s defense team. In a statement published on May 25, Birouaine said that “the lawyers of the Casablanca Bar condemned the unprecedented behavior and “rabid reactions” of some lawyers in the Bouachrine case. The statement came a few days after a hearing held on May 21 that was marked by loud altercations between the lawyers and complainants. Moroccan journalist Bouachrine, who was arrested on February 28, is facing heavy charges for alleged sexual harassment, gender-based violence and rape. Authorities said that they have 50 videos backing the charges against the journalist. The videos were allowed to be featured during the hearings. Mohamed Ziane, a member of the defense team, expressed anger over the videos, claiming that the person in the footage “is not Bouachrine.”  Ziane used explicit language in front of the press, shouting that the videos are “porn footage.” In response, Birouaine accused some lawyers in the Bouachrine case of “denigrating the uniform of lawyers.” “Anyone following the trial of Mr. Taoufik Bouachrine’s trial will find that some lawyers, on both sides, have moved away from common sense and have lost the serenity and foresight that a lawyer is bound to observe.” The president of the Casablanca Bar Association called on the lawyers to respect their colleagues, client, judicial institutions, and the public “that expressed their deep dissatisfaction with what they hear, read and see of the use of obscene words and gestures that undermine morality.”

Rabat- Police authorities caught a car thief after a dramatic car chase on tram tracks in Rabat. A thief driving a stolen car on tram tracks, chased by police and angry locals, is not a common sight in the administrative and calm city of Rabat. The 39-second video segment begins seconds before police stopped the car, followed by indignant crowds. Before the police captured the culprit, some members of the crowds took their version of justice into their own hands. If the car’s owner could not have the car, then no one could have it. Those may have been the thoughts of young locals who angrily hit the car, smashed windows, and threw rocks at it.

Rabat – Sometimes, perhaps, the most compelling stories are those suggested, murmured, mimicked, like the sound of a toddler in early stages of speech: stories that are revealed through an artfully calculated prose.  This brings to mind the mantra with which aspiring writers are being tortured: “Show, don’t tell; less is more.” The suggestion, I think I now know, is this: at times, simplicity is more evocative, more sophisticated, and, ultimately, more vibrant than pompous language. I still have qualms about such a posture. I’ve never been truly convinced by this minimalist gospel. To me, a fervent lover of flowery and sinuous prose, literary minimalism sounds like somebody telling me that the best way to speak is to actually ‘not speak’; it feels, as Paul West put it, like “a lion afraid of meat.” The Nigerian writer Chigozie Obioma makes the case more brilliantly than I in his magnificent essay in defense of “audacious prose.”  As a literature fundamentalist, I revel in beautiful language; I worship the beguiling musicality of felicity; I succumb to the symmetry and poetry of vivid language. Language, when it is dexterously used by the sublime and pertinent pen of a writer—be they poet, novelist, or essayist—has the ability to transform the world into a party, a festival, an uproarious gathering of angelic creatures: in literature, nothing is as transcendentally transformative as linguistic virtuosity. Beautiful language is, in essence, an elixir, a downpour of paradisal evocations. Yet, although I have not totally succumbed to literary minimalism, Leïla Slimani’s beautiful and breathtaking prose has somehow convinced me that when mastered and controlled, minimalism does have its undeniable merits; that it has a point, especially in these times when people don’t really have time for books. Dans le jardin de l’ogre, Slimani’s first novel, was published in 2014. But I only read it very recently, last October, to be more precise, as I tried to familiarize myself with Morocco’s literary world, having recently landed in Rabat as an exchange student. Dans le jardin de l’ogre recounts the thrilling, and yet depressing, life of Adèle, a journalist and sex addict married to a successful doctor. It is a novel full of double entendres, veiled desires, the body and its abilities, and marital life. “She’s been enduring for a week. For a week she has not given in. Adèle has been wise.” Such are the opening lines of Slimani’s first novel, as she introduces a character whose unbridled lust will be her downfall. The shortness of the sentences, the breathtaking briskness with which she throws her words in her reader’s face—these are the hallmarks of Slimani’s minimalistic, constrained, controlled and quasi-Flaubertian prose. Her sentences are economical and assertive. They bear that magisterial posture of a writer who knows what to do with words. But for all the brilliance present on some pages, for all the subversive imagery so pervasive in Adèle’s world, her “failed” femme fatale character did not move me much. Slimani’s first novel, in some senses, failed to grant me the transfiguration that only great novels bestow upon their readers. But I did not put it down; I have the irrational stubbornness of finishing the books that I start, especially when I invested my money to acquire them. And so, as I witnessed Adèle’s lies being exposed; as I watched her bourgeois marriage crumble; as I enjoyed the dizzying enchantment of her roller-coaster sex life; as I laughed at that carnal, pathological versatility masquerading as romance; I decided that I needed to be a bit indulgent towards Slimani. After all, this was her debut novel. Debuts can be great. Some “great” established writers will actually tell you, as will their readers, that their best novel is in fact their first one. But, in general, good debuts show—at least they should—glimpses of prospective greatness. A well-written debut novel, I dare believe, is a sign of somebody still looking for their voice, their signature–the distinctive mark that will make them stand out in our stultifying frenzy of poor books. (After all, Notes from the Underground, an early “philosophical fiction” by the formidable Dostoyevsky, was not so great. In the hesitant tone of its mild prose, however, one can sense greatness under construction, a nascent voice, the sure-to-come originality of an author who would subsequently prove to be the best explorer of human psychology and complexity.) And so, as I finished Slimani’s first novel, I decided to give her a second chance, to buy her second novel at my earliest convenience. And Slimani, in the curious telepathy—that divine bond—existing between authors and their readers, seemed to have heard my doubts. She took them into account. She soothed my qualms, reassured me, shattered my reservations, and promised me that next time would be better, much better. In the final lines of Dans le jardin de l’ogre, she writes: “Love is but patience. A submissive, bigoted, tyrannical patience. An unreasonably optimistic patience. We are not done yet.” She was right—we were not done yet: Two weeks later, I bought Chanson Douce, her second novel (winner of the 2016 Goncourt Prize, France’s most prestigious literary award, and recently translated into English as Perfect Nanny in America, and Lullaby in Britain). A dramatic, heartrendingly beautiful adventure had begun! “The baby is dead,” begins Chanson Douce. Like in her first novel, Slimani was back with the aggressive candor of her prose. Here, however, the style was more touching, affecting, addictive. Chanson Douce, from its first pages, radiates with penetrating simplicity. In the shocking brevity of its sentences, it blends meaning and sensuality. Every word in this novel is a hard and deliberate choice, a calculated move, the quintessential paroxysm of Slimani’s dogged obsession with clarity. By using this magisterial trick of starting with the end, Slimani slams you in the guts, her words haunt you until the last page.  Chanson Douce, as it is, transforms you into a detective looking for clues to what really went wrong. “Why? How?” you keep murmuring as you witness Louise, the central character, a charming and spotless nanny, turn into a monstrous presence, a cold and unthinking murderer of the children she so dearly loved. This is perhaps why a critic has called the novel “truly horrific” and “sublime.” That assessment is right. As a page-turner, an irresistible thriller, Chanson Douce tells you this: a) Sometimes, it is in the comfort and security of home, in the tenderness and familiarity of being loved and desired, that we are most vulnerable; b) estrangement, alienation and self-loathing can transform us into monsters. To feel abandoned, left out, and good-for-nothing can be a fertilizer of atrocity. But this does not do justice to the masterful minimalism of Chanson Douce. Here, Slimani deploys her journalistic instincts of agonizing clarity and detailed observation—she worked as a journalist before writing her first novel—to talk about life in general. In Louise’s bittersweet tenderness, the children’s immaculate and unquestioned love for their fairy-tale nanny, and the professional success of Louise’s employers, Slimani gives us characters to chat with, presences that comfort. She lightens the ordeal and torture of going through life. She sweetens cruelty without depriving it of its galvanizing horror. Hers, fundamentally, is a simple prose that vivifies life and summons the readers to the agony of broken lives and unfulfilled destinies. Chanson Douce evokes unarticulated longings, desires left unsaid, and unquenched thirst. Slimani recently told The Guardian: “I want to write about a character who fascinates me, someone I don’t understand… [to capture] the anxiety and claustrophobia of being a mother.” I think she succeeded in that regard. Slimani’s Paris, the locale of her novels, is harsh and violent; it is a slaughterhouse mired in indifference and the condescending civility of the well-off. Immigration, loneliness, tears, gossip, poverty, the squalor of French banlieues—Chanson douce has it all. Slimani introduces you to the disarming precariousness of these broken lives. She opens your eyes to things that you took for granted, or ignored, or things that did not matter to you. Her poetry is not effusive; it is humane, compelling, and sincere. As Louise begins to consider the possibility of a dreadful deed, Slimani writes of her: “Her heart has hardened… Nothing moves her anymore. She has forgotten how to love. She’s extinguished all the tenderness that was left in her heart; her hands no longer have anything to stroke.”  From then on, it seems to me that Slimani’s book surpasses a mere thriller. With a well-adorned language that avoids being sanctimonious or preachy, she touches upon the inescapable grip of social class and how our lives can be decided by a series of predetermined and fixed patterns. Slimani is passionately attached to her characters and obsessed with the emotional sincerity of her story. That is all; that is enough; that is laudable.  In his preface to The Early Stories, John Updike asserted that the mission of art is “to do justice to the beauty of the ordinary.” Who can say that Chanson Douce did not achieve that? In My Name Is Red, a fascinating novel on art and creativity, one of Orhan Pamuk’s characters opined: “An artist’s skill depends on carefully attending to the beauty of the present moment… stepping back from the world… allowing for the distance and eloquence of a jest.” Pamuk’s suggestion, it seems to me, is that unrivaled artistry resides in masterful control over one’s medium, a divine ability to douse the flames of life and create unparalleled elation and angelic delight and indefinable splendor out of the trivial and tedious banalities of daily life. If this suggestion is correct—and I think it is—Slimani deserves a residency permit in the pantheon of authors on whom we’ve bestowed the epithet “great.”  Leïla Slimani may not have the entrancing scholarship of Mathias Énard’s bamboozling novels, or the verbal succulence of Alain Mabanckou’s zestful prose…yet, through her lacerating urgency, her gut-wrenching clarity, her deft observations, and her penetrating journalistic gaze, Slimani abducts us at our own behest. Is that not what a reader should require of an author? Sexe et Mensonges: La vie Sexuelle au Maroc, Slimani’s most recent book, a reportage on the duplicity and the hypocrisy surrounding sexual mores and conventions in Morocco, was published last September. I have not read it yet. Term papers and the turbulence of student life have been keeping me back, diverting my focus. But I will very soon. So should you.

Rabat – Was he messing with his fans? Cristiano Ronaldo’s statement after Real Madrid won the Champions League has raised a lot of questions. Saturday night after the coronation of Real against Liverpool (3-1), CR7 excited the media sphere by leaving some doubt about his future. “It was good to play for Real…. I will talk to the fans soon,” the Portuguese football player told journalists, who were quick to report his departure from the Spanish club, as he was rumored to be courted by the PSG. Sunday night in the center of Madrid, where Merengues traditionally go to celebrate their titles, the sensational footballer was giving a different speech. “It’s a pride to play in the biggest club in the world. It’s very important for me, I feel comfortable with your passion, the players who motivate me, the coaching staff, to get better and better. It’s my DNA, I’m like that. 1, 2, 3 Hala Madrid. Thank you, guys, and see you next year,” he said to delighted Madrid fans. According to sports outlet Marca, Ronaldo’s statement is only his “umpteenth blow of anger.” Ronaldo’s “extension is in progress” with an estimated salary of EUR 30 to 33 million per year. According to the press, the five time winner of the Ballon d’Or does not feel sufficiently defended by the club and is not remunerated for the value he brings. Ronaldo, 33, extended his contract in November 2016 until 2021, for an estimated annual salary of EUR 23.6 million. But his eternal rival, Barça’s Lionel Messi, takes in more (counting gross wages, premiums, and advertising revenue) over a season: EUR 126 million to Ronaldo’s 94 million.

Rabat – Undocumented Moroccan migrants stranded in Libya have begun a hunger strike to protest delays in their repatriation to Morocco. Husni Abu-Ayana, head of the information office of Tripoli’s “anti-illegal immigration” department told Chinese news outlet Xinhua, that the repatriation was scheduled before Ramadan, but “was delayed.” Ayana said that a delegation from the Moroccan embassy visited the migrants in April to register their information. The Libyan official added that 60 detained migrants are carrying out a hunger strike in protest. A massive number of sub-Saharan and North African migrants have found themselves stranded in detention centers across Libya after attempting to illegally cross over the Mediterranean to Europe. The number of irregular migrants in Libya reached 700,000 by the end of 2017. Several videos of Moroccan migrants went viral in 2017 and early 2018. In the videos, the migrants cried for help to end their detention in Libya and urged Moroccan authorities to bring them back home. Dozens of families of Moroccan migrants missing or detained in Libya protested in late November in Rabat, calling for authorities to repatriate their relatives, whose number was estimated to be between 200 and 700. The Ministry in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad announced in December that it would repatriate 235 Moroccan migrants. This is the second repatriation operation that Moroccan authorities have conducted, after one in August which brought back about 200 citizens in two private aircraft. Info Migrants reported in January 2018 that Morocco will repatriate 800 migrants home in three different operations. “A reported 338 migrants will travel to Morocco with two flights operated by Libyan company Afriqiyah,” the source said.

Rabat – The head of the Moroccan secret service (DGST), Abdellatif Hammouchi, has received a Moroccan citizen who was assaulted by a police officer to apologize to him. The footage of a police officer’s attack on Khalid Choukri, a scooter driver in Casablanca, sparked a storm of reactions on social media. Some deemed the violence “unacceptable” and “humiliating.” After quickly reacting by suspending the policeman, Hammouchi welcomed Choukri in Rabat, on Saturday to apologize on behalf of the officer. “I am extremely happy and honored to have been greeted by Mr. Hammouchi, who apologized on behalf of the security apparatus for the violent behavior I suffered,” Choukri told news outlet 2M.  It is the first time that the head of DGST has received a citizen to apologize, a gesture that was applauded on social media.  The officer, who works at the police headquarters of Casablanca, was not only suspended from his duties, but also referred to the disciplinary council for violating the code of ethics for national security officials, for breaching the duty of reserve, and for exposing an individual to verbal and physical assault. The video, which circulated on social media Friday, showed an officer slapping and verbally insulting Choukri, who was begging the officer not to seize his scooter. Choukri even fell on his knees to kiss the officer’s feet while the latter remained completely indifferent.

Rabat – Real Madrid’s captain, Sergio Ramos, has become the “most hated man” for Liverpool fans and Egyptians alike after sending football star Mohamed Salah off the field with a dislocated shoulder during the first half of the Champions League final. French sports news outlet L’Equipe wrote on Sunday that the Spanish player  committed several “highly controversial actions in the final between Real and Liverpool.” According to the French source, Ramos locked Salah’s hand under his armpit “in the manner of a judoka. With all his weight. The arm bends, the shoulder suffers.” The Salah takedown was not among Ramos’s first attempts to deliberately hurt Liverpool’s stars. According to L’Equipe, the Spaniard has also attempted to elbow Liverpool’s goalkeeper in the head. Ramos has been receiving global backlash from Egyptian football fans and Liverpool followers. The English football club, according to L’Equipe, had a successful start in the first 20 minutes of the game ahead of the injury of Salah. Football fans have launched a petition on Change.org, urging FIFA and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to punish Ramos for forcing Salah out of the Champions League final and the 2018 World Cup. The petition also called for the football organizations to punish Ramos for “acting that Liverpool players fouled him falsely, causing the referee to give [Sadio] Mane a yellow card he did not deserve.” The petition calls  Ramos “an awful example to future generations of football players.” International news outlets also reported pictures of Ramos laughing as Salah left the final game due to his injury.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has commented again on the ongoing boycott against “unjustified” price increases for food products. After apologizing to consumers, El Othmani said that the boycott mirrors a “cry of suffering” experienced by some middle-class citizens. El Othmani made his remarks during a national committee meeting of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), held at the headquarters of the party in Rabat on Saturday. El Othmani, who is also the Secretary-General of the PJD, said that the boycott campaign launched on April 20, is a “cry of suffering,” adding that it is the duty of the government to “understand this and undertake practical steps” to stop the suffering of citizens, in a statement published at the PJD’s official website. El Othmani confirmed that his cabinet has been following with a “great interest” the recent changes at the national level, reaffirming that the government must listen to the demands of citizens. “We will not ignore such a phenomenon or act as if it did not exist. This is our role, otherwise, we will not be up to the responsibilities,” El Othmani said. The head of government further explained that all steps undertaken by his cabinet in the first year of his mandate were aimed at “supporting the middle class and strengthening the purchasing power of citizens.” “When we increase the number of scholarship for students and develop employment in the public sector, both in education and in health, this undoubtedly supports purchasing power and the middle class,” he said. Several officials condemned the boycott, including Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi. El Khalfi denounced the boycott earlier this month, asserting that online activists’ claims of price increases are “fake news.” Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid also condemned the boycott and described boycott supporters as “madawikh” (fools). In response to the increasing tension between people supporting the boycott and government, El Othmani apologized to consumers for the harsh comment made by the officials.

Rabat – The Moroccan musical scene has, by definition, changed throughout the last decades of the twentieth century up to today.  Compared to the 1970s, Moroccans have neither the same political awareness, nor the same mode of thinking. The musical scene has moved from the top down. Nass El-Ghiwane, El-Malhoune, El-Ayta, Taktouta El-Jabaliya, and all the other purely Moroccan traditional songs disappeared with the fading of an audience who was able to understand and relate to the content of these songs. While Nass El-Ghiwane and El-Ayta used to tackle purely political issues, El-Malhoune addressed the daily life of women inside harems and love stories that took place in riad gardens and on rooftops. Nowadays, we barely find songs that tackle politics, even in the genre of rap, which has historically served as an outlet for criticism of the political and social environment. More than this, the concept of love has also radically diverged from older conceptions that the previous generations knew through songs like “Laghzal Fatma.” Due to modernity and globalization, Moroccan culture, and specifically the Moroccan musical scene, have almost completely lost their cultural specificity. With the arrival of pop music to Morocco, audiences of hard metal, rock, reggae, and even hip-hop decreased bit by bit. Pop has become the real medium to voice the daily challenges for the new Moroccan music generation. Thus, we had the emergence of new voices such as Saad Lamjarred, Aminux, Zouhair Bahaoui, Douzi, Ihab Amir, Ibtissam Tiskat, and Dounia Batma discussing love between young people, betrayal, and relationship problems in general. The content of rap music has also been affected by the new pop trend,but Muslim and many other rappers continue to raise awareness of social issues like poverty, corruption, and freedom of speech. In the history of music, pop served as a grand opportunity for female voices to be heard, while rapping was limited to male performers and fans. Girls who listened to rap were considered odd, as rap was directly related to only one gender in the Moroccan mindset. However, women continue to break into many different fields that used to be restricted only to men, including rap. Moroccan women began rapping in 2008, with the rise of the women’s rap group, “Tigress Flow.” Created by three girls—Miss ND, Soltana, and Miss Wiba—they performed first in the Boulevard of Young Musicians in Casablanca and Mawazine and were very well-known for two main songs, “Maghribiya” (Moroccan Girl) and “Kifash” (How/What) Soltana also released a single called “SawtNssa” (the Voice of Women). The women’s raps sought to express the problems that Moroccan women face in a patriarchal society. They sang from their own positions as women, and discussed their personal problems. They also sang wearing loose clothing to deemphasize sexuality typically attribute to female performers.Moreover, they avoided stereotypical images about the female body and swear words in an attempt toconvey a certain level of respect for the Moroccan context. After Tigress Flow, women rappers dipped in fame until 2017, when a new generation of rappers emerged. With the rise of the new generation, the essence of rap has radically changed. For Ilham Stati, Oumaima Lahlou, or Zineb Said, rap equates to nudity and swearing. Although they don’t proclaim this idea directly in their interviews, it is obvious in their music videos, which are mainly about exposing and emphasizing their feminine bodies. This reinforces stereotypes about women in the minds of girls, especially teenagers, who represent a large part of their audience and who will see them as role models and imitate them. Their lyrics are mostly about clashing with each other and about money; the word “dollar” is present in each of their songs. There is no hint of the focus on women’s issues and resistance to patriarchal society that was so present in the songs of the last generation of Moroccan women rappers. Rap may be about resistance, but these new female rappers are resisting resistance by exploiting a resistance tool to produce and emphasize different forms of power in society. It is useless to have a female body while the mind remains patriarchal.

Rabat – Authorities in Spain have captured a 47-year-old Spanish national for alleged sexual assault of Moroccan seasonal farmers in Huelva, in southwestern Spain. The suspect was arrested on Friday, May 25, according to Spanish news outlet El Espanol. The source reported that the alleged suspect was in charge of supervising seasonal farmers working in strawberry fields during working days.  El Espanol added that the suspect was questioned by the police and was released on bail. The arrest operation followed an exclusive press report by El Espanol, featuring several alleged Moroccan victims of sexual assault. “They know that we are poor, that we have children, that many of us are divorced or widowed, they blackmail us by depriving us of work if we do not surrender to their sexual desires,” said one of the alleged victims. The German investigative journalism NGO Correctiv published an investigation on May 2 in collaboration with RTL Nachtjournal and Buzzfeed News on Moroccan women farmers in Spain and in Morocco’s Souss Massa region in the south. In the report, women claimed that they were harassed, insulted, and raped in the field. Recently, the Ministry of Employment reported that it has opened an investigation; a Moroccan-Spanish delegation also carried out a visit on May 10-11 in the province of Huelva to inquire about the conditions of women farmers on Spanish farms. Following the visit, the ministry issued a statement, refuting claims that Moroccan seasonal agricultural farmers working in Spain are being harassed. The Ministry also explained that the working conditions of Moroccan women workers is in conformity to the employment contract concluded between the two parties. The workers allegedly received work permits from Spanish authorities to pick strawberries between April and June.

Rabat – The Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, and Higher Education have announced that this year’s baccalaureate final exams will be arranged accordingly for students with hearing problems as well as those with mental conditions such as autism. The ministry in a press release on Thursday that students with other special needs who are preparing to sit for the final exams scheduled for June 5-8 will receive extra exam time and an exam assistant. The alternative exam circumstances will be readied for both mental and physical disabilities. The initiative falls under the 2015-2030 strategic vision to define the outlines of the future Moroccan schools and provide all citizens with a high-quality education, carried out by the Higher Council for Education, Training, and Scientific Research. 
As usual, the baccalaureate examination tests will differ from region to region, and all exam candidates must pass multiple choice questions, closed-ended questions requiring explanation or justification, and open-ended questions requiring opinion or discussion,  according to the announcement. Cheating in baccalaureate exams On Friday, the Government Council approved a new draft decree that decries cheating in baccalaureate exams, including private educational institutions and vocational training establishments. The current anti-fraud law penalizes cheating candidates caught with smartphones, tablets, or other communication devices with six months to five years in jail, in addition to a fine ranging from MAD 5,000-100,000. The candidates are also prevented from taking the exams for two years. In 2016, the Ministry of Education prosecuted more than 3,048 cases of baccalaureate cheating. To fight this phenomenon, the ministry recently installed classroom cameras to raise awareness of the graveness of the act and to encourage a fair environment for the exams. Unfortunately, the measure is not implemented in all educational institutions, due to cost restrictions.

New York – In a recent interview with Fox News, Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita detailed the country’s security cooperation with the United States. This led to the extradition of a Hezbollah financier who was detained by Morocco’s intelligence last year. The financier, Bourita explained, was at the center of Hezbollah’s financial system in Africa. Although Hezbollah has been active in the continent for a while, until this point, it was not actively taking measures against Morocco. However, since the arrest of the financier, there has been a shift in Hezbollah’s focus, which culminated in the recent incident involving Iran’s cultural attaché in Algeria. The shift, Bourita posited, has to do with Iran’s strategy of destabilizing pro-Western governments around the world and looking to weaken Arab states specifically. To that effect, UAE’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah bin Zayed al Nahyan, acknowledged Iran-backed attacks on Morocco’s national sovereignty, as part of its pattern of attacks on Arab states, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. He reiterated UAE’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity and severance of relations with the Islamic Republic. Hezbollah’s activities in Africa is not a new story for Morocco or the Gulf States. The Gulf States responded to Iran’s long-term presence in Africa by increasing their own hard and soft influence throughout the continent via building bases, backing military forces, providing humanitarian aid, and recruiting affiliates to mosques and religious schools. Recently, Morocco turned heads by presenting evidence of Iran’s intelligence operations in violation of the ceasefire agreement between Polisario and Morocco; there has been little public discussion among those states of Iran’s threat on that front. The United States intelligence services were well aware of Hezbollah’s activity in Africa well before the financier’s arrest. Moroccan cooperation allowed them access to more information in the months that followed. The discussion of Hezbollah’s threatening actions in Africa and the expansion of its financing network kept away from the public, remained limited to the narrow circles of professionals. There was no hint that the U.S. government considered the network’s nefarious activities in Africa as part of Hezbollah’s global reach or threat to its interests. It was only after Morocco’s announcement that the State Department gave a nod to Iran’s presence in Africa. Iran’s presence included the backing of assorted terrorist and separatist groups, interest in naval bases and domination of waterways, mirrors the Islamic Republic’s alarming strategy in the Middle East. Why such seeming lack of interest in the terrorist network’s below-the-radar activities in Africa? Could it be that the United States simply underestimated the extent of the involvement? Did U.S. intelligence fail to convey Iran’s noticeably traceable strategy to the policymakers? Or, did the Trump administration turn a blind eye to the continent because it considered Africa a low priority, and sufficiently distant not to present particular interest to its potential involvement? The last is doubtful given the extent of U.S. participation in various counterterrorist operations in West Africa, and it’s base in Djibouti. Indeed, there has been much discussion about Iran’s access to Yemen through Somalia, and potentially, its use access to a friendly port of call in Eritrea. It is not quite that simple. In February 2018, U.S. sanctions targeted a number of Hezbollah affiliated businesses, including some in West Africa.  Furthermore, as far back as October 2017, the U.S. counterterror operations found Hezbollah weapons caches in Kuwait, which has a significant Shi’a population, and Nigeria, where Iran is actively supporting Shi’a militia, a fact well known to locals yet rarely discussed in the media. At the time, the U.S. announced its intentions to go after Hezbollah particularly in South America, yet also pushed its African and Asian allies to sanction Hezbollah members and associated entities. This was noted in some sources but generated little discussion. Despite Hezbollah’s accusations that Morocco acted under U.S., Saudi, or Israeli pressure, the attack on Morocco’s national sovereignty is what ultimately culminated in the country’s dramatic move. Indeed, the U.S. has not been seen as pressuring any nation to break relations with Iran itself; rather, part of its strategy was to create a viable alliance of states willing to sanction entities linked to Iran’s IRGC, as well as proxies. Looking back, it becomes clear that despite lack of media attention, Congress was aware of Hezbollah’s activities in Africa. In June 2017, the House produced a document detailing Hezbollah’s financial dealings, noting aggressive funding and partnership with criminal enterprises in South America and Africa.  A discerning reader can learn from an article published in 2012, that Iran has been active in Africa for decades, focusing its attention on exploiting weak, corrupt, or unstable state systems through soft influence such as peddling, arms deals, and easy access to its market. For a majority of the time, Iran’s focus on illicit activity resided through West Africa spanning to Congo, looking to influence the Middle East through the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, Hezbollah’s activity in Africa goes back for just as long. In both parts of the continent, Hezbollah was active in weapons smuggling and various criminal enterprises. It eventually spread throughout central African states, even reaching Djibouti, the base for U.S. AFRICOM. Its expansion to North Africa, in alliance with Algeria and Polisario, illustrates the successful evasion of international scrutiny. Its uninhibited trek through the continent was met with little resistance from local governments and less so by unaffiliated groups who were eager to make easy money. One of the most successful organized crime ventures for the Lebanon-based movement was the control of the illegal diamond trade in West Africa. Illegal diamonds, which profited the “Lebanese Resistance Attachments,” also known as AMAL, facilitated large-scale diamond smuggling, which financed Hezbollah’s terrorist activities. The diamonds often ended up in Antwerp, Belgium.  AMAL also had connections to Sierra Leone, Congo, and other places in Africa. In addition to these sophisticated networks, Hezbollah was also active in food-related smuggling rings, shakedowns of Lebanese merchants in West Africa, narco-trafficking, and various fraudulent schemes. By the early 2000s, other groups started taking advantage of the diamond trade, causing Hezbollah to lose its edge and therefore shift to other sources of revenue. Drug trade, with narco-states such as Guinea-Bissau, became a more significant part of Hezbollah’s financial portfolio, even earning it special fatwas of dispensation from Shi’a clerics. This cooperation stretched via Lebanon to South America, in close collaboration with Colombia’s FARC. The drug route from Guinea-Bissau followed Mauritania (a state also well familiar to Polisario’s light arms trafficking), Mali, and Niger, and then went onwards to Europe through North Africa’s Mediterranean coast. This activity laid a foundation for Hezbollah’s later shift to North Africa and saw the potential for intelligence and military activity. They saw a possibility of destabilizing the region and distracting countries like Morocco, from playing a constructive role in educating African imams; thus countering Iranian influence in West and Central Africa and elsewhere. Likewise, Hezbollah was able to co-opt local Sunni groups scattered throughout the continent, to play a supportive role. Some states, such as South Africa, openly backed Iran. Iran and Hezbollah, in addition to Al Qaeda and Boko Haram, were able to take advantage of local hardships, human rights abuses, and economic issues in Nigeria in order to co-opt local institutions and appeal to the broader population. In addition to exploiting Islamists, Iran worked to establish arms smuggling through Nigeria to other parts of the continent.  Western security services, however, kept track of its activities, and in one instance, helped Nigerian Security Services intercept a ship loaded with weapons. However, Iran was not deterred and continued to persist in countries, such as Kenya, while also working to destabilize the Horn of Africa, where it focused much of its activity. It looked to expand its influence to the Saudi-backed Sudan and Somalia, which provided it easy access to Yemen. Sudan, a solidly Sunni state, which is part of the Arab Coalition in Yemen, has recently been diversifying its portfolio of backers by cutting deals with Turkey and Qatar. Tehran, however, has not given up on peddling influence and has established a Somali Revolutionary Guard in Sudan, trained by both Iranians and Hezbollah contingent, much like the Houthis in Yemen. Iran was also active on a government level. Hezbollah’s influence peddling in Khartoum is detailed in the U.S. State Department’s profile of Sudan as a hub for assorted terrorist groups, going back to 1989. Hezbollah eventually ran into a confrontation with Egypt when it looked to smuggle weapons into Gaza during the war with Israel. Egypt eventually ended up arresting a group of Hezbollah operatives. The extent of Iranian and Hezbollah’s influence in Africa is immediately observable, and the U.S. both publicly and privately, kept record of these activities. With the exception of occasionally tipping off local intelligence services, the U.S. appeared perfectly content with not making Hezbollah’s troublemaking a top priority, much less a front-page item. The extent of Hezbollah’s African financing and criminality is noted years prior to the extensive study referenced above. In 2004, the Washington Institute for Near East Studies complained that Hezbollah’s activities remained uninterrupted. The article notes that in 2003 a Lebanese aircraft crashed in Benin with two Hezbollah operatives on board. What were they doing there? Even as early on as the beginning of the decade, U.S. and Israeli officials duly noted that Africa presented a lucrative opportunity for terrorist financing for Hezbollah, as well as its Iranian backer. Shakedowns, illicit diamond trade, front companies, influence peddling, and even recruitment of students from Uganda to Iran-backed universities were noted even then. Israeli intelligence noted terrorist plots to abduct Israeli businessmen and diplomats in Africa. The article notes the proactive measures Western and African intelligence agencies have taken to counter Al Qaeda’s influence, as well as the spread of other Sunni groups; yet Hezbollah somehow, remained uninhibited. The article describes Hezbollah as operating “financial, logistical, and operational” branch in Africa, essentially milking the continent with a great deal of output in return for very little trouble or international reaction. It seems that this pattern of activity has continued unabated to this day – until Iran tried to interfere directly in Morocco’s ongoing conflict with Polisario and overplayed its hand, finally forcing the world to acknowledge out loud, the extent of its success in the continent. Still, in light of obvious and overwhelming evidence about the extent of Iran’s involvement in Africa, noted both by the public and intelligence agencies for decades, in conjunction with Morocco’s strained relation with Iran regarding Polisario, the U.S. reaction has been minimal, relatively speaking. Its sanctions of determined there were seven Hezbollah affiliated business in February though undoubtedly many more such entities deal with Iran and Hezbollah throughout the continent. To date, little to no action has been taken, despite various regular reports on Hezbollah’s financial activity in Africa. Morocco’s significant measures to protect itself remains the talk of the Middle East even weeks later. Despite the U.S. JCPOA withdrawal and Bourita’s dramatic account to Fox News, the U.S. administration has yet to take strategic steps in response to these revelations. Much can be done now that Iran’s presence has been outed and denounced. Increasingly, it seems that rather than reacting to U.S. pressure, Morocco hoped to finally draw attention to Iran’s scheming in its neighborhood with taking very public steps in defense of its national security interests. The United States in conjunction with Moroccan intelligence, should strengthen its relationship and devote a specialized, small and flexible taskforce devoted to tracing Iran’s and Hezbollah’s financing and other activities in the region. This would result in creating viable coalitions to counter these movements, and responding to the spread of extremism and terrorist activity by Hezbollah in the region. The U.S. should also be taking a harder look at Polisario’s violations of the ceasefire activities, as its partnership with Hezbollah is now making it complicit in international terrorism. Further, the U.S. should publicize additional studies and information about Hezbollah’s and Iranian activity in North Africa, and other parts of the continent and focus on targeting individuals, entities, and governments for severe and consistent sanctions for any involvement with this organization or other illegal Iranian proxies and forces. It should also strengthen its economic and educational partnerships with Morocco, and work closely with Rabat, as well as other moderate allies in the region to counter Iran’s soft influence peddling which includes ideological outreach, recruitment, and spread of extremist ideology throughout the economy.  Prophylactic operations, as well as preventative measures, such as investments in entrepreneurship and displaying Western influence in local populations, can go a long way for offering alternatives to Iran’s aggressive interventionism. Iran’s interest in Africa is geopolitical as well as tactical. Iran seeks control of strategic waterways, the building of additional naval bases, control of strategic infrastructures, including ports, for smuggling weapons and terrorists, and monopolizing trade routes and encouraging piracy. It also seeks to create destabilization, as that is both easier and cheaper for a country with a weak economy and dissatisfied population than investing a flow of funds into building up viable economies and networks. In addition to sowing chaos wherever possible, and facilitating criminal activity, Iran seeks to undermine pro-Western governments. This is done via aligning with and arming local terrorist groups, providing weapons to existing terrorist groups, even those with contrasting religious and ideological proclivities, coopting governments and recruiting followers. If left unattended, Iran can easily create flexible armies of followers, following the model of Iran-backed Hamas, Hezbollah, and Houthis, to stage terrorist attacks, engage in espionage, abduct foreigners, travel around the world on terrorist missions, or for the sake of facilitating warfare. The United States can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to the obvious. It must heed the warnings of Morocco, take advantage of this brief window of opportunity, and crank up the pressure on Iran and its proxies in Africa, in defense of its allies and the U.S. own interests in preventing the spread of terrorism and financing of Iran’s hegemonic adventures.

Rabat – Morocco’s food quality control boards seized and destroyed 50 tons of food products unfit for human consumption during the first week of Ramadan. A statement from the Ministry of General Affairs and Governance notes that the seized commodities included four tons of milk products, 16 tons of flour and cereals, five tons of fish and meat, 14 tons of dates, two tons of fruit and vegetables,  and 11 tons of other foodstuffs typically consumed during the holy month of Ramadan, including other milk products. The statement was issued after the interministerial commission in charge of food and prices monitoring held on Thursday in Rabat. The control operations covered 10,385 points of sale during this period.  The commission added that the available data showcases that majority of prices are stable, with the exception of fish prices that recorded a significant increase during this period. In April, Moroccan citizens have joined the boycott against high prices of products made by three companies: Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone, and Afriquia. Recently, the boycott extended its reach to include fish. Those supporting the boycott emphasize that there is no justification for such high prices at the fish market in a country with more than 2,000 miles of coastline. On Wednesday, a group of young people took to the Souk Bani Hassan marketplace in Tetouan and violently destroyed the merchandise of several fishmongers. Fish prices, including that of sardines—one of the cheapest and most widely available products— hovers around MAD 30 in different cities across the country, including Tetouan and Rabat. According to the statement, the committee is closely monitoring the price situation of all the most consumable foodstuffs and will not hesitate to apply the provisions of the law in force in case of monopoly or speculation. Ahead of Ramadan, the government pledged to reassure a “diversified” market that responds to all the needs of citizens during the holy month of Ramadan.  The cabinet has also established a national hotline to receive possible complaints from both traders and consumers concerning the price of Ramadan supplies.

Rabat – Authorities in Tangier arrested a policeman for alleged connections to drug-related crimes with a  criminal network in the port of Tangier on Saturday evening. The arrest operation was conducted in collaboration between the Prefectural Police Department and the General Directorate of National Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The arrest of the alleged suspect was carried out after months of investigations, said a statement of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The arrested policeman was caught in possession of 115 kilograms of cannabis that he was intending to deliver to his accomplices to smuggle them abroad, a statement added. DGSN added that one of his accomplices was also arrested. The two defendants were placed in custody for a further investigation conducted under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office to arrest the other suspects linked to the drug trafficking network. On Monday, May 21,  the police caught two truckers with a large quantity of psychotropic tablets, which they attempted to import to Morocco aboard an international cargo truck. Last month, customs police in the port seized 490 kilograms of cannabis resin. Police arrested the driver and placed him in custody. Also in April, police seized 53 kilograms of cannabis in a shipping truck on its way to Spain. The authorities arrested the truck driver after X-rays revealed the drugs concealed behind the vehicle frame and the engine cooling system.

Rabat – Beating Liverpool 3-1 Saturday during Champions League Final match in Kiev, Ukraine, Real Madrid will remember the historic victory for a long time. As part of the triumphant team, Achraf Hakimi has become the first Moroccan footballer to win the Champions League with Los Blancos. Real Madrid has managed to win the Champions League for the third consecutive year, scoring three goals in today’s match thanks to Karim Benzema, who scored the first goal 50 minutes into the game and Gareth Bale, who scored the second two goals. Bale’s bicycle kick carried Real Madrid to a 3-1 victory over Liverpool; a memorable moment for both the winning and losing team. In the first half of the match, Sergio Ramos took down Mohamed Salah, causing him an arm injury. As Salah left the field in tears, Real Madrid emerged as the first team to win three straight European titles, apart from Bayern Munich in 1976. In April, speculations about Hakimi leaving Real Madrid spread like wildfire in both the Moroccan and international press. However, Zinedine Zidane said in a press conference that Hakimi will continue to play:  “Achraf Hakimi, Borja Mayoral, and Marcos Llorente have to play ’20 or 25 games’ next year to continue their development,” he said. The 19-year old Hakimi made his official debut at the Santiago Bernabeu in October 2017, He has since become one of Morocco’s most important players, managing to make the list of Moroccans who will play in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. As a side note, Hakimi and his Atlas Lions teammates will play their first game against Iran on June 15, and their second game against Portugal on June 20. Morocco will play the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25.

Rabat- Rahmouna Ziani from Meknes was recently appointed as the King’s Public Prosecutor at the Commercial Court of Appeals in Fez, making her the first woman to hold the position in Morocco. On Monday, May 14, the Supreme Council of the Judiciary organized Ziani’s appointment ceremony, which was supervised by Head of the Supreme Council of Accounts Driss Jettou in the presence of the Crown Prosecutor, Mohamed Abd Nabaoui. A number of judicial officers and representatives from Fez and Meknes’ courts of first Instance and courts of appeals also attended. Ziani graduated from the Higher Magistrates’ Institute back in 1979 and has worked as Deputy Prosecutor in Meknes, Khemisset, and Fez’s Courts of Appeals and First Instance until her promotion to Public Prosecutor. On the occasion of Ziani’s promotion, Aicha Ait El Hajj and Kalthoum Tawab were also appointed as deputy prosecutors of the court of first instance in Casablanca and the commercial court of appeals in Meknes. In recent years, women have succeeded in achieving positions that were previously only help by men i, such as police officers and parliamentary positions. However, they only represent two percent in the upper house of parliament and 17 percent in the lower house, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The same source revealed, based on 2013 statistics, that Morocco ranked eighth in the Arab World and 107th worldwide for the number of women elected to the legislature. Several Moroccan organizations, such as IKHAE Fraternité Association – a non-profit organization that seeks to empower women through educational programs and helps them gain financial independence – are calling for greater gender equality, including the integration of women into the economic and political spheres,.  In turn, the government has made a number of legal amendments to enhance the presence of women in positions of employment that have traditionally been occupied by men exclusively. In January, King Mohammed VI opened up adoul (official public notary) positions to women for the first time. In Morocco, a public notary typically handles paperwork concerned with property sales and marriage commercial contracts. These duties were previously carried out by religious men certified by the government to draft marriage papers and manage inheritance matters. On Sunday, May 6, more than 7,000 women took the admission test to become public notaries for the first time in the kingdom. Nevertheless, seven out of 10 men (70 percent) in the country believe that women belong in the home, according to a survey conducted by the UN, involving 2,889 households.

Rabat – The city of Marrakech will host the 2021 Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in October 2021. The decision came after a vote by the boards of governors of the IMF and WBG in April, according to a statement by the IMF. The choice of Morocco marks the 60th anniversary of the country’s membership in both organizations since 1958. The October 2021 meeting will convene central bankers, ministers of finance, private sector executives, media, and academics.  The attendees will discuss global concerns, “including the world economic outlook, global financial stability, poverty eradication, inclusive economic growth, climate change and job creation,” the statement added. Traditionally, the annual meetings of both institutions are held over two consecutive years at the WBG and IMF headquarters in Washington D.C and every third year in another member country. The last time the meetings were in Africa was in 1973 when they were held in Nairobi, Kenya. This year’s annual meetings will take place in Indonesia in October. During the event, the official signing ceremony for the 2021 Meetings in Morocco will be concluded. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported in April that the 2021 meetings will be an opportunity to underscore Morocco’s structural reforms as well as the economic progress the country has made. They will also provide a forum for international decision-makers and experts to discuss the means of developing international and regional cooperation.

Rabat – The release date of the FIFA task force assessments, which evaluates Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid and North American joint bid, has been delayed. FIFA’s task force was expected to announce its final decision on 2020 World Cup bids on May 29. French sports outlet L’Equipe reported on Friday that the task force will announce its decision in the first week of June. FIFA task force will meet with both committees of the 2026 World Cup in Zurich on May 30 to answer questions of the five-member task force. The task force has the legitimacy to disqualify one of the bids if it does not meet FIFA’s requirements. The countdown to the FIFA vote, which is set to take place on June 13 in the presence of 211 football federations, has begun. Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid committee received the task force on April 16. The five-member committee spent three days in several Moroccan cities in order to evaluate Morocco’s assets and capacity to host the 23rd world’s premier tournament in 2026. The Moroccan bid committee said in April that the task force expressed their admiration for the quality of Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Chairman of the Moroccan bid committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy said that the FIFA delegation  felt the passion of the whole population” for the tournament, which “clearly highlights the fact that Morocco as a whole is a candidate.” FIFA’s Task Force committee included Chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee Tomaž Vesel; Chairman of the Governance Committee Mukul Mudgal; Member of the Organising Committee for Competitions Ilcho Gjorgjioski; FIFA Deputy Secretary General (Administration) Marco Villiger; and FIFA Deputy Secretary General (Football) Zvonimir Boban.

Rabat – Nearly a month after Morocco announced its decision to cut ties with Iran, Secretary General of Iranian proxy Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah has denied that his party has a relation with the Polisario Front. This is the first time for Nasrallah to comment on the Polisario-Hezbollah collusion publicly. Nasrallah made his remarks on Friday in a televised address marking Lebanon’s Resistance and Liberation Day. “We do not have a relation with the Polisario Front,” said Nasrallah. He also claimed that Morocco presented no proof of the Polisario-Hezbollah collusion. “The motive behind this accusation was to sever Morocco’s ties with Iran.” Nasrallah’s statements came three days after Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita reiterated Morocco’s accusations in an interview with US-based news outlet Fox News. In his discussion with Fox News, Bourita warned that Iran’s interference in Arab nations’ internal affairs “is unlikely to stop.” “I think it is clear that the interference of Iran in the internal affairs of the Arab and Muslim countries won’t stop in (the) Middle-East and in the Gulf countries,” Bourita said. Morocco cut ties with Iran on May 1, accusing the Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah for supporting the Polisario Front and training its separatist members in the Tindouf camps of Algeria. Since Morocco announced its decision to sever ties with Iran, Bourita has repeatedly stated that Morocco presented detailed evidence to Iran documenting the Polisario-Hezbollah collusion. The evidence includes details and “proven and precise facts: dates of visits by senior officers of Hezbollah in Algeria, dates and venues of meetings with Polisario officials and a list of names of agents involved in these contacts,” Bourita said in a previous interview with Jeune Afrique.

Rabat – The Yves Saint Laurent Museum in Marrakech won the AFEX (French Export Architects) award on Thursday, May 24 during a ceremony in Venice, Italy. This award recognizes the best achievements of French agencies in foreign lands. This year, it was granted to the Marrakchi museum, which opened in October 2017 and was designed by Karl Fournier and Oliver Marty, architects from Studio KO. The building was selected to receive the award over nine other finalists and has historical significance for Morocco. During their first stay in Marrakech, the late designer and Pierre Bergé, a co-founder of Yves Saint Laurent, fell in love with Majorelle Garden, which they bought in 1980. AFEX is not YSL Museum’s first award. In 2017, it was named among the most influential buildings of the year by the prestigious magazine, Architectural Design. In 2018, it was awarded the “Best New Public Building” by the British magazine, Wallpaper. Covering an area of 4,000 m2, the Marrakech museum contains a permanent exhibition space that displays Laurent’s work, a room for temporary exhibitions, a 130-seat auditorium, a café-restaurant, a bookshop, and a research library. The library will house 5,000 books on topics including Arabic and Andalusian history, botany, history of fashion, and poetry. Built out of local terracotta, concrete, and earth-colored terrazzo, the museum will be situated opposite the designer’s Majorelle Gardens. Together with the Berber museum, it draws approximately 700,000 visitors each year. The French architecture company, Studio KO, drew inspiration for the building from “the duality of curves and lines, and the succession of loose and clean cuts” found in Laurent’s collections.

Rabat – The Moroccan Treasury has a deficit of MAD 7.6 billion in the first quarter of 2018, a slight improvement from the MAD 8 billion in the same period a year ago, says the Directorate of Treasury and External Finance (DTFE). The lowered deficit was mainly driven by a decrease in overall expenditures, at a greater rate than that of revenue, especially tax revenue, explained the DTFE in its May 2018 business outlook. Tax revenue has declined by 1.7 percent to MAD 986 million in the first quarter of 2018, implying a drop of 10.1 percent to MAD 2.9 billion in direct taxes and rise by 5.2 percent to stand at MAD 1 billion in indirect taxes. The drop in direct taxes is primarily due to a decline in corporate taxes revenue (IS) by 16.7 percent to MAD 14.9 billion, the result of poor performance in 2017 of the financial sector, petroleum companies, the national agency of land conservation, cement plants, sugar companies, and telecommunications companies compared to 2016. In addition, revenue from income tax (IR) rose by 1.1 percent to MAD 10.5 billion. Concerning indirect taxes, value added tax (VAT) rose by 7.1 percent to MAD 997 million, due to the progression of both internal VAT and import VAT by 6 percent to stand at MAD 320 million and 7.8 percent to MAD 677 million, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from consumption internal taxes (TIC) increased slightly by 1 percent to MAD 6.5 billion from the same period a year ago. Revenue from customs fees increased by 22.7 percent to MAD 468 million. Registration and stamp duties improved by 6.8 percent to MAD 378 million. Non-tax revenues decreased by 18 percent to MAD 375 million, primarily due to the diminution in competition funds to MAD 48 million from MAD 116 million. In addition, gas pipeline royalties appreciated to MAD 482 million from MAD 317 million, and revenue from debt relief to MAD 177 million from MAD 116 million. Ordinary expenditures recorded a drop of 2.6 percent to MAD 1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2018 in comparison to the same period in 2017. The trend is caused by a decrease in salary costs and interest on debt. Both expenditures on compensation charges and interest on debt have also dropped by 14.4 percent to MAD 656 million, and by 13.5 percent to MAD 914 million, respectively. The drop is primarily related to the decline of interest charges on domestic debt, while the external debt has remained stable in comparison to the same period in 2017. Operation expenditures has recorded a slight increase of 0.3 percent to MAD 124 million, driven mainly by the increase of 613 million dirhams (2.3 percent) of salaries, while other goods and services recorded a decrease of 489 million dirhams (2.8 percent). Investment expenditures amounted to MAD 19 billion, a drop of MAD 2.5 billion (11.7 percent) in comparison to March 2017. The Treasury’s borrowing requirement stands at nearly 13 billion dirhams against 14.8 billion dirhams a year ago, given the MAD 5.3 billion decrease in expenditures pending a payment and a positive balance of MAD 7.8 billion of the Treasury’s special accounts.

Rabat- A video showing policeman physically and verbally abusing a scooter driver has caused nationwide outrage. The clip of the Khouribga teacher’s violence against a student in his class had not yet faded from memory when a new video surfaced. The video shows an officer in the security services slapping and verbally insulting the man, who was begging the officer not to seize his scooter. The citizen even fell on his knees to kiss the officer’s feet while the latter remained completely indifferent. The video, which has been circulating on Facebook and YouTube this past week, caused considerable controversy. While some deemed the violence “unacceptable” and “humiliating,” others claimed that the officer was simply doing his job. More than simply provoking controversy, the video also helped expose the police officer to the DGSN. Abdellatif Hammouchi, the director of the DGSN, decided Friday to forward his case tour the disciplinary council and suspended him from all his duties as member of security services.

By Abdul Hafiz Ali Sutacio Rabat – My name is Hafiz. I am a travel journalist and blogger from Malaga, Spain, but originally from the Philippines. Some facts about me: I was born with Filipino parents and my mother’s side is Hispanic. I spoke Spanish, Chavacano, and Filipino while growing up. The Philippines was a Spanish colony for 300 years and was a province of Mexico. Most of our last names are Spanish—De la Cruz, Santiago, Francisco, urghhh,  you name it. But wait, what? “Japon?” “Ni hao” “Jackie Chan” “Korea!” “Wapaaah!” Moroccan men and quite a few of the women blurt this out from the narrow streets of every corner of the Medinas and Kasbahs when I visited the North African country for the fourth time.  I was mistaken as Jackie Chan or the brother of a kung fu master, which I heard five times a day. I felt like my identity crisis was about to unfold while chewing a Miloui bread with my Moroccan best friend, Salah. No, he is like my adopted brother to me. If you read my previous article “My Travel Confession from Morocco,” I can’t hide my love of this country, despite the negative news that has been published on some travel websites. In fact, when a travel company based in Canada asked for my ultimate bucket list for 2018, without a doubt the famous Sahara Desert was on it. I wonder why Moroccans often think that Asians are all the same. Morocco is the only country to which I will always be coming back. However, I believe its geographical proximity to Europe means that we, as Asians, make up a small percentage of the tourists. So, perhaps their curiosity is justified. Morocco is a modern nation but it is still a highly patriarchal community and men possess a heightened sense of privilege. I read horrifying accounts online about groping and cat-calling incidents from other travelers and bloggers. Maybe this would explain why men are more visible in some places of Morocco.  Cafes are the most dominant place for Moroccan men. Although, Millennials in general are now visible in some cafes, aside from the Hammams for women. I met my Spanish friend Alexandra and a travel photographer in Marrakech. She is in and out of the country despite being warned by her followers and friends to skip Morocco for solo travel. I was waiting for another train route going to Casablanca when a Moroccan man approached me and smiled. “Salam”. Then the million-dollar question followed. “Where are you from?” I didn’t expect that. “Japanese?” he asked again before my first million-dollar answer could get out of my mouth. “No, I am not Japanese and I am not Chinese. I know Jackie Chan but we are not related.” He laughed. He said sorry about it. What I encountered more were passersby playing guessing games on where my friend and I are from. We spent some days in Casablanca, a very laid-back city, where we met some of our friends. We went to the port near Hassan Mosque and a waiter from a nearby restaurant approached us. After learning that I am a Filipino, he asked me if I read and write Japanese. “I don’t know Nihonggo and that’s what the Japanese language is called.”  In all of the stories we heard about Morocco, we were told not to do things alone. Whether you are a man or a woman, travelers can learn from this country no matter what. I think our world has a lot of issues that need to be addressed. Morocco is not a perfect country but neither are any others. What I am sure of is that my experience as a travel journalist moulded me to be better because of this country. In my fourth time visiting, I would say that street harassment was not the concern of my experience. Not once was my personal safety threatened. “Un jus d’orange, merci.”  Farewell, Morocco, until my next adventure…

Rabat – Morocco is among the top ten African nations in terms of digital development, according to Moulay Hafid Elalamy, the Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade and Digital Economy. Elalamy was in Paris this Friday to speak about the development of the digital economy in Morocco during an event titled “Morocco: A Gateway to Innovation in Digital Africa.”  The event was organized under the umbrella of the Viva Tech Show, which draws thousands of attendees from across the globe.  This year’s edition celebrated African startups and featured participants from Morocco, Rwanda, South Africa, Tunisia and Nigeria. Mohamed Laklalech, OCP’s (Office chérifien des phosphates) Chief Digital Officer, discussed the role of increasing digitalization in the industrial sector. Hicham Serghini, the CEO of Central Guarantee, joined the roundtable to outline the mechanisms that provide funding for startups. Serghini noted that such funding involves several parties, such as seed and venture capital companies. Morocco’s first-ever official Viva Tech event was co-organized by the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy, the Digital Development Agency and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency. In addition to the roundtable discussion, 16 Moroccan startups were selected to take part in the show. They presented their innovations, interacted with industry stakeholders and established relationships with investors and other major players. The event sought to introduce investors and major global contractors to Morocco’s tech ecosystem while positioning it on the international chessboard of technological innovation.

Rabat – The French TV channel TV5 Monde showcased the geographical and cultural diversity of the Moroccan southern city of Dakhla in a four-minute documentary by French TV producer Thierry Pérouse in 2017. The documentary, “Dakhla, une province en mutation,” illustrates the many booming industries of the southern province, including the handicrafts industry, which exemplifies beauty and cultural diversity of Moroccan southern provinces. With a population of more than 100,000, Dakhla is “the most southern and largest” region in Morocco. The video introduces the audience to a handicraft center that offers training and job opportunities for many Moroccans living in and around the Sahara. The documentary also featured interviews with craftspeople, who share and express their passion for handicrafts with TV5 Monde. A woman working in the handicraft center explains that their task is to preserve the Sahrawi (Saharan) heritage through handiwork. A craftsman and a jewelry maker in the region also state that people have shops, as a result of the royal instructions of King Mohammed VI, which promote human development in southern provinces of Morocco. In conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the Green March in 2015, King Mohammed VI launched development projects in Laayoune to enhance the influence of the Sahara region as an economic hub. In a speech delivered on the 41th anniversary of the Green March, the King reiterated the need for Morocco’s responsibility to fulfill development and stability of the Moroccan southern provinces. The French TV channel TF1 published in April a 17-minute video, which features the beauty of Morocco’s “southern pearl.” TF1 staff has lauded Dakhla, remarking that, “Between its ocean and desert, it [Dakhla] has become a haven for surfing and kite-surfing enthusiasts, and more broadly, a paradise for all those who dream adventuring off the beaten path.” Dakhla is renowned of its surfing venues, deemed a haven for international tourists and surfers. There are now ten flights to Dakhla per week departing from Casablanca, two direct flights from Las Palmas (located in the Canary Islands), and one flight from Paris, which departs once per week.

Rabat – The Directorate General of National Security (DGSN) has “categorically” denied that its members celebrated the 62nd anniversary of its services by “publicly” showcasing the IWI Tavor X95, a bullpup assault rifle produced and designed by Israel Weapon Industries. In a statement published on Friday, the DGSN said that a foreign news website published a report indicating that its members used Israeli-made firearms in parades celebrating the 62nd anniversary of the DGSN, held on May 17 in Kenitra.  DGSN’s statement referred to a report published by Mena Defense and reported by several Moroccan news outlets, including Le Desk and Yabiladi. Two days ago, Mena Defense claimed that DGSN featured a parade “equipped with an Israeli IWI Tavor X95 9MM assault rifle.” The source further claimed that Morocco is the first North African country “to publicly use” the Israeli firearms, adding that Morocco is “used to purchasing Israeli equipment.” In response, DGSN has “categorically denied the news  reported by some national media outlets.” The statement added that the firearms acquisition deals reported by Mena Defense“ were concluded with a specialized European company” in accordance with the provisions and requirements of relevant national legislation. DGSN celebrated its anniversary in the presence of high-level officials, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, Minister of the Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, General Director of DGSN Abdellatif Hammouchi, and foreign dignitaries, including US Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Stephanie Miley. The performances ranged from an equestrian show, drug-sniffing dogs jumping through flaming hoops, synchronized motorcycle riding, taekwondo, a ninja-like handcuffing exercise, thwarting of a hypothetical attempted assassination, and hypothetical forced entries against hostile combatants followed by a police chase.

Rabat – The Qatari-based international sports channel, beIN Sports, will offer free broadcasts of the 22 games featuring Arab countries in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.  The decision follows an alleged piracy operation conducted by Saudi-based channel BeOutQ. Europe1 reported today that the Saudi channel pirated the transmission of FIFA’s 64 games in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. BeIN Sports has the rights to feature the Champions League, FIFA’s World Cup finals, and the Premier League throughout the Middle East. The Independent said that BeOutQ is “geo-locked.” However, people using internet across Saudi Arabia can access the channel for GBP 80. In response, BeIN Sports spent GBP 120,000 to stop the hackers. The Independent quoted Managing Director of beIN Sports Tom Keaveny, saying that “the pirated signal is being transmitted by the Riyadh-based satellite provider Arabsat, whose largest shareholder is the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.” Keaveney further explained that the BeOutQ action “takes industrial scale knowledge and ability and multimillion-dollar funding.” On June 4, six Gulf countries led by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain, announced their intention to cut all diplomatic ties with Qatar, citing its alleged involvement in funding terrorist groups. Saudi Arabia then announced its intention to launch the largest sports network, PBS Sports, to compete with the Qatari sports network.

New York – Professor Wael Hallaq’s The Impossible State is one of the most important, groundbreaking and erudite books on the subject of “modernity and Islam.” It should be read, indeed studied carefully, by every person who is even slightly concerned with the calamitous situation that our global community and planet are undergoing and have been suffering from for centuries.  The fact that this disease called modernity is getting exponentially more lethal with the passage of time is hardly a controversial statement. We can readily observe evidence for this claim in the symptoms this illness continues to exhibit, such as the massacre of the Palestinian people, a genocide which large segments of the “human” population, patently devoid of our last shreds of humanity, witness in silence (another symptom). As I have written before here and elsewhere, we are all accountable for this genocide. Cowardice and silence are not an option.   Although The Impossible State does not specifically address the tragic situation of the Palestinians, it does elucidate its cause, which is also the source of the discontent, emptiness and fragmentation most modern subjects experience on a daily basis. Professor Hallaq takes a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose the problems of modernity and, grounded in his unparalleled knowledge of Islamic history in general and the Sharia in particular, produces a unique critique of modernity from out side modernity.  By seriously engaging epistemes different from the one it assesses, Professor Hallaq shows us that alternative, more ethical ways of life, and different political formations existed for millennia and can exist again. By looking outside the assumptions that created the dire situation the world is in and using Islamic premodernity and its postulations, Professor Hallaq analyzes the problems of modernity. He asserts, among many other things, that the present Muslim crisis is not actually “Muslim:” It does not arise from modern Islam but from modernity itself.  The Impossible State successfully escapes the thought-prisons of the liberal state and looks for viable ideas elsewhere. Professor Hallaq proposes capitalizing on Islamic history as “a resource to face the challenges of the modern project, a project that has proved incapable of solving even those problems of its own making.”  Although the Sharia is institutionally defunct and the desire to restore it as such would be absurd and impossible, “much that is psychologically and spiritually latent has survived” and can be used as a moral resource (p. 13). Indeed, many Muslims attempt, to the best of their ability, to orient their lives according to the guidance and wisdom derived from the Islamic tradition, albeit constrained as they necessarily are by the all-penetrating mechanisms of the state.  Using the moral Sharia-centered paradigm as an example and challenging the liberalist universalizing theory of progress, Professor Hallaq demonstrates that the modern state is neither the pinnacle of human development nor will it be everlasting. Alternative modes of thinking may lead us to healthier results.  The ideas in this book are not only intellectually stimulating, bold and highly original, but also profoundly necessary and urgent. If we are to change course and prevent further destruction and genocides, which are direct results of a utilitarian worldview and the split between fact and value that took place during the Enlightenment, we must acknowledge that the thought-processes that led us to our present dilemmas will not lead us out of them.  Throughout the book, Professor Hallaq capitalizes on the concept of paradigm as a tool to capture the essence of different systems, to refer to their sine qua non aspects, those features without which a thing would no longer be that thing. Building on Carl Schmitt’s notion of a central domain, Professor Hallaq explains that when a domain becomes central, all the problems of the peripheral domains are solved in terms of the central one. For example, European technical progress in the nineteenth century was paradigmatic.  All other areas, whether moral, political, social, and economic, were impacted by progress and any problems in those areas were solved through technical progress. It was a “religion of technical miracles, human achievements, and the domination of nature” (Impossible State, p. 7). Whereas in the age of traditional religion, the moral development of the individual was the central domain, in the technical age, material progress is valued above all other achievements.  The concept of paradigm is extremely useful to distinguish the aspects of a tradition that make it what it is, those things that are representative of it rather than outliers. Certain scholars, for instance, are paradigmatic, (for example, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali), whereas other peripheral figures, famous as they may have become in “history” cannot stand as representatives of the tradition. Sixty-four years ago, Muhammad Asad perceptively recognized this occurrence, this shift towards a “theology of progress,” which has only gotten more pronounced: “The average European – whether democrat or communist, manual worker or intellectual – seemed to know only one positive faith: the worship of material progress, the belief that there could be no other goal in life than to make that very life continually easier or, as the current expression went, ‘independent of nature’.  The temples of that faith were the gigantic factories, cinemas, chemical laboratories, dance-halls, hydroelectric works; and its priests were the bankers, engineers, politicians, film stars, statisticians, captains of industry, record airmen, and commissars. Ethical frustration was evident in the all-round lack of agreement about the meaning of Good and Evil and in the submission of all social and economic issues to the rule of ‘expediency’… The insatiable craving after power and pleasure had, of necessity, led to the break-up of Western society into hostile into hostile groups armed to the teeth and determined to destroy each other whenever and wherever their respective interests clashed.” (The Road to Mecca, Louisville, KY: Fons Vitae Publishing, 2005, pp. 70-71). Back to The Impossible State: It begins by stating its conclusion, with which I fully agree, that the “Islamic state” is an impossibility and a contradiction in terms. Although Muslims (and non-Muslims) take the modern state for granted, accepting it as a natural reality and a timeless phenomenon, the state is in fact a modern event, one that was born out of European history and has specific characteristics.  Although some Muslim scholars think the state is neutral and even compatible with the Sharia, they fail to realize the inherent contradictions between the two systems, which are grounded primarily in modernity’s moral predicament. All political and economic problems derive from this moral predicament.  The state has fundamental properties without which it would not be a state, although the content of the state can change. Of course, every state is different, “just as every snake or hawk is a unique creature.” However, “snakes and hawks, by their nature, live and perform certain functions that are particular to them, however much their individual members may differ in strength, shape or aggressiveness. And the state is a particular modern creature that fulfills fairly well-defined functions of governance and dominance…A state is a state, just as a hawk is a hawk, and not, say, a sparrow” (See, Wael Hallaq’s Shari’a, p. 361).   The state is a historical product grounded in specific metaphysics and has the capacity to thoroughly penetrate culture and society, shaping them in ways conducive to forming state subjects. There are five essential characteristics of the state: (1) It is a specific historical product and is distinctly European in origin. It arose organically out of European conditions and because of this, “the state has been possible only in the West;”(p. 25, citing Carl Schmitt); (2) Sovereignty and its metaphysics: the state is the sole author of its own will and destiny.  Nothing higher that the state and its laws exists; (3) The law represents the will of the state and it is the most paradigmatic manifestation of sovereignty. Sovereignty is essential to the state and the capacity to produce law is a related essential attribute; (4) A rational bureaucratic machine, which is an extension of the legal order and shows a rational type of domination. The central features of this domination are “voluntarism and systematization”(p. 31); (5) Cultural hegemony and making all things, including culture, political. Society is not separate from the state as the state permeates all or most aspects of existence. By merely reflecting on the characteristics of the state, it is quite apparent that they are in direct conflict with the metaphysics, value system and worldview of the Sharia. The book demonstrates in detail that the state is not value free or a blank canvas with the capacity to become “Islamic” as many scholars seem to think.  By accepting and using the state and giving it an Islamic veneer, claiming that it implements the Sharia, all we have is still a modern-state, a theocracy, not the Islamic system of governance that existed in premodernity (i.e., the content has changed but the form has not and unless the form changes, we will always have a state).  The Sharia and the state are indeed antithetical. Among the many reasons for this is the fact that the subjects produced by the modern state are inherently of a different “species” from the ones produced by the Islamic premodernity. Premodern Muslims were self-accountable, self-regulated subjects, intrinsically motivated to follow the divine laws, which bound everyone, including rulers.  They had an “inner moral-compass” that was the result of practices they engaged in daily, which included the five pillars of Islam, and were meant to train the soul. In contrast, modern state subjects are formed to submit to the state and follow its laws. The laws and the state subjects are both created by the state to ensure its survival. These laws must be obeyed to avoid punishment and imprisonment: “The population had to be educated in the ways of good conduct, which meant…the ability to work and produce.”  The spiritual or moral well-being of subjects is of no concern to the state and in fact may be troublesome to it. The ultimate sovereign is the state itself. In Islam, in contrast, the moral is anchored in a metaphysic of divine sovereignty. The premodern Muslim subject was formed in a world where the is and the ought existed symbiotically. The modern state subject, in contrast, cannot conceive of a world where the legal and the moral are intertwined, on where something is or is not legal because it is or is not moral.  The premodern Sharia was a way of seeing and understanding the world and of living in it, an ethical orientation, a spiritual foundation. It was a holistic moral practice that enveloped the world around it. It was a way or a path, which is perhaps the most accurate translation of the word Shari’a into English.  The Sharia represented in general terms an enchanted universe, a moral worldview, and an ethical way of life. All of life, including political and governmental institutions were bound by the Sharia, not by the laws of the “ruler.” We cannot imagine a state that is not its own sovereign and does not issue its own laws for should that happen, it would cease being a state.  In addition to its groundbreaking and desperately needed ideas, which are most urgent, The Impossible State is also dexterously written in beautiful, vivid, and precise language, making it a pleasure to read just from a literary perspective. I cannot recommend this book enough. There are superb passages that describe the purpose and meaning of Islamic rituals with such beauty, depth and understanding that the reader cannot help but be deeply moved. In sum: Please read The Impossible State as soon as possible, as carefully as possible, and as many times as possible. *The Impossible State was published by Columbia University Press and won the prestigious “Columbia University Press Distinguished Book Award” in 2015.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI inaugurated Thursday a new center for addiction treatment in Sidi Moumen suburb in Casablanca, initiated by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity under the supervision of the sovereign. As part of the 2010 national program to fight drug addiction and its effects, implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Ministry of the Interior, the new center’s budget is MAD 6.4 million. It contains a sport area, psychotherapy and social support facilities, and spaces for computer science and artistic workshops to encourage self-expression. Another space within the center was also dedicated to training associations that support youth suffering from addictions. The initiative seeks to rehabilitate individuals with drug issues, contribute to their inclusion in social life, improve their response to treatment and raise awareness about the risks of drug abuse for both addicts and their families at the receiving end of addictive behavior.  Prior to the new center’s establishment, other drug rehab centers were built by the same foundation in Casablanca’s Ibn Rochd University Hospital, and in Rabat, Oujda, Nador, Marrakech, Tetouan, Tangiers, Fez, and Agadir. According to a study conducted by the Biochemistry, Nutrition and Cellular Biology Group in partnership with Casablanca’s Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy in 2017, Approximately 600,000 Moroccans are addicted to drugs, with 16,000 addicted to hard drugs like heroin and cocaine. Drug addiction is especially prevalent among 18 to 28-year-olds. The other most common addiction is to alcohol, according to a report by the National Observatory of Drugs and Addictions (ONDA). The same source revealed that Moroccans consume approximately 120 million liters of alcoholic beverages a year, 68.3 percent of which is beer.

Rabat – Experienced travelers and beauty seekers have known for decades that Morocco, with its gorgeous landscapes and multicultural heritage, is an alluring and enlightening travel destination. The North African country is getting some good publicity. Australians are drawn to Morocco’s adventurous side as they have named the Kingdom the 5th best adventure travel destination, according to the new Adventure Travel Index compiled by Intrepid.  “Camel rides through the Sahara, the stunning Atlas Mountains and the pulsating energy of Marrakech are just a few highlights of mint-tea filled Morocco. From the medieval old town of Fes to the spice markets of Marrakech, the rich history and natural beauty of Morocco await,” wrote the website.  The travel site also praised the collision between old and new expressed in Morocco’s architecture and artwork, encouraging Australian travellers to learn about “fallen cities and cross paths with nomadic trips” and “to jump in and discover the many mysteries and legends concealed within this moody, ever-changing landscape.” Morocco’s fifth place follows Vietnam (1), Peru (2), India (3) and Cambodia (4) as Aussies’ favourite adventure travel destinations from 2016 to 2017. Morocco displaced Cuba, now in sixth place.However, Iceland, Croatia and China are new to the top 20 in 2017 where Cuba has moved down to one place from the 5th (Morocco’s actual spot) to the 6th , and Nepal has risen two spots, from the 10th to the 8th.  The report, which aims to “share insights into the fast-growing adventure travel sector; challenge the dated stereotypes of adventure travellers, and redefines this growing sector within the tourism industry” combines the Intrepid’s travel figures with externally-commissioned qualitative research.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat- After Moroccans launched a campaign to boycott three companies selling dairy, bottled water and fuel in response to prices increasing, they have added all fish products to the boycott, resulting in a confrontation with fishmongers. On Wednesday morning, a group of angry youth violently destroyed the property of several fishmongers in Souk Bani Hassan in Tetouan. The youth also attacked bystanders who continued to purchase fish for eating despite the boycott call. With the slogan “#Let_it_rot,” pictures and videos circulated yesterday on social media showing many sardine boxes thrown to the ground and being spoiled before they were burned. Protesters in the video shouted: “Do not sell fish anymore, or buy it!” and “Go on, kill the fish!” In contrast, many observers said the destruction was unacceptable because it will reflect negatively on the boycott campaign. Seventeen perpetrators were arrested yesterday after an investigation was opened. The protest comes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when food prices, including fish, typically rise, despite Morocco’s large maritime wealth. The fishing industry in Morocco is a leading foreign exchange earner, accounting for 56 percent of agricultural and 16 percent of total  exports. For a long time the industry has been an economic pillar in the country. The Kingdom is considered the largest fish market in Africa. As a result, it is assumed that fish prices are affordable for most citizens.

Rabat – While Moroccan fans continue to express disappointment over the new design of the  2018 Atlas Lions World Cup kits, Adidas believes that it has fulfilled the aspirations of Moroccan fans. In a statement obtained by Morocco World News, Adidas said that the “inspiration behind these kits came from previous designs, with updates based on new fabrics and innovative technologies.” Adidas and Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) unveiled the new version of the kits on Thursday in the presence of Moroccan football players. The new design received a heavy backlash from Moroccan fans on social networking services. However, Adidas is certain that it has met the aspirations and expectations of the Atlas Lions and their fans through the new design. In the statement, Adidas Football Senior Director of Design Juergen Rank said that the “Atlas Lions fans have been waiting patiently for this World Cup to arrive. So we wanted to make sure that we could provide a kit that is authentically Moroccan while using the latest technology.” Rank added that it was important for Adidas to make sure that the new design will fit “both the players and supporters, so that they are comfortable on the field and in the stands, in the stadium or on the street.” “We believe that we have achieved this goal for Morocco,” he added. The statement added that the shirts were made “in accordance with Adidas technology,” designed with “lightweight fabrics and air to evacuate heat and perspiration while keeping players cool and dry.” Many football fans described the new version of the kits as too similar to Casablanca’s Widad Club’s jersey. “They just copied the Widad jersey,” said one online commenter, while another commenter described the kits as a “shame.” This is not the first time Moroccan fans criticized the Adidas kits. In April, football fans mocked the first uniform design, with former Moroccan footballer Abdeslam Ouaddou asserting that the jerseys require further development. Slamming Adidas, Ouaddou said that the company should have devoted more time and energy to an appropriate design suitable to the Moroccan public.

Rabat- Member of the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM) Omar Zerad was sentenced Wednesday to three years in prison on charges of corruption. The Criminal Chamber of Court of First Instance in Fez condemned Zerad, who is also deputy mayor of Targuit town in the northern region of Al Hoceima, and his deputy and accomplice, Mohamed Zamou, to three years in jail on charges of corruption, bribery, and abuse of power to intimidate and influence others into action. Zerad also received a fine of MAD 730,000. Throughout the investigation, the politician denied all corruption charges leveled against him and pleaded not guilty in court.  However, the prosecutor presented  testimonies from witnesses and Zerad’s own criminal record, including forgery and false testimonies that led the court to rule against him, reported the newspaper Al Massae. To address problems of corruption, the Moroccan government has proposed a wide variety of measures, including the new anti-corruption hotline (0537718888) and a greater national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050, such as administrative corruption, public funds mismanagement, and power abuse. Although Morocco slightly improved in the Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2017 with 40 points compared to 37 points in 2016 below the global average of 43, it still has a long way to go for the realization of social justice.

Rabat – NGO Transparency Maroc has heavily criticized the government’s stance against the ongoing boycott against increases in prices. The organization said that the boycott faced “intense suppression.” The NGO claims that the boycott was met with harsh remonstrations, like the Hirak Rif protests in the Al Hoceima province, ‘Hirak Al Atach’ (thirst protest) in Zagora, and Jerada’s protests against illegal mining. In a statement published on May 22, Transparency Maroc described the online campaign as an “extension”  of the social movements of the Hirak Rif, Zagora, and Jerada that denounced social disparities across the country.  According to the NGO, the movement resulted primarily from a “shake-up of an economic system based on corruption” and a “marriage between economic and political powers.”  The boycott and previous social movements, according to Transparency Maroc, are “an opportunity for Morocco, provided that the state recognizes its dimensions and profound significance.” The NGO also urged authorities to take responsibility in dealing with the crisis and to “respect public freedom” and fight against corruption in the country. The boycott, which started on April 20, has proved to be successful and is expanding its reach to include fish products, due to price hikes. Several officials denounced the boycott, including Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi. El Khalfi condemned the boycott earlier this month, asserting that online activists’ claims of price increases are “fake news.” Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid also condemned the boycott and described people supporting the boycott as “madawikh” (fools). In response to the increasing tension between boycotters and the government, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani apologized to consumers during a meeting held at the parliament in mid-May, calling for tolerance. The head of government apologized for statements made by some ministers in his government, emphasizing that his cabinet is committed to fulfilling its responsibility to protect consumers. The government has been following the campaign and is implementing a set of measures to meet the needs and aspirations expressed and will ensure the protection of the purchasing power of citizens, El Othmani added. Five weeks on, the boycott continues as people supporting the campaign are calling on the government to urge the boycotted companies (Sidi Ali, Afriquia gas, Centrale Danone) to lower the prices of their  products.

Rabat – The United Nations mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has increased patrols to oversee the ceasefire agreement in the region, following Polisario’s recent actions east of Morocco’s defense wall. Security sources in Morocco’s southern city of Laayoune reported that UN Special Representative and Head of MINURSO, Colin Stewart, ordered the increase of patrols to monitor the ceasefire agreement. Stewart ordered his staff to increase the number of four-wheel drive vehicles and surveillance helicopters to facilitate MINURSO’s mission. The Polisario Front pushed MINURSO to be on alert, especially after its provocative maneuvers in Tifariti, in the region east of Morocco’s defense wall. Last Sunday, the separatist group celebrated the 45th anniversary of “the struggle of its army” in the region, in defiance of the UN Security Council’s recently adopted Resolution 2414. The resolution made the Security Council’s stance on the Polisario Front clear, urging the separatist group to withdraw from Guerguerat and expressing concern about the group’s intention to relocate its facilities to Bir Lahlou, east of Morocco’s defense wall. Moroccan news outlet Hespress reported today that it has obtained confidential documents that prove MINURSO’s alert situation. The documents, consisting of photographs, show many monitoring vehicles waiting for a new shipment of surveillance helicopters that will facilitate MINURSO’s mission to monitor the whole area east of Morocco’s sand wall.  The recent resolution of the Security Council has also reduced the mandate of MINURSO to only six months instead of a year. Subsequently, 12 employees of the mission have reportedly returned to the UN headquarters in New York. Polisario’s recent violation in Tifariti is a serious development that calls for resolute intervention by the United Nations. Morocco has condemned Polisario’s “flagrant’ actions east of Morocco’s defense wall, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calling on the separatist group to refrain from changing the status quo and undermining the UN-led political process to reach a mutually acceptable political solution to the four-decade long conflict.

Rabat – One of the most highly respected actors in Hollywood is facing serious accusations. After being accused of sexual harassment and misconduct by eight different women, Morgan Freeman apologized on Thursday, May 24. He is the latest male star implicated for inappropriate behavior in the wake of the Weinstein affair. “Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected – that was never my intent,” said Freeman in a statement. Among the dozens of people surveyed by CNN who worked with the 80-year-old comedian, eight said they had been harassed and eight others had witnessed inappropriate acts. According to CNN, a production assistant said that on the set of “Going in Style” (2015), the actor touched and caressed her lower back, also commenting on her figure or her outfit. He “kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear,” she said. A member of the production team of another film, “Elusive” (2013) ,reported similar behavior, stating that the actor had harassed her and other assistants. The actor founded a production house, “Revelations Entertainment,” described by seven of the women interviewed by CNN as having a workplace environment of harassment. One of the accusations comes from a CNN journalist, Chloe Melas, co-author of the article denouncing his actions. She says she was subjected to inappropriate sexual comments at a press conference for the release of the movie “Going in Style,” when she was six months pregnant. Morgan Freeman has been nominated four times at the Oscars and won one for best supporting actor in 2005. His last nomination was in 2010 for his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in “Invictus,”, a collaboration with Clint Eastwood.

Rabat – International human rights organization Amnesty International has called Algeria’s detention of blogger Merzoug Touati “another stain on the country’s human rights record.” In January 2017, Touati published two social media posts critical of the Algerian government. The first Facebook post called for national protests to counter a new finance law. The second YouTube video, uploaded six days later, interviewed an Israeli government spokesperson, who denied Algerian accusations of Israeli interference in local protests. Ten days after publishing the posts, Touati was arrested by Algerian authorities on charges of stirring civil unrest and “espionage” on January 18, 2017. One and a half years after he was first detained, the criminal court in Touati’s hometown of Béjaïa sentenced the blogger to 10 years in jail on Thursday, for “providing intelligence to agents of a foreign power,” according to AFP. “Every day Merzoug Touati spends in prison is one day too many, and is a further stain on Algeria’s human rights record…Touati represents the broken dreams of a generation in a country where freedom of expression has been repeatedly undermined,” said the Middle East and North Africa regional director at Amnesty International, Heba Morayef. After reviewing the case files, Amnesty International wrote in an online statement: “[Amnesty found] no incitement to violence or advocacy of hatred, rather his posts were covered by freedom of expression in relation to his work as a citizen-journalist. Amnesty International therefore considers Merzoug Touati a prisoner of conscience held solely for expressing his peaceful opinions.” Touati’s 10-year sentence is not the only incident of rights abuses in Algeria garnering international attention. The UN slammed the North African country in a press briefing on Tuesday, condemning the mass expulsions of sub-Saharan migrants that have been widely reported in Algeria since October 2017.

By Dana Leger Rabat – The Cities Without Slums initiative intends to eradicate slums from 85 cities across Morocco in an effort to end unsanitary housing, social exclusion, and to lessen the chance of homegrown violent extremism in Morocco. Far behind schedule, if and when it reaches completion, will it be enough? King Mohammed VI established the Cities Without Slums program in 2004 in the wake of the 2003 Casablanca terrorist attacks, when 12 suicide bombers from the shantytown of Sidi Moumen, a poor suburb of Casablanca, killed 45 people and injured hundreds more. The program was originally set to be completed in 2011, having received EUR 90 million from the European Commission. The tasks of the program include building sufficient, affordable, and sanitary housing for families to relocate to as the old slums are demolished. Seven years late, it has reached about 68% completion. Today, 58 of the 85 targeted cities across Morocco are “slum-free” as declared by the Ministry of National Planning, Urban Planning, Housing, and Urban Policy. The most recent city to receive such status is Settat in central Morocco. Often, people with low amounts of income struggle to find suitable housing that is close enough to commercial centers that are necessary for daily life. With few options for commuting from farther locations into a city on a daily basis and without the necessary funds to live inside a city, living in a slum becomes the only option. According to the 2011 Constitution, Moroccan citizens have an essential right to housing, water, a healthy environment, healthcare, and social security. On the other hand, slums often lack a combination of water supply, electricity, sewage, or waste management, and often unreasonable numbers of people are housed together in small spaces. People living in slums are marginalized, meaning their needs and desires are often not met by their local government or society. Marginalization creates a feeling of otherness and of social exclusion as an entire sub-group of people is ignored by their community and/or seen as lesser. Marginalization is often one of the first of many characteristics an individual experiences on the road to violent radicalization. There are a number of factors and paths that may lead to such an end, but in shanty towns and slums, a multitude of factors that are thought to raise the chances of an individual becoming violently radicalized are present. According to research by Dr. Audrey Heffron Casserleigh at Florida State University, some of the factors that create higher chances for an individual to become violently radicalized include lack of education, unemployment, and social exclusion. That is not to say that every, or even most, individuals within a marginalized group, or those who are radically religious, or those who are affected by each of these factors will become a terrorist actor. It is perfectly possible and most common to hold radical beliefs and/or be a part of communities affected by these circumstances and yet be nothing close to a terrorist. Communities such as these simply have a higher chance than others to become locations for recruitment. According to Casserleigh, the difference lies in the fact that terrorist actors are intolerant of those who go against their moral absolutes and are motivated by something bigger than the act itself, whether it be a political, religious, or social motivation. In addition, those who commit terrorist acts make a rational decision to do so when they believe that alternate measures have already been taken and failed, and they feel that there is no other way left to make their voice heard. One strategy to reduce the likelihood of individuals feeling such extreme voicelessness is community engagement for all groups. The Cities Without Slums program exemplifies this strategy as it aims to bring marginalized people into mainstream society through housing solutions.  The question that remains is whether the program will ever be completed, and even if so, what preventive measures will be taken to deter the return of slums to Moroccan cities? Morocco has been rapidly urbanizing for decades. UN-Habitat predicts that urban Morocco will continue to grow by 290,000 inhabitants every year until 2030. The problem is most likely not going to disappear by simply demolishing slums and relocating families. The program is struggling to keep up with its current number of households in need, and with every year, more are added. Beyond that, not only is affordable, sanitary, and available housing an issue within itself, but people also settle in shanty towns such as Sidi Moumen because there are not sufficient employment opportunities and education. Morocco has an official unemployment rate of 10.5 percent and a literacy rate of only 68.5 percent. If there were more of a focus on these issues as well in order to attempt to solve the problem at the root, there would be better chances of sustaining “slum-free” cities.

Rabat – Morocco has come up with a great deal on ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup. The Kingdom is offering low cost tickets at the price of USD 227 to attend games. Facing fierce competition, Morocco is taking its bid to host the 2026 World Cup to another level by setting lower prices that the rival bid cannot compete with because of higher costs, as reported by Al Massae on May 24. Russia, for example, is selling tickets for $310. According to the estimates of the United 2026 bid, fans wanting to attend the World Cup must pay at least USD 431 for a single match. If accommodation costs, food and transportation costs are added to this, the bill can easily climb to more than USD 2,000 for a single game. Only 19 days remain until 211 football federations will vote to decide the World Cup’s 2026 host on June 13. Prior to the vote, the FIFA task force will publish their assessment of the host candidates’ readiness on May 29 to decide whether the prospective hosts are eligible to host the much anticipated tournament.

Rabat – During King’s Mohammed VI inauguration of a training center in the educational and social trades in Rabat, dozens of citizens residing in “Douar El Garâa” in Yaâcoub El Mansour neighborhood raised protest slogans, calling on the king to hold corrupt officials accountable. On Wednesday, the protesters chanted slogans decrying authorities’ attempts to deport them from their shantytown to an area outside of Rabat, and demanded housing in their neighborhood.  They also called on the king to hold accountable the officials who are, according to the protesters, involved in two stagnant housing projects. When King Mohammed VI performed his customary handshakes with the population, a little girl handed him a letter describing the protesters’ issues and demands , which was signed on behalf of the area’s people.   Several Facebook pages specify that the housing demonstrations are not related to the ongoing boycott, but rather focus on the people’s right to appropriate housing.

Rabat – The Liberia Football Association (LFA) announced on Thursday that it will not vote for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid on June 13. Liberia is the second African nation which has publicly shunned the Moroccan bid, after South Africa. The chairman of the Liberia football association, Musa Bility, has said that his country’s decision was made after talks with former world footballer and President George Weah and the Liberian government. The key factor in supporting the North American bid, according to a statement by the LFA, is the “long-running traditional relationship between Liberia and the United States, the many Liberians living in the US and the impact the World Cup will have on them.” The LFA president, according to The Cable, added that “Liberia, a football crazy nation will be bracing to see the World Cup in the United States as thousands of its citizens living in the country will have an opportunity to witness live world cup matches from the giant stadiums in the US.” Liberia’s decision followed a similar statement from South Africa in May.  It is expected that Liberia, like South Africa, will receive backlash from the Confederation of African Football (CAF). International news media speculated that South Africa retracted support for Morocco’s bid due to pressure from Donald Trump’s infamous tweet about the World Cup. Trump wrote in his tweeted that it “would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid.” Eventually, South Africa adopted a strong stance against the Moroccan bid, as seen in South Africa’s Minister of Sports Tokozile Xasa’s statements published earlier this month. “We are very clear that we cannot support Morocco,” she said. South Africa’s parliament “was very straightforward in this regard, it is the mandate of the country, and it is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is.” Xasa’s statement retracted South Africa’s initial support for Morocco’s bid from the president of the South African Football Association back in April. Morocco, however, does not seem to be surprised by such decisions. CEO of the Moroccan bid Hicham El Amrani told the BBC mid-May that no one is “forced” to back the Moroccan bid “if he believes that it doesn’t serve the country or the country’s football interest.” “Even if Africa has always acted in unity, unity does not mean 100% of all the member associations, this is part of the democratic process,” he added. After South Africa’s decision, CAF President Ahmad Ahmad reportedly met with South African officials this month to convince South Africa to vote for the African bid. The countdown to the FIFA vote, which is set to take place on June 13 in the presence of 211 football federations, has begun. Prior to the vote, the FIFA task force will publish their assessment of the host candidates’ readiness on May 29 to decide whether the North American and North African bids are eligible to host the world’s 23rd premier tournament in 2026.

Rabat – The research group BMI has forecasted high unemployment throughout the next decade due to an expanding workforce, unmet demand for technical positions, and decline in traditional high employment sectors. In a recent research report, BMI cites the current unemployment rate in Morocco at 10.5 percent. However, with an estimated 245,000 working-age people set to join the workforce in 2017-2018, Morocco would need to create 115,000 additional jobs each year and maintain all current employment opportunities, to remain steady at the current workforce participation rate of 47 percent. The long-term BMI report overshadows BMI’s previous report, which forecasted positive growth and a consistent and strong economy for the remainder of the year. To explain the high unemployment, the research group points to several key factors.  First, BMI forecasts declining employment in the agriculture and public sectors, as job creation in the sectors becomes “increasingly unreliable,” compared to the industrial sector.  In agriculture, the unreliability is based on unpredictable weather patterns and corresponding water scarcity and crop yields, which the government has struggled to address through measures like the Green Morocco Plan. Meanwhile, the research group also predicts that employment will fall in the public sector, which composes 40 percent of the country’s formal employment. BMI forecasts the decline will result from restricted government hiring linked to attempts to decrease the government debt. The second cause of unemployment is the poorly-performing national education system. According to BMI, “Only 71.7% of the population can read and write, while just 64.4% of the working-age population has completed secondary education or above,” adding “only Yemen fares worse regionally on these metrics.” Furthermore, Moroccan higher education lacks the technical focus essential to the country’s growth model based on the manufacturing sector. Morocco represents the region’s lowest numbers for engineering graduates, with only 4.7 percent of total national graduates receiving their degree in engineering, manufacturing, and construction in 2016. Comparatively, nearly one third of graduates studied business, administration, and law. A shortage in the trained technical workforce represents a drain in the national potential that requires the outsourcing of trained professionals, and a consolidation of higher salaries among a smaller number of qualified job candidates, which discourages international investment. The International Monetary Fund describes the loss of employment opportunities caused by the high number of Morocco’s unemployed graduates as below national potential for five years, a “chronic underutilisation of available resources.”

By Nada Afa Fez – As part of its ‘Salon du Cinéma’ cultural program, the French Institute of Fez will screen Alain Gomis’s critically acclaimed movie Félicité for free, this Friday in Dar Batha at 10 p.m. Every city has a story to tell, and this Friday, those living in Fez will discover Kinshasa’s through Alain Gomis’s latest movie. Félicité tells the story of a proud emancipated woman and single mother who works as a late night singer in a bar in Kinshasa. Her life takes an unexpected turn when her teenage son is severely injured in a motorcycle accident. In order to save him, she must come up with £500 to pay for his surgery. She embarks on a frantic race against time through the streets of Kinshasa, where she meets Tabu, a car mechanic who will support her through this journey. The strong central female character Félicité was inspired by a brave women Alain Gomis looked up to and admired growing up. Félicité was played by Véronique Tshanda Beya Mputu, who auditioned four times for the role, because Gomis was not sure if an inexperienced actress could portray such a complex character. Félicité won a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and the Golden Stallion for best film at the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. It was also nominated for the Amnesty International prize, and the Alfred-Bauer prize, among others. In an interview with the Financial Times, Gomis said that he likes resonances. He explained, “My perception of space is sensorial like the sound of a drop of water falling in a cave. For me that is stronger than a uniquely visual perception of space.” All of his movies shed light on today’s social problems and are centered on strong-willed characters doing their best to beat the odds. He told the Financial Times, “I myself am of mixed race, which is a curious state to be in because you don’t look like your mother or your father’s family,” he says. “You feel like an immigrant wherever you are, so I think that’s also had a lot to do with the kind of subjects that have interested me.”

By Karen Duarte  After 20 years, Morocco is back on the field and on the road to Russia 2018 with a football squad full of potential. Only six of the 23 players selected for the national team were born in Morocco, while the others were born in either France, Spain, or the Netherlands. Because all players have Moroccan heritage and have maintained a connection with Morocco, FIFA rules allow them to represent the country in the World Cup. Morocco’s talented bench would not be the same without its diasporan players. For the first match on June 15, Morocco will face Iran. This is a must-win game for the Atlas Lions as they will next be up against two tough teams, Spain and Portugal. Who are the key players on the team that could deliver Morocco to the World Cup’s next round? The national team captain and Juventus F.C. center back Mehdi Benatia’s goal is to lead his team into the knockout stages against the odds. Since Spain and Portugal hold a strong soccer reputation, many are already doubting Morocco’s chances.   Attacking midfielder Mbark Boussoufa is a two-time Belgian Golden Shoe winner and former player on the Chelsea youth team back in 2006. The 33-year-old is filled with experience and ready to bring his skills and techniques to the national team.  Born in the Netherlands to two Moroccan parents, Karim El Ahmadi is a former Aston Villa midfielder, and also one of the most experienced players on the squad.  Former Watford midfielder, Nordin Amrabat is a current player for Spanish club CD Leganés and for Morocco’s national team. Amrabat has represented Morocco at two Africa Cup of Nations and the 2012 Olympics.  The 24-year-old striker, Ayoub El Kaabi, can possibly shift the spotlight towards himself with his outstanding statistics. With 9 goals, he was the top goalscorer of the CHAN 2018 (Total African Nations Championship), hosted by Morocco.  Romain Saïss currently plays as a midfielder for English club Wolverhampton Wanderers and the Morocco national team. The 28-year-old Frenchman was qualified to play for the Atlas Lions through his Moroccan ancestry. According to The Sportsman, Saïss completed almost 2,000 short passes throughout the season, putting him 5th in the Wolverhampton Wanderers league overall.  Currently playing as a midfielder for German club Schalke 04, the 20-year-old French-born Amine Harit is Morocco’s future star player. The young footballer has caught many clubs’ attention with his mastery of speed, agility, and ball control.  Spanish-born Moroccan Achraf Hakimi plays for Real Madrid. As a 19-year-old defender, Achraf is an attacking threat and has managed to make his way to the top of the field to score three goals for Real Madrid, while also making valuable assists.  Twenty-five-year-old Hakim Ziyech plays as an attacking midfielder for Ajax Amsterdam. He is known for his ability to put the ball behind the net in his free kicks.  According to The Sportsman, Ziyech has eight goals from 15 caps, giving him the second highest goal-tally on the team, and he will be key to creating or scoring the goals that Morocco will need to progress in Group B.

Rabat- Cats, dogs, rabbits and other furry animals can soon accompany patients on their journey toward recovery, beginning June 28 in Souissi Children’s Hospital, Rabat. Perhaps one of the most-anticipated and needed additions to Morocco’s health system is animal-assisted therapy, due to the many benefits it gives to the patient’s emotional and psychological well-being.  The first of its kind in the country will be dedicated to children battling illness in Rabat’s Children Hospital, thanks to an initiative by the Friends of the Children’s Hospital in Rabat Association (AAHER) and the High Institute of Audiovisual Works and Cinemas. The inauguration of the space provided for pet-therapy will take place on June 28, after a fundraising gala set for June 6 at Allal El Fassi Theater in Rabat.  Another fundraising gala is scheduled for the day of the inauguration at Annakhil Palace in Temara, south of Rabat. Children living or visiting the hospital will be able to bond with the animals, an experience that helps children heal and provides more affection for animals.   It is to be hoped this first step will encourage more pet-therapy spaces to open in hospitals throughout the kingdom, so that a larger population can benefit from its physical and psychological advantages. For both adults and children, having animals around as a form of treatment has proved therapeutic across the world. Pets like dogs or other animals encourage physical activity and social interaction, while animals like rabbits or cats help relieve stress. Calming animals can also soothe easily-irritated or angry patients by prompting the body to release endorphins, chemicals that produce a calming effect. Patients suffering from depression or mental diseases can benefit exceedingly from the presence of a pet, especially ferrets, according to The Douglas Institute, which specializes in serving people with mental health problems.

Rabat – Gad Elmaleh is still living the American dream and sharing plenty of anecdotes about his career with his fans. In an interview with French comedian Kevin Razy, the French-Moroccan comedian has recounted his very special and slightly awkward dinner with Al Pacino with whom he shot a movie in 2011. Invited on the French TV show “Rendez-vous,” broadcast on Channel+, Elmaleh talked for the first time about inviting iconic actor Al Pacino and his wife to dinner at his place in Los Angeles. It was a proud moment to remember for the actor of “Chouchou.” “I was flattered when he came to see me, I’m a big fan of his work. We actually shot a scene together when I had a little part in the ‘Jack and Jill’ movie. I think if I had not shot this scene with him, I would not have known him, I would not have come close to him,” said the 47-year-old artist. Elmaleh invited Al Pacino in a very unique way when they were shooting a scene together. The pair were sitting side by side in a helicopter when the humorist popped the question. “He said yes, so I panicked and went quickly to redecorate my apartment.” The comedian wanted to go big and impress the American producer. “I’m starting to feel pressure and I’m going to buy wine, the Hamilton wine,” said Gad. “I go to a wine cellar, I say ‘give me the best’, and he took out a very expensive bottle. Elmaleh joked about breaking his budget as he claimed to have even hired a renowned French chef in the United States to prepare a meal with French service style. But it seemed the comedian did not do his research. “I’m sitting next to Al Pacino and his wife,” said the actor, who then signaled for the chef to serve the wine. “He does not even serve women first, he serves Al Pacino.

By Ousama Bziker Kenitra – Most language conflicts stem from the unbalanced status allocated to each language in a single country.  Language conflicts take place, most of the time, in multilingual countries such as Morocco. Its strategic location at the gateway between Africa, Europe, and the Middle East has caused Morocco to be influenced by multiple waves such as the Arabs, Spaniards, Portuguese, and French. Morocco has a variety of languages spoken within the country.  The first group includes Moroccan Arabic and Tamazight (Berber), which are held in low esteem by society. The second group includes French and Standard Arabic, which are the languages of administration and are held in high esteem by Moroccans. This interaction between languages creates a realm for competition, which results in a class struggle, as Grandguillaume puts it (Saib, 2001: 5). In regard to the diversity of Moroccan languages, Zouhir argues that the Moroccan linguistic repertoire includes two groups. The first includes Moroccan Arabic and Tamazight, which occupies a vulnerable social status in Morocco. The second category includes French, Standard Arabic, and English. These languages are used in administration Dawn Marley argues that there are three languages that enrich Moroccan language repertoire: Tamazight, Arabic, and French. She thinks that these three languages are the ones that must be included in any discussion related to language issues (Marley, 2005). Saib analyzes the linguistic situation in Morocco in a more detailed approach. He refers to the two languages that have native speakers and are the mother tongues of Moroccans, both inside and outside of Morocco. He says, “Moroccan Arabic and Berber are the only varieties that are spoken natively” (Saib, 2001). Other languages, such as Standard Arabic, French, Spanish, and English, are limited to schools. Boukous thinks that there are competition and power struggles among languages as well as between the two groups of language (Zouhir, 2013).  Another thing that Saib mentions is that policy-makers have favored the use of French against Standard Arabic as the most appropriate language for instruction in schools (Saib, 2001). To support his argument, Saib claims that the Royal Commission on the Reform of Education does not include the use of mother tongues (Tamazight and Moroccan Arabic), and he added that the policy is still the same today. Furthermore, Saib unravels some of the paradoxes, utilizing the figures from the 1994 Census. Saib notices that the Amazigh (Berber) population is estimated to be 38.64% of the total Moroccan population. If that is added to the number of Tamazight speakers dwelling in urban cities and outside of Morocco, it will push the percentage to reach 60%, as estimated by some Amazigh scholars (Saib, 2001). According to these figures, if correct, one can only notice that Tamazight is minimized even though the Tamazight language is a majority language (Ibid). One of the reasons behind minimizing the Tamazight language, Saib argues, is obviously political: The ethnocentric pan-Arabist political establishment, which has been repeating ad nauseum that Morocco is an Arab country and that Moroccans are Arabs, does not obviously want the Amazigh to know how many they are, hence their demographic weight, for fear that they may demand a political power corresponding to it (Saib, 2001:1) The demographic weight obviously poses a threat to the elite’s ideological plan. Moreover, Marley thinks that reinstating Arabic was a means of preserving Morocco’s Arab-Islamic identity, and its epistemological break with Western ties. (Marley, 2005:1488). She also added that during the Arabization plan, people thought that it was a good move since they had never been exposed to foreign languages or Classical Arabic (Ibid). Saib states that the sociolinguistic situation of both Tamazight and Moroccan Arabic is inherently motivated by ideological and political intentions (Saib, 2001:4). Marley, following in the footsteps of Saib, argues that “A powerful motivation behind the policy is the pursuit and maintenance of power: the ‘élite’ promote Arabization from virtuous ideological motives, but in the knowledge that French continues to be necessary for social and professional success” (Marley, 2005: 1489). Saib asserts that specialists in the field, who take into consideration sociolinguists’ findings and literature, are the ones who should carry on language policy and planning (Saib, 2001). The language situation in Morocco can be seen as ‘simplex’; it is simple but complex at the same time. On one level, foreigners see multilingualism in Morocco as richness. On the other level, theorists like Saib see it as complex and unfair. When Arabization was first established by the Istiqlal-led first national government (1955-1956), it was based on purely political and ideological intentions (Saib, 2001). The sociolinguistic status assigned to Tamazight and Moroccan Arabic during independence was the work of the pro-Arabization “nationalist” elite, who chose the language that suited their agenda (Ibid). “They have been subjected to a consciously planned process of minorization and excluded from the school domain” (Saib, 2001:4). Saib says that Tamazight and Moroccan Arabic were regarded as vernaculars that are considered stigmatized forms of speaking used in casual settings (Ibid). Marley argues that Tamazight language and culture are held in low esteem, and are regarded as “synonymous with inferiority and ignorance” (Marley, 2005). Boukous says that an analysis of the sociolinguistic situation in North Africa reveals the hierarchy and classification of languages according to various ecological factors, such as the economy, politics, the marketplace, and technology (Boukous, 2008:35). When Morocco gained independence in 1956, several reforms took place in its linguistic policies. For Morocco to break with Western influence, it declared Classical Arabic as the official language of the country alongside the Arabization policy (Zouhir, 2013: 274). The purpose of Arabization was to bring the country together, but it did not respect the multilingual voices that inhabit Morocco (Zouhir, 2013: 274). Morocco implemented the same strategy that the French adopted during their colonization in Morocco. “During the French occupation for 44 years from 1912 to 1956, French was imposed and instituted as the main language of instruction at all levels of education, and Arabic as a foreign language” (Redouane, 2016: 19). In fact, back in 1930, the French used Tamazight dialects and the Arabic vernaculars, through the “Dahir berbère” (Berber Decree), to help divide the country in order to rule more widely (Redouane, 2016: 19). After the failure of Arabization, Grandguillaume saw “Arabization as a class struggle” (Saib, 2001). Tamazight speakers started voicing their rights; it was time for a reform that could actually deliver solid results. Years have passed searching for the absolute solution for the linguistic catastrophe Morocco has suffered. The Charter for Educational Reform, created in 2000, calls for a drastic linguistic change. Article 110 in the Charter states, “Morocco will now be adopting a ‘clear, coherent and constant language policy within education’. This policy has three major thrusts: ‘the reinforcement and improvement of Arabic teaching’, ‘diversification of languages for teaching science and technology’ and an ‘openness to Tamazight’” (Marley, 2005: 1489).  Openness towards Tamazight is a huge jump towards inclusion. Although many might not see this step as being enough, at least it represents movement toward change and an admission that not all Moroccans are Arabs. As Berdouzi suggests (2000: 26), if the Charter delivers what it promised, young Moroccans will excel in Standard Arabic, as well as use it appropriately in different domains, and they will also excel in at least two foreign languages, which they will use in several contexts (Marley, 2005: 1490). Morocco has adopted many reforms in the past. Although these decisions by previous policy-makers were somewhat poor, they tried to adapt and form a linguistically-united Morocco. Regardless of their agendas and intentions, the changes and reforms that have occurred in Morocco are solid steps toward changing what went wrong and preventing it from happening in the future. Challenges will always present themselves. For example, Tamazight is limited to the elementary level and Standard Arabic is supposed to be used in higher education. Moreover, the Charter suggested that Morocco has opened up to foreign languages without specifying what languages. This leaves the foreign languages in a state of rivalry. However, this does not mean change stops here or that it will take place overnight. This process of recreating policies and correcting the mistakes of the past is a healthy one. Morocco has to learn from its mistakes and evolve toward a better future.

Rabat- The Government Council scheduled for Friday, May 25, will discuss issues surrounding telemedicine, generic drugs, and academic cheating.  Government officials will examine three draft decrees including a new government project: telemedicine which allows the exchange of information regarding the patient’s health condition from a location to another, through electronic communication. Telemedicine has the potential to bring many benefits to the Moroccan health system, beginning with facilitating the diagnosis process, especially for those living in rural areas. Telemedicine could also increase communication between doctor and patient that usually happens through a nurse or assistant. In addition, it could give doctors’ access to the patient’s personal medical data. After the government officials sign the telemedicine draft decree, the Ministry of Health’s new commission specialized in telemedicine will be sent to verify the reliability the telemedicine equipment. The other draft decrees to be discussed are on the bioequivalence of generic drugs and preventing cheating in exams. Recently, the Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, and Scientific Research which recorded more than 3,048 cases of baccalaureate cheating in 2016, installed classroom cameras for baccalaureate candidates’ final exam. The current anti-fraud law punishes exam candidates caught with smartphones, tablets, or other communication devices. Moreover, installing cameras will ensure equality between students and enable them to realize the graveness of cheating.   At the close of Friday’s meeting, the Council will consider and approve the appointment of new senior officials.  As a side note, the governmental meeting on Friday will not be attended by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, who is expected to attend the 53rd African Development Bank’s Annual Meetings (AfDB) that end May 25 in Busan, South Korea.

The backlash against Adidas continues. Rabat – When it comes to outfits, Moroccans are hard to please. After Adidas revealed the second version of the official jersey of Morocco’s national team for the 2018 World Cup, social media users were quick to comment about the new outfit, which (once again) does not appeal to the public opinion, as fans feel ripped off by the sportswear brand. After a failed first version of the jersey, released April 27, which caused Moroccans to boycott the brand and which was criticized by many Moroccan football players, including former Atlas Lion Abdeslam Ouaddou, Adidas has not learned its lesson. According to some comments, the new Adidas jersey, released Thursday, looks like Casablanca’s Widad Club’s jersey. “They just copied the Widad jersey;” “It looks like a discounted Adidas jersey;” “The other one wasn’t that bad after all;” “Awful;” “I’ll never buy it;” “What a shame;” were among the hundreds of negative reviews.      Some Moroccans decided to take the news with humor, creating many memes to laugh at the situation.      Three weeks ago, President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation Fouzi Lekjaa wanted to cancel the contract with Adidas when he urged them to redesign the kits. After that, Adidas responded quickly to the Moroccan anger, but it obviously could not create an acceptable design on its second try.

Rabat – In a speech before the European Parliament in Strasbourg this week, French President Emmanuel Macron warned of a “fascination with the illiberal.”  The French president posited that a new generation of citizens across the EU who did not experience World War II were quick to embrace nationalist leaders who promise order and decisiveness in an era characterized by uncertainty, mass migration, and economic dislocation. In the European Union, Poland’s government has earned the wrath of EU leaders over its plans to weaken the independence of the judiciary and other civil society structures. A recent survey of 50,000 Poles indicated that one-third of respondents supported leaving the EU. There will be no Polexit; Poland is the largest net recipient of EU aid. Yet, the nation’s president vowed to show the “sick Europe of today the path back to health.” In the United States, President Donald Trump’s mantra of “America First” represented, in part, a belief that multilateral institutions had usurped American power and that the United States was being taken advantage of because of this fact. “We have been disrespected, mocked, and ripped off for many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher,” he said in 2016 during the presidential campaign. In showing his disdain for regional trading agreements, Trump tweeted his core belief on international trade: “Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers.” Several other national leaders would grudgingly share a similar view. Read Also: French President Emmanuel Macron Vows to ‘Return African Heritage to Africa’ Trump’s determination to play hardball and to pursue one-on-one trade deals with major trading partner nations may be bearing fruit, though. South Korea recently announced that it would relax its automobile import rules thereby permitting a greater number of US automobile exports to the country. Last week Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that his country would lower tariffs on imported cars and allow easier access to foreign investors and foreign companies. But Beijing also announced new import tariffs this week on American sorghum, a livestock feed grain. As China’s ambitions rise, so too does its ability to guide economic development initiatives across the globe. China’s massive “Belt and Road” initiative has invested several hundred billion dollars in transportation, infrastructure and energy across 71 nations in Asia, Africa and Europe. The project will integrate China’s economy more intimately with the global economy. It’s first priority, though, is that it is good for China and its people. Trump and Xi Jinping both know that economic and national security priorities reinforce each other. Trump’s doctrine may be rooted in domestic politics (the forgotten blue-collar worker) but he considers nationalist policies as the ultimate guarantor of prosperity, not just for the US but for all other nations, too. The recent tit-for-tat protectionist declarations from Beijing and Washington could very well lead to decreased international trade and a dampening of global GDP growth that would have consequences for the EU and beyond. Bad news for everyone, nativists and internationalists alike. International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde offered a warning recently about the perils of protectionism and the erosion of global cooperation: “The multilateral trade system has transformed our world over the past generation. But that system of rules and shared responsibility is now in danger of being torn apart.” Legarde sees “darker clouds looming” from multiple threats, including American fiscal deficits, Germany’s omnipresent trade surplus, and Chinese trade policies that prioritize state-run enterprises. Seventy years ago the United States created the Marshall Plan, a $13 billion plan to revive the war-ravaged economies of Europe. It was a farsighted investment that sought to create a stable market-oriented Europe that would no longer find any utility in large-scale internal armed conflicts. The cooperative multilateralism that informed and guided the Marshall Plan is today under siege from a nationalist fervor in Europe that Emmanuel Macron derided as a yellow brick road fantasy, reckless adventurism that was in vogue because it is different. Even for those who advance a realpolitik doctrine, multilateralism and regional collaboration still have relevance toward nationalistic goals. Migration policy in Europe will be most effective when all 28 nations share some core principles concerning the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants currently inside the union. Terrorism is another area where multilateral agencies have meaning when they are tasked with collaborating formally. The attacks in Paris in November 2015 and in Barcelona last year demonstrated not only the need for national police and intelligence agencies to talk to each other but also for local policymakers to know how the lines of communication work between neighboring countries. As the United Kingdom is now discovering following its vote to leave the European Union, the price of going it alone is often higher than anticipated. Nearly two years after the referendum Brexit leaders in London are struggling to get a handle on the true costs of leaving the EU and what it means for the British economy. The so-called divorce bill is estimated to be nearly 50 billion euros. The latest public opinion survey of British citizens shows that 45 percent of respondents believe the decision to leave the EU was wrong. Forty-two percent believe it is the right decision. George F. Kennan, perhaps America’s greatest diplomat of the 20th century, articulated what became known as the strategy of containment. If American diplomacy concentrated on genuine national security interests then the Soviet menace could be managed and contained. His admonition to policymakers and State Department leadership was consistent and based on an embrace of realism that would find support today from a diverse cross-section of world leaders who either champion nationalist policies or seek to establish a greater role in international and regional affairs for their home nation. “The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better,” Kennan wrote in 1948. Years later, though, he expressed disapproval over the Cold War arms buildup that grew from the zero-sum gamesmanship of the era. The challenges facing the global community are both small and big. Protectionist trade policies have been around for a long time. They protect critical industries as well as the workers who seemingly embody a larger meaning to the nation. They also defend sacred domestic cultural icons, both real and imagined. The ad-hoc system of pick and choose multilateralism is perhaps an apt symbol for the state of the world in 2018. En Marche, Belt and Road, and America First. There’s no place like home.

Rabat – The long-awaited official jersey of Morocco’s national team for the 2018 World Cup has finally been unveiled. The first version of the jersey, released on April 27, received heavy criticism from many Moroccans and officials, describing it as lacking originality and in need of further development. President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation Fouzi Lekjaa urged Adidas to redesign the kits. Adidas responded quickly to the Moroccan anger over the kits and decided to make a new design that would appeal to the Moroccan public. Russian footballer Vladimir Granat officially presented the Moroccan national team jersey on Thursday. So far it has received largely negative reviews from online commenters. #VladimirGranat, défenseur de la #Russie porte le nouveau maillot du #Maroc @EnMaroc ?? au #Mondial2018 #Russie2018 #Sport24info

Rabat – After announcing his retirement from soccer at the end of the season with his club AS Nancy-Lorraine, Youssouf Hadji is seriously thinking about continuing his football career off the field, and he is not excluding the possibility of returning to his homeland, Morocco. Three weeks ago, the former Atlas Lion publicly announced his decision to retire, after talking with his club, the staff and his teammates. He played his final game at Marcel-Picot against Orleans with a (3-0) win on Friday, May 11. Hadji, 38, had scored 86 goals in 348 games and became the second highest scorer in the history of AS Nancy behind the sensational Michel Platini. In a video published on AS-Nancy’s official website, the club said, “Youssef Hadji is now thinking about following his career, off the field.” The French-Moroccan spoke of his future, “As a player, it was my last match at Marcel Picot. After that, I’m going to stay in football as I can only do that. We will see the opportunities. I am fulfilled. In my career, I saw what I wanted to see. Now we will give room to young people.”  The Moroccan international football player may return to the Kingdom. “If I need sun, I’ll go to Morocco,” he joked. Hadji’s brother Mustapha Hadji is the assistant manager of the Atlas Lions. “With the Moroccan selection like my brother? Yes why not. There are many things that can tempt me. If I can bring something thanks to the long career that I had, that’s what I think I will do,” he said. Hadji’s career was formed with Lorraine, for whom he played during three different periods (1998-2003, 2007-2011, and 2014-present) and with whom he won the French Ligue 2 champion title in 2016. Hadji also wore jerseys from Bastia, Rennes (twice), Al-Arabi and Elazigspor. Hadji will always be remembered as an iconic Atlas Lion who helped Morocco’s national team reach the finals of the African Cup of Nations in 2004.

Rabat – This is a story with a happy ending. People on social media were happy to hear that Ghazal, a missing 4-year-old girl, has found her way back to her parents after she disappeared for over 11 days in Casablanca. The young girl was reunited with her parents Thursday, May 24, shortly before dawn.  After days of searching, her family, who had made a call for the public to look for her on social networks, can finally breathe.  Authorities in Casablanca managed to find Ghazal at 1 a.m. According to witnesses, her parents received  a call Wednesday evening from a couple in Casablanca who said that they had seen the girl and had kept her with them without notifying the police. The couple was placed in police custody under the supervision of the public prosecutor to determine the exact circumstances of the disappearance. Ghazal disappeared Sunday, May 13, in the neighborhood Riad El Oualfa, Diour Nasrani, Casablanca. She was playing in front of her grandmother’s house before she disappeared. The story moved many people on social networks who did their best to help Ghazal’s family find their little girl.

Rabat – The newly launched anti-corruption hotline is producing results, as the security services in Kenitra have reported the arrest of a policeman suspected of engaging in corrupt acts. The security services arrested an officer in Kenitra Monday, after he accepted an MAD 2,000 bribe in exchange for keeping silent about other corruption.  A citizen witnessed the bribery and called the new corruption hotline (0537718888), enabling security forces to set up a sting operation and catch the officer red-handed. The culprit is being prosecuted on corruption charges. The Kenitra arrest is the second to occur since the launch of the hotline last week. The first arrest took place in Marrakech airport, where a security officer was caught receiving a bribe from two foreigners to facilitate security screening procedures for them. Since the launch of the hotline on May 14, the Public Prosecution Office in the Ministry of Justice reported that it has registered 599 calls from witnesses reporting corruption. The initiative comes in line with the government’s national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050. Compared to 2016, Morocco improved slightly in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2017, owing to the government’s efforts to counter administrative corruption, power abuse, and public funds mismanagement.

Rabat – Moroccan fans at the 2018 World Cup in Russia can expect to receive help from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Interior. Daily newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported Wednesday that the Ministry of Health will mobilize medical staff who will surround the stadiums in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Kaliningrad, where the Atlas Lions will play, to provide medical assistance for Moroccan supporters. As for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has instructed the Moroccan embassy in Moscow to set up itinerant consulates that to provide supporters with the necessary documents. The consulates will also help fans organize their stay in Russia and deliver mobility booklets containing information on stadiums and cities in which Morocco will compete, and will also provide assistance with public transportation, travel documents, and the FAN ID required by Russian authorities to attend matches. On his way to South Korea, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani landed in Moscow to meet Morocco’s ambassador to Russia, Abdelkader Lachhab. The two officials discussed how the Moroccan embassy is mobilizing to welcome Moroccan fans. Royal Air Maroc (RAM) will organize direct flights to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kaliningrad. Additional flights will be scheduled if the Moroccan national team reach the next rounds. The Moroccan team will play its first game against Iran on June 15 in Saint Petersburg, the second against Portugal on June 20 in Moscow, and the last game against Spain on June 25 in Kaliningrad.

Rabat – The fashion police have struck again. When it comes to “first lady” attire, Saad Eddine El Othmani’s wife’s choice of djellaba did not cut it as observers delineated the flaws in her gown during the prime minister’s visit to Seoul. Halima Saghour was probably not expecting such a reaction for her first official visit. While Head of Government El Othmani was received by his South Korean counterpart, Lee Nak-Yeon, in Seoul on the occasion of a rare official visit Monday, May 21, his wife’s dress attracted the most interest among people. A picture of the Moroccan head of government posing with  the South Korean prime minister and their wives went viral. Detractors quickly disparaged the dress, saying that Saghour’s outfit was “old school” and “inappropriate.” “What will we remember from the five years of Elothmani? The djellaba of his wife,” said one Twitter user.       Dressed in a very sober black djellaba and a colorful scarf, Saghour did not seem to satisfy the public’s opinion. Back in 2014, Nabila Benkirane, wife of former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, had also received a lot of criticism about the simplicity of her djellaba after a photo with the US presidential couple at the first US-Africa summit was posted. El Othmani’s first visit to Seoul El Othmani was accompanied on his visit to Seoul by a large delegation including Mohamed Boussaid, Minister of Economy and Finance; Said Amzazi, Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research; and Othmane El Ferdaous, State Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade and the Digital Economy, in charge of investment. The official visit, the first of its kind with a Moroccan head of government in the Republic of Korea, was an opportunity for both parties to welcome the bonds of friendship and good cooperation that have united the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1962. Throughout the state visit, both guests and host will hold talks to find opportunities for cooperation between Morocco and South Korea on different sectors including education, economy, and investment.

By Karen Duarte Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan signed several cooperation agreements on Tuesday in a meeting in Abu Dhabi.  The two officials signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding a standardization and conformity assessment between Morocco’s Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment, and Digital Economy and the Emirati Authority for Standardization and Metrology.  Bourita and Al Nahyan also signed an MoU between Morocco’s Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water, and the Emirati Federal Transport Authority-Land &amp; Maritime to mutually recognize certificates that conform to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) and its amendments. Also signed was an executive program to implement media cooperation between the governments of Morocco and the UAE from 2018 to 2020. The officials also signed an MoU on cultural cooperation. After signing the MoU’s, both officials expressed their happiness. “We are proud of the agreement signed by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) last year to supply sulphur to phosphate producer OCP Morocco,” said Al Nahyan. Bourita noted that the Moroccan people will remain indebted to the significant roles played by the UAE’s founding father and the late King Hassan II of Morocco in establishing prosperous relations between the countries.  Upon the instructions of King Mohammed VI and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the 5th session of the Morocco-UAE Joint Committee was held during the royal visit to the UAE, on November 11, 2017. Following the 5th session, both officials agreed to  signing the several cooperation agreements on Tuesday.

Rabat – It has nothing to do with the defender of Juventus.  The video went viral on social media. Last Saturday, at the presentation of the Italian championship trophy, Mehdi Benatia had quite a lonely moment. The Moroccan international football player wanted to shake the hands of two hostesses before going on the stage, but neither of the two ladies accepted his handshake. Following the incident, a lot of reactions were posted on social media as people quickly jumped to conclusions, describing the scene as “racist.” After receiving a lot of messages, one of the hostesses took to her Instagram page to explain herself. “I received several messages asking me why I did not shake Benatia’s hand. I want to clarify the situation: The rules forbid us any contact with people around us, so there is no personal consideration in this gesture, I am actually a big fan of Juve!” she said.  ????Dopo più di un milione di visualizzazioni su social ho ricevuto molti messaggi in Direct e commenti su Benatia.  Le regole delle hostess non permettono di avere alcun contatto con i protagonisti durante le manifestazioni ufficiali. Quindi nulla di personale nel non aver dato la mano al calciatore . Sono tifosa juventina e esprimo alla società Juventus i miei complimenti per la vittoria. ???? #benatia #hostess #juventusgirl #juveverona #mehdibenatia #juve #seria #juventus #fantozzi #friendzoned #scudetto #premiazione #bendtner #festascudetto #preniazionejuventus A post shared by  Svetlana Vakulova (@whitefatcat) on May 20, 2018 at 3:16am PDT  However, the reactions of people are understandable given the national team captain’s history of facing animosity in Italy. Last month, the Atlas Lion was harshly insulted by Italian comedian Maurizio Crozza who called him all kinds of names after the Real Madrid-Juventus match. In 2017, he was in the middle of a television interview when someone called him a “sh***y Moroccan” in his earpiece. Benatia, 31, has spent most of his career in Italy, where he has played for Udinese, AS Roma, and Juventus. He joined the latter two years ago on loan from German football giant Bayern Munich.

Rabat – The UN has denounced reported mass expulsions of sub-Saharan migrants from Algeria as illegal under international law.  “We urge Algeria to implement the recommendations made by the Committee on Migrant Workers in April, including to explicitly prohibit collective expulsions and establish monitoring mechanisms to ensure that expulsions of migrant workers are carried out in strict compliance with international standards,” UN Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani asserted in a press briefing Tuesday. According to the UN human rights office (OHCHR), raids by Algerian security forces typically occur in construction sites and areas with high migrant populations, although migrants also testified to arrest and detention after encounters with Algerian authorities in the street Many of the deported migrants often end up in neighboring Niger or Mali, without money, passports, food, or clothes due to the rapid nature of the deportations, Shamdasani added.  Following detention in the southern Algerian city of Tamanrasset, detained migrants are moved to the Nigerien city Agadez or smaller border cities, where they are abandoned without food, possessions, or contacts. Surrounded by the Sahara desert, many migrants are often forced to walk for hours in the heat to cross the Nigerien border. In its statement, the OHCHR urged Algerian authorities to maintain migrants’ rights to seek asylum, to the principle of non-refoulement (forced deportation), and to due process under international law. Reports of Algeria’s mass migrant deportations to Niger first surfaced in August 2017 to widespread condemnation by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The organization denounced the expulsions as blatant violations of international migrant protections granted by the UN and African Union. Racism in the country, evidenced by the popular hashtag #Say_No_to_Africans and reports of frequent assaults, feeds migrant vilification and detention; even Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia referring to the sub-Saharan undocumented population as “a source of crime, drugs, and many other plagues” in July 2017. Although Algerian officials have discussed the possibility of implementing a regularization program similar to that of Morocco, legislative action has made little progress. In April, Algerian interior ministry official Hassen Kacimi reported to Reuters that the North African country “is very concerned by the growing number of illegal migrants.” Dismissing condemnation from human rights organizations, the official stated, “Nobody has helped us, we are handling the situation with our own means.”

Washington D.C. – Less than a month after the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2414, Polisario has announced that it will celebrate the 45th anniversary of its founding in Tifariti and transfer its parliament there. The move tests the resolution, which called on Polisario to withdraw from Gueguerat area and to refrain from taking any destabilizing steps. Moroccan diplomacy quickly condemned the move and demanded that the United Nations shoulder its responsibility and compel Polisario to comply with the provisions of Resolution 2414, the ceasefire agreement and Military Agreement No. 1. A threat to the status quo Despite Morocco’s condemnation and a statement issued by the UN Secretary-General on Saturday, in which he called on the Polisario to refrain from changing the status quo, the Polisario organized a military parade in the area. The military parade is an unprecedented and serious development that requires resolute intervention by the United Nations. Security Council Resolution 2414, adopted on the heels of an unprecedented diplomatic campaign launched by Morocco, was clear. In operative paragraph 8, the Security Council expressed concern about Polisario’s announcement to transfer part of its government to Tifariti. In principle, given the current dynamic of the political process in the Security Council and the strong rhetoric that Morocco has used against Algeria and Polisario in recent months, any Polisario move in Tifariti constitutes a flagrant violation of the Security Council resolution and puts it in a more critical position than it was in this April or even April of last year. Polisario’s gift to Morocco It seems that Polisario did not learn any lesson from the diplomatic blows it suffered in the United Nations this year and last year. Nor does it seem to get the message that all its attempts to change the situation in the buffer zone and throughout the area east of the berm have failed and resulted in weakening its position. Moreover, thanks to the proactive manner in which Moroccan diplomacy is handling the latest development, Polisario has been put on the defensive and is suspected of destabilizing the region and failing to respect the relevant United Nations resolutions adopted by the Security Council since April 2007. Any such action by Polisario is a gift to Morocco, which should escalate its rhetoric against the separatist movement and warn the United Nations of its determination to take all necessary measures to protect its interests, including the use of military force, should the Security Council fail to compel Polisario to abide by Resolution 2414. The move also provides Morocco with another argument to reject direct negotiations with Polisario to reach a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict and to reiterate that there will be no solution as long as Algeria does not participate in the negotiations. How can Morocco accept negotiations with a party that has shown no good faith, has taken steps contrary to Security Council resolutions and further seeks to change the status quo in the area with a fait accompli? Furthermore, the regional and international context in which the Polisario move took place will potentially weaken its position in the Security Council and expose it to painful political blows in the next six months. Iran and Hezbollah in hot water The move comes two weeks after Morocco cut ties with Iran because of Hezbollah’s alleged military and logistical support for Polisario. These accusations put the Polisario in an unenviable position, raising suspicions about its cooperation with a non-state actor that the US considers a terrorist organization. If Morocco succeeds in convincing its allies of complicity between Polisario and Hezbollah, the image that the latter has tried to promote for decades as a peaceful movement that renounces violence and terrorism will be eroded and dealt a painful blow. Morocco’s accusations against Polisario came in an international context characterized by hostility between the US and its Arab allies on the one hand, and Iran and its allies, including Syria and Russia, on the other hand. It is no secret that Iran is the main supporter of Hezbollah and all its actions in the Middle East and North Africa aim to advance Iran’s expansionist agenda. Security Council’s October deliberations No matter what Algeria does to refute or dismiss the accusations made by Morocco, there is no doubt that in October, Morocco will surely include the complicity between Polisario and Hezbollah in the debates before deliberations by the members of the Security Council ahead of the renewal of MINURSO’s mandate. Given the hostility of the Trump administration and of most members of Congress to Hezbollah and Iran and Washington’s eagerness to rein in Iran and put an end to its threat to the stability of its allies, it is highly likely that the US will take Morocco’s accusations against Hezbollah and Polisario seriously. It is also highly likely that the UN Secretary-General will include in his report on the conflict prior to October discussions of all the violations committed by Polisario. Morocco should handle Polisario firmly On the other hand, Moroccan diplomacy should handle the developments with great firmness and demand that the United Nations immediately intervene to compel the Polisario to comply with Resolution 2414 and the provision of the ceasefire agreement. A simple statement issued by the UN Secretary-General is not enough. If the United Nations fails to ensure full compliance with the agreements, Morocco must escalate its rhetoric and threaten to declare the ceasefire agreement null and void. To avoid this scenario, the UN Secretary-General should unequivocally state that Polisario is bound by the terms of the agreements and cannot take any action to change the status quo in the region. The Secretary-General must also address any ambiguity in the interpretation of the cease-fire and explicitly declare that the areas east of the berm, including Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, are not “liberated areas” but areas under the authority of MINURSO military officers. The Security Council should act immediately to condemn Polisario’s move and its disregard for the UN resolution. Morocco should also threaten to cease cooperating with the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General until further notice, as long as the UN has not done what is necessary to prevent Polisario from changing the status quo in the region.

Rabat – According to the latest statistics of the General Treasury of the kingdom, the state’s ordinary revenue has increased, alleviating its under-performance in March with a revenue of MAD 76.4 billion in April. Revenue in March had declined by 2.6 percent since February, but revenue in April is up 5 percent since March. Corporate tax revenues, which declined by 17 percent in March, went down again by 14.6 percent in April to MAD 16.1 billion. The decrease is explained by the tax returns for the year 2017 distributed in March 2018, which was less than expected due to the inflation base effect. Income tax revenues increased by 2.4 percent to MAD 14.7 billion. Regarding indirect taxes, Value Added Tax increased by 7.6 percent to MAD 21.9 billion, and Consumption Internal Tax (TIC) increased by 6.1 percent to MAD 8.9 billion. Investment income taxes dropped 4.7 percent to MAD 22.5 billion. Government spending has remained stable at MAD 73.3 billion per month, mainly due to the fall in debt interest payments, which offset the slight increase in the government’s salary expenses. Morocco spends MAD 3.5 billion repaying external debt.

Rabat- Students organized demonstrations on Wednesday to protest the detention of a teacher who was caught on video violently assaulting a highschool girl.  The Court of First Instance in Khouribga, a city 123 kilometers southeast of Casablanca, ordered the detention of the teacher on Tuesday. The older male teacher, who appeared striking and cursing at his student during class in the viral video, admitted to charges against him and remains in detention. A member of the victim’s defense committee, Idriss Harach, told Hespress news site that the girl threw chalk on the teacher who beat her. The girl’s father utterly refused to withdraw her complaint, despite Harach’s attempts to find common ground between the two parts, as the incident coincided with the holy month of Ramadan, Harach informed the same source. In protest against the court’s order, many students of Imam Malik Highschool where the violence took place, gathered in front of the court calling for the teacher’s release while chanting insults at the assaulted girl.  Harach noted that the demonstrations siding with the teacher further eliminated the possibility of reconciliation between the girl and her assailant. 
The teacher’s arrest immediately followed the posting of the video that circulated online on May 19 and fueled the anger of social media users calling for his arrest. In response, the Moroccan public has questioned the role of the Ministry of Education and the fate of Moroccan education, in the face of rising reports of violence against students and teachers alike. Minister of Education, Vocational Training, and Higher Education Said Amzazi denounced the act of violence on Monday and said that it contradicted the morals and values of education.

Rabat – Dutch magazine for military database and aviation Scramble announced on Tuesday that the Moroccan government is planning to purchase another series of F-16 Fighting Falcons. The magazine said that Morocco plans to get 12 brand new single-seat F-16V Vipers, adding that the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces currently has 15 F-16C Block 52 and 8 F-16D Block 52s. “The 24 FAR F-16C/Ds were delivered in 2011 and 2012 and are based at 6 Air Base Benguérir with Escadre de Chasse ‘Falcon’, ‘Spark” and ‘Viper,’ ” said the magazine. According to the magazine, the aircrafts used by the Moroccan army are all built in the US, while Algeria receives its heavy military equipment from Russia. Defense and weapons procurement publication Defense World reported on May 8 that the US Department of Defense has offered US aerospace and defense technology giant Northrop Grumman a military fund to power up Morocco’s M1A2S tanks with eye-safe lasers. Defense World added that Morocco has bought 220 Abrams tanks “refurbished for the Kingdom  through the US Army’s Excess Defense Articles (FDA) program.” The US Pentagon approved the delivery of USD 115 million in military equipment in September 2017. A 2018 report released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said Morocco is the second largest arms importer in Africa, representing 12 percent of the continent’s total military imports in the 2013-17 period. The same source said the US is Morocco’s main military supplier with a 52 percent share in Morocco’s imports. Despite its declining oil revenue, Algeria remains the largest importer of heavy military equipment in Africa. A 2018  report issued by SIPRI earlier this month shows that although Algeria decreased its military expenditure by 5.2 percent between 2016-17, the country remains Africa’s largest importer of military arms, spending USD 10 billion.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat- Morocco’s State Secretary in charge of Water Charafat Afilal has reported that Morocco’s dams are nearly 70 percent full, compared to the 56.2 percent recorded last year. Afilal indicated that there will be no disruption in the drinking water supply over the summer thanks to abundant rain filling most wells, springs, and groundwater sources. Concerning royal instructions, Afilal noted that a budget of MAD 606 million had been allocated to resolve the problem of drinking water supply in 2018. The government’s plan will create temporary solutions to urgent problems until the larger projects dam building and well drilling is complete to ensure continued water supply in remote areas which suffer from drought and are difficult to access. Afilal commented on water quality, saying water distributed through the public network is strictly controlled from its source to consumers in cities and rural areas, through the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE). On the national plan for sanitary liquid waste, Afilal noted that since its adoption, the number of sewage treatments plants has increased from 20 to 122. In 2009, Morocco developed a new water strategy aimed to support the water needs for its economic development plan until 2030. Building dams is part of the plan but will eventually flood some villages.

Rabat – “Bad Boys 3” is happening. Fifteen years later, the iconic duo of police officers Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is coming back for a third part of the famous saga. The movie will be directed by Belgian-Moroccan filmmakers Adil El Arabi and Bilall Fallah, with Jerry Bruckheimer returning as producer. In an interview with French outlet Le Parisien, the Moroccan duo revealed that they first refused to direct “Bad Boys 3” but were finally convinced by American producer Bruckheimer. “We will not believe it until filming. But we will be back in Europe because we know we will not win any French award with Bad Boys 3,” they joked. “In Belgium, there is no money, but at least we do what we want […] One day, we will make a sci-fi film, and we will send Moroccans into space,” said the duo. Called “Bad Boys for Life”, the movie is set to begin filming in August, but the release date has been pushed back to January 17, 2020. The budget is set for USD 100 million, five times greater than the original action-packed movie. The third chapter in the series will see Lawrence’s character, Marcus Burnett, working as a private eye after a falling out with Smith’s Mike Lowery. Lowery is going through a midlife crisis as a bachelor who finally wants to mature, all while dealing with a new, young, and cocky partner. Lowery and Burnett are brought together again when a lean, mean, skilled, Albanian mercenary with a vendetta puts a death order on Lowery and Burnett for killing his brother. Now the two must work together once again to bring him down.   The first Bad Boys movie was released in 1995 and garnered more than USD 144 million in profits, while the second earned USD 273 million. Adil and Bilall rose to fame with the movie “Black,” which deals with urban bands, released only in video-on-demand in France in 2016. They received the Discovery Award in Toronto the same year. In 2017, they were named among the 10 “directors to follow” by the American magazine “Variety.” In early 2018, they made “Paster,” a story about four friends, small drug dealers who dream of becoming future sponsors of organized crime. But everything gets complicated when they steal a big load of cocaine. The two friends also direct “Beverly Hills Cop 4,” starring Eddie Murphy.

Rabat – The boycott against dairy company Centrale Danone continues, despite the company’s offer to reconcile with the campaign supporters. In its fourth statement, Centrale Danone denied claims of products’ alleged poor quality on Wednesday. Since the boycott against high prices was launched on April 20, Centrale Danone has released a series of statements. The first and second statements denied price increases and apologized to customers for statements by its purchasing director Adile Benkirane, who characterized the boycott as a betrayal of the nation and its products. Centrale Danone then released, on the eve of the holy month of Ramadan, a third statement, emphasizing that the company has listened to the demands of citizens and has a “special offer,” dubbed “Zine Bladi” (the Beauty of my Country), to show support for families. The offer includes a 20 percent discount on its yogurt throughout Ramadan. The fourth statement claims that since the release of the “special offer,” rumors and false information about the quality of its products were posted on social media, especially Facebook.  Products are of good quality “This misinformation affects the quality of Centrale Danone’s products and could affect consumer confidence in the company’s products,” the company said in a statement. The company emphasized that it would like to give the public details on its products. “Central milk, like all other products of the company, is closely monitored during the production process” reads the statement.  The company added that the production of milk is subjected to the strictest observance of international health safety standards. “The production is also monitored by the National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA). The statement added that the firm’s five factories have an international certificate for the safety of its products, as well as other certificates, including ISO 9001 and FSSC 22000. Danone also has a recognition certificate from the Hygiene and Food Safety (HACCP). After listing several other reassurance of its products, the company called on online activists to stop sharing “suspicious information without verifying it first.” Boycotters unhappy Like its previous statements, Danone’s recent post received a backlash from Moroccan social media users. People supporting the boycott commented that they will not stop the boycott as long as it has not listened to their demands and lowered the prices of its products. One Facebook user said: “We are not asking you about the product’s quality because this is your duty, we are talking about whether you will decrease the prices.” “Be sure that we will not stop the boycott if you don’t decrease the prices,” wrote another Facebook user.  “We don’t need your statements, we want you to lower your prices.”

Rabat – Ramadan … what a wonderful period of the year! If the holy month means fasting from sunrise until sunset, getting close to God, self cleansing and reflection time, it also means being around (or meeting) people who have special habits, and a unique way of dealing with Ramadan.  From those who get angry or sleep all day to those who count the minutes, here are 15 types of people you have probably met (or will meet) during the holy month. The sleeping beauties: Sleeping is their religion. Fasting from sunrise until sunset means sleeping from sunrise until sunset for some people. They do not even care what time it is as long as they wake up before the maghreb adan (at sunset).  via GIPHY The time keepers: Counting time is their main occupation. They know exactly what time it is and how many hours are left until the f’tour (the breaking of the fast). They are also the same people who only know the time of the prayers during Ramadan. Don’t even try to ask them about it.  via GIPHY The hungry ones: “I am starving” is a sentence that you will probably hear a hundred times during the day. They smell food everywhere, and they get really moody because of their empty stomach. They have never been happier than after the first bite of food after the fast.  via GIPHY The angry ones: Brace yourselves, “Tremdina” (the irritable faster) is coming. Hating people or things is their mojo during Ramadan as they quickly get mad, sometimes for no reason. The best thing to do is to avoid them at all costs.  via GIPHY The complainers: The weather is too hot; the streets are too crowded; the traffic is awful and people are breathing; this is the typical day of a complainer.  via GIPHY The unhygienic ones : Who said that showering, putting on perfume and brushing teeth is forbidden during the holy month? Some people seem to think so. Once they open their mouths, you will probably pass out.  via GIPHY The sport addicts: Ramadan is a perfect reminder to work out. The gym has never been so full than it is during the holy month as people try to get in shape before summer. But in reality all they do is look at themselves in the mirror and take selfies.  via GIPHY The “religious” ones: These are the ones who will give you lectures during the whole month. Putting makeup on? Haram (forbidden). Wearing a t-shirt? Haram. Listening to music? Also haram. They spend the whole year cursing and practising irreligious behavior, but when it comes to Ramadan, they don’t miss a single prayer.  via GIPHY The addicted ones: Coffee, cigarettes, chocolate, they just can’t seem to control their addictions. It is actually a pretty good excuse for them when they behave questionably. When they break the fast, they will start with their beloved addictions before eating a good meal.  via GIPHY The television watchers: Missing an episode of “Souhlifa”? NEVER! Before, during, and after f’tour, do not even try to fight over the remote-controll; it is a lost cause.  via GIPHY The “I want to lose weight” ones: They have just remembered that summer is just around the corner. Preparing for a summer body is easier during Ramadan according to some people. They think that fasting the whole day and eating the whole night will help them achieve their goals.  via GIPHY The master chefs: They have no need to envy Choumicha. Ramadan is the perfect occasion to try all the recipes that their grandmother has left them. They spend their day cooking to prepare for the best f’tour table: beghrir, briwates, chebakia, harira, etc. Nothing is left out.  via GIPHY The resolution makers: Ramadan is a month of self reflecting, in which we can work on our flaws. The resolution maker has a to do-list of things he wants to work on. Resolutions can be anything from quitting smoking to becoming more helpful.  via GIPHY The “hard” workers: They get up at 7 AM to go to work. They will pretend that they should not have to help set the table because they worked all day, but we all know they have been sleeping at their desks.  via GIPHY The fasting police: They proclaim themselves inspectors of Ramadan, and everyone hates them. They ask each individual around them if they are fasting; they have eyes on everything and will criticize your way of dealing with the holy month.  via GIPHY 
This feature is part of an exclusive series at Morocco World News for Ramadan. Also in the series is: How Moroccan Pass Their Time during Ramadan.

Rabat – The Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Riyad al-Malki submitted a state party referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday, requesting that the ICC open a full investigation into Israeli settlements and “war crimes” in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Jerusalem. The state party referral would expand the ongoing preliminary investigation of Israeli settlements and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) actions during the 2014 Gaza war. The Palestinian state party referral is widely viewed as an entreaty for justice in light of the recent US embassy relocation to Jerusalem and the corresponding Israeli military violence. Gaza officials report that 62 Palestinians were killed and over 2,000 were wounded by IDF soldiers during protests of the US embassy move on Monday, May 14. Thousands more were injured in the days leading up to the move during the “Great Return March” protests, which began on March 30. In a statement to AFP, the ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said, “My staff is vigilantly following developments on the ground and recording any alleged crime…The violence must stop.” Bensouda also expressed the necessity for IDF soldiers to cease the “excessive use of force.” In response to the Palestinian state party referral submission, Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement denouncing Palestine for working to “derail” the ICC’s mandate. The Israeli statement also accused protesters of using women and children as human shields on the Gaza border. Peace talks between Palestine and Israel have not progressed since 2014, and Palestinian officials have rejected the US as a mediating body entirely, as the Trump administration suggests the impending release of its “deal of the century.” Although Israel is not party to ICC arbitration, Palestinian officials hope the international court investigation would yield international arrest warrants for indicted Israeli officials. Several international bodies, including the UN, have declared the Israeli settlements as a “flagrant violation under international law,” specifically UN Resolution 2334. According to the Israeli NGO Peace Now, the “past few months have seen unprecedented development promoting settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem,” referring to the “quantum leap” in settlement construction as a “de-facto annexation” of Palestinian land under international law.

Rabat –  The  United Arab Emirates (UAE) has reiterated its condemnation of Iran’s interference in Morocco’s internal affairs during the opening of the fifth session of the joint UAE-Morocco Committee. The symposium, attended by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, opened on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. Emirates News Agency quoted Emirates Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, saying that the meeting coincides with “an unprecedented state of instability and spiraling violence across several Arab countries on the back of the growing danger of fanatic groups.” Al Nahyan then expressed the UAE’s support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara, adding that the UAE backs all measures undertaken by Morocco “to address any threats to its territorial integrity.” Commenting on Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran, the Emirati official said that his country denounces “all foreign interferences in the internal affairs of Arab countries, primarily Iran’s meddling into the region, and reiterate UAE’s support for all measures taken by Morocco in this concern over the past period.” The UAE was among the first Gulf countries to support Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran on May 1. Morocco has accused Iran of interfering in the country’s domestic affairs, and has blamed Iranian ally Hezbollah of delivering heavy military equipment to and training members of the Polisario Front. The fifth session of the joint committee is co-chaired by Al-Nahyan and Bourita. The session is held at the instructions of King Mohammed VI and Al-Nahyan’s brother Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. The session will feature political consultations between the two countries, trade talks, and the elaboration of recommendations and draft laws to be submitted to the joint committee. The UAE state-owned news agency reported on Tuesday that non-oil trade exchange between the countries rose from USD 464 million in 2013 to USD 524 million in 2017. The source added that trade grew 9 percent from 2016 to 2017, “threefold of its equivalent over the past five years,” according to the Emirati Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also commended the “distinguished” bonds between the two countries, emphasizing that the ties are at “their best.”

Rabat – Authorities arrested a suspect at Menara Airport in Marrakech after he was caught carrying a plastic bag containing “suspicious materials.”  The bag contained “ten tiny gas bottles, usually used for purposes such as camping, accompanied by ten cotton wipes and a bottle of kitchen oil.” A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said on Wednesday that security forces arrested a 35-year old man at about 4:15 AM.

Initial investigations conducted by DGSN showed that the suspect appeared to have symptoms of mental imbalance and that he was admitted at several hospitals specializing in the treatment of mental and psychological diseases.  Police are investigating the suspect’s motives. The defendant has been transferred to a hospital to examine his mental state.

Rabat- Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) has revealed in its latest report that the consumer price index (CPI) rose in April 2018. CPI increased by 0.3 percent in April, after rising by just 0.1 percent in March. The food index increased by 0.7 percent and the non-food index rose by 0.3 percent. Production of fruits and vegetables increased in both March and April, by 4.4 percent in March and by 2.1 percent in April. Meat production also increased by 1.1 percent in April.  In the non-food index, fuel prices increased by 2.8 percent, nearly ten times the price increases in the overall CPI.  Meanwhile, some products decreased slightly in price, including mineral and soft drinks by 0.8 percent, fish and seafood by 1.4 percent, and oils and fats by 0.4 percent. It seems that fish prices subsequently increased in May, including those of sardines, croakers, and sole fish, due to increased demand for Ramadan. The development resulted in calls for a fish boycott in addition to the ongoing boycott of three prominent Moroccan companies. The highest increases in CPI were recorded in Al Hoceima at 1 percent; Safi at 0.8 percent; Agadir at 0.7 percent; Oujda, Dakhla, and Guelmim at 0.6 percent; Marrakech and Settat at 0.5 percent; and Rabat at 0.4 percent. The CPI increased by 0.3 in Fez, Meknes, Tetouan, Tangier, Kenitra, Laâyoune, and Beni Mellal, while it rose by only 0.2 percent in Casablanca. In the twelve months since April 2017, CPI has increased by 2.7 percent. The food index increased by 3.7 percent, non-food products by 1.7 percent, and services (excluding communication services) by 6.8 percent. Communication services prices remained stable in the last year.  The core inflation indicator, which excludes products with volatile prices and products with public tariffs, remained stable in April compared to March, and has increased only 0.8 percent since April 2017.

Rabat – Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita has once again warned the world of the threat Iran and its proxy Hezbollah pose to the security of states. In a recent interview with Fox News, Bourita said Iran’s interference in nations’ domestic affairs “is unlikely to stop.” In his discussion with the US-based news outlet Fox News, Bourita denounced Iran’s meddling strategy in nations’ internal affairs. “I think it is clear that the interference of Iran in the internal affairs of the Arab and Muslim countries won’t stop in (the) Middle-East and in the Gulf countries,” Bourita said. He added that Iran is “disturbed” by Morocco’s “soft power” and “good relations” with the US and European countries. Bourita explained that Morocco’s relationship with Iran changed after the North African country arrested top Hezbollah financier Kassim Tajideen in 2017. Hezbollah “threatened Morocco to release him. We gave him to the United States and from that date there was a change.” Bourita said that the change “threatens our own security.” The Moroccan official also recalled the latest updates in the recent tension between Morocco and Iran. On May 1, Morocco cut diplomatic ties with Iran and accused its ally of delivering military equipment to and training the members of the Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. Bourita said that in the last month, the situation reached its peak “which is providing military equipment.” Bourita also mentioned the file of proof of Hezbollah-Polisario collusion that he gave Tehran. The file includes details and “proven and precise facts: dates of visits by senior officers of Hezbollah in Algeria, dates and venues of meetings with Polisario officials and a list of names of agents involved in these contacts,” Bourita said in a previous interview with Jeune Afrique. According to Fox News, Bourita “seemed to confirm” that the Iranian embassy in Algeria “was used to fund” the Algerian-backed Polisario, recalling the actions of the embassy’s cultural attaché Amir Moussawi. “[It’s] our understanding that he’s more powerful than the ambassador himself and his connection(s) are the strategic advisors to the Supreme Guide to the Islamic Republic of Iran.” While denying Morocco’s accusations, Iran claimed that the North African country made its decision due to pressure from other countries, including the US and Saudi Arabia. Morocco denied the claims, with Bourita emphasizing once again that Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran was “based on our own assessments,(our) own intelligence and with regard to our national security. So it was purely a bilateral decision.”

Rabat – The Paris Court of Appeal has once again denied a request to release Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan, who has been detained on rape and sexual harassment charges since February. Ramadan’s lawyer, Emmanuel Marsigny, complained about his client’s health condition and denounced the “multiple contradictions and inconsistencies among the complainants.” According to the lawyer, Ramadan has had multiple sclerosis since 2006. “Mr. Ramadan has nothing to do in prison. He can be quite free,”  the lawyer told AFP. He added that his client asked to live under restricted house arrest and surrender his passport to be released, but could not convince the court to order his release. To date, three women have accused Ramadan of rape. Ramadan denied all charges against him, but admitted to having relations with one of the complainants. Marie, Ramadan’s third complainant, relayed statements in March to French newsource Europe 1.  She also provided investigators with a dress allegedly containing Ramadan’s DNA. Tests are still being conducted to determine if there is a correlation between DNA samples. The defense team presented the court with several release requests. The latest application was rejected before the court on May 4. The scholar’s defense team also requested a new medical expert to examine Ramadan, claiming that his client’s health was incompatible with remaining in prison. The defense also added that Ramadan was not receiving the necessary treatment in custody. If the charges are confirmed, the scholar will face up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person, since the second complainant is disabled.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, along with a Moroccan delegation, landed in Russia on Sunday to meet the Moroccan ambassador to Russia. The officials discussed how the Moroccan embassy is mobilizing itself to welcome Moroccan fans who will travel to cheer on their team in the 2018 World Cup. The Moroccan delegation stopped in Russia en route to South Korea for the African Development Bank Annual Meetings. El Othmani wrote on his Facebook on Sunday that the brief visit covered many topics, including “preparations for the Moroccan participation in the 2018  World Cup, the reception of Moroccan supporters in Russia and other national affairs such as Morocco’s territorial integrity.” Only 23 days remain until the world premier tournament, which will kick off on June 14. The presence of Moroccan fans in Russia is expected to boost the national team, as many footballers rely on the support of Moroccans.  Morocco’s embassy is organizing “mobility booklets” for Moroccan football fans to attend the 2018 World Cup. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press in April, Moroccan ambassador to Russia Abdelkader  Lachheb said that the information packets will provide assistance with public transportation, travel documents, and the FAN ID required by Russian authorities to attend matches. “The validity of this identification document, which should be carried throughout the tournament, starts ten days before the first match and extends to ten more days after the final match,” Lachheb explained. Morocco’s flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) will organize flights from Casablanca to the three cities where Morocco’s Atlas Lions will play in the first round: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kaliningrad. RAM will add flights to other cities if the national team makes it to the next rounds. The Moroccan team will play its first game against Iran on June 15, the second against Portugal on June 20, and the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – A Nigerian parliamentary delegation has visited the southern city of Laayoune to observe Morocco’s exemplary development in the southern provinces. Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported that two members of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammad Adamu Aleiro and Orji Theodore Ahamefule, visited the area Sunday and met members of the regional committee of the National Human Rights Councils (CNDH), the municipal council and the regional council.  During the three day visit, the Nigerian officials also met several tribal sheikhs and religious notabilities of Morocco’s southern provinces to observe the multidimensional development that the region has experienced in the last decades.  The Nigerian senators toured the city, noting important socio-economic achievements, as well as many projects in progress. The visit is a part of the new dynamic that Morocco’s relations with Nigeria are experiencing. In May 2017, Morocco and Nigeria concluded several agreements related to the Nigeria-Morocco Gazoduc Project and the Moroccan-Nigerian cooperation in fertilizers. The government has invested MAD 21 billion until the end of March 2018 on the development projects. The projects are part of King Mohammed VI’s development model, which he launched in Laayoune in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the Green March in 2015. These projects include a road network, airports to serve African destinations, a railway between Tangier and Lagouira to link Morocco with other African countries, and an economic development fund to “support businesses and the social economy, generate steady income and create jobs, particularly for young people.” According to the Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, the development program in the southern provinces for 2015-2021 has achieved 48 percent completion.

With 250,782 Moroccans contributing to social security in Spain, only Romanians contribute more, with 339,631 workers. According to the statistics, published on Tuesday, Morocco is the largest community of non-EU foreign workers contributing to social security in Spain, followed by Chinese workers, with a total of 101,109 contributing. By contributing to social security, foreign workers can benefit from free Spanish healthcare, work-related sickness or injury compensation, maternity and paternity leave, child allowance, retirement and pension. Of all foreign workers, the ministry revealed that Italy ranks third, Ecuador fourth, the United Kingdom fifth, Bulgaria sixth, Colombia seventh, and Bolivia eighth.

At the end of April, the total number of immigrants contributing to social security reached 1,610,494 who are registered in the general social security scheme. 315,447 are registered in the autonomous regime, which represents workers in the independent sector or those who are self employed. Moreover, 4,566 are enrolled in the maritime regime, which represents the codes and conventions of behavior agreed upon by coastal states to provide a degree of security within territorial waters and on the high seas. Moroccans have historically immigrated to Spain for economic reasons, primarily looking for jobs in the agricultural and construction centers.

Out of the 6,635 votes, Mezouar won 5,173 votes compared to the 1,432 votes for his rival Hakim Marrakchi on Tuesday. Mezouar succeeded Miriem Bensaleh, who assumed the office for six years.

Bensaleh said that her experience as  president of the CGEM helped her on a personal level. “I did the job,” she said. Bensaleh added that she worked to ensure transparency in the administration procedures in CGEM, emphasizing that she is satisfied with the achievements and the work she accomplished within CGEM. She added that “our demands to the government have led to the restoration of confidence in the business community and good governance.”  Bensaleh is finishing her term amid a major boycott of three prominent companies, including her own mineral water company: Sidi Ali. During his election campaign, Mezouar pledged to boost business confidence and local investment. “I am carrying  a very ambitious but at the same time realistic program that aims primarily to boost business confidence and domestic investment.”  Mezouar’s program aims to support fragile economic bodies “that suffer relatively and need tools and measures to regain their energy to continue to develop.” The President is elected by the elective general assembly for a period of no more than three years. Mezouar, a Moroccan politician and businessman, was born in 1953 in Meknes. Mezouar is the former president of the National Rally of Independents (RNI). Mezouar is also the former Minister of Industry, Trade, and Economy and  former Minister of the Economy and Finance. Mezouar also held the position of president of the Moroccan Association of Textile and Clothing Industries (AMITH) and president of the Textile and Leather Federation within the CGEM.

Rabat – Seven months after a shooting in La Crème Cafe in Marrakech where two masked suspects killed a 26-year old man and injured two other individuals, the police have arrested 10 senior officers of the royal gendarmerie in several cities for their involvement in the activities of the international criminal network linked to the shooting.  According to Al Massae, the investigating judge in charge of financial crimes in the Court of Appeals in Marrakech presided over  the 10 officials who report to the Royal Gendarmerie in Larache, Tangiers, Tangier Med, Tetouan, Agadir, Settat, and Marrakech.  Placed in pre-trial detention, the ten face prosecution for corruption, disclosure of trade secrets and participation in international drug trafficking. The masked gunmen were targeting the cafe owner in the evening shooting, but they killed a medical student who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The cafe owner allegedly received death threats before the incident. The shooting was an act of “settling scores” in connection with an international drug trafficking network. The statement added that the network is also involved in similar crimes in some European countries. The arrestat of the officials culminates a lengthy investigation. In the course of the investigation, police listened to more than 600 telephone conversations of 100 people alleged to have links to the shooting. According to the same source, the officials were actually reported by the drug trafficking network, whiche operates in Morocco from abroad. On the day after the November 2 shooting, Moroccan authorities made six arrests in connection with the shooting, in which one was killed and two were injured. The arrests took place in Casablanca.

Rabat- It all started with Arabic hashtags equivalent to “Let_it_spoil” and “SayNotoHighPrices.” The ongoing boycott campaign embodies the Moroccan citizen’s fighting spirit, not only against the exorbitant prices of the three boycotted companies—Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone and Afriquia—but also against market monopolization and all forms of price manipulation across the country. It has already been a month since the launch of the boycott campaign, which started online on April 20, when people decided they had had enough and took to Twitter and Facebook to raise awareness of the unjustified prices set by the three major companies in the kingdom. The three boycotted companies are mineral and soda water company Sidi Ali,  dairy products company Centrale Danone, and Afriquia gasoline—a subsidiary of the Akwa Group whose owner is Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch. Five days into the boycott, Akhannouch took the chance at SIAM to demonstrate disregard for it and defend dairy workers, referring to the boycotted Centrale Danone, stating that the online campaign cannot hamper the work of 470,000 employees in the dairy sector. Akhannouch’s Afriquia stations recorded losses of 47 percent in Nador, 25 percent in Al Hoceima, and 39 percent in Casablanca’s Hay Hassani, according to newspaper Akhbar Alyaoum. As days passed by and the boycotters remained resolute, promising to continue through the holy month of Ramadan, several other government officials broke their silence and expressed their concern about the issues surrounding the campaign. Secretary-General of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) Nabil Benabdellah, Head of the Istiqlal Party Baraka, and Secretary-General of the Unified Socialist Party Nabila Mounib supported the campaign. Minister Delegate to the Head of Government for General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi, Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid, and Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim asserted different views. In a speech during Parliament session on May 7, Daoudi shared Akhannouch’s concern about workers in the dairy sector and warned of the consequences haunting the families of thousands of Centrale Danone employees, insisting that the boycott will hinder the country’s foreign economic investments and badly influence its reputation. At the same time, El Othmani said there were:“120,000 farmers, 80 percent of whom are small farmers working for this establishment [Centrale]…we are worried about their situation and are thinking of means to support them during this hard time which will impact them into the future.” In the early days of Ramadan, El Othmani expressed concern over market monopolization during the holy month. He reminded citizens of the government’s latest initiative, a consumer complaint hotline (57 57). He affirmed that the government is making serious efforts to meet citizens’ needs throughout Ramadan. Meanwhile El Khalfi had a different take. He did not denounce the boycott campaign for reasons such as its threats on the jobs of dairy farmers, but he believed that the price increases were “fake news.” He singled out Centrale Danone, saying:“The profit margin of the company is reasonable and does not exceed 20 centimes [per liter].” In turn, Ramid acknowledged the “wisdom” of Moroccan people, stating: “I am asking Moroccans, who have always been known for their wisdom and rationality, to suspend the boycott of milk.” According to him, the boycott came in conjunction with the spring peak yield in milk production. “I am not a citizen on the street”-Yatim replied, when a journalist asked him about his stance on the boycott as a Moroccan citizen. Yatim refused to go further on the subject and merely added: “I am a minister and not a citizen. You are asking me [about my stance] as a minister now. If I were a citizen on the street (private citizen) you would not ask me.” Yatim’s statements tipped social media users over the edge, as they rose to attack him on Facebook and Twitter, writing things like: “What were you before?”; “We will not forgive those who supported you in your election campaign”; and “We have discovered now that you are a minister and not a citizen on the street.” The latest apology came from Yatim, who wrote on his Facebook page that he is proud of being a Moroccan. He clarified his earlier statement, saying: “I would like to reiterate what is meant by this statement, which is more than three weeks old. This is to remind the journalist at the time that he asked me as a minister, and that he would not have asked me if I was a citizen walking in the street.” On behalf of the government, El Othmani apologized to boycotting consumers for the “verbal expressions and offenses” which were previously made against them, calling for tolerance and assuring that the government cannot be against the interest of citizens, as some think. Formerly, Centrale Danone Purchasing Director Adil Benkirane apologized to boycotting consumers whom he had called “traitors,” betraying the country and its products. After experiencing the wrath of consumers on social media and, allegedly, facing the threat of being fired from the company, Benkirane said, “I have read the reactions about my statement, and I know I made a mistake.” The first concerned company to officially comment on the boycott, Centrale Danone, emphasized in a statement that Benkirane’s offensive comment does not reflect its official stance. The voice of the burdened consumer, Thla Ouheddou, who first recounted her struggles to Alyaoum24 newspaper in a video and told of Sidi Ali’s monopolization near Oulmes, has now merged with the voice of the concerned company, as she recently appeared in a new video denying her original story and accusing the newspaper of pressuring her into venting at Sidi Ali. Thla, who lives off selling bread to Sidi Ali employees in the rural Middle Atlas village of Tarmilat by Oulmes said, in her original statements while she was on the verge of tears: “We suffer from water shortage while 150 [Sidi Ali] tank trucks carry water everyday.” It seems that she lost her confidence in mathematics, as she said in the new video: “I am ignorant, I don’t even know how to count.” Thla said:“I was troubled and pained since I suffer from diabetes, when these people [Alyaoum 24] came and told me just hold the microphone, and we will tell you what to say.” Hearkening back to her original statements, she said: “There is not enough [water] for drinking, not enough for doing laundry, yet we pay for it monthly.” Compared to her emotional state on the first video, which captured the anguish surfacing on her face as she complained about water being cut off in the region, Thla appeared with a blank face as she contradicted herself on the last video. “They told me to say that water was cut off on us, when it’s currently running day and night…I beg the authorities to pardon me because I was pushed to say what I said.” The very sudden change of Thla’s heart has raised questions among the public and pointed fingers at Sidi Ali as the one taking advantage of her difficult financial condition, presumably pressuring her to submit to the company’s preferred version of the story.
 New boycott hashtags were born Tuesday on social media networks: #Letitrot and #Letitswim. The boycott is now extending to fish due to high prices at the country’s fish markets. In a country with more than 1,000 miles of coastline, the rise in prices is unjustified, fish boycott supporters said today. Why now? The protests against high prices of fish are aligned to the fact that fish is a widely consumed food during Ramadan. “You know how to increase prices, but we have the boycott weapon,” one Twitter post said. Another read, “Moroccans will also be #Boycotting fish. Despite having a huge coast and bordering with two seas, fish is too expensive for the ordinary citizen. Effect of the regime’s disastrous economic policies. #Let_it_swim.” The new boycott sends a message to any business pondering an increase in prices without taking into consideration the purchasing power of the regular consumer.

Rabat – Since the beginning of the boycott crisis in Morocco four weeks ago, the political meter seems to be swiftly ticking towards the expiration date of the current Justice and Development party (PJD) cabinet and the coalition parties.  The massive boycott is threatening the future of three large Moroccan multinational corporations: Centrale Danone, Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès (Sidi Ali), owned by Holmarcom, and AFRIQUIA GAZ, owned by the Akwa Group. The boycott that was launched on social media has quickly spread across Morocco. It caused the loss of millions of dirhams for these companies and tarnished the reputations of their brands, products and executives. While the boycotters consistently demand that these companies lower their prices, many infer that the boycott has been politicized. They claim it targets the billionaire Mr. Aziz Akhannouch, the Minister of Agriculture and the head of the National Rally of Independents party (RNI), and the powerful businesswoman Mrs. Meriem Bensaleh-Chaqroun. She heads the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), Morocco’s largest business organization that represents the private sector. With more than 30,000 member companies, CGEM’s mission is to advance the interests of its member enterprises nationally and internationally by creating a favorable economic environment. As the heads of two of the boycotted companies, AFRIQUIA GAZ, and Eaux Minérales d’ Oulmès (Sidi Ali), both Akhannouch’s and  Bensaleh-Chaqroun’s names have come up repeatedly during the boycott. They are seen as powerful magnates who are using their positions to enrich themselves, grow their businesses, and monopolize certain vital sectors of the Moroccan economy. The boycott is also threatening the political shelf life of the PJD and the current government due to a poor handling of the situation. Since the beginning of the boycott, both the silence of Mr. Saad Eddine El Othmani, the Prime Minister, and the uncalculated remarks of several of his cabinet members have not only failed to suggest a possible solution, but directly inflamed the boycott. It all started when Mr. Mohamed Boussaïd, a member of the RNI and the Minister of Economy and Finance, called the boycotters “morons.” The term became a popular hashtag that the boycotters adopted and used to describe themselves in a positive way. In his first response to the boycott, during a live press conference, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi threatened the boycotters. He considered the boycott to be based on “false information” and not “part of free speech” and asserted that “the government will review current speech laws.” The boycotters reacted negatively and called for an apology as his comments seemed to have inflamed the situation and were seen as a failure on the government’s part to help resolve the worsening situation. The statement of Mr. Mohamed Yatim, the Minister of Labor and Employment, shocked the majority of Moroccans when it was propagated through social media platforms. When asked about the boycott, Mr. Yatim said “Some people understood that I am either for or against it. I am neither for nor against. I am not concerned with this matter, because I am a government official and that is the concern of the people.” He added when he was asked to comment as a Moroccan citizen, “I am a minister, I am not a citizen.” Yatim’s comments reveal the clear disconnection of the PJD-led government from the concerns of the Moroccan people. They mark the end of the popularity of the PJD party that won by branding itself as the party of the poor and working class Moroccans. While the boycott continues to shake the economic and political power structures in Morocco, the PJD’s popularity is on a slippery slope. The boycott that started as a protest of high prices on some of the most basic commodities in Morocco is having a double effect in politics by threatening the interests of Moroccan business and political tycoons. The boycott’s impact extends to the political parties in the government coalition, namely RNI and PJD, which are directly implicated in the ongoing boycott crisis.

Rabat – Moroccan international footballer Achraf Hakimi has expressed his determination to make Moroccans feel proud again during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Hakimi, who is a key player for the Moroccan team, made the list of the Atlas Lions who will play in Russia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In an interview with Moroccan TV channel Al Oula, the 19-year old Real Madrid football player shared his aspirations and his teammates’ determination to make another successful achievement in Russia. For El Hakimi, wearing the Moroccan kit is a “dream.” The young player addressed a message to Moroccan fans, promising them that he will do his best to make them happy again. In the qualification round last year Morocco did not lose a game, making all Moroccans proud after 20 years of absence from the FIFA World Cup field. The footballer also talked about players who inspire him, naming his teammate Marcelo Vieira, Moroccan Hajji brothers, and Noureddine Naybet. The Atlas Lions will play their first game against Iran on June 15, and the second game will be against Portugal on June 20. Morocco will play the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25. Hakimi asked Moroccans to support the national team as they did in the qualifier games. Hakimi has played for Real Madrid for just a short period of time. Recently, speculations on social media said that this season will be the last for Hakimi in Real Madrid. His coach, Zinedine Zidane, however, shut down the rumors and said that the Spanish-Moroccan footballer has a promising future. “Achraf Hakimi, Borja Mayoral and Marcos Llorente have to play ‘20 or 25 games’ next year to continue their development,” said the Frenchman. He added that “One year here, playing less and training with those who do play, isn’t a lost year. They have improved a lot, they have had minutes, and each player expects to play more.” Hakimi scored his first goal for the Spanish team on December 10 against Sevilla, becoming the first Moroccan ever to score for Real Madrid.

Rabat – Mehdi Benatia is confident about taking the Atlas Lions all the way in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. In an interview with France 24, the captain of the national team has talked about his ambitions for the World Cup, the path that led him to Juventus, and his determination to restore “pride and happiness” to Moroccan fans, as he counts on “the state of mind” of his team. Benatia is well aware of the challenge he will face competing against Iran, Spain and Portugal in the first round. “We already know that it’s going to be difficult. When you have the chance to participate in the World Cup, you want to play these kind of games, especially with Spain, which is the best team in the world […] It’s a pride and it’s a beautiful challenge,” the 31-year-old player said. The Juventus defender added that he sees himself in the finals as he wants to make Moroccans proud of the Atlas Lions. “I want the Moroccan supporter to be happy in the streets of Moscow.”  Moreover, “El Capitano” has faith in his team that he describes as strong and unified. “We have seen the state of mind of the national team during the pre-World Cup friendly games. We have a strong bond and that’s how we help each other,” he explained.  Benatia also talked about his career in Italy and recalled his time at Olympique Marseille (OM), where he is rumored to be returning in the mercato (transfer window).  Earlier this month, several media announced that OM was insisting on recruiting the Atlas Lion.  The French manager of OM, Rudi Garcia, asked for the Juventus defender, remembering his collaboration with AS Roma a few years ago when he was Benatia’s coach. In order to recruit Benatia, OM will have to spend more than EUR 25 million. “I was formed in Olympique Marseille. I wasn’t given the chance at the time to play with the professionals. When I look back at my career now I think it’s a good thing, I feel good with where I am know,” said the defender.  Benatia, 31, has spent most of his career in Italy, where he has played for Udinese, AS Roma, and Juventus. He joined the latter on loan from German football giant Bayern Munich. Captain Benatia concluded his interview by picturing himself in the finals. “If I close my eyes, I see myself passing the first round, and winning against France and even Argentina. Everything is possible.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI, accompanied by Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan, has launched three humanitarian projects to improve the economic and social conditions of poor women and youth in Kenitra. The King launched a building project to provide housing for families of fishermen in Mehdia, a center for vocational training and job integration in Sidi Taibi, and a center for vocational training in agricultural logistics in Souk El Arbaa. With an expected cost of MAD 26 million, the projects reflect the special interest that the King takes in women and youth as crucial stakeholders to maintain social balances and revive the socio-economic dynamic for local and national development, and his unwavering will to offer them a decent and prosperous lifestyle. MAD 6 million is allocated for the housing project that will provide fishermen’s wives—nearly 250 women yearly—with training in local income-generating trades. The project will ensure supervision and support for the creation of income-generating cooperatives.  The project, which is spread over 12 months, will also offer the women literacy, guidance, socio-educational support, and a daycare that offers preschool education for their children. Built on a plot of 1,500 square meters, the future facility will contain workshops for culinary arts, sewing, embroidery, knitting, and handicrafts. It will also include classrooms for literacy, computer, tutoring, counselling, and sale of homemade products, as well as a nursery and playground. The second project, a center for vocational training and job integration in Sidi Taibi, will open new prospects for young people to learn skills to integrate into the job market and improve their living conditions. The humanitarian project, costing MAD 8 million, seeks to increase access to various tools and means of social and vocational integration. The nearly 400 trainees who will benefit per year will learn from cultural and social activities that instill responsibility and encourage citizenship and voluntary work. The future center, which will also take 12 months, will be built on an area of 1,200 square meters. It will include workshops for sewing, painting, decoration, electrical building, carpentry, classrooms, meeting rooms, computer rooms, and a library. As for the center for vocational training in agricultural logistics in Souk El Arbaa, it is the solidarity result of the will of the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity to ensure that youth, primarily dropouts, receive training in sectors that are adapted to the socio-economic nature of the region and to the needs of businesses. The construction work for the center will take place in a surface area of 5,000 square meters and is scheduled to take 18 months for MAD 12 million. The center will guarantee socio-vocational integration for young people and support the agricultural sector’s development by providing technical, skilled, and competitive labor. The facility will comprise workshops for technical training (agricultural machinery repair, packaging, industrial refrigeration, industrial maintenance), training rooms (office automation, business management), classrooms, computer and language rooms, and a library. The project will benefit 600 trainees per year. The center is the fruit of a partnership between the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity and the Office of Vocational Training and Labor Promotion (OFPPT).

Rabat – Business, the Western Sahara conflict, and Morocco’s accession to Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) all featured in Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Nak-yeon, in Seoul on Monday. El Othmani arrived in South Korea on Monday for an official visit at the invitation of Nak-nyeon. During the meeting, the minister reiterated Morocco’s support for the United Nations to oversee the negotiation process to reach a mutually acceptable solution to the four-decade conflict over Western Sahara. South Korea also recognized Morocco’s efforts to find a solution to end the regional conflict. The Republic of Korea also underscored the importance of Morocco’s return to the African Union and its accession to ECOWAS, said in a statement on El Othmani’s official visit obtained by Morocco World News. The Head of Government led a delegation, which included Mohamed Boussaid, Minister of Economy and Finance; Saïd Amazai, Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research; and Othmane El Ferdaous, Secretary of State to the Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy. This official visit marks the first of its kind for a Moroccan Head of Government in the Republic of Korea. The meeting served as an opportunity for both parties to discuss the bilateral cooperation that has united the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1962. The visit also aimed to discuss new measures for the bilateral cooperation, which was consolidated at the last high-level meeting, held in November 2014, in the presence of former Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, Chung Hong-Won. Morocco and South Korea have expressed their willingness to reinforce the bilateral ties; partnerships, and “regular political consultations,” added the statement.

South Korea and Morocco will pursue enhanced cooperation in the following sectors: economic competitiveness and the digital economy; innovation as a driver of economic and social development;  decentralization and regionalization, and education and academic cooperation.

The festival will present uniquely cultural music while inviting and representing people from all over the world. Although some might believe that recruiting 79 celebrities, setting up nine stages, and hiring security might be costing Morocco a mountain of money, the statistics say otherwise. The sponsors, partners, volunteers, and local vendors all benefit economically from the well-known music festival, which will take place June 22-30.  Abdeslam Ahizoune, President of Mawazine Festival and of Maroc Cultures, stated, “Together we are striving to build a national show and entertainment industry, which would create significant added-value for tourism and strengthen the economic fabric within the region.” So, how exactly does Mawazine have a positive economic impact on Morocco? By collaborating with local suppliers, Mawazine gives a plethora of job opportunities to many Moroccans, while building relationships and negotiating with businesses involved in the entertainment industry.  According to Mawazine’s website, the festival works with over 40 Moroccan companies, negotiating three-year partnerships with key suppliers. The festival employs people from many professions, such as stage directors, light and sound technicians, and communication directors. The festival directly drives up, the demand for these Moroccan enterprises.  But how impactful is Mawazine’s platform on the tourism industry. The Mawazine Festival does not solely focus on the entertainment industry; it is also cognizant of impacting shops, local markets, transportation, restaurants, hotels, and many more.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi has unveiled his ambitious new national education plan to address infrastructure, pedagogy, and violence in schools. The minister presented his plan, which projects through the 2021-2022 school year, to the Committee on Education, Culture, and Communication in the second chamber of Parliament on May 16. The new education plan largely continues and builds upon the former education minister’s program, which targeted the expansion of school facilities and infrastructure and the early integration of an increasingly Francophone pedagogical approach. The new plan details several key markers to increase national education infrastructure, including the construction of 1,984 new classrooms in existing schools and the creation of 87 new schools, 37 of which will be in rural areas.  To improve classroom performance, the plan will target schools with insufficient staff numbers and institute classroom caps. Specifically, it will add 35,000 contracted regional academy teachers to the 20,000 new instructors hired in 2018. Over the next three years, class sizes will gradually be capped at 30 students per class for the first two years of primary school, 34 for the remaining primary levels, and 36 students for secondary and “qualifying secondary” education. In the plan, the minister also promises to lower the minimum age for early education to gradually integrate 4 and 5-year-olds. By the 2021-2022 school year, the program aims to integrate 67 percent of this age group in schools. Furthermore, the program will likely continue the renovation of the 9,511 buildings that qualified under the former minister’s plan, although this proposal has not been confirmed. Many of Amzazi’s key educational reforms are rooted in pedagogical approach, specifically, in early childhood learning and reading in both Arabic and French. The plan implements a model that relates letters to syllable formation and encourages project-based experiential learning. The minister also seeks to expand Francophone education in the first year of primary school and middle school science curricula.  At the baccalaureate and preparatory classes levels, the minister proposes the comprehensive revision curricula and pedagogical guidelines and evaluation models, such as exams. Moreover, the plan will introduce international baccalaureate programs in all high schools by the 2021-2022 school year. These changes build upon the textbook review and rewrites that occurred under the two former education ministers in 2016 and 2017. School dropout levels and education accessibility remain two of the greatest national challenges. To address these obstacles, the minister proposes the creation of 27 second-chance schools—schools that service students who discontinued their formal education at an early age— to reach the target goal 100 supplementary education schools by 2021. The educational programs aim to expand upon the 62,000 youth students who are currently served by informal education programs or vocational training. Ultimately, these programs hope to attract 30,000 additional students per year to eventually enroll 40 percent of those who participate in the programs in informal education or vocational training. Furthermore, the minister plans to launch a large-scale reassessment of student aid programs, specifically the selection process and student funds allotment. As it stands, the program will increase students’ daily allocation for meals from MAD 1.40 to 2 at the primary level, from MAD 7 to 10 at the secondary education level, and from MAD 14 to 20 for student meals at all boarding schools. In light of reports of teacher aggression and violence against students, the latest national education reform program also aims to raise teacher awareness and expand support services for students.  The plan provides for 12 new support services for violence against students at the national level and 82 support outlets at the provincial level. Under this framework, 94 anti-violence coordinators will be trained to fill the positions at the national and provincial levels. The most recent video of a high school teacher violently beating his student during class has raised the issue of classroom violence to the national consciousness and will likely impact the Parliament vote in the second chamber. The final aspect of national education reform addresses education in the private sector. Primary aspects of the new plan include the revision of legal criteria for the establishment of private schools, the institution of a framework to guide teacher salaries, and the strengthening the qualifications for national tax benefits. Although the comprehensive reform spans a wide range of topics, from educational infrastructure to private sector education reform, it fails to address one of the primary problems in Moroccan education: violence against teachers. Teachers remain unprotected in the classroom from violent act perpetrated by students. November 2017 saw three attacks on secondary school teachers by their students. One Casablanca teacher was attacked with a knife after classes, while another male teacher was beaten by a student during class. Though Morocco’s Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training and the national teachers union have condemned the violence, the minister’s proposed reforms fail to raise the critical issue to the national agenda. As the Ministry of Education pours funding into infrastructural improvements and new pedagogical methods, it is worth considering the extent that these developments can be implemented if classroom safety and security cannot be guaranteed for students and teachers alike.

Rabat – In addition to the spiritual aspect of fasting and its health benefits, Ramadan brings an exceptional atmosphere. People engage in multiple special activities during the holy thirty days of fasting. This is the month when mothers indulge their family members with succulent and special dishes.  As the time of breaking the fast approaches, many people, especially men, are drawn into sports and other leisurely activities such as playing cards with friends in the neighborhood.  Breaking the fast at the beach Sitting around a table with friends at the beach while watching the sunset is one of the best ways to break the fast. Additionally, swimming in the warm water will make the person feel alive and refreshed after long hours of fasting. Touring the city with friends, chilling and laughing, is surely another good way to pass time. Family gatherings Ramadan is a special month for family gatherings, which are great opportunities to see all extended family members gathered in one house, talking, laughing and bringing back memories of childhood. Minutes after al adan Activities in Morocco stop for a minutes after al adan (the Islamic call to prayer) announces sunset and the end of fasting, before returning to normal. Once the appetite is appeased, people are out and the streets are full, to the point that it is nearly impossible to find seats in some cafes. Smokers during Ramadan  In contrast with the festive aspects of Ramadan, the holy month also brings out negative behavior in some people. While fasting, some people become easily irritable and prone to engaging in fights, especially smokers. For people who smoke, Ramadan is not an easy activity as they spend the whole day waiting for al Adan at sunset so that they can resume smoking or consume hard drugs. Football tournaments before breaking the fast Football is the most common sport in Morocco, as all Moroccan cities from north to south, east to west, are organizing tournaments in which several local teams or visiting teams will compete. The competitions pass the time and break the routine, filling the air with a spirit of competition and determination to be nominated the “king” of a local tournament. Bodybuilding during Ramadan   Bodybuilding is the second most common sport that Moroccans practice during Ramadan. Many Moroccans are increasingly interested in building a better shape. During Ramadan, some people prefer to work out before breaking the fast while others do so after. So the question is: when is the best time for pumping up the muscles?  Morocco World News will answer the question in an article dedicated specially for bodybuilding in an exclusive series of articles for Ramadan. This feature is part of an exclusive series at Morocco World News for Ramadan. Also in the series is: 10 Places to Have a Delightful F’tour during Ramadan, 15 Types of People During Ramadan and Bodybuilding Best Practices during Ramadan

Rabat – Incarcerated since February 2 in France, Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan is awaiting trial for rape. His daughter Maryam has come to the defense of her father to try to prove his innocence In an interview with Swiss outlet Le Temps, Maryam Ramadan, 31, talked about how difficult it was to deal with the backlash following her father’s incarceration. “Honestly, my family and I have not been prepared to live this. My father has never done anything reprehensible so that we can one day imagine visiting him in a prison,” said the native of Switzerland. To date, five women have accused Ramadan of rape. On January 31, Ramadan was arrested on two counts of rape filed against him in 2017. Ramadan fully denies the accusations and deems them to be part of a “campaign of lies launched by adversaries”—a sentiment shared by his supporters. “I feel a great injustice. He does not benefit from the presumption of innocence: he is in fact presumed guilty, while his accusers benefit from a presumption of sincerity, it is not normal. Besides, he’s sick. We have to stay strong to fight,” Maryam said. Asked about Ramadan’s mental health, Maryam explained that he is strong mentally but not physically as he has multiple migraines a day. She added that he is unfairly treated in the prison. “While he had voluntarily surrendered to the police request [to present himself] of January 31st in Paris, he has the feeling of living a profound injustice. He is placed in complete isolation, which is akin to psychological torture. Every time he takes a shower, no one should be in the corridors, same thing when he is walking.” The Islamic scholar’s daughter is confident of his innocence; she thinks that his incarceration is “completely crazy” as she recalled that he has never been violent to her or to anybody at home. “The charges against him are based on allegations without evidence. If there were, they would have already been produced.” The 55 year-old theologian had banked hopes on an early release ahead of trial due to his health condition. According to a report filed with judges last month, he has suffered from multiple sclerosis since 2006.

Rabat – The ongoing boycott campaign in Morocco may expand its reach to include fish, in response to price hikes. The hashtags  #Letitrot and #Letitswim (in Arabic) were launched today on social networking services to oppose the high prices of fish across the country. After successfully making their voice heard through the ongoing boycott, which is targeting Sidi Ali (mineral water), Afriquia (gasoline) and Centrale Danone (dairy products), boycotters are denouncing the high prices of fish. Those supporting the boycott emphasize that there is no justification for such high prices at the fish market in a country with more than 1,000 miles of coastline. Moroccan television channel 2M shed light on the high prices of fish at fish markets in the coastal city of Agadir. Customers told 2M that fish is available at reasonable prices just a few kilometers outside the city. However, the prices of fish are sometimes doubled in the center of the city, a local fishmonger told 2M. Fish is among the foods widely used during the holy month of  Ramadan. Interviewees told the Moroccan channel that they go outside the city to buy fish at a good price. The fishmonger said that the price of a croaker is between MAD 50 and 60; while in the city fishmongers sell it for MAD 80 or more. According to the fishmonger, sole fish can be bought for the reasonable price of MAD 55 and whiting MAD 35. Fishmongers justify the increase of prices based on the origin of the fish and transportation costs. The price of sardines, one of the cheapest and most widely available products in the country, has increased from MAD 20 to MAD 30 for one kilogram. ?????: ??? ??????? ????? ?????? ?????#????_?????#????_???? — MOSAFIR.MA ?????

Rabat – Moroccan Ambassador to Mauritania Hamid Chabar has presented his credentials to Mauritanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Isselk Ould Ahmed Izdibih. The two officials met Monday and discussed ways to reinforce the centuries-old cooperative relations between the two nations, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Chabar was appointed in June last year by King Mohammed VI appointed Chabar as the new ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. He succeeds Abderrahmane Benomar, who held the position for 15 years until his death in December 2016. Before his appointment, Chabar  was  Morocco’s former Coordinator for United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). The ambassador holds a PhD in political science, international law and international relations from the University of Brussels. Chabar  also holds a postgraduate degree from the Institute for Studies of Developing Countries at the University of Louvain, Belgium. He began his professional career as a teacher at the National School of Administration in Morocco. Yesterday’s credential presentation comes a few months after Mauritanian Ambassador to Morocco Mohamed Lemine Ould Aboye Ould Cheikh El Hadrami gave his credentials to Morocco’s Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mohamed Ali Al-Azraq. Ould Aboye was appointed to Morocco in December 2017. The past few years were marked by on and off tension between Morocco and Mauritania over political issues, including the Western Sahara conflict. Mauritania had not had an ambassador in Rabat since the departure of the previous Mauritanian ambassador in 2012. Since 2012, Morocco and Mauritania expressed readiness to revive diplomatic ties. In a recent interview with Jeune Afrique, Mauritania’s President Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz said that Mauritanian-Moroccan relations “have been somewhat lethargic, there have been ups and downs, but they are improving and our goal is to strengthen them further.” The president told the magazine that the Western Sahara conflict is the “main reason” for the regional tension. “It’s a real headache, we’re going around in circles!” said the president. The president also said that in order for the conflict to be solved, both sides need to sacrifice to achieve that goal. “There should be a lot of sacrifices on both sides and, above all, a political will to solve this problem by going beyond rivalries between states in the name of a global vision of the Maghreb.”

Rabat- A street camera recently recorded a man trying to kidnap a three-year-old girl in front of a grocery shop in “Khabazat” neighborhood, Kenitra. The video segment shows a little girl walking out of a “hanout” (grocery shop) when a male passerby saw her and started to drag her along. Just when he lifted the child in an attempt to run away, he was caught red-handed when her mother emerged from the shop. According to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the suspect was captured by residents of the Khabazat neighborhood at the scene.   It is unclear when the attempt was made, but the DGSN stated on Friday, May 18, that the 31-year-old suspect is undergoing a thorough investigation at the hands of the Kenitra Criminal Investigation Department.

Rabat- After a video circulated on social media on May 19 showing a teacher beating a young girl inside a classroom, Minister of Education, Vocational Training, and Higher Education Said Amzazi has denounced the act of violence. Amzazi said Monday the violence defied the values and principles of education. The incident occured on May 16 in Khouribga, a city 123 kilometers southeast of Casablanca. Amzazi further asserted that the Ministry is taking firm measures to promote mutual respect between students and teachers and to make sure that acts of violence will not happen in the institution again. At Amzazi’s request, a commission lead by Inspector General of Pedagogical Affairs Khalid Faris arrived in Khouribga earlier today to conduct an investigation into the details of the incident. Apparently shot by one of the girl’s classmates, the video shows the teacher repeatedly striking the student in her face and head and cursing at her in front of other classmates. When posted online, it fueled the anger of social media users who questioned the fate of Moroccan education and the role of the Ministry of Education.   Following the video’s posting, security services immediately reacted by notifying the educational institution and handing the teacher to authorities where he is currently undergoing an investigation.

Rabat – Rabat has scrapped plans to establish a twins cities agreement with Guatemala City, following Guatemala’s decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. After the US embassy in Israel relocated on May 14, Guatemala shifted its embassy to Jerusalem on May 16, to great praise from the Israeli community and widespread international condemnation. At the time of the opening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced, “This is a great day for Israel. This is a great day for Guatemala. Guatemala was with us at the beginning and Guatemala is with us today, and we welcome the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem.” Just one week after the Moroccan government planned to vote on the twin cities plan, which intended to promote social, economic, and political ties between the two cities, Rabat announced its decision to cancel the partnership on Saturday, May 19. Deputy Mayor of Rabat Lahcen El Amrani told Reuters: “Following Guatemala’s decision to establish an embassy in Al Quds (Jerusalem), Rabat’s city council unanimously decided to suspend the examination of a twinning project with Guatemala City in solidarity with the Palestinian people.” The decision preceded the Casablanca popular protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people on Sunday, May 20. Over 10,000 protesters marched in condemnation of the US embassy move and the use of excessive force against Palestinians by Israeli soldiers. Israeli Defense Forces killed 60 Palestinians and injured over 2,000 during Gaza protests against the US embassy move on May 14.

Rabat – Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) have carried out important military exercises dubbed “Tafilalet 2018” in the southeastern Moroccan city of Errachidia, in the Draa-Tafilalet region in preparation to deter any further escalation east of Morocco’s defense wall. The most recent edition of the FAR magazine notes that the operations took place between March 22 and April 7. The Moroccan military maneuvers form part of Morocco’s mobilization to respond to a long series of illegal maneuvers by the Algerian-backed Polisario. The magazine wrote that FAR is mobilizing its members in “an environment close to reality” and identical to that in Western Sahara. The magazine described the operations as “the action of a joint force generated around the means of the operational sector Tafilalet, engaged in a defense of territorial integrity, in response to a fictitious aggression.” The tension due to Polisario’s repeated actions east of Morocco’s defense structure persists as the separatist group has conducted yesterday a parade to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle” in Tifarriti, east of Morocco’s berm. Polisario’s action, which constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement, came after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2414. The resolution, adopted April 27, expressed concern about Polisario’s intention to relocate their facilities east of Morocco’s defense and urged the separatist group to withdraw from Guerguerat. Prior to the recent violation, the front had been defying the United Nations and the Security Council since December 2017.  For months, the separatist group has been threatening Morocco and the UN that it would relocate its functions to Bir Lahlou, east of Morocco’s defense wall. Ahead of the adoption of the 2414 resolution, Morocco provided the UN with evidence of the presence of the Polisario Front in the region. The proof included satellite images captured by the Mohammed VI-a high-resolution satellite. In April, United Nations Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric confirmed Polisario’s illegal actions in Tifariti. Dujarric reported that members of the Polisario Front intercepted a patrol unit of the UN mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) on April 16. “MINURSO has informed the UN Security Council that on April 16, in the Tifariti area, MINURSO observers were intercepted by Polisario elements, who then proceeded to fire warning [shots],” the official said at the time.

Rabat – As part of its ‘Layali Ramadan’ cultural program, the French Institute of Marrakech will open its door to cinema lovers and music enthusiasts to attend a Cine-Concert this Tuesday at 10 PM. This Tuesday 22nd, a cine-concert will take place at the French Institute of Marrakech. The beautiful organ music, played by Michel Chanard, and the melodious voice of the lyrical singer Valéria Florencio will accompany the movie in a live performance. Most people recall her name from painful study sessions when there were too many dates to remember and a myriad of war heroes’ names that slipped the mind as soon as the bell rang and the test was placed on the teacher’s desk. Nevertheless, one thing is sure. The name of Joan of Arc doesn’t only belong in history manuals. She inspired books and paintings; poems bore her name; buildings were named in her honor; and in 1928, Carl Theodor Dreyer directed a silent movie to tell her story on the big screen. Today, “The Passion of Joan of Arc” is considered a masterpiece. However, when the movie was first released, not everyone was a fan. Among the latter were government officials, and the Archbishop of Paris, who censored various parts of the movie. Although Dreyer spent months researching for the film and wrote the script based on the original transcripts of Joan of Arc’s trial, the French were not pleased with the choice of Dreyer as director. Even though it was the Société Générale des Films that invited him to make the movie, the French thought he was the wrong pick. Dreyer was Danish and did not belong to the Catholic Church, and that combination, in their opinion, was enough reason to assume that he would not be able to capture either the essence of Joan, or her innocence and bravery.  What truly sets this movie apart from the rest is that Dreyer insisted that none of the actors could wear makeup, and he used lighting that made their faces look deformed and distorted, in order to showcase real and raw emotions. He also used unique camera techniques and movements, which resulted in a breathtaking and thought-provoking narration of the tragic story of Joan of Arc. The captivating images of the movie along with the harmony between Chanard’s organ music and Florencio’s delightful voice, is certainly an experience that should not be missed. The French Institute of Marrakech is the place to be this Tuesday at 10 PM. Admission is free, and an evening filled with art and music awaits those who will attend.

Rabat – While the final few days countdown has begun until FIFA’s assessment of host candidates’ readiness is published, the Trump administration is still silent on concerns over access to powerful firearms, which has exposed America to violent attacks. In 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a report on crime statistics, estimated that the murder rate rose 8.6 percent across the country in 2016. The report shows that murders committed with weapons rose to 73 percent in 2016, compared to 70 percent a year earlier. Easy access to guns is making the US face challenging issues and contributing to mass shootings that claim the lives of many people across the country. According to Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines mass shootings as an incident in which four or more people are shot (regardless of fatality count), 2,030 mass shootings have occurred in the US since 2013, while 89 mass shooting incidents have occurred in the US in 2018 alone. Trump’s gun control policy is sparking controversy across the world; international press are concerned about how a country with low safety host the World Cup. More guns than people in US The Washington Post estimated in 2015  that there would have been 357 million firearms in the US in 2013, “40 million more guns than people.” The news source added that the estimation  does not include “firearms that enter and exit the country illegally” or “guns that break down, or are lost or destroyed.” Most recently, on May 18, a 17-year old student killed ten students inside Santa Fe High School, in southeast Texas. The suspect also injured at least 10 others. On April 22, four young adults were killed at a Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee. Prior to that, on February 15, a shooting in Parkland, Florida, claimed 17 lives and injured many others. The shooting was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. In October 2017, a lone gunman fired at the audience of an open-air country music concert in Las Vegas, killing more than 50 people and injuring more than 400 others. Muslims, second-class citizens in US Trump’s anti-Muslim sentiments could also jeopardize the United 2026 bid. Islamophobic fear has been a part of US President Trump’s stance on immigrants and refugees since the early days of his campaign. The tension against Trump’s policies mounted in January 2017, when the president introduced a travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries. The ban has shifted to cover Iran, Chad, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia, with additional travel restrictions placed on North Korea and Venezuela. In a press conference held in March, US Soccer Federation President Carlos Cordeiro emphasized that FIFA has not expressed concerns over  Trump’s travel ban and public xenophobic sentiments. “This is not geopolitics. We are talking about football,” said the chief of the US federation. Renowned officials, however, do not appear to agree with Cordeiro’s statement. On May 15,  Pascal Boniface, the director of the Institute of International and Strategic Relations (IRIS), heavily criticized President Trump and his country’s immigration laws. “Can we welcome the whole world when we spit in the face of the whole world,” said Boniface in reference to Trump’s ban on immigration from some Muslim-majority countries and his determination to build a wall between Mexico and the US. Morocco World News last month contacted FIFA, asking whether the US would address issues related to  Trump’s travel ban on Muslim countries and changing immigration laws. FIFA, however, chose not to answer, saying that “since the bidding process of the 2026 FIFA World Cup is currently ongoing we cannot comment on specific content matters of the bids.” The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)’s Hate Crime Statistics for 2016. Regarding hate crimes motivated by religion, Muslims and Jews were “the two most common targets… with nearly 54 percent and more than 24 percent respectively, of religiously motivated hate crimes committed against them,” according to Vox.com. The US intelligence services used several ways to monitor Muslims’ practices and activities, including mapping Muslim communities and employing video/image surveillance. Muslims in the US have been surveilled since at least 2002, when New York authorities singled out Muslim mosques, student organizations, and businesses for surveillance that is described as “discriminatory,” by many human rights organizations. FIFA’s task force will publish its assessments on May 29, to announce whether Morocco and the North American bid are eligible to host the 23rd World Cup bid in 2026. The assessments will be published prior to the vote scheduled for June 13, when 211 football federations will vote for their favorite bid.

By Dana Leger Rabat – Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes has inaugurated the Paraguay embassy, relocated to Jerusalem from Herzliya, following suit of the United States and Guatemala, a move condemned by Palestine and many world leaders. The inauguration, held in Malha Technology Park on May 21, was attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Paraguay, before but especially under your leadership, took a very bold stance in international affairs and refused to cooperate with the lies directed against Israel,” Prime Minister Netanyahu told President Cartes. “We always remember that. Thank you Horacio. Thank you, and thank you Paraguay.” The relocation of the three embassies to Jerusalem before a final resolve of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute has caused international anger and protests in the lead up to and after the US opened its embassy on May 14. Protests at the Gaza border resulted in 60 Gazan deaths by Israeli fire, and more than 10,000 people marched in Casablanca in solidarity with Gaza on May 20.  An official of the Palestine Liberation Front, Hanan Ashrawi, released a statement saying, “By adopting such a provocative and irresponsible measure that is in direct contravention of international law and consensus, Paraguay has conspired with Israel, the United States and Guatemala to entrench the military occupation and to seal the fate of occupied Jerusalem.”  East Jerusalem, which is viewed as the capital of a future Palestinian State, has been occupied by Israel since 1967, although all three of the newly inaugurated embassies are located in West Jerusalem. Palestinian leaders have said that by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the US has damaged the chances of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestine. Paraguay’s move has also created controversies within the country as Mario Abdo Benitez will replace Horacio Cartes as president in only two months, and Benitez was not consulted on the decision to move the embassy. A number of other countries have expressed an interest in moving their embassies to Jerusalem in the future as well, including Honduras, the Czech Republic, and Romania.

Washington D.C – A news story about an alleged discussion between President Trump and a Moroccan diplomat regarding Morocco’s World Cup bid and the Western Sahara conflict is going viral. According to the Arabic language weekly Al-Ousboue, quoting  an anonyms diplomatic source, the American President asked the Moroccan government to give up  its 2026 World Cup  bid  paving the way for the joint one from USA, Mexico and Canada to win in exchange of a firm American support to the Kingdom’s positions in the Western Sahara conflict. Since Al-Ousboue used an anonymous source, it will be difficult to prove that the weekly is factually mistaken, but it is clearly willfully misleading. While it is known that President Trump threatened nations who did not support the joint North American World Cup bid with political repercussions, Al-Ousboue story seems to be far-fetched. The fact that the President will meet face to face with a Moroccan diplomat to convey such outlandish demand seems unlikely since given the various and more subtle ways such pressures make their way between capitals. While efforts of the American government to use political muscles to win votes for its bid are real and true, the allegations that the American President explicitly linked the World Cup event and the Western Sahara conflict is a deliberate spread of false news that tend to manipulate people. The original piece was published in a small rubric buried in pages 10-12 of Al-Ousboue’s May 17, 2018 edition, even though it was highlighted in the front page as “the dossier of the week”. It is far from a good piece of journalistic writing in a weekly not known for good sourcing. In fact, the story did not make clear how and when this alleged exchange between President Trump and the Moroccan diplomat took place. Furthermore, such hot topics can be effortlessly distorted and altered affecting the way individuals interpret them. In this case, once translated into English and French, the story took on a life of its own making the rounds of Facebook and Twitter in Morocco and in circles involved in the World Cup and the Western Sahara conflict.  With the fast and vast reach of online journalism and social media, this news moved from an obscure Moroccan weekly to the world stage with a global public engagement. As the bad practice of “copy and paste” journalism continues to flourish in Morocco, the re-production of stories without proper vetting could have serious implications on Morocco’s positions in the Western Sahara conflict and its bid for the World Cup. In the last few years, Journalism in Morocco has been in a state of flux with a fixation on creating “the buzz” to attract web clicks and make money at any cost. The digital platforms have opened the door to new players but also to bad journalistic practices. The Moroccan press has every right to criticize the American government’s clumsy approach to counter Morocco’s World Cup bid, however, linking it to estern Sahara is dangerous. This story is an example to why it is important to keep media’s digital sphere open and fair, while cracking down on those who profit from disinformation.

Rabat – Some Moroccans know exactly how to make a profit out of the boycott campaign. Consumer anger toward Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone and Afriquia has inspired a  humorous mobile phone game called “Madawikh” (fools). The game ironically pays tribute to Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid, who called the boycotters fools. Available for free for a few days on android, the app has been downloaded more than 1,000 times and rated 100 times as a five star game. Users commented on the app positively, saying how clever and encouraging the idea was: “Thank you for this game,” “I am speechless about this very cool idea,” “Good job guys, keep it up.”.  How is it played? App users need to slide or jump to avoid a series of obstacles,representing the three companies targeted by the boycott campaign which was launched on April 20 on social media. Among the obstacles are several Moroccan political figures, including Mohamed Ouzzine, former Minister of Youth and Sports. A total of 10 levels of play are offered to users.  To date, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch, and Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid, have denounced the campaign, with Boussaid calling supporters of the campaign “fools.” However, former ministers Nizar Baraka and Nabil Benabdellah disagree with the  dismissive stances, identifying the boycott as an urgent call for change that requires serious government consideration. Last week, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani finally reacted, apologizing to customers for “verbal expressions and offenses” made against boycotters of three companies for “unjustified” price increases in their products. During a meeting held in the upper house of the Parliament, Othmani addressed an apology to people supporting the boycott.

Rabat – Israeli think tank, the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, has reported that the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) will soon be the best in Africa. Thanks to its efforts in national security, military development, and diversification, Morocco’s military ranks among the top three in Africa, behind Egypt and Algeria, the daily Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, reported over the weekend. According to INSS, the FAR are reversing “the balance of power in North Africa, by their armament and their operational capacity, and propelling themselves to the rank of the first military power in North Africa.”  Morocco established a five-year plan in 2017 to gain “regional supremacy” by modernizing the military equipment of its land, air, and sea departments. So far, Morocco has devoted USD 20 billion to the strategic objective. Morocco’s annual defense budget is USD 3.5 billion currently and will reach USD 4 billion in 2022. Morocco has made significant improvements to its military equipment and skills over the past few years Since 2012, Morocco acquired 450 tanks, 600 armored vehicles, and 130 artillery batteries. It has diversified its arms suppliers by turning to the US, France, Spain, and China, according to a study conducted by the Spanish think tank, the International Security Studies Group (GESI), at the University of Granada. Recently, the military ordered 48 new Abrams tanks that will be delivered in the upcoming months. Morocco’s primary arms suppliers include the US with a 53 percent share, followed by France with 44 percent, and Italy with 1.4 percent. The FAR and US Armed Forces sponsor joint military exercises for allies and partners from 15 countries representing Africa, Europe, and North America. The annual exercises, known as African Lion, are “designed to improve the interoperability and mutual understanding of [each nation’s] tactics, techniques and procedures,” according to the US military. The most recent African Lion took place April 16-27. Morocco’s military strength serves its objectives of eliminating any external attack, protecting territorial sovereignty, and combating regional terrorism.

Rabat – The city of Oujda is hosting some very interesting cultural events during this Ramadan. The people of the eastern city will be busy Sunday, May 27, as the French Institute of Oujda is organizing a concert for Moroccan singer Oum El Ghait at the Mohammed VI Theater, as part of its 2018 “Ramadan Nights.” After opening Casablanca’s 10th  “Heritage Days,” on May 9 with an unforgettable show, the talented Moroccan artist will delight Oujda’s public with a unique concert. The Oujdi public will expect great melodies from the Sahrawi singer who mixes hasanian rhythms and Berber-Andalusian melodies with jazz on his double bass, oud, percussion, and gnawas. Through her charisma, energy and the quality of her stage performance, Oum will be able to transport the Oujdi public under the sun of the Sahara. Organized as part of the Cultural Season of the French Institute of Morocco since 2012, Ramadan Nights accompany the annual month of spirituality that is Ramadan. The program highlights the universal values ??of dialogue, respect, tolerance and sharing. Oum El Ghait, which literally means “mother of relief,” is a common name that Moroccan Sahrawi nomads give to baby girls born on a rainy day, believing that it is the luck of the newborn that brings with it water and relief. The jazz singer has released her last album “Zarabi” (Carpets) in 2015, which achieved great success. The album is a tribute to the colorful carpets of M’hamid El Ghizlane, formerly known as Taragalte, a rural commune in the province of Zagora, in Morocco’s south-east of Morocco. Zarabi features various styles of Moroccan music, including gnawa, jazz and hassanya, which reflect Oum’s creativity and ability to incorporate Moroccan culture into her tracks. It also includes the music of well-known artists, such as the percussionist Mohammed Krija and Yacir Rami.

International press reported that Abbas underwent a minor ear surgery last Tuesday. The president was then hospitalized overnight on Saturday and Sunday, Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. He returned to the hospital again later on Sunday. Saed al-Sharahneh, medical director of the Istishari Hospital in Ramallah, said that the president went for normal medical tests on Sunday and reassured the press of  his medical condition. The president, according to international media, is a heavy smoker and has been suffering health issues, including heart problems. Conflicting reports as Mahmoud Abbas admitted to hospital for a third time in a week https://t.co/ONqRRq6Al0 pic.twitter.com/b13HGz6uxE — The National (@TheNationalUAE) May 21, 2018  Abbas’s hospitalization followed a series of mass protests in Gaza, culminating on the day of the US embassy’s inauguration in Jerusalem May 14, when at least 58 people were killed by Israeli law enforcement. Arab leaders and United Nations representatives condemned Israel’s violence against Palestinians and denounced the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem. Last Monday, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to Abbas, emphasizing his rejection of the US move. In his letter, the King said: “We follow with deep concern the implementation of the US administration’s decision to recognize Al-Quds [Jerusalem] as the capital of Israel and to move its embassy there.”

Rabat – The Moroccan government has signed a tripartite agreement with the United Nations and the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco (CGEM) to support refugees’ economic integration in Morocco. A statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs outlined the agreement, signed May 18, in which CGEM will work with refugees to develop their professional skills and increase employability in the private sector. As the enterprise leaders’ union in Morocco, CGEM is committed to promoting economic autonomy for all vulnerable populations through workshops and skills development. As the CGEM develops refugees’ professional skills, the UNHCR, also known as the UN Refugee Agency, will bolster training and employment to raise awareness and open employment opportunities within Moroccan businesses.  The agreement falls under Morocco’s National Strategy for Migration and Asylum, initiated in 2013, and the broader UN Global Compact for Migration. Morocco’s migrant regularization strategy and socio-economic integration policies constitute key aspects of the national migration strategy. At the international level, the Global Compact aims to foster greater international cooperation and create a multifaceted and coordinated international response response to human migration. The signing of the tripartite agreement was attended by Mr. Ahmed Eskim, Director of Immigration Affairs of the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration Affairs; Mr. Salah Eddine Qademiri, Deputy General of the General Federation of Moroccan Contractors, and Ms. Bettina Gambirt, Deputy Representative of the UNHCR in Morocco. Migrants in Morocco primarily emigrate from 38 countries, including Senegal, Mali, Cameroon, and Nigeria. The press release noted the extensive knowledge and skills of many refugees and positive impact that their skills could create in the Moroccan private sector.

Rabat- Denmark’s anti-immigrant Minister of Immigration, Integration, and Housing Inger Stojberg said Monday that Muslims in Denmark should take leave from work while fasting for Ramadan because it’s dangerous for the rest of Danish people. Speaking to Danish newspaper BT Tabloid, Stojberg called on Muslims to stop working during Ramadan “to avoid negative consequences for the rest of Danish society.” Known for her controversial attitude towards immigration and Islam, Stojberg questioned the compatibility of Ramadan with the modern way of life in Denmark: “I wonder if a religious order commanding observance to a 1,400-year-old pillar of Islam is compatible with the society and labour market that we have in Denmark in 2018,” she said. Stojberg also questioned the safety and productivity of Muslim workers when they fast from dawn to sunset. Stojberg brought up the example of bus drivers who have to abstain from food and drink “for more than 10 hours,” saying “this is dangerous for all of us.” In 2017, Stojberg posted a screenshot of her iPad background on Facebook, showing a satirical drawing of Prophet Muhammed, peace be upon him, with a bomb in his turban. The drawing was similar to the satirical caricatures of Muhammad (PBUH) which were published in Denmark in 2005, triggering outrage among Muslims across the world. The minister’s posted the screenshot in response to the  Skovgaard Museum’s decision not to include the drawing in an exhibition. “Honestly, I think we should be proud of the Muhammad cartoons,” she said. She justified the background on her iPad screen, saying it was to remind her that Denmark’s freedom of speech also includes the freedom to criticize religion. Stojberg is also an advocate for toughening immigration laws. Last year, she sparked more controversy on social media when she posted a photo of herself on Facebook, smiling next to a cake in celebration of Denmark’s 50th law restricting immigration.

Rabat – The Ministry of Employment has refuted claims that Moroccan seasonal agricultural workers working in Spain are being harassed, insulted and raped. The US-based online media company Buzzfeed investigated how women farmers are treated in southern Spain. Journalists from Buzzfeed heard the stories of several women about their alleged sexual harassment. The Ministry of Employment then opened an investigation. In a statement published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the ministry said that a Moroccan-Spanish delegation carried out a visit on May 10-11 in the province of Huelva, Spain to inquire about the conditions of women farmers on Spanish farms. The Moroccan delegation included representatives from the Ministry of Employment, the National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (ANAPEC) and the General Consulate of Morocco in Seville. The delegation also included representatives of the Spanish Ministry of Employment. The delegation visited three strawberry companies and learned that  “no specific case of abuse or violation against Moroccan workers was found.” The statement added that the companies have not received any complaints. Spanish authorities also confirmed that they have not received complaints from any Moroccan seasonal farmers. The Ministry also explained that the working conditions of Moroccan women workers is in conformity to the employment contract concluded between the two parties. The workers received work permits from Spanish authorities to pick strawberries between April and June. The seasonal migrant workers will return to Morocco after the berries are picked. The preselection for the work permits took place from January to February. According to the government, priority was given to seasonal workers who have experience in the field, who are married, and who are committed to returning to Morocco after the season ends. German investigative journalism NGO Correctiv published an investigation on May 2 in collaboration with RT Nachtjournal and Buzzfeed News on Moroccan women farmers in Spain and in Morocco’s Souss Massa region in the south. In the report, women claimed that they were harassed, insulted, and raped in the field.

Rabat – More than 10,000 protesters took to the streets of Casablanca on Sunday in solidarity with the Palestinian people. In the wake of the recent relocation of the American embassy to Jerusalem, the protest demonstrated Moroccans’ solidarity with Palestine. The march also served as a commemoration of the 60 Gazans who were killed during protests throughout the weekend of the move, May 11-14. The march began at began Place Annasr, crossed Paris Boulevard, and continued on to Boulevard Hassan II and Rachidi, with shouts of “We are going to Jerusalem, millions of martyrs.” Protesters demanded the preservation and protection of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and condemned the use of excessive force against unarmed Palestinians. Morocco’s Justice and Spirituality party planned the protest, in partnership with a four-party coalition. On May 14, King Mohammed VI rejected the embassy move in a letter to the president of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, describing US President Trump’s decision to relocate a “unilateral act contrary to the will expressed continuously by the international community, through Security Council resolutions.” As the Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, King Mohammed VI, has emphasized that Morocco will “spare no effort in mobilizing the international community and its forces to triumph over the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state, with Al-Quds as its capital.”

Rabat – After revealing his list of 23 players, Hervé Renard has explained his choices in an interview with Medi 1 TV, expressing once again his joy in leading the Atlas Lions to the 2018 World Cup. Renard is well aware of the high responsibility that he will face in the World Cup. After releasing his picks for the players who will compete this summer, the French coach has explained that he doesn’t always select the best players, but he always serves the interests of the whole group. “We do not always pick the top 23. We select a group of 16 or 17 players and then people who are able to not get bored for a month, a month and a half. That is to say that states of mind are not mandatory and that the collective interest is primary,” he said. The national team coach is responding to criticism that leaving Boufal and Azaro off the list is unfair. For Renard, Morocco’s participation in the long-awaited event is like a dream come true. “I feel like I’m going to live something I’ve been dreaming of since I was a kid. Participating in the World Cup is a pride,” he said, while assuring that he has confidence in his group of players. “Morocco is certainly expecting great things from its national team. I think we are on the right track. This is what makes you want to go to the World Cup not to disappoint people, not to make sad a country like Morocco who expects great things from his national team or at least a very good image. I think we are on the right track.” However, Renard believes that the World Cup is an Africa Cup of Nations multiplied by 10. “Since I participated in 6 African Cups, I have a little experience. Now there are parameters that I will have to master a little more for this World Cup. I’m going to meet people to take advice, to win and to make sure that we improve on some small details that will make the difference,” he concluded. When the tournament begins on June 14, the Atlas Lions will first take on Iran on June 15. The team will face Portugal in their second game on June 20, and the final in the first-round match for Morocco will be against Spain on June 25.

Rabat – Authorities in the Tangier port have caught two truckers with a large quantity of psychotropic tablets. The drivers were attempting to import the drugs to Morocco aboard an international cargo truck. The authorities caught the drug traffickers with intelligence from the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST). In a statement, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that they are investigating if there are additional cargoes of drugs in the truck. The suspects were placed into custody as suspects involved in international drug trafficking. Last month, customs police in the port seized 490 kilograms of hashish (cannabis) resin. Police arrested the driver and placed him in custody. Also in April, police seized 53 kilograms of cannabis in a shipping truck on its way to Spain. The authorities arrested the truck driver after X-rays revealed the drugs concealed behind the vehicle frame and the engine cooling system.

Rabat – “I am not a citizen on the street” said Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim several weeks ago. Now the minister has taken to his Facebook page to explain himself and clarify the situation. Yatim apologized to consumers for his initial response to the boycott against high prices, when he was asked by a journalist about his stance as a Moroccan citizen on the ongoing boycott against high prices. Yatim had replied, “I am a minister and not a citizen. You are asking me [about my stance] as a minister now. If I were a citizen on the street (private citizen) you would not ask me.” The official also said that the boycott “does not concern” him as a member of the government. “Some [people] believe that I am for or against the boycott. I am neither for nor against this issue. I am an official and this concerns citizens,” he added. He started his apologies saying that “he is proud of being a Moroccan.”The PJD minister explained that he made the statement  at the beginning of the campaign. “I express my regret for what has been promoted through the distortion of the content of my statement,” said the politician. “I would like to reiterate what is meant by this statement, which is more than three weeks old. This is to remind the journalist at the time that “he asks me as a minister, and that he would not have asked me if I was a citizen walking in the street,” he added. “I don’t find it offensive to apologize to anyone who considered that I was insulting both members of the party and the general public,” he concluded.  The video of the minister’s “not a citizen” answer has been circulating on social media for the past few days, causing uproar among citizens.  The statement caused an angry backlash on social networks nationwide as online activists launched a hashtag in Arabic script criticizing the minister: #AnaWazeerMashiMouatin (I’m a minister, not a citizen).

By Sarah Goodman When Oussama Skali, the director of the Fez Festival of Culinary Diplomacy, entered the event’s kitchen, he was greeted by Chef Najat Kaanache, arranging and rearranging her kitchen utensils like army battalions on a strategy board.  “I’m going to change your life,” she reported brightly, a twinkle in her eye. “Just kidding.”  Yet, underlying the three-day Festival of Culinary Diplomacy, there was a palpable sense of the transformative power of food. The weekend, April 19-22, created a space where the officials and politicians left the real diplomacy to the kitchen. As politicians gathered in the main dining hall of Fez’s luxury Hotel Les Mérinides, world-renowned chefs – Morocco’s Najat Kaanache, France’s Christian Têtedoie, and Mexico’s Alberto Rebolledo – navigated multiple languages, accommodated vegetarians, and upheld Halal dietary standards to produce world-class cuisine for nearly 300 guests. Each evening saw a new, fresh, six-course menu, fusing Moroccan and foreign flavors. The first night, April 19, offered a dinner of Tunisian and Moroccan-Jewish cuisine; April 20, a pairing of Mexican and Moroccan Arab-Andalusian food; and, finally, on Saturday, April 20, a final mixture of French and Amazigh culinary traditions.  Working elbow to elbow, the chefs sliced, garnished, plated, and encouraged one another and the culinary students from the School of Hospitality and Tourism in Fez. Speaking in a mixture of Arabic, English, French, and Spanish, the chefs, cooks, and service staff collaborated to pull off an ambitious – and delicious – array of dishes.  The word “champion,” a favorite of chef Kaanache’s, became an unofficial rallying cry in the kitchen, and could be heard in different languages, from different voices, behind the scenes during the festival.  “Champions, I know you are tired, but Muhammad Ali was also tired,” cajoled Kaanache to reinvigorate the flagging energy of the assembled kitchen crew for the final dinner. The ultimate test of a man’s conscience may be his willingness to sacrifice something today for future generations whose words of thanks will not be heard. Gaylord Nelson #champion #womenpower #food #lyon #mystorywithmichelin @christian_tetedoie ???the best ??Champion @nur_restaurant we love you ???? @dado_lopez_perez eres el mejor ? A post shared by  Najat kaanache (@najatkaanache) on Apr 23, 2018 at 4:28am PDT 
The French word “chaud” achieved a similar universality, as cooks alerted each other and service staff as they wove and dodged with their steaming plates of food.  Skali was effusive in his excitement for the festival: “We can speak of a ‘politics’ or of a ‘diplomacy of taste’ which gives to each meal, be it simple or sophisticated [and] imbued with this know-how, a capacity to enchant us and to recall our gratitude for nature and life!”  “In a context where the excesses and the nuisances of an industrialized and productivist agriculture are widely established, we take the full measure of the lessons of a gastronomy related to local cultures, including in their traditional and historical aspects.” After the final dinner on April 20, the chefs and cooks entered the dining hall to resounding applause from the guests.  As the guests ate, Kaanache took the microphone and, with an audience both captive and captivated, shared her perspective that Moroccan women were the evening’s unsung heroes.  Standing beside Têtedoie and Rebolledo, she announced, “There’s a chef in every house.” For Kaanache, a celebration of Moroccan cuisine is, necessarily, also a celebration of the nation’s women, both in their contributions to the country’s cuisine and in their ability to bring people together through food. “The future of Morocco is in women’s hands,” Kaanache concluded.  The event concluded peacefully, as guests filed out of the Mérinides dining room and the chefs returned to the kitchen to oversee the cleaning up process. Some of the highest praise for the festival came from Michael Møller, the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva, who welcomed the event in a televised announcement ahead of the festival. “At the United Nations, we work tirelessly to ensure there are more opportunities for people to hear one another,” adding “that which we share around the table is as spiritual as it is culinary, and thereby solidifies the foundations of lasting peace and respect between individuals.”

Rabat – It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently. — Warren Buffett The simmering consumer boycott in Morocco is a blend of old-fashioned consumer fury and internet-fueled bandwagon activism. As a non-Moroccan, I can only pretend to understand the anxiety and frustration of working-class, fixed income and working poor Moroccans. Budgets are stretched. That much is certain. Decades ago, an American economist coined the term “misery index.” It was the sum of a nation’s annual inflation rate and the unemployment rate; it created an easy to understand measure of the economic status (and the mood) of the nation. Today’s inflation is nowhere near the double-digit inflation of the late 1970s. But consumer movements are often a perfect storm of factors and grievances, real and imagined. The dust hasn’t settled yet on the current consumer boycott but experience demonstrates the importance of consumer engagement by companies and tempered expectations by consumers. For consumers everywhere, feeling is knowing. Dairy prices have been quite stable in the past four years in Morocco. Costs of many staple food products have been relatively stable over the past few years. A half litter bottle of water has cost the same since 2013. A fair price? Hard to say. The tap water is cheaper. Political leaders and citizens will have to determine the proper calibration between product cost at retail, long-standing distribution advantages among established producers, and consumer preferences. A macro issue comes into play that is the scourge of consumers everywhere: price inflation mixed with flat wages. A misery index 2.0. Many advanced economies have spent nearly a decade (since interest rates dropped dramatically during the Great Recession and after, 2008-2010) with minimal price inflation. As in the US and many EU nations, Morocco’s inflation rate over the past two years was in the one to 1.7 percent range. Quite low. But flat wages with even minimal inflation can lead to a slow motion but powerful drag on the ability to purchase basic goods. Add increasing costs in one or two important sectors, say, transportation (bus/train tickets, gasoline) and meat, and the abstract fragile family budget becomes the very real frustrated consumer. In the US for most of this decade, despite a growing economy since late 2009, wage growth for most workers has been flat or non-existent. Only over the course of the last three months have wages begun to grow. Finally. The illusion of rising dairy prices, along with the perception of corporate indifference to family finances feeds the reality of consumer frustration. Some of the anger fueling the current boycott is rooted in resentment of institutional privilege. The three primary boycott targets—Afriquia, Centrale Danone, and Sidi Ali-Oulmes—all represent successful establishment enterprises, institutions whose profits are dependent on a broad cross-section of Moroccans—rich and poor, young and old, urban and rural. American investment titan Warren Buffett once said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” The quote is relevant for both struggling consumers and company executives who engage in a transaction that establishes, even minimally, a customer experience. Centrale Danone’s purchasing director apologized weeks ago for earlier suggesting that supporters of the boycott were somehow disloyal to the nation. A regrettable statement reflecting a genuine disconnect between a successful corporation and its consumers. Widespread resentment by consumers over institutional indifference is understandable, particularly when that resentment emanates from millions of low-income Moroccans who, to quote George Bailey in the classic American film, It’s A Wonderful Life, “do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.” The newly announced Ramadan discounts by Centrale Danone represent a first step at stopping the hemorrhaging, so to speak. Next, consumers have to decide if they really want to abandon a given producer in hopes that an alternative is present, and at an affordable price, day after day. Ultimately, consumers may not be happy with technical explanations related to profit margins and fixed costs, but it’s the effort to communicate that resonates with them. The boycott may also represent the tentative beginning of a new paradigm for how retailers, wholesalers and government officials interact with consumers, mirroring perhaps the administrative devolution (advanced regionalization) now underway in the kingdom. Think local, plan local, buy local. Time will tell. Whether the message is sincere consumer frustration (“Say no to high prices”) or over the top anger (“Let it spoil”), the customer suggestion box, just like Morocco’s new 5757 consumer complaint hotline, is an important part of the customer service experience. Sam Walton, founder of the giant global retailer Walmart put it this way: “The two most important words I ever wrote were on that first Wal-Mart sign, ‘Satisfaction Guaranteed.’ “

Rabat – FIFA will grant MAD 6 million to three Moroccan football clubs (MAD 2 million each) after the national team coach, Hervé Renard, selected their players to compete in the 2018 World Cup, reported Al Massae. Three Moroccan players who compete domestically (as opposed to internationally, typically with European clubs) made Renard’s 23-player list revealed on May 17. Badr Banoun (Raja de Casablanca), Ayoub El Kaabi (Berkane Sports Renaissance) and Réda Tagnaouti (Ittihad of Tangier) could all see the field against Iran (June 15), Portugal (June 20), and Spain (June 25). The amount of money aims to reward the Moroccan football clubs’ contribution to the world competition, said FIFA in a statement. As for World Cup preparation, FIFA previously announced that it would give USD 2 million to the Moroccan national team’s preparation. This decision follows negotiations initiated by the CAF President, Ahmad Ahmad, with the FIFA administration, which resulted in the exceptional agreement signed on April 12. It follows a decision by the CAF Emergency Committee, held on December 1, 2017, and approved by the CAF Executive Committee on January 10, 2018, to provide exceptional financial support to the five African representatives for their preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. On Friday, FIFA published a list of the teams that boasted the best records in the qualifying games for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The Atlas Lions made the list of the “defensive heroes hoping for [a] Russian repeat” published by FIFA. FIFA commended the Moroccan team’s spectacular defensive records as one of the key factors to  secure its ticket to the much-awaited World Cup tournament.

New York – It would be an error of the first order to judge the Other, any Other, by standards that are inappropriate and effectively exterior and foreign to it. To understand the Other (like understanding the self) means to sympathize with it, to try to enter its soul and spirit, to identify with its worldview and cosmology. –Wael Hallaq [1] Katherine Ewing’s Stolen Honor discusses a subject which has long and deeply troubled me, that of the stereotyping and stigmatization of certain “categories” of men, especially: Arab men and Latin American men, and more generally, “Muslim” men as well as males from many “minority” or “Other” groups. Having grown up in Mexico, I am repeatedly asked about my father’s “machismo,” and just have it assumed and taken for granted, precisely as professor Ewing writes, by “politically correct” people, that my father must have been a “macho” in the sense and meaning described by her: In the United States, the form of masculinity associated with machismo is highly stigmatized and stereotyped: ‘As defined by U.S. society, the concept of ‘machismo’ has distinct negative overtones. Being macho is often associated with being a wife-beater, a philanderer, a drunk, a ‘bien gallo’ –a fighter, like a rooster.'” (Rodriguez and Gonzalez 1997). What often goes unnoticed by Americans who identify themselves as politically correct is that in the United States this label was applied first to Latin American men and has contributed to their marginalization.[2] As Ewing explains, to many who consider themselves politically correct (and would feel horrified by the suggestion that they are prejudiced), the fact that they are de facto and unconsciously prejudiced against the males of certain cultures which have been consistently portrayed in less than favorable ways in the public discourse and media completely eludes them. The majority of people never consciously think or become aware of this very destructive form of “othering” and stigmatization. Many take it as a given, a fact that “we all know” and therefore don’t even need to discuss or debate, that Mexican men, Arab men, Muslim men, etc. are violent and oppressive towards women and that women must be saved from these types of men. As Gayatri Spivak writes, the view that “white men are saving the brown women from brown men” is prevalent and hardly examined. Only recently, Professor Ewing tells us, have the stereotypes about Hispanic men, for instance, began to be questioned. Bearing striking similarities in the actual stereotype content and stigmatization process directed against Hispanic males, the widely prevalent stigmatization of Muslim males in general and Arab men in particular, is largely ignored. The primary concern and focus of public discourse is on the oppression of women and the violence they endure at the hands of these men. What Professor Ewing writes is unfortunately and deeply true to this day: “The stigmatization of Muslim men in terms of women’s rights is a longstanding element of Western discourse. The Bush administration used the argument for women’s rights as part of the justification of the war in Afghanistan, as in Laura Bush’s radio address to the nation in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: ‘The fight against terrorism is also the fight for the rights and dignity of women.'” Right here, in the United States, an alarmingly large number of women are trafficked, enslaved, abused and sexually assaulted on a regular basis. But if one were to read academic research and media publications alike, one would think we have transcended such things in the United States and because of this, must now solely focus on the pain that women endure in other places. This obsessive focus on the plight of Muslim women reinforces the “truth” of the stereotypes (and thus stigmatization) against Muslim men. Among Muslim men, however, there appear to be categories or levels of discrimination, with Arab men being, in my opinion, the most severely attacked group. Hardly anyone would disagree that Arab men are unceasingly demonized and shown in the worst of lights, reduced to stereotypes, ridiculed, caricatured, and portrayed as dangers that “women must be saved from.” These stereotypes have been assimilated and parroted by other “minority” men who are also stigmatized, but to a lesser extent –let’s say, Iranians who may not want to be associated or confused with other groups of Muslims. This is because the propaganda machinery of the recent times has forcefully attempted to distort the Arab male identity perhaps more than any other, to alienate it from its nature and to prevent others from knowing it at all. Racist philosophies, including this mainstream Western disparagement of Arab men, are deeply painful and harm every human being. The frustration I feel at the constant onslaught I encounter of trite and obtuse stereotypes about “Arabs” in general and Arab men in particular is intolerable. Even in academia, when the substance of the arguments put forward by scholars of Arab origin cannot be discredited, attempts to dismiss or devalue their work through attacks launched at them (in supposedly “academic” journals) for “belong[ing] to the Arabian race”[3] incredibly take place. Clearly this “category” of scholar –and his work, regardless of its incontestable brilliance–is treated quite differently than the category of let’s say white male scholars. To conclude, I found Professor Ewing’s discussion of the mechanism whereby a society imposes, defines, and distorts the masculinity of the “Other” enlightening and upsetting. Without having studied this issue academically, what she wrote deeply resonated with me and clarified ideas I had long intuited about the stigmatization of “minority” males in the modern nation-state and the purposes this serves. Using the example of Turkish men in Germany, Ewing demonstrated how this “stigmatization is naturalized through a hegemonic discourse emotionally structured by social fantasies and how a national and transnational imaginary based on such fantasies is produced through government institutions and public culture.[4]” This is precisely what has happened in mainstream Western culture in relation to, among others, Muslim men and Hispanic men.

Unable to counter Professor Wael Hallaq’s valid and logically irrefutable criticisms of her work, she typically twists his substantive legal critique into a vile ad hominem attack based on the fact that he “belongs to the Arabian race.” Her hollow response to Wael Hallaq’s critique is a desperate attempt to save a hopelessly deficient work called Roman, Provincial and Islamic Law, and is paradigmatic of the way Orientalism has always treated outside critiques, “brushing them aside as being inherently motivated by ideological considerations, as if Crone herself and the other Orientalists are free of complex forms of ideological biases.” See, Hallaq, Wael, “The Quest for Origins or Doctrine,” in Islamic Legal Studies as Colonialist Discourse, 2 UCLA J.

New Delhi – Pune-based Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) will be helping Morocco to set up a Centre for Excellence in Information Technology (CEIT), Indian newspaper, the Indian Express reported. Mobashar Jawed Akbar, Minister of State in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), announced the decision, the source said, adding that as part of the joint venture, the C-DAC will initially provide training to Morocco’s IT experts in India before the services are expanded to a center in Casablanca. Pune is the second largest city in the Indian state of Maharashtra after Mumbai. “The agreement comes as part of the MEA’s collaborations with Morocco. C-DAC will train the IT professionals in India and they, in turn, will extend the training to others at the newly-established CEIT. We will also design IT-based programs and courses for them,” Hemant Darbari, C-DAC Director General  told the Indian Express. For more than six decades, the two countries have been partnering to address various issues. Highlighting the growing importance of IT, Akbar said that governments today need to double its response to people’s needs, particularly the young.  “So, we need to develop technology that can be used to reinvent the government as an efficient platform offering incorruptible services. Along with this, we need to see how an ecosystem can be created to help people and governments engage in this fast-changing environment,” the minister stated.  Earlier, the C-DAC had signed similar IT-based collaboration agreements with Vietnam, Kazakhstan, and Armenia.

New York  – The United Nations paid tribute to Morocco on Saturday for its contribution to peacekeeping efforts, with a special dedication afforded to the Moroccan blue helmets and their families for their services and sacrifices. On the occasion, the UN published a collection of photos and posters thanking Morocco for its service and sacrifice, the UN said in a press release. The tribute to Morocco is part of the UN global communication campaign, “Thank you UN peacekeepers for your service and sacrifice, “to raise awareness of the strategic importance of peacekeeping operations” and to express recognition to participating countries,  peacekeepers, and their families for their sacrifices. As the 14th largest troop contributor to UN Peacekeeping operations, Morocco provides 1,600 military and police officers to UN peacekeeping efforts, according to the UN. Since 1948, more than a million women and men have served as UN peacekeepers. More than 3,500 peacekeeping personnel have lost their lives serving in UN operations, including 43 Moroccans. Every day, UN peacekeepers make a tangible difference in the lives of millions of the world’s most vulnerable people. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres paid special tribute to the Moroccan blue helmets, who provide humanitarian assistance and protect civilians in conflict areas. In particular, Guterres Master Corporal Rachid Abarki, who recently died of natural causes on April 24: “…My sincere condolences for this painful loss and express my gratitude for the contribution of Master Corporal Abarki to our peace action in the Central African Republic,” Guterres wrote, in a letter to Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Omar Hilale Master Corporal Abarki served with the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), which works to protect civilians. During his funeral, the head of the Moroccan division of MINUSCA, called Abarki an “exceptional soldier” and praised the military leader’s integrity and professionalism.”

Rabat – Despite repeated alerts from both the United Nations and Morocco, the Polisario Front organized military parades in Tifariti, east Morocco’s defense wall, to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle.” The leader of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) delivered a speech to praise the separatists’ “achievement” since May 20, 1973. The celebration in Tifariti came only a few weeks after the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 2414 on April 27. In the recent resolution, the Security Council expressed serious concerns over Polisario’s intention to relocate their facilities east Morocco’s defense wall. The resolution also urged the front to withdraw its forces from Guerguerat. The Polisario Front, however, defied the recent resolution and has continued violating the 1991 ceasefire agreement and other previous UN resolutions without consideration for the recent condemnation of both Morocco and the United Nations. On Saturday, Morocco condemned the Polisario Front intention to commemorate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle” in Tifariti and informed the UN and its bodies to take the necessary measures to respond to the front’s actions. In response, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that any action undertaken in the region “may constitute a change to the status quo.” He added that the actions will also hinder the political process to find a consensual and mutually acceptable solution to the four-decades-long conflict. Media affiliated to the separatist group reported that the military parade was marked by the presence of foreign delegations led by “ambassadors of friendly states and brothers.” The sources, however, did not provide any details about the delegations that attended the parade.

Rabat – The Supreme Judicial Council’s spokesperson in Iraq, Abdulsatar Bayrakdar,  has announced that Iraq’s Central Criminal Court confirmed a confession of ISIS recruitment by an internationally wanted Moroccan national. The Moroccan national, who speaks English, French, and Spanish, confessed that he was in charge of communication to recruit foreign ISIS fighters using Skype and previously occupied different important positions as a manager at Idlib and the White Hill Port borders in Syria. He also worked in the Office of Foreign Affairs processing and purchasing weapons from the Free Army for the ISIS organization. The Moroccan national entered Syria illegally through Turkey and was caught by Iraqi security forces in cooperation with the central criminal court when he moved to Iraq. Some ISIS sleeper cells are still operating brazen attacks in Iraq and police forces are undergoing operations to eliminate resistant pockets. On May 2, ISIS militants claimed responsibility for attacking a village near Baghdad and killing 21 people, and additional armed conflicts caused 68 civilian fatalities in April.  Still, the region is noticing substantial stabilization after declaring the defeat of ISIS in December.

By Eddahmani Abdeselam Rabat – A video showing a young girl being beaten in class by her older male teacher shocked the Moroccan public, after it circulated widely on social media on May 19. The judicial police team in the city of Khouribga–a city 123 kilometers southeast of Casablanca—opened a judicial investigation under the supervision of the public prosecutor of the 59-year-old professor who appeared in the video. In the disturbing video, the professor hits the girl several times in the face and head and curses at her during class, in front of all her classmates. The security services quickly responded to the published tape, and the educational institution was notified. The identity of the concerned professor was revealed and he was turned over to authorities, where he has remained in custody as the investigation continues. The incident raises serious questions about Moroccan education, the role of the minister of education, and the moral boundaries of Moroccan society in general. Prior to the publication of the video, the judicial police had not received any other complaints about the incident, which occurred on Wednesday, May 16.

Rabat – The former Moroccan player, Mohammed Jarir, died on Saturday, at 74, in the United States of America. With Jarir’s passing, Morocco lost one of his formative former players, who wore the Moroccan colors with distinction on more than one occasion. Jarir was born in 1944, in Casablanca, and his passion for football began at the age of 8. He started his professional football career in one of Morocco’s strongest clubs, Raja Club Athletic.  Jarir demonstrated  his dedication and love for football with his phenomenal skills and performance, which later led him to become a member of the Moroccan national team for the 1970 Mexican World Cup. During the tournament, Jarir scored a goal against Germany, becoming the first Moroccan to score in the World Cup.

Rabat – It appears that the recent apology from Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani does not reflect the stance of his administration on the ongoing boycott. Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim is at the heart of a new controversy after his recent boycott statement. When asked by a journalist about his stance as a Moroccan citizen on the ongoing boycott against high prices, Yatim replied, “I am a minister and not a citizen. You are asking me [about my stance] as a minister now. If I were a citizen on the street (private citizen) you would not ask me.” The official said that the boycott “does not concern” him as a member of the government. “Some [people] believe that I am for or against the boycott. I am not for nor against this issue. I am an official and this concerns citizens,” he added. The statement angered backlash on social networks nationwide as internet users launched another hashtag criticizing the minister: #I_not_minister_not_a_citizen. ?????? ????: ??? ???? ????? ??? ???? ????? ?????? ?????????

Rabat – In response to Polisario’s repeated violations east Morocco’s defense structure, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that any action undertaken in the region “may constitute a change to the status quo.” On Saturday, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had informed the relevant UN bodies of the “illegal” actions of Polisario east of the defense wall, which constitute a violation of the 1991 ceasefire agreement and the UN Security Council resolution 2414. The Moroccan condemnation has not gone unnoticed. UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric announced that the UN chief “is closely following the developments in Western Sahara.” In response to Polisario’s continuous illegal maneuvers, the UN official’s statement added that Guterres is calling for “maximum restraint” in order to “maintain an environment conducive to the resumption of dialogue under the auspices of his Personal Envoy Horst Kohler.” The statement reiterated that no action “should be taken, which may constitute a change to the status quo.” The UN Security Council adopted resolution 2414 on April 27. In paragraph eight of the resolution, the Security Council expressed its serious concerns regarding Polisario’s intention to “relocate its administrative functions” east Morocco’s defense wall. These Polisario actions, according to the Security Council, hinder the stability and legal status of the region. The resolution also urged the separatist group to withdraw from Guerguerate.  Morocco expressed strong condemnation of the Polisario Front and its backer Algeria on Saturday evening. In the statement, Morocco said the recent public “revelation of Polisario-Hezbollah collusion embarrassed the separatist group and its supporter, Algeria, and caused them to multiply their illegal actions in the region.” On May 1, Morocco cut ties with Iran and accused Hezbollah for supporting the Polisario by delivering military equipment and training its members in the Tindouf camps in Algeria.  Morocco also accused its eastern neighbor for being directly involved in the Polisario-Hezbollah collusion. “Visibly embarrassed by the confirmation of links with the terrorist group Hezbollah, Algeria and the ‘Polisario’ have decided to multiply their irresponsible actions,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.  The ministry warned that Polisario’s actions will hinder the UN-led political process and will seriously undermine the UN effort to bring about a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.

Rabat – Morocco has again expressed its forceful condemnation of the recent destabilizing maneuvers carried out by the Polisario Front in Tifariti, east of Morocco’s defense wall. Polisario’s actions east of Morocco’s berm constitute yet another flagrant violation of the United Nations ceasefire agreement and Security Council resolutions, including the most recent resolution, 2414 adopted last April. Resolution 2414 puts heavy pressure on the Algerian-backed separatist group and urges their withdrawal from the region. On Saturday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the “flagrant” challenge to the authority of the UN Security Council.  The Moroccan ministry linked Polisario’s “provocative” actions with the recent “embarrassment” that the separatist group and its primary backer, Algeria, faced due to their proven connection with Iranian ally Hezbollah. “Visibly embarrassed by the confirmation of links with the terrorist group of Hezbollah, Algeria and the ‘Polisario’ have decided to multiply irresponsible actions,” the ministry said.  The source added that “it is in this context that the Kingdom of Morocco strongly condemns the recent provocative actions” of the separatist group in Tifariti, east of Morocco’s defense wall. The ministry said that it had informed the Security Council and the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) of the recent provocative maneuvers, urging the UN to take the necessary measures to denounce the Polisario’s “unacceptable actions” in the region. The ministry warned that such actions will hinder the UN-led political process and will seriously undermine the efforts of the UN. The statement heavily criticized Algeria, emphasizing that the escalation “takes place with the blessing and complicity of a [Morocco’s] neighboring country,” which encourages the Polisario Front in their destabilizing regional actions. The ministry accused Algeria of threatening the stability of the region “by closing the borders and sheltering on its soil an armed movement that threatens the territorial integrity of another [Arab Maghreb Union] member.” Morocco urged the UN bodies to open an investigation to study the situation in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps in Algeria, where Moroccan nationals are “held against their will” in an unbearable and “inhumane conditions.” The statement also urges the UN to investigate Polisario’s embezzlement of humanitarian aid destined to the Saharawis in the Tindouf camps. Earlier this week, media affiliated to the separatist group reported that Polisario was planning to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle” by staging parades in the region of Tifariti on Sunday.

Rabat – The curtain fell last Sunday on the 14th annual International Festival of Amazigh Culture in Fez.  Organized under the High Patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI by the Association Fes Saiss and the Center South North organization in partnership with the region of Fes-Meknes, this festival was marked by its vibrant homage to the great writer Tahar Ben Jelloun and several tributes to prominent Amazigh musical figures. A dozen concerts at the historical site of Bab Makina set the tone for a colorful event, as varied programming attracted lovers of Amazigh and “popular” music. The great artist Aicha Maya and the sublime Faisal orchestra performed beautifully on the prestigious opening stage of the festival. The second evening featured the artists Fatima Tachtoukt, Sami Ray, and the group Ahidous d’Oulmès. For the Sunday closing, the Catalan band Marea Flamenca, Houssa 46, and the star of the Moroccan song, Dounia Batma, revealed their unique musical talents. The other major event of the festival, the International Forum, served as a platform to discuss the Amazigh culture and the future of democracy in North Africa. The discussions focused on the importance of democratic culture and intercultural dialogue for human development, peace, and social cohesion. In parallel, theater, writing, and painting workshops, as well as poetry readings, art and book exhibitions, and an Amazigh carpet fair were on the program. Many big-name writers, poets, and journalists participated in the festival: Driss Mdaghri Alaoui (Morocco), Nouzha Skalli, Hassan Aourid (Morocco), Jean-Marie Simon (France), Noha Bakr (Egypt), Johan Goud ( Holland), Tarik Mira (Algeria), Juliane Tauchnitz (Germany), Mino Vianello (Italy), and Youssouf Amine Elalamy (Morocco). The 14th annual International Festival of Amazigh Culture at Fez released the following recommendations: 1) Emphasize the central role of the Amazigh language and culture as vectors of universal values of democratic culture and living together. 2) Strengthen respect for gender equality and the preservation of social integration. 3) Through education, sensitize individuals, especially young people, to the values of democracy, modernity, and peace. 4) Encourage democratic culture in the family, school, community, and cities, at local and national levels. 5) Encourage self-criticism and critical thinking, and work on developing open mentalities as a means of conflict prevention. 6) Separate religion from politics and consolidate the separation of powers. 7) Strengthen the values of social justice and freedom, and strengthen cooperation among North African countries to achieve democracy and sustainable development.

Rabat – The online boycott has called into question the amount of profits and the quality of the products provided by the three “monopolizing” companies in the Moroccan market: Sidi Ali-Oulmes, Centrale Danone and Afriquia gasoline. The bottled water sector has significantly evolved in recent years. Experts explained the growth by the emergence of new services, such as hotels, restaurants, and cafes that have grown popular among Moroccans. Differences in the taste and mineral content between bottled water and public tap water is also a factor that has contributed to increased consumption of mineral water, because many Moroccans believe that it can be used to get rid of kidney stones. But doctors recommend using a  filter with tap water rather than buying bottled mineral water. So, the question is: is there a real difference between bottled water and public tap water? One of the fundamental differences, theoretically, is the rate of nitrate allowed per liter of water. Fifteen milligrams of nitrate is the maximum in bottled water, while tap water can contain up to 50 milligrams per liter. Pediatricians, meanwhile, are increasingly advising parents to avoid giving babies public water for fear of poisoning, leading to further demand for bottled water. According to Alyaoum24, one billion liters of bottled water is consumed per year. That yields 28 liters per person, up from an average under 10 liters a decade ago. Increased demand has incentivized companies to compete for market shares. The main actors in the mineral water sector are Oulmes Mineral Water and Sotherma, which is known for its subsidiaries Ain Saiss and Sidi Hrazem. Other companies include Coca-Cola, Cobomi, and AlKarama. All reports and studies point to the monopolization of the sector. Given Morocco’s shockingly high tariffs of 25 percent on imported water, the established companies are deprived of any kind of outside competition. In addition, foreign companies would struggle to access the Moroccan market and establish an effective distribution network. Oulmes is the major shareholder of the market, dominating 72 percent of the market. Oulmes’ profits have reached MAD 1.5 billion, in comparison to less than MAD 300 million for its closest competitor, Sotherma, which holds 17 percent of the market share. Three weeks after the boycotts began April 20, Sidi Ali-Oulmes released a detailed statement, ending their silence by focusing on the taxes and fees included in the cost of their products. Oulmes said that in 2017 it paid a total of MAD 657,072,912 in taxes, which includes VAT, the water resource utilization fee, a local domestic consumption tax, the environmental tax and tax mark fees. The 2017 tax burden represented an increase of 9.8 percent in comparison to 2016. The tax paid to the Oulmes locality increased to MAD 99,056,958, while the water abstraction fee amounted to a total of MAD 48,288,916. Sidi Ali-Oulmes pointed out that Sidi Ali’s profit margin, after deducting all expenses, is 7 percent, or MAD 0.4 per liter. According to the company’s data, released in fiscal year 2017, its profits exceeded 195 million, a growth of 16 percent compared to 2016, which generated an MAD 165 million profit, which is explained by its good business performance.

Rabat – Coach of Real Madrid Zinedine Zidane has shut down rumors that Moroccan footballer Achraf Hakimi will leave the Spanish team. Moroccan and international media reported last month that the Moroccan player could not convince Zidane to keep him among the list of players to stay with Real Madrid for another season. Mundo Deportivo wrote in April that Hakimi “did not feel comfortable in his position on the side and showed some inaccuracies, especially in defense.” In response, Zinedine Zidane said in a press conference on Saturday that Hakimi will play next year in 20 to 25 games. “Achraf Hakimi, Borja Mayoral and Marcos Llorente have to play ’20 or 25 games’ next year to continue their development,” said the Frenchman. He added that “one year here, playing less and training with those who do play, isn’t a lost year. They have improved a lot, they have had minutes, and each player expects to play more,” he added. Zidane typically gives Hakimi minutes as a  substitute with Real Madrid. The 19-year old player is one of Morocco’s most important players and has managed to make the list of Moroccan players who will play in Russia in June for the 2018 World Cup. Hakimi and his Atlas Lions fellows will play their first game against Iran on June 15, and the second game will be against Portugal on 20. Morocco will play the last game in the first round of the World Cup against Spain on June 25. CIES Football Observatory ranked the international footballer among Europe’s “50 most promising under-20 footballers,” in February. The footballer made his official debut at the Santiago Bernabeu on October 1, when Real Madrid’s key defender Dani Carvajal couldn’t play due to injury. Hakimi scored his first goal for his Spanish team on December 10 against Sevilla, becoming the first Moroccan ever to score for Real Madrid.

Rabat – It is official. Morocco will finally unveil the much-awaited kits of the Moroccan national football team for the 2018 World Cup in Russia next Thursday. Moroccan TV channel Arryadia wrote on its Twitter that Morocco will present the Atlas Lions’ kits on Thursday, May 24. On April 27, the German-based multinational company Adidas unveiled a set of jerseys for the Moroccan team, but the design angered Moroccan football fans. The jerseys were simple: mostly white with red and green accents, representing the Moroccan flag. But fans were not having it, and Adidas’s design received a backlash on networking services. Coupe du monde 2018. C’est officiel la présentation du nouveau maillot de l’équipe nationale ?? jeudi 24 mai à Rabat@FRMFOFFICIEL pic.twitter.com/YURKtJMl72 — Arryadia TV officiel (@arryadiatv) May 19, 2018  Former Moroccan footballer Abdeslam Ouaddou also voiced his concern over the kits, asserting that they required further development. Slamming Adidas, Ouaddou said that the company should have devoted more time and energy to an appropriate design suitable to the Moroccan public. To calm the storm, the Royal Football Federation (FRMF) spokesman told a Moroccan television channel earlier this month that a new design is being prepared and will be officially released between May 22-24. The official kits are expected to be featured during a press conference held in Rabat in the presence of media and a group of Moroccan footballers.

 Rabat  – King Mohammed VI has presided over the first religious lecture of the holy month of Ramadan at the Royal Palace of Rabat. The lecture was given by Endowments and Islamic Affairs Minister Ahmed Toufiq on the theme “The Rights of the Spirit and its Economic Dimensions.” The lecture drew on Surah 91 (The Sun) verses 7-10 “And the soul and He who proportioned it, and inspired it its wickedness and its righteousness, he has succeeded who purifies it, and he has failed who instills it.” Toufiq recalled at the beginning of his speech that noteworthy scholars of the Islamic Ummah (Community) have studied all that is related to the rights of the soul in the Holy Qur’an and the Sunnah (the way) and distinguished between the absolute rights and the collective rights, noting that the latter are also the rights of Allah, His Prophet, the individual and the community. The individual has first rights to himself, then come the collective rights that naturally impact the community and especially its economic aspects, he said. Toufiq then made it clear that the theme of his talk would be based on four pieces of evidence and one conviction. As for the pieces of evidence, the speaker first cited the causal relationship between human behavior and economic choices. Second, he noted that human behavior manifests itself through politics, which is basically the management of human weakness. The third piece of evidence, he went on to say, is to consent that human behavior depends on the desires of the soul of the individual which push him to consume. The fourth is that the market is a meeting point between the economy, politics, and the soul. He noted, as it is stated in the Qur’an, that the conviction is the fact of shaping the soul so that it can guide the behavior of men to ultimately build a lifestyle in which the economy is just one dimension among others. In this respect, the soul is defined as an acting force from which stems a certain behavior, said Toufiq. He added that Allah has sworn to shape the soul and make it pure and loving by nature. The purification of the soul is the right of the soul from which several other rights derive and is therefore the foundation for building a healthy personality in terms of religion, he said. Toufiq noted in this sense that the Holy Qur’an has warned against parsimony because it constitutes an injustice towards the soul and an attack on one of its fundamental rights, noting that piety, which involves the purification of the soul, is both the origin and the result of an economic choice imbued with the virtues of altruism and generosity. At the end of the lecture, the King was greeted by Special Envoy of Nigeria Ahmed Aboubakar Rifai, President of the Forum for Peace Promotion in Muslim Societies Sheikh Abdallah Ben Biyah, and Director of the World’s Centre for Renewal and Orientation in London Shaikhouna Ben Abdellah Ben Beyah. Afterwards, Toufiq handed the King a copy of a calligraphy manuscript in the Moroccan style, which dates from the 19th century. The original version of the manuscript is kept in the library of the Ben Youssef Mosque in Marrakech.

Rabat – Asmaa Ghlalou, a member of the exploratory committee on fuel prices, called the declarations of the committee’s chairman, Abdellah Bouanou, “false” and his figures “nonexistent.”  Ghlalou, a member of the National Rally of Independents party (RNI), was surprised by  Bouanou’s statements and accused him of sharing figures with the public that she said were “nonexistent” in the exploratory committee’s report. She said the committee had “agreed to produce a nonpartisan report.” In the parliamentary discussion Tuesday, Bouanou, a member of the Justice and Development party (PJD), noted that the difference between the government’s set prices (before deregulation) and today’s prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. He added, “The Moroccan market annually consumes some 6.5 million tons [of fuel]. So, we easily reach MAD 7 billion in one year of additional profit.” Bouanou also stated that some companies have tripled their profits since the market was deregulated. Between 2015 and 2016, their profits increased from MAD 300 million to MAD 900 million. In a Wednesday press conference, Ghlalou disparaged Bouanou’s statements as “political cowardliness,” incredibly claiming that his acts reflect schizophrenic symptoms. Ghlalou claims that Bouanou never brought the “falsified” numbers to the committee during the 60 days of the exploratory work, while he fed false information to the press in order to create controversy and speculation. Ghlalou challenged Bouanou to unveil the real numbers in the report, saying “if he has a little bit of morality, he would have come out to clarify the figures.” While Ghlalou lashed out at Bouanou, her statement overlooks the many media reports that disclosed that the final report presented to the parliament contained incriminating evidence against the fuel companies that was later expurgated.  According to Moroccan news outlets Le Desk and Lakome, there is a big difference between the preliminary version of the report and the final report submitted to the parliament. Le Desk described the editing of the final report and the elimination of all evidence incriminating fuel companies as a “scandal.”  The report investigated fuel prices to determine whether fuel distributors have taken advantage of deregulation to boost their profits, in response to the concerns of Moroccans who are boycotting Afriquia Gas and other large companies. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced that he has been updated on the issues surrounding fuel distribution since deregulation, but that he awaits the exploratory committee’s final report. Many top officials and Moroccan celebrities have expressed their support for the boycott; some have even addressed a message to El Othmani. Famous singer Latifa Raâfat dismissed El Othmani’s clumsy apology and urged him to find solutions. Raâfat wrote: “My respect to you, Mr. El Othmani, a few days ago you described and called us all kinds of insulting things.” She said the head of government “called us inconsequential. How can you apologize and call on inconsequential people to turn the page. Are you talking to ghosts?” Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, who owns Afriquia, has not spoken on behalf of his company, but he has publicly announced his disregard for the online campaign in protest of the rise in commodity prices.

Rabat – After receiving a standing ovation for her movie “Sofia,” Moroccan filmmaker Meryem Benm’Barek  won the award of “Best Screenplay” Friday night. The day before winners will be announced for the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the jury of the Un Certain Regard, chaired by actor Benicio del Toro, has delivered its verdict. If Ali Abbasi’s “Border” won the grand prize, French-Moroccan filmmaker Meryem Benm’Barek’s “Sofia” was not left out as it came first in the “Best Screenplay” category. Meanwhile, Belgian Victor Polster, acting in “Girl,”  won an award for his interpretation of a teenager who wants to become a woman; Sergei Loznitsa won “Best Director” for his powerful “Donbass,” and the Brazilian film “Les Morts et les autres” by João Salaviza and Renée Nader Messora was awarded the special jury prize. “Sofia” is Meryem Benm’Barek’s first feature film. Her short film “Jennah” (her thesis project at INSAS in Brussels) won the 2014 Grand Prize at the Rhode Island International Film Festival. The cast includes Sara Elmhamdi Elalaoui (“Much Loved”), Sarah Perles (“Burnout” by Nour-Eddine Lakmari), Hamza Khafif, the Belgian Lubna Azabal (“Exiles” and “Paradise Now”), Faouzi Bensaidi (“The Blissful”), Nadia Niazi, and Saïd Bey. Benm’Barek’s script tells the story of a single mother desperately searching for the father of her unborn child to avoid being reported to the authorities by the hospital. However, the objective of the film is not to discover the identity of the father but to show “the pressure imposed by a society that cannot comprehend a birth without a husband”, as Benm’barek explained in a statement.

Rabat- Thla Ouhaddou, the woman whose voice echoed across the country last week when she spoke to Alyaoum 24 about the boycotted mineral water company Sidi Ali’s monopolization near Oulmes, has appeared in a new video denying her original story. A week ago, Ouhaddou, who lives in the rural Middle Atlas village of Tarmilat near Oulmes, fervently told Moroccan newspaper Alyaoum 24 of the suffering that she and her people endured at the hands of Sidi Ali, which she said was monopolizing the mineral waters of Oulmes for its “Oulmes” bottled soda water. During her interview last week, Thla Ouhaddou complained of the harsh living circumstances that her family and neighbors have experienced for decades. Thirst and unemployment have plagued the region’s residents. On the verge of tears, Ouhaddou said, “We suffer from water shortage while 150 [Sidi Ali] tank trucks carry water everyday.” Ouhaddou, who sells bread to Sidi Ali employees, showed the news agency her home, a single room she shares with her husband and four children in the heart of the region’s shantytown. “There is not enough [water] for drinking, not enough for doing laundry, yet we pay for it monthly,” Ouhaddou said. She recounted the daily ordeals of the Oulmes population, which exceeds 9,460 people based on 2004 statistics. Contradicting her first statements, Ouhaddou appeared in a new video posted on Friday, accusing the newspaper of taking advantage of her diabetes to pressure her into venting at Sidi Ali. With a blank face she said, “I was troubled and pained since I suffer from diabetes, when these people [Alyaoum 24] came and told me just hold the microphone, and we will tell you what to say.” In the first video, Ouhaddou said that authorities cut off water to the region, and Sidi Ali took over the natural mineral water of Oulmes. She told a different story on Friday, “They told me to say that water was cut off on us, when it’s currently running day and night.” She added, “I beg the authorities to pardon me because I was pushed to say what I said.” Now that her story has changed, Moroccan social media users have concluded her sudden change of heart stemmed from pressure and blackmail by concerned entities.

Rabat – Although he did not make Coach Hervé Renard’s list of 23 players for the national team in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Youssef El-Arabi can be proud of himself, as he was awarded the trophy of the best scorer in the Qatar Stars League for the 2017/2018 season. The Moroccan international player received the distinction Thursday night in Doha.   With a total of 26 goals, the international footballer led his Qatari team Al-Duhail to win the Qatar championship.  The club has won for the second time in a row and for the sixth time in its history. El-Arabi’s performance allowed him to beat Tunisian Youssef Msakni, who scored 25 goals during the season. The Moroccan Abderazzak Hamed Allah, who plays in the Al Rayyan club, came in third place with 18 goals scored during the championship. As for El-Arabi’s national career, the 31-year-old sensation previously expressed his wish to be chosen to play with the Atlas Lions for the World Cup. “Any footballer dreams of defending the colors of his country at the World Cup,” he said in an interview with the German Press Agency (DPA).

The footballer also played for Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal club and for La Liga Club Granada in 2012.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Culture and Communication has rejected the latest report from Reporters Without Borders (RSF) on press freedom in Morocco, claiming it is “biased” and “inaccurate.” The 2018 Annual Freedom of the Press report published in April ranks Morocco 135th in the world for press freedom, citing alleged “strong judicial pressure on journalists.” Contesting RSF’s report, the ministry wrote, in a statement quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), that the document is “biased, inaccurate and does not take account, in an objective and impartial way of the many positive indicators of the climate of openness and freedom” in Morocco. The report claims that Moroccan authorities deterred the work of domestic and foreign journalists who were attempting to cover Hirak Rif, a protest movement that erupted in the Al Hoceima Province in 2016 and 2017 after the death of a local fishmonger, Mohcine Fikri. Condemning the accusations as false and baseless, the ministry said the Moroccan press carries out its work in “an atmosphere of freedom and independence, without any direct or indirect censorship.” The ministry further said that authorities have never influenced or prohibited any news source from practicing journalism and that no TV channel or radio station was banned from covering the events in the Al Hoceima region. In response to the RSF’s claims that authorities hindered the work of foreign reporters, the ministry said that several special envoys carried out hundreds of media missions,“ freely and independently, in all Moroccan regions including in the Rif.” The ministry said that it has also provided 951 authorizations to international reporters to cover the events in 2017, adding that it has granted accreditation cards to 97 correspondents from 21 countries working in Morocco for foreign media outlets. Last year, the ministry also condemned RSF’s report. In 2017, Morocco was ranked 133rd due to authorities’ use of political and economic pressure to deter local independent media from covering sensitive issues. The ministry called RSF’s reasoning behind its ranking “baseless and lacking credibility.” The ministry also recalled licenses it provided for foreign press correspondents in Morocco to carry out their work without restrictions.

Rabat – France, the first European country to back Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, is determined to rally support for the North African bid and promote it in the European sporting sphere. On May 15, the Moroccan bid committee gave a presentation at a special event held in the French National Assembly. The France-Morocco Friendship Group, chaired by member of La République En Marche! Mustapha Laabid, organized the symposium. The event was attended by high-level officials from the European Union and Morocco, including President of the National Foundation of Museums Mehdi Qotbi and Moroccan Ambassador Chakib Benmoussa, according to French news outlet Le Monde. The Moroccan bid is fiercely fighting to win the hosting rights, despite the pressure and criticism in the international press, who tout the lack of infrastructure in Morocco and the readiness of the joint North American bid (US, Canada and Mexico). World Cup in Morocco, beneficial for the world “Morocco’s bid will be beneficial for all,”  said Chairman of the Moroccan bid committee and Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy. In Morocco, the distance between stadiums is far less than in North America, a major argument in Morocco’s favor that FIFA must take into account. Players can move between stadiums in just a few hours, unlike the “United 2026” bid. Delivering his presentation in the France National Assembly, Elalamy said that fans will not face visa problems to attend the 2026 World Cup games and that FIFA will make “significant”  business profits. He added that the World Cup will also benefit Morocco and Africa through accelerating development of the continent. For Morocco’s bid committee, the World Cup in Morocco is the best choice for the world as the country holds the values of “peacemaking” and tolerance.” Elalamy stated the World Cup in Morocco would cost USD 15.8 billion. If Morocco Wins, Europe Wins In April, France became the first European country to support the Moroccan bid. Officials who attended the event also promoted the Moroccan bid. On March 15,  Pascal Boniface, the director of the Institute of International and Strategic Relations (IRIS), has heavily criticized US President Donald Trump and his country’s immigration laws. “Can we welcome the whole world when we spit in the ace of the whole world,” said Boniface in reference to Trump’s ban on immigration from some Muslim-majority countries and his determination to build a wall between Mexico and the US. Mustapha Laabid mentioned that Africa has only hosted the tournament once, in 2010 in South Africa, and emphasized that it is time for Africa to host the sporting event again. “If Morocco wins, it is Europe that wins,” concluded the chairman of the France-Morocco Friendship Group. In less than 13 days, the FIFA task force will announce its assessment of whether the two bids have met the requirements to host the 23rd World Cup in 2026. Achieving eligibility will take the bidders to the final stage: the vote scheduled for June 13 in Moscow.

The suspect also injured 10 others. Time reported that the suspect opened fire in an art class, according to several students. A police officer was among people who were critically wounded due to the shooting, Ed Gonzalez, the sheriff of neighboring Harris County, said. The 17-year-old suspect was placed into custody. “There have been explosive devices found in the high school and surrounding areas adjacent to the high school. Because of the threat of explosive items, community members should be on the look-out for suspicious packages and anything that looks out of place.” The shooting is the latest in a string of high school shootings over the past year, and follows President Donald Trump’s controversial statement regarding easy access to guns in US. #UPDATE There have been explosive devices found in the high school and surrounding areas adjacent to the high school. Because of the threat of explosive items, community members should be on the look-out for suspicious packages and anything that looks out of place. — Santa Fe ISD (@SantaFeISD) May 18, 2018  On May 4, Trump gave a gun law speech to the National Rifle Association (NRA), during which he criticized strict access to guns in France and the UK. During his speech, Trump mimicked the 2015 Paris deadly attack and said if people were carrying guns “it would have been a whole different story.” “They took their time and gunned them down one by one… Boom! Come over here… Boom! Come over here … Boom!” said the president. Since the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, massive rallies have brought protesters to the streets and government offices in US states to condemn the the high death toll due to gun violence and protest against the availability of military-grade weapons and bump stocks, in addition to the absence of a universal background check requirement in the majority of states. In March, hundreds of thousands took the capital by storm for the “March for Our Lives” protest, calling for stricter gun control in the country. The march came on the heels one of the deadliest attacks in the US, which took place in Florida at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, claiming 17 students. Most recently on April 22, four young adults were killed at a shooting in a Nashville, Tennessee Waffle House. Prior to that, a lone gunman open fired on the audience of an open-air country music concert in Las Vegas, killing more than 50 people and injuring more than 400 others. Police bomb squads have been also looking to dispose explosive devices planted in the high school, wrote the high school in its Twitter.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Education, Vocational training, and Scientific Research has announced the final results of the Arabic language teaching test for teachers who will instruct Moroccans residing in Europe (MRE) in the Arabic language and Moroccan culture. The regional academies of education and training and the regional directorate declared that 188 teaching candidates have been hired. The department announced on its website that the teachers will be sent to three countries. France will receive 146 teachers, Spain 26, and Belgium 16. The purpose of the program is to strengthen the Moroccan community abroad and foster its identity with Morocco’s deep-rooted civilization. All Moroccan children residing in Europe are eligible to learn from the teachers in the program. The Foundation Hassan II of Moroccans Residing in Europe has some parameters for the teaching candidates.The candidates should not exceed four years of teaching Arabic abroad, and they keep their current salary in Morocco as well as receiving monthly compensation, depending on the administrational situation in the host country. The candidates must continue teaching in Morocco until they are sent to Europe. Europe has long been a destination for Moroccan migration; the largest concentration of Moroccans outside Morocco is in France, which has reportedly over 1.9 million Moroccans. In Belgium, Moroccans now form the largest group of non-Western immigrants, at 700,000. At 4% of Belgium’s population, Moroccans are better represented in the country by percentage than anywhere in Europe. Moroccans have historically immigrated to Spain for economic reasons, primarily looking for jobs in the agricultural and construction centers. Moroccans represent the second largest foreign nationality in Spain, with 750,883 people.

Rabat – Tilila Rabat will brighten Rabatis’ Friday nights this Ramadan by screening four Moroccan Movies. “The Governor General of Chakerbakerben Island” will be projected today at 9:30 PM at L’Kwan.  The number of movie theaters is decreasing year after year. However, even those who are lucky enough to be living in a city where there is an operational multiplex or cinema have very limited movie options.Yet no one can deny the fact that during the last 5 years, Moroccans have shown a rising interest in cinema. Many events are organized in Rabat annually, such as Nordic Film Week and German Film Week hosted by Renaissance Cinema, Portuguese and Japanese movie showings at l’ISMAC (High institute of Audiovisual Works and Cinema), Human Rights Thursdays organized by l’ARMCDH (The Association of Mediterranean Meetings of Cinema and Human Rights). In addition, they are usually either free of charge or have affordable prices. At most of the events, people struggle to find an empty seat since they are full a good ten minutes before the movie starts. The interest does not only concern foreign movies, because when Burnout by Nourredine Lakhmari was projected during the last International Festival of Author Cinema, hundreds of people lined up in the street in front of Renaissance Cinema to watch it. When the big screen lit up with the movie title and the doors leading to the packed room were shut, dozens of people were left outside. For the first 10 minutes of the movie screening, everyone inside could hear the audience demanding a second showing. It is only once the organizers yielded to their demands, and an impromptu second screening of Burnout was scheduled that the clamor of the crowd stopped. Nonetheless, most tickets that multiplexes and movie theaters manage to sell are ordinarily those of American blockbusters and thrillers, as can be seen in the CCM yearly reports. To try to change that, as well as get people to enjoy Moroccan cinema, Tilila Rabat will screen four Moroccan motion pictures this Ramadan. The first one will be projected this Friday, at L’Kwan in Rabat, at 9:30 PM. Le Gouverneur Général de Chakerbakerben (1980) “The Governor General of Chakerbakerben Island” is a film directed by Nabyl Lahlou in 1980. Born in 1945 in Fez, Lahlou studied drama at the Charles Dullin School and the Théâtre des Nations University, in France. His films include The Dead (1975), Al Kanfoudi (1978), and Brahim Yash (1981). He also writes and produces plays in French and Arabic, such as “Ophelia is not dead” and “The Fall.” The Governor General of Chakerbakerben Island tells the story of a Mr. Al Gharbi who works in the telex booth of a newspaper and is in charge of classifying dispatches. One day while reading a dispatch about an island bearing the name of Chakerbakerben whose governor has disappeared, Mr. Al Gharbi’s life takes an unexpected turn. Set in the 1980s, the film is a mix of retro chic decor, quirky characters, and funny dialogue. A new and different side of Morocco can be perceived through its scenes set in Rabat. Complete with hippie hairstyles, an outdated wardrobe, and a panoply of old fashioned sunglasses that the protagonist switches on and off, the movie is a rare treat. After the movie, the audience will discuss the movie, and debate the topic of “Moroccan Cinéma” by giving their opinions and sharing their ideas.

Rabat – Polisario’s destabilizing activities in the region continue as it is planning to celebrate the “45th anniversary of its armed struggle” on Sunday in Tifariti, east of Morocco’s defense wall. The move comes in defiance of the recently adopted Resolution 2414 of the United Nations Security Council. The event planned by the Polisario Front was reported by Algerian news agency Algeria Press Service (APS) on Friday. Algerian press is no longer hesitating to show their support for the separatist group. APS wrote that the Algerian-backed separatist group will celebrate, “in the Sahrawi liberated territories the 45th anniversary of the outbreak of the Sahrawi armed struggle against the Moroccan occupation forces.” The separatist group claims the entire territory east of Morocco’s berm, which also includes Bir Lahlou, as a “liberated zone.” For decades, the front has been announcing its plans to relocate some of its facilities to the zones of Tifariti and Bir Lahlou. However, the United Nations has made its stance against Polisario’s illegal actions clear in its Resolution 2414, adopted on April 28.  In Paragraph 8 of the resolution, the Security Council expressed its serious concerns regarding Polisario’s intention to “relocate its administrative functions to Bir Lahlou.” Subsequently, it called on the Polisario to “refrain from any such destabilizing actions.” The Security Council also called on the front to withdraw immediately from the Guerguerat region. The Polisario, however, is planning to defy the Security Council, with the risk of further escalating tension in the region. It is not the first time the separatist group has violated the 1991 ceasefire agreement. The Polisario Front has repeatedly violated the ceasefire agreement. On April 20 the United Nations spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, publicly announced that the Polisario intercepted members of MIUNRSO in the region. He said that the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has “informed the UN Security Council on April 16, in the Tifariti Area, MINURSO observers were intercepted by Polisario elements, who then proceeded to fire warning [shots].” He added that the UN observers were deterred from doing their job by the members of the front. Since December, the Polisario Front has been staging illegal maneuvers east of Morocco’s defense wall. Since then, Morocco has been urging the United Nations to strongly intervene to end Polisario’s illegal operations. Morocco has always stressed Algeria’ central role in the Western Sahara dispute, and urged the United Nations to put pressure on its eastern neighbor to contribute to the UN-led political process to end the 40-decade-long conflict over the region. The latest Moroccan attempt to push for Algerian involvement in the conflict came in a letter that King Mohammed VI addressed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on  April 4. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said the King in his letter that Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita passed along to Guterres during their meeting at the UN headquarters in New York. The King added that “Algeria bears a full” responsibility in the conflict.

Rabat – Mounir Mahjoubi has had something to say about his sexual orientation. The French-Moroccan Secretary of State in charge of Digital Affairs in France has shared a powerful message about homosexuality on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia. “Homophobia is an evil that corrodes society, invades high schools and colleges, and contaminates families and lost friends. Worse, it haunts the minds of homosexuals, and sometimes forces us, often, to adapt and lie to avoid hatred, to live,” he wrote on Twitter yesterday.    Mahjoubi, who led French President-Elect Emmanuel Macron’s digital campaign, was contacted by French outlet Franceinfo after his tweet, and he opened up with them about his homosexuality. “What was important was to talk about the subject: yesterday was the anti-homophobia day. It was necessary to recall the consequences of homophobia in everyday life, especially among the youngest. And it also had consequences for me,” he replied to the journalist who asked about his coming out. Published on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia, the 22nd annual report of the French association SOS Homophobie highlighted an increase in reported LGBT-phobic acts, up 4.8 percent since 2016. “We are in 2018; I live my life publicly and quietly. On that day if can send the message by reinforcing it by my personal experience, I think I will do it,” Mahjoubi said, adding that it is “important to offer visibility to homosexuals.” The 34-year-old had already shared his homosexuality in 2015 by posting a photo on Instagram with his same-sex companion. In Morocco, Article 489 of the Moroccan Criminal Code still criminalizes “unnatural acts with individuals of the same sex.” Homosexuals face six months to three years imprisonment and a fine of MAD 120-1,200. The punishments are regularly applied by the courts. Born in 1984 to a Moroccan working class family, Mounir Mahjoubi grew interested both in computers and politics. Mahjoubi joined Macron’s En Marche! campaign in January 2017, following stints running digital communications for Socialist Party candidate Ségolène Royale in 2007 and François Hollande in 2012. In March 2017, he was named the Secretary of State in charge of Digital Affairs. The appointment was announced when Prime Minister Edouard Philippe revealed the full list of government titles.

Rabat – It’s time to kick sexism out of advertising, and Mio’s strong commercial campaign is doing just that. For Ramadan, the Moroccan detergent brand has released a television ad with a powerful message about gender equality. Through the ad, produced by the agency Rapp, Mio illustrates how domestic tasks can be shared by men and woman, showing men doing the dishes, cleaning the house, and carrying groceries. The message, disruptive in Morocco’s conservative society, subtly blends gender equality with the culture of respect that a man owes to his mother, wife, daughter, and women in general.  On social media, people were thrilled, commenting positively about the ad. “Thank you Mio, you have sent a great message,” “I can’t believe it’s real,” “This is the first time that I like an advertisement,” “This should serve as an example for the other brands,” are just a few among hundreds of positive comments. Mio has set an example for other Moroccan brands, which usually portrays a sexist image of the feminine gender, such as Nestlé, which recently sparked controversy on social media for its #BghitNtezewaj (I want to get married) ad. The ad showed a mother looking for a wife for her son. To find the best match, the mother tests a group of girls in cooking and house management skills. There is nothing particularly new about advertising that plays on gender stereotypes. Many ads have a sexist and offensive tone that are hidden by a semblance of subtlety. Last year, Moroccan soap brand El Kef went completely wrong with an ad showing  women dressed up as they did laundry and wiped floors, while dancing, smiling, and singing lines like “That’s what you learned when you were little,” and “Your husband says my wife rocks at home.” Moreover, the company posted the video with the statement: “No one likes to do the housework, but El Kef will make it more effective. Women use their voices to denounce the misconceived ideas about house work in our society.”

Rabat – Morocco has been awarded “Best Dressed Embassy” at the 10th DC Embassy Chef Challenge, which features top chefs from diplomatic representations in Washington, D.C. At the competition Thursday, Morocco was represented by Chef Faiçal Zahraoui, from the Embassy of Morocco in Washington, which received the “Best Dressed Embassy” Trophy. The prize rewards the costume, presentation and decoration of the gastronomic work. Last year’s winner of the jury prize, Chef Mouha Fedal of Morocco, was also present as a member of the jury. In a statement to the MAP, Chef Faiçal said that he was “proud and relieved” to have provided “a good performance.” Chef Faiçal sought to promote both Morocco’s candidacy for the 2026 World Cup and Moroccan cuisine, as an art and a culture with ancestral roots. The Jury Award and Public Award were both won by the Philippines. The competition, which boasted the participation of 28 countries and 1,500-2,000 people this year, is an experience of tasting the culinary works of foreign chefs representing various cultures of the world. Organized at the Ronald Reagan Building by “DC Events,” an organization that promotes events in the US federal capital, the culinary contest serves as a platform for international chefs to promote the gastronomy of their respective countries. Morocco won the jury and public prizes at the first Embassy Chef Challenge in 2009. Last year, Chef Mouha Fedal won the Jury Prize for a Tangia-Marrakchia dish.

Rabat – Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has ordered authorities to open the border with Gaza at Rafah throughout the holy month of Ramadan. El Sisi wrote on his Twitter on Thursday: “I issued instructions to the concerned bodies to take the necessary measures to continue the opening of the Rafah border during the holy month of Ramadan, in order to alleviate the suffering of brothers in the Gaza Strip.” The decision came after Palestinian mass protests Monday, in which at least 59 Palestinians were killed by Israeli law enforcement after the inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem. The Gaza Strip, where 2 million  Palestinians live, has been subjected to a severe Israeli blockade for more than 10 years. Egypt’s Rafah border terminal, Gaza’s only non-Israeli-controlled border, has been closed since 2013, with Cairo citing threats to the country’s security. Members of the United Nations Human Rights Council strongly condemned Israel’s attacks against Palestinian protesters on Friday. Chairman of council Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said “Nobody has been made safer by the horrific events of the past week.” Denouncing Israel’s violence, al-Hussein added that since March 30, Israeli law enforcement have killed 106 Palestinians, including 15 children, while several hundreds were injured. In 2017, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Israel to end the blockade of Gaza while visiting the area. Guterres said he was “deeply moved” to see the suffering of the inhabitants of the region. “[It is unfortunate] to witness one of the most dramatic humanitarian crises that I’ve seen in many years working as a humanitarian in the United Nations,” he said. Several Arab leaders, including King Mohammed VI, condemned Israel’s violence against Palestinians. King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday to express deep concerns over the US embassy’s move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The King, who is also the chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, said that he has reiterated to US President Donald Trump and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres the “extreme importance of the city of Al-Quds,” not only for the parties to the conflict, but for all three Abrahamic religions.

Rabat- It appears that many more artists will receive special letters from King Mohammed VI, who recently honored Moroccan singer Dounia Batma, Emirati singer Ahlam, and MBC journalist Mustapha Al Agha with handwritten letters, thanking them for their concern for his recovery. After King Mohammed VI underwent a successful heart surgery in February in Paris due to a heart rate disorder, many artists expressed concern for the sovereign’s health and conveyed sentiments of joy upon his safe return to the kingdom in April.

By Nada Afa Rabat – Hoba Hoba Spirit will lighten the mood this weekend with their rock vibes. Hosted by l’Institut Français of Casablanca, the band will hold concerts Friday and Saturday, performing songs from their last album “Kamayanbaghi”. Evenings in Ramadan tend to run a little later than usual and are generally quite dull. Even though people promise themselves that they will go to bed early in order to wake up on time and head to either their job, school, or university, they unfortunately never do. They lie half asleep in front of the television, too lazy to get up and head to bed, and loathing every minute spent watching some lame late-night program. At 2 AM, they realize that they stayed up too late and spent a dreary evening.  Those living in Casablanca are in luck today, because Hoba Hoba Spirit’s concert is the place to be this weekend. Nothing is better than some music jams to help digestion after some very tasty “harira sessions,” as Hoba Hoba Spirit called them on social media. The band hasalways been a staple in Moroccan rock and funk music, not only nationally, but on an international level as well. Twenty years ago, they made their debut and quickly became a notable group in the Hayha/Nayda music movement. Known for their fun rhythms, fast tempo, and rock beats, twenty years later their fan base is still growing. Their eighth and latest album, “Kamayanbaghi,” was released in January. Its 13 tracks quickly found a home in their fans’ playlists, along with other popular songs by the band such as “Fhmator” or “Black Mossiba.”  Stages in New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Brussels, Paris, Ségou, Carthage, and in other cities across the globe, have all welcomed Hoba Hoba Spirit and their energetic rock tunes. This weekend Casablanca can enjoy them, too, at l’Institut Français, at 10:30 PM May 18 and 19. Acclaimed by Paste Magazine as “what The Clash might have sounded like if they had grown up in Morocco listening to Gnawa tribal music instead of growing up in London listening to reggae,” Hoba Hoba Spirit never ceases to amaze with each new song.  At Hoba Hoba Spirit concerts, people are always guaranteed a great time, and their music is able to put anyone and everyone in a good mood.

Rabat – The Hezbollah-Polisario collusion is still making international headlines following Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran. An op-ed in the Washington-based political newspaper, The Hill, wrote that the collaboration between Polisario and Hezbollah unveils Iranian toxic” strategy. The analysis, written by Ahmed Charai, a board member of the Atlantic Council and an international counselor at the Washington-based Center for the National Interest think tank,  recalls Trump’s decision to abandon Iran’s Nuclear deal on May 8. The decision received backlash from several European countries, including France, Germany and UK. According to Charai, Iran is the “home to the only constitution in the world with expansionism as a founding tenet,” and“maintains vassal states or proxy militias in four Arab countries and Gaza; terror cells in the Gulf and reservoirs of recruitment in central Asia.” Charai added that Iran also maintains a “web of lethal alliances across the African continent.” Being a vassal state can imply receiving both the protection of a stronger state and military assistance, and that is what Morocco has accused Hezbollah of receiving from Iran. Morocco decided to cut ties with Iran on May 1 as its ally Hezbollah had provided military support for the separatist group Polisario. Morocco also accused Algeria of its direct involvement in supporting the collusion. “To Moroccans, Iran is a faraway place. But for the mullahs of Tehran, Morocco is also part of the ‘Iranian periphery,’” Charai wrote. The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that it backed its decision with a complete file and data demonstrating the collusion. Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita said in several interviews this month that Morocco sent Tehran a carefully prepared file. The file includes details and “proven and precise facts: dates of visits by senior officers of Hezbollah in Algeria, dates and venues of meetings with Polisario officials and a list of names of agents involved in these contacts,” Bourita said. To date, Iran and Algeria are still in denial. Earlier this week, Spokesman of Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bahram Ghasemi denied that Morocco provided any “conclusive evidence to prove their claims.”  He also questioned if Morocco’s stance was made “under pressure” from certain governments, referring to Saudi Arabia. Algeria also denied its involvement, with its Spokesperson for the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abdelaziz Benali Cherif underplaying his country’s role in the ongoing tension. “Instead of producing the ‘irrefutable’ proof that he claims to hold, the Moroccan minister has chosen the track of mystification and fabrication,” said the Algerian official.

Rabat – Juventus of Turin will have its first academy in Morocco. The Italian club is set to open its own training club in July in Casablanca. The Italian club also plans to open additional clubs in El Jadida and Rabat in the future. Juventus Academy will give players aged 4 to 15 the opportunity to learn the technical and tactical aspects of football with the methodology that Juventus has been developing for years.  “After having multiplied the experiences of football schools with British and Spanish schools such as Arsenal and FC Barcelona, I thought it was time to give Moroccans the chance to train and benefit from the know-how of Juventus,” said Gabriel Hicham Guedira, general director of the Juventus Academy in Morocco. “We are very happy because Morocco has many fans of Juventus and the club is even more followed since the arrival of Mehdi Benatia at the club,” he added. The summer courses and annual program will be hosted at the Paradise Club in Ain Diab. The enclosure, with 10 football fields, will be the headquarters of the  new academy, conveniently located in Morocco’s economic capital.

Rabat – Confederation of African Football (CAF) President Ahmad Ahmad has pledged to use his influence to convince South Africa to vote for Morocco 2026, after the country announced it could not in a cynical about-face. After promising on April 16 to support Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup, South Africa announced it would not support Morocco earlier this month, shortly after US President Donald Trump threatened countries to support the North American bid, United 2026. The CAF president planned to express his anger against South Africa for denying Morocco its support. According to Reuters, CAF officials want to persuade South Africa, the first and only African country to host a World Cup, to back the Moroccan bid. CAF’s meeting with South Africa’s Football Association (SAFA) officials was to take place on Wednesday in Johannesburg, but no updates about the meeting have been published so far. The CAF president has shown unwavering support for the Moroccan bid since its official announcement to compete to host the World Cup back in August 2017. CAF’s first vice president, Kwesi Nyantakyi, echoed his colleague’s statement,  emphasizing that Morocco has honored Africa throughout the month-long African Nations Championship (CHAN), which Morocco hosted earlier this year. CAF’s mission to convince South Africa to back the Moroccan bid will not be as easy as people may believe. South Africa is taking a strong stance against the Moroccan bid, as seen in South Africa’s Minister of Sports Tokozile Xasa’s statements. “We are very clear that we cannot support Morocco,” she said. The country’s parliament “was very straightforward in this regard, it is the mandate of the country, and it is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is.” In response, CEO of the Moroccan bid Hicham El Amrani told the BBC last week that no one is “forced” to back the Moroccan bid “if he believes that it doesn’t serve the country or the country’s football interest.” “Even if Africa has always acted in unity, unity does not mean 100% of all the member associations, this is part of the democratic process,” he added. Meanwhile, the countdown for FIFA’s task force’s outcomes, which will decide whether Morocco’s bid meets the criteria to host the World Cup, begins. FIFA’s inspection committee, which visited Morocco in April, are expected to announce the results on May 29. The assessment will decide whether Morocco’s bid will continue its race until the big day, when 211 football federations will cast their vote for their favorite bid on June 13, in Moscow.

Rabat- In the weekly Cabinet meeting on Thursday, the first day of Ramadan, El Othmani addressed the rise in fuel prices and pledged to combat any attempt at monopolization or price manipulation of consumer products during the holy month.  El Othmani articulated concerns over market monopolization during Ramadan and affirmed the government’s efforts to meet citizens’ needs during the holy month, especially since three major companies in the kingdom—Sidi Ali (mineral water), Centrale Danone (dairy products), and Afriquia (gasoline)— are being boycotted.  El Othmani insisted that the government is invested in providing food products with guaranteed quality, at credible prices, and in sufficient quantity. El Othmani reminded his audience of the government’s latest initiative, consumer complaint hotline (57 57), dedicated to countering market monopolization and corrupt business: “[The hotline] grants the right to any citizen to report about offenses like fraud, monopoly, exorbitant prices or others,” he stated. “Local authorities will be able to investigate the violations immediately after.” El Othmani announced that he has been updated on the issues surrounding fuel distribution since deregulation, noting that he awaits the exploratory committee charged to bring a final report on fuel deregulation and the profits of companies operating in the oil industry. After the final report is presented, the government will take the necessary procedures depending on the results, El Othmani explained. However, two versions of the parliament’s report have already been leaked to the public, revealing contradictory content in the two versions since specific data related to profits of companies in the sector was removed, indicating that the original report was modified. El Othmani did not make specific comments on the report, which was discussed in Parliament’s Finance Committee Tuesday, other than to say the government would closely review it. With the ongoing boycott campaign, consumers are angered at the rise in fuel prices, especially those of Afriquia, which owns more gas stations in the country than any other oil company.

Rabat- After quitting “The Voice” France singing competition in February following online controversy, Mennel Ibtissem has released her first music video “Je Pars Mais je t’aime” (I’m leaving, but I love you). The 22-year-old French singer’s track references her sudden departure from the singing competition after she received fierce online criticism for some of her social media posts dating back to 2016 when she was perceived as blaming France for terrorist attacks in Nice and Paris. “The government is the real terrorist,” she wrote then. After Mennel left the competition, she posted an apology on Facebook in which she defended herself, saying that her posts were “taken out of context.” On her first appearance during the blind audition of The Voice France on February 4, Mennel captivated the judges and the audience with her serene rendition of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah. The artist, the daughter of a Syrian-Turkish father and a Moroccan-Algerian mother, began the song in English before transitioning into Arabic, with the Hallelujah refrain replaced with “Ya Ilahi” (My God). Ever since, Mennel has won thousands of followers on social media.

Upon arriving in Rabat on Wednesday, Dastis was received by his counterpart, Bourita, who engaged him in discussions ranging from trade, immigration, and tourism, to terrorism, the Sahara issue, and Monday’s massacre in Gaza. In the meeting, Dastis sought Morocco’s opinion on the situation in Gaza. Bourita answered that the kingdom strongly condemned the violence of Israeli forces that cost the lives of over 50 Palestinians and wounded thousands. On the Western Sahara issue, Bourita hailed Spain’s “constructive role” and efforts dedicated to finding solutions for the decades-long conflict, in a press conference following the meeting, reported state-owned press Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Spain defended the UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2414 in Morocco’s favor. Bourita said Morocco’s autonomy plan has not yet been fruitful because the  interested parties were not the “real” ones engaged in the matter. The plan was proposed by the kingdom to reach a solution in the Western Sahara conflict and deemed “serious and credible” by the UNSC. Bourita added that Morocco is a fundamental partner for the EU, saying that the kingdom trusts that it can rely on Spain’s support to “help establish a privileged framework with the EU.” During his meeting with Dastis, El Othmani acclaimed the strategic ties between Morocco and Spain, emphasizing that Spain is Morocco’s main trading partner and hailing the country for its continued support for Morocco on different levels. El Othmani further noted that the relationship between Morocco and Spain is built on mutual respect, which has made Morocco a prominent economic partner for Spain. Dastis praised the historical, political, economic and cultural links between the two countries. Spain is one of Morocco’s main customers; total exports between the countries increased by 11.2 percent over the previous year alone. With regards to countering terrorism, the two countries share a strong sense of cooperation, as they continue to work together to detect ISIS members in Morocco and Spain. Recently, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), in collaboration with Spanish authorities, dismantled five active members of a terrorist ring allegedly connected to ISIS in a northern Moroccan city, Fnideq, and in Bilbao, Spain.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI launched, Thursday in Sale, the nationwide foodstuffs distribution operation “Ramadan 1439,” initiated by Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity on the holy month of Ramadan. This act of generosity mirrors the royal solicitude for the poor and promotes the values of humanity, solidarity, and sharing which characterize the Moroccan society, MAP agency said. Organized with the help of the interior ministry and the ministry of endowment and Islamic affairs, this national operation has become a yearly appointment meant to assist underprivileged social segments, mainly widows, the elderly and the disabled. It is in line with the humanitarian programs led by the Foundation, the Ramadan 1439 operation is worth MAD 80 million versus MAD 55 million that was allocated last year. This rise is due to the increase of the number of beneficiaries which reached this year 2.5 million people in 500,000 households, including 429,100 in the rural area, as well as the addition of new foodstuffs. Thousands of people as social workers and volunteers were mobilized to conduct this operation. Two committees, one local and another provincial, supervise the supply of distribution centers, the identification of beneficiaries and the handing of foodstuffs. The Ramadan 1439 operation is part of the different humanitarian actions and initiatives undertaken by King Mohammed VI to promote the culture of solidarity and ensure sustainable human development pursuant to the values and principles of Islam.

Rabat – Centrale Danone has responded to the boycott of its dairy products for the third time, calling all Moroccans to turn the page and to reconcile with the company during the holy month of Ramadan. In a communiqué on the eve of Ramadan, the spokesperson of Centrale Danone, Abdeljalil El Kaimi, seized the opportunity to invite boycotters to consider the company’s two special offers during Ramadan to support Moroccan families.
 ‘’The message of Moroccans has been received, so today, we bring you special offers to show support for families,” he said. El Kaimi explained that Centrale Danone maintains a 70-year-old relationship with Moroccans, and expressed fears that the current tension could end the company’s long-standing service to customers. The dairy company is offering a 20-percent discount on its yogurt throughout the holy month of Ramadan, in addition to offering customers a cup while purchasing four yogurts. Another offer provides customers with a 14.28-percent discount when they purchase two half-liter boxes of fresh pasteurized milk. Boycotters did not respond positively to the conciliatory offer, arguing that one liter of milk should be sold at MAD 5. Furthermore, they asserted that the milk price will return to its previous price at the conclusion of Ramadan. Danone’s statement coincides with a recent apology message from the Moroccan Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani.  In his message, El Othmani emphasizes the government concern and solidarity with its people. It also urged boycotters to end the campaign. However, many boycotters doubt the sincerity of the head of government’s request. The timing of his statement conveniently coincides with the Ramadan, which also represents the company’s highest period for production and sales. 
 With Centrale Danone products lining grocery shelves, untouched, across the country, many see the discount marketing strategy as a means of minimizing company losses that have accumulated since the launch of the boycott. Centrale Danone has claimed that the company has not increased prices since 2013.  Regardless, Danone’s products remain above the purchasing power of the majority of Moroccans, who have recently witnessed notable increases in all commodity products, such as oil, sugar, tea, and flour. The boycott, which has caused great concerns for Centrale Danone, also targets Sidi Ali mineral water company and Afriquia gasoline. Boycotters have accused all three companies of monopolizing the market and raising prices. 
 The Competition Council, founded in 2008 to regulate market prices, has remained inactive for three years as it waits for its members to be appointed.

Rabat – Saad Abid continues his journey supporting the 2026 Morocco World Cup bid. After travelling to numerous cities to meet superstars like Eto’o, Iniesta, Messi, Gad Elmaleh, and RedOne, the online personality and his deflated balloon landed in Los Angeles, to meet Swedish football legend Zlatan Ibrahimovic. “I’m really happy to have met the legendary Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It was truly an unforgettable moment when the “Lion” surrendered and supported the challenge #MAYMKENCH2026. He is a person with a big heart and I thank him for his time,” wrote Abid on his Facebook page. For his challenge of “meeting 26 celebrities in 26 days in 26 countries,” Abid is traveling with a half-deflated balloon–representing “Moroccans’ state of mind”–and wants to inflate Moroccans’ hopes and the balloon with the breath of the personalities he will meet to promote Morocco’s 2026 World Cup. Ibrahimovic, who called Abid’s project “fantastic,” accepted the challenge to give his breath in symbolic support for Morocco and its 2026 World Cup bid. “You’re not strong enough to handle a Lion’s breath,” joked Zlatan, as he told Abid that he believed in him and in his challenge. The football icon recalled his time in Morocco, where he trained with his former team PSG (Paris Saint-Germain). He also signed the (not so) deflated balloon. “I love Morocco, I wish you all the best, all the success in the future and I hope that you will get the World Cup,” concluded Zlatan. Through his promotional campaign, Abid hopes to rally “symbolic but not official” international support for Morocco in order to give more weight to its candidacy.

Rabat – Two versions of a confidential parliamentary report, commissioned to investigate the distribution of fuels in Morocco, have been leaked to the public. The report was debated Tuesday in the House of Representatives’ Finance Committee. One version appears to be about 25 percent shorter than the other, suggesting the original may have been edited. According to Arabic-language news outlet Lacome-2, “A lot of important data has been removed from the final version, especially related to the profits of companies operating in the sector.” What has changed since price liberalization? After Morocco liberalized fuel pricing on December 1, 2015, the government saved MAD 35 billion each year that were previously spent subsidizing fuel, and redirected the savings to social sectors and disadvantaged people, according to the report. In the parliamentary discussion Tuesday, the chairman of the committee, Abdellah Bouanou, noted that the difference between the government’s set prices and today’s prices is nearly MAD 1 per liter. He added, “The Moroccan market annually consumes some 6.5 million tons [of fuel]. So, we easily reach 7 billion dirhams in one year of additional profit.” While the price of crude oil fluctuates widely, consumers are angered by increases in price. Bouanou also claimed that some companies tripled their profits since liberalization. “Their profits went from 300 million dirhams to 900 million dirhams between 2015 and 2016 thanks to the liberalization of fuel prices.” Without taking taxes into account, the cost of gas in Morocco is on the low end of non-oil producing countries. However, taxes do comprise a large portion of the price, at approximately 34.5 percent on diesel and 43 percent on gasoline. Still, the report claims the tax burden is one of the lowest in the world. Does Afriquia have a monopoly? According to the report, there are 20 gas distribution companies in the kingdom, including three multinational companies operating under subsidiaries (Libya Oil, Vivo Energy, and Total). Eleven companies import crude oil directly. Since liberalization, the number of gas stations in the country has increased by 12 percent. According to a summary provided by Medias24, “Afriquia has nearly 22% of the stations followed by Vivo Energy (Shell) with 14% and Total with 12.5%. Petrom, Ziz, Winxo and Libya Oil follow with shares between 7.5% and 8.7%.” Should boycotting consumers be concerned that Afriquia owns more gas stations than any other gas distributor? A US court ruling in United States vs. Aluminum Co. of America proclaimed that owning 90 percent of the market “is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four percent would be enough; and certainly thirty-three per cent is not.” Although consumers may rest easy if Afriquia owns only 22 percent of the gas stations, they should be vigilant of whether it receives preferential treatment from the government that disadvantages competitors, whether it has deceived the parliamentary commission about its market share, or whether its profits were edited out of the final report version.

Washington DC – With the start of the holy month of Ramadan, the unprecedented popular campaign in Morocco to boycott three consumer products starts to takes a certain measure of perseverance and significance.  The decision by large segments of the Moroccan society to shun companies owned by individuals close to the circle of power sends a number of political and socio-economic messages to the ruling elite. The campaign that started online by an unanimous group calls on fellow Moroccans to stop buying dairy products made by the powerful and dominant centrale-Danone, gasoline from petro-stations owned by billionaire and current Minster of agriculture Aziz Akhannouch and mineral water Sidi Ali owned by the president of  the Confederation of Moroccan  Enterprises Meryem Bensalah. It has been a rallying cry for those activists who blame powerful politicians for using their status to solidify their presence on the market, drive out competition and keep the prices of key products artificially high. This crusade, though it intends to denounce the control of corporations with links to government officials over markets and their use if this power to raise prices and limit choices for consumers, nonetheless reveals the duplicity of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), as well as  most political parties, with powerful business lobbies. The goal of this campaign is beyond the boycott of three specifically targeted companies, it is to protest the high cost of living caused by soaring prices of staple foods and services. Moroccans are hoping to bring to lights their daily sufferings with the unsustainable prices of necessities and a widespread market monopoly of few powerful and well-connected industrial mega-groups. However, politicians on the right and the left have stayed indifferent to such basic demands. This apathy is yet another sign of the widening disconnect between the Moroccan political parties and the public. This cyber activism has demonstrated the ineptitude and impotence of the current political leadership including members of the PJD. The disdain with which members of the current government regard the Mokataa (Arabic for boycott) is worrisome. The notion that such activism could be illegal as Minster of Communication, Moustafa al-Khalfi, implied in a speech is disturbing. In fact, the ruling PJD that campaigned as the poor people’s party should have shown more understanding if not solidarity with the boycott. The disappointing reactions of civil society organizations is alarming. Moroccans are heartbroken and disillusioned with their leader’s lack of political courage to defend the rights of all Moroccans to fair prices and decent living conditions. Nevertheless, they are well aware that their politicians understand the meaning of the boycott and the subtle messages it carries with it. They also know that these same “leaders” are reluctant to address the public’s concerns for fear of losing positions, jobs and privileges. Unfortunately, the political leadership seems to ignore the implications of leaving the political and public discourse fields empty of serious contenders. This mindset opens the door to despair, chaos and sometimes violence. It is the duty of the political parties, the civil society, and independent organizations to absorb, digest and produce solutions to society’s malaises. If they fail, extreme and foreign ideologies settle in. The Mokataa offers a necessary and sobering wake up call for Morocco’s political elite. It is time to take serious, genuine and honest steps to help increase wages for workers and encourage competition from startups and small businesses all over Morocco. The current Band-Aid and lip service policies are taking the nation in the wrong direction.

Rabat – The EU Commission has proposed upgrades to its Visa Information System (VIS) that would require all Schengen visa applications to be checked across other EU information systems for security and migration. Schengen visas grant successful applicants access to the 26 European states that agreed to abolish internal borders in the Schengen agreement. The UK, which wants to maintain its own borders, is famously not a member to the agreement. (Five other EU member states, Ireland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Cyprus, are also not part of the Schengen.) Under the proposed changes, holders of long-term visas and residence permits would be included in VIS, the database for Schengen visa applications, in addition to those applying for short-term visas, which are in the current system. According to the EU’s press release on Wednesday, the changes will give law enforcement “more structured access to the VIS for the prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or other serious crimes.” Hundreds of thousands of Moroccans apply for Schengen visas each year. In fact, Morocco is among the top ten countries submitting short-term Schengen visa applications. Last year, 614,472 applications for Schengen visas were received in consulates and embassies in Morocco. Of those, 15 percent were rejected. According to the VIS factsheet, the system contains “over 55 million visa applications and nearly 47 million fingerprint sets as of May 2018.” In addition to fingerprints, the VIS contains facial images and information from the visa application. The information can be accessed by a number of relevant authorities, including visa authorities, border guards, migration authorities, asylum authorities, law enforcement, and Europol. The new upgrade will secure applicants’ information with a “data protection by design” approach. Data is retained in the VIS for five years from the expiration of the visa or from the date of a negative decision.

Rabat – For the start of the holy month of Ramadan, several heads of government, such as King Mohammed VI, Justin Trudeau, and even Donald Trump, have released statements wishing a happy and blessed Ramadan to Muslims all over the world. King Mohammed VI sent congratulatory messages to leaders of Islamic countries, expressing his best wishes for good health and happiness, and wishing their brotherly peoples further progress and prosperity. “This holy month of Ramadan, with its spirit of faith, human solidarity and compassion, is an opportunity for us to reminisce about the unity of Muslim peoples and the brotherly bonds uniting them. It is also a time to step up efforts to strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance between our countries and to enhance their commitment to the lofty values of our pristine faith – values which reject discord, extremism, hatred and reclusiveness, and advocate, instead, moderation and tolerance,” the King said. “The aim is for our Ummah [Islamic community] to hold its rightful place and continue to enrich human civilization,” the Sovereign added. “I pray that Almighty God grant us success in our untiring quest to fulfil the aspirations of the Muslim Ummah and instil confidence and hope in our younger generations so they may rise to current challenges and build a prosperous future in which peace, security and stability prevail,” the King said. UAE President Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan sent congratulatory messages to the kings, emirs and presidents of Arab and Islamic nations on the occasion of Ramadan. In his messages, Sheikh Khalifa wished the leaders and their people continued good health and well-being, as well as further progress and prosperity for Arab and Islamic nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Muslims in Canada and around the world on Tuesday, reflecting “on values such as compassion, gratitude and generosity.” “Over the coming month, people will gather in mosques and homes to pray, fast during the day time, and in the evening break their fast and enjoy iftars together,” said Trudeau.  The White House issued its annual US presidential message on Ramadan, wishing Muslims worldwide a blessed Ramadan. Diverging from his typical fear-mongering messages about “radical Islamic terror,” US President Donald Trump sent his “best wishes” to Muslims around the world. In contrast to his past messages of Muslim vilification, Trump highlighted the “richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life” in his 2018 presidential message on Ramadan. At his general audience on Wednesday morning, May 16,  Vatican City Sovereign Pope Francis sent greetings to Muslims for the month of Ramadan. “May this special time of prayer and fasting help everyone to walk the path of God, which is the path of peace,” he said. “It is meant to inculcate righteousness and discipline,” said  Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari of Ramadan, as he sent his greetings and best wishes to Muslims in Nigeria and across the world.

Rabat- A woman arrested for secretly recording a video in a women’s hammam in Temara, a coastal city located in the region of Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, will have to spend the holy month of Ramadan behind bars, as she was sentenced to 10 months in prison on Wednesday. After a 50-second video of naked women in a hammam circulated on social media in April, security services conducted an investigation leading to the eventual arrest of the offender on Friday, May 4, as the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN) reported.  The woman said that she was incited by a particular individual to shoot the video. The culprit pretended to be on her phone when she was recording the footage.  On Wednesday, the Court of First Instance in Temara handed down its verdict, giving the woman 10 months in prison and an unidentified monetary fine. Meanwhile, security services revealed that the individual who first requested the video was a man, who was subsequently fined MAD 30,000. Ordinary Moroccans were the first to demand an investigation after the video outraged many Moroccans on social media. The incident was not the first time a video was illicitly taken in a Moroccan hammam this year. In January, two French tourists sneaked a camera inside a hammam in Marrakech’s Bab Doukkala. The tourists shot pictures and videos of naked women until they were caught by an employee in the bathhouse. The tourists were placed in custody to undergo investigation.

Rabat – African Development Bank (BAD) has outlined EU 200 million loan dedicated to finance the program of support for the inclusive and sustainable development of agricultural sectors in Morocco. The new operation aims to support job creation in rural areas through the inclusive development of agricultural value chains, the African bank said in a statement. “This program will thus strengthen the sustainability of jobs created through green governance and even more effective management of water resources,” adds the same source, stressing that “in the continuity of the Bank’s historic support, the program will contribute to the implementation of agriculture, environment, employment, and professional training.” Aligned with three of the Bank’s five strategic priorities, the project responds primarily to the “Feeding Africa” goal and hopes to promote the two other strategic objectives, namely “Improve life quality of the African people” and “Industrialize Africa,” according to BAD. The agricultural support is one aspect of the 2017-2021 Country-Strategy document for Morocco, in line with its second pillar focused on improving living conditions through employment for young people, women, and men living in rural area. The country manager of the BAD in Morocco, Leila Farah Mokaddem, highlighted how the project is projected to boost Morocco’s exports revenues to MAD 45 million by 2030 and save 990 million cubic meters of water. By 2020, it aims to mobilize MAD 4 billion of private investment in the agricultural sector to create thousands of jobs for young people and women in rural areas. Foundational infrastructure, covering the energy, water, transport, agriculture, and social development sectors, will compose 80 percent of the total financing.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI inaugurated the new MAD 312 million ‘Prince Moulay Abdallah’ prefectural hospital in the Hssain district in Salé. The 250-bed hospital, which may have a strong social impact, reflects the importance the sovereign places on the health sector, particularly through the development of hospital infrastructure. The project also reflects the King’s conviction that the right of access to health care services is a major pillar to consolidate citizenship and achieve comprehensive, integrated, and sustainable human development. The new hospital, which will serve a population of more than one million inhabitants, will complement similar structures in the Rabat-Salé-Kenitra region and will relieve congestion at the Ibn Sina University Hospital Center in Rabat. Having a regional vocation, this hospital reflects the King’s willingness to enable all citizens to have access to quality health care services. The health facility extends over 3.7 hectares and houses a medical-technical department, an emergency department, a blood bank, an outpatient hospital, gynecology-obstetrics wards, and a pediatrics ward. T he hospital also contains departments for surgery, orthopedics, neurology, ophthalmology, nephrology and hemodialysis, in addition to administrative and technical offices. Built by the Ministry of Health, the new hospital will be served by Line 2 of the Rabat-Salé Tramway, when the current extension project is completed.

Rabat – Moroccan biologist, author, and prominent Islamic feminist Asma Lamrabet has chosen to publish her latest book, “Women and Men in the Qur’an,” in the United States. In her book, Lamrabet defies preconceived Islamophobic ideas about subjects like the treatment of Muslim women, as she frames Islam as an egalitarian spiritual ethic. The 195-page book has been published by Palgrave Macmillan and is translated from its original French version by Muneera Salem-Murdock, the former resident director of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Morocco. The book distinguishes the spiritual message message of Islam from the socio-political context at the time of its revelation, challenging notions of oppression and patriarchy commonly held in the West. “Stuck between a Western rhetoric that portrays them as obedient figures in search of an impossible freedom, the majority of Muslim women find themselves stuck in this eternal duality,” Asma Lamrabet noted while presenting her book. Moreover, Lamrabet advocates for “a deep reconsideration of the spiritual message of Islam toward human relations as expressed in innumerable verses in the Quran that highlight the importance of shared responsibility, and mutual respect and support between men and women.” “Asma Lamrabet’s book makes a convincing argument through two essential points: first, the non-existence of the notion of the universal Muslim woman, and second, the fact that the patriarchal interpretation on the status of women in Islam is not supported by the Quran,” explained Peter Mandaville, professor in George Mason University.  Born in 1961, Lamrabet is the founder of a working group for women’s issues and intercultural dialogue, and a major contributor to “Third Way” feminism, a movement that questions religious patriarchy and fights sexism in Islam. In March, Lamrabet resigned from her position as director in the Mohammadian League of Scholars, “Rabita Mohammadia of Oulemas,” due to disagreements over equality of inheritance between men and women.

Rabat – Morocco is set to welcome yet another Hollywood production. American actor, singer, and filmmaker, Johnny Depp, will soon fly to the kingdom with British actors Robert Pattinson and Mark Rylance to shoot “Waiting for the Barbarians,” produced by Colombian filmmaker Ciro Guerra. “We hope to start shooting at the end of the year in Morocco. It will be my first film outside of Colombia and in English,” said the director in a statement to AFP. Robert Pattinson and Mark Rylance will be the stars of this film, and shooting will begin in autumn. As for Depp, he contacted the Colombian producer to work under his direction and appear in the movie. This political thriller inspired by apartheid in South Africa, tells the story of a British judge in a small colonial town, helpless in the face of an officer who provokes a war to kickstart his career. The movie is an adaptation of the novel of the same name published in 1980 and written by South African writter John Maxwell, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 2003.  This will be Guerra’s first feature film in English. In 2016, the producer won the Oscar for best non-English film for his movie “El abrazo de la serpiente,” which was presented this year at the Directors’ Fortnight in Cannes. “Waiting for the Barbarians” isn’t the only Hollywood movie that will be filmed this year in Morocco. The famous Keanu Reeves’s saga “John Wick” is revving up for round three in the kingdom. The Canadian actor is set to shoot in the North African country, following filming in Japan and Montreal beginning April 25.

Rabat- Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita denounced Israel’s violence in the Gaza strip, where more than 50 Palestinians were killed the same day of the US embassy’s inauguration Monday, May 14. In a meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis, who arrived in Morocco Wednesday to hold bilateral talks with Bourita, the Morrocan official gave Morocco’s stance on the Gaza massacre, saying that the country strongly denounces the use of force against unarmed Gazan protesters that left 58 dead and 2,410 wounded, according to the latest statistics. Bourita added that the violence defies international law and will further worsen the situation between Israel and Palestine. With regard to the kingdom’s stand on the move of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Bourita referred to King Mohammed VI’s letter to the president of Palestine, which stressed Morocco’s condemnation of the embassy relocation against UN international law. The letter said: “We follow with deep concern the implementation of the US administration’s decision to recognize Al-Quds as the capital of Israel and to move its embassy there.” Several countries condemned Israel’s mass killing of Palestinians along the Gaza border. The Palestinans had rallied in protest of the US embassy move. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed outrage towards Israel, calling it a “terrorist state,” and recalling Turkey’s ambassadors to the US and Israel.

Rabat – Following Algeria, Iran has reiterated denial of involvement in Morocco’s internal affairs. Spokesman of Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bahram Ghasemi also denied that Morocco provided evidence of Hezbollah-Polisario collusion. Quoted by Iranian news agencies ISNA and Mehr, the Iranian official said that “Either in their meeting with the foreign minister of our country in their interviews with different media outlets, the authorities of this country (Morocco) did not present any conclusive evidence to prove their claims.” Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Iranian ally Hezbollah of providing military support for the separatist group Polisario and severed diplomatic ties with Iran May 1.  Morocco also accused Algeria of directly supporting the Hezbollah-Polisario collusion. “The file was carefully prepared” In a recent interview with Jeune Afrique, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that Morocco provided detailed evidence of the collusion to Tehran. “The file was carefully prepared, for weeks, on the basis of information collected and cross-checked over several months,” said Bourita, adding that the document summarizes “proven and precise facts: dates of visits by senior officers of Hezbollah in Algeria, dates and venues of meetings with Polisario officials, and a list of names of agents involved in these contacts.” He added that Morocco would not have bothered submitting a file to Iran, “if its [evidence] was not solid.” Denying his country’s role in the tension, Ghasemi said that “after breaking ties with Iran due to a baseless reason, Moroccan officials now have a difficulty justifying their action before the public opinion both at home and abroad,” adding that this is why Moroccan officials “gave interviews and repeated the same old rhetoric against Iran.” However, Morocco has been firm in its decision. Bourita also provided specific names who traveled to Algeria’s Tindouf camps, where separatists are housed. Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran has received unwavering support from European, African, and Gulf countries. A decision made under pressure? Ghasemi also said that Morocco’s stance was made “under pressure.” “We hope Morocco’s recent move to sever its relations with Iran was not done as part of new regional alignments and under the pressure of certain governments that are standing against the Islamic Republic of Iran today,” Ghasemi said, referring to Saudi Arabia and its allies. Morocco, however, has already responded to these claims. A few days after announcing its decision, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement denying that its decision to cut ties with Iran was taken in response to foreign pressure. “Following the rupture by the Kingdom of Morocco of its diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, some circles, in need of arguments, claimed that the Kingdom would have taken this decision under pressure from some countries,” said the statement. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Morocco has historically proven that it takes its positions independent of all regional and international crises. Furthermore, all  stances “correspond to its principles and respond to its own assessment.”

Rabat – The FIFA task force will officially announce its final decision on the Morocco 2026 bid and the North American joint bid on May 29.  Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid committee announced the date of the final decision earlier today on its official Twitter account. The Moroccan Royal Federation of Football (FRMF) addressed on Monday, May 14, a letter to all football federations affiliated with FIFA, calling them to vote in favor of the African bid in the FIFA conference that will be held on June 12-13, in Moscow. The FRMF stressed the strong aspects of the Moroccan dossier. Prior, the FRMF addressed its first letter to FIFA on March 25, regarding Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. FRMF President Fouzi Lekjaa noted the committee’s surprise upon learning about scoring system that was sent to them [FRMF] on March 14-24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA. On April 3, FIFA responded to convey that the aim of the Task Force is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue-cost criteria.” FIFA’s arguments, however, were not enough to convince Morocco’s FRMF. Morocco had requested, in another letter to FIFA, to exclude the American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands football associations, which are subordinated to American influence and are not entitled to vote. Despite the independence of these states in the sports field, they are politically affiliated with the United States of America and is considered as an American territory.   #RoadTo2026 #TaskForce La Task Force chargée par la @FIFAcom d’évaluer les candidatures nord-américaine et marocaine pour l’organisation de la #CoupeDuMonde 2026 rendra son verdict le 29 mai prochain, concernant l’éligibilité des deux dossiers #Maroc2026 pic.twitter.com/N7QEsSk4BF — Morocco 2026 (@Morocco2026_FR) 16 mai 2018

Rabat – French-Lebanese Actress Manal Issa has taken a stand against Israel’s repression of Gaza at the 2018 Cannes Festival. The 26-year-old artist hoisted a sign that said “Stop the Attack on Gaza!!” on the red carpet, before the premiere of the film “Solo: A Star Wars Story” Tuesday night. If Cannes  is all about beautiful faces, great movies and fancy dresses, it is also a platform to send clear and strong messages on political matters.  Issa took advantage of her moments in front of photographers to deploy a placard in support of the people of Gaza, after the bloody quashing by the Israeli army. With her gesture, the heroine of “Parisienne” (2015) and “Mon tissu préféré” (2018) joined a wave of indignation against the massacre of Palestinian civilians. Issa’s protest symbolizes support for the right of Palestinians to return to land occupied by Israeli settlers and a stand against the move of the US embassy to Jerusalem, inaugurated Monday with blood and guns. Earlier in the day, dozens of people held a minute of silence in the Palestinian booth of the Cannes Film Festival, including American actor Benicio del Toro. This is the first year that Palestine has had its own booth at the event. Last year at the festival, stars of the film “Aquarius” used signs to denounce a “coup” in Brazil. May 14 was one of the bloodiest days in Gaza’s history.  Israeli forces injured over 1,900 people and killed over 50 people, including eight children, who were protesting the move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In the days leading up to the inauguration of the US embassy on Monday approximately 35,000 Gazans joined the protests. According to AFP, a special meeting of the UN Human Rights Council is scheduled to be held Friday in Geneva to discuss “the deterioration of the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories.” The United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland have supported the idea of investigations launched by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in late March.

Rabat – With Morocco’s expulsion of Iranian Charge d’Affairs and withdrawal of her own Ambassador from Tehran, Morocco signaled to the region and to the world that any interference in its national sovereignty and attacks on territorial integrity will be met with a swift and decisive response.  However, that does not resolve the issue that led to this development: Iran’s use of its embassy in Algiers for delivery of sophisticated weapons through Hezbullah to Polisario operatives in Western Sahara. Algeria, Iran, and Hezbullah all denied these allegations.  However, Polisario admitting that it was interested in strengthening its ties to Iran and cultivating ties with Hezbullah, failed to explain the illegal maneuvers in violation of the ceasefire agreement it was recently caught conducting the buffer zone. On the one hand, Iran has been weakened in the past week on several fronts: JCPOA withdrawal has caused the rial to plummet, further undermining its economy. Second, the United States is reimposing sanctions, which should further squeeze Tehran. Israel has severely damaged, if not mostly destroyed, its military supplies in Syria. And popular dissatisfaction has grown internally. However, European countries continue to legitimize Iran’s actions by looking to strengthen and protect their business deals with the Islamic Republic. Furthermore, it is not clear whether Iran has been honest about its military capabilities in Syria. There are those who suspect that the surface bases were merely built to protect underground facilities where much more sophisticated weaponry is stored. There is no indication that Tehran is backing off its bellicose plans to continue on the path to global hegemony and destabilization. Hizbullah and other proxies remain active. If anything, there is a high likelihood that for a period of time, Iran’s focus will shift to Africa. President Trump’s recent comments accuse Iran of perpetrating and supporting terrorism all over the Middle East and North Africa; however, the White House also left room for renegotiating the JCPOA. That gives the Islamic Republic some breathing room to regroup. Already, some of Iran’s allies in Africa are pushing back at Morocco in response to this decision. South Africa, a close and growing ally of Iran, dropped its support for Morocco’s 2026 FIFA bid. However, there has been little discussion of South Africa’s connections with Hezbullah. Only a few months ago, Africa’s Mail &amp; Guardian revelead South African link in the US-Hezbullah drug exporting case, part of the ongoing probe in response to the bombshell about the Obama administration’s cover up of Hezbullah and drug cartel narcotrafficking into the US in light of the JCPOA deal.   South Africa, as it turns out, was a central location used by a businessman who was arrested on charges of collaborating with Hezbullah in the narcotrafficking. While the Trump administration has dedicated a task force to fighting Hezbullah’s presence in Latin America, so far the organization has continued to grow its presence in the Middle East and Africa. Much more needs to be done by the United States and her allies to combat this threat. Iran, threatened by increased scrutiny in the Middle East, has turned to the continent where it has a long history of interference and growing alliances, thanks to its investments into infrastructure, ideological outreach, arms trade, and purchase of uranium. The West has not been watching the growing tensions inside the African Union over the support of some countries for Iran; likewise, South Africa’s and Algeria’s role in supporting Iranian interventionism and attempts to destabilize pro-Western countries in West Africa, and Morocco up until this point have received little media attention. This issue likewise has not been a priority with Congress or the administration. Iran, however, is not deterred by Morocco’s gesture, though the break in relationship has done a lot to bring Iran’s dangerous presence in North Africa to the world’s attention, and to send a strong signal from Morocco’s about its priorities in defending its borders and national sovereignty. If anything, Iran will continue to supply Polisario operatives through Algeria and other means; in fact, whereas previously it has not brazenly used intelligence operatives disguised as diplomats to conduct illegal activity, there may be many more of such individuals in Iranian embassies in Africa, and others may be on their way.   Angered by Western response to its aggression in the Middle East, Iran may very well increase its bellicose activity in Africa as well, in an attempt to undermine Morocco’s alliance with the United States, France, and other Western countries. At the same time, it may look to recruit more proxies for its forces in the Tindouf camps in Algeria, and among Western Saharawis, allegedly under Polisario’s jurisdiction. The goal would be to have terrorist forces, not unlike the main Hezbullah body or the Houthis in Yemen, available at a moment’s notice to strike Western or pro-Western targets all over the continent. While the Western attention has focused almost exclusively on Sunni-backed terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and Boko Haram, Iran has likewise been arming Shi’a militias in the Sahel.   Likely, it will capitalize on Polisario’s ongoing supply of small arms to Mauritania and other countries to promote its own business, gain control of all such arms trafficking, and become a main supplier of the destabilizing forces in the continent. It will likewise use Hezbullah to conduct and cover up other illicit activities, including illicit direct arms trade and smuggling with other countries, various forms of contraband, including missiles going through Somalia and Eritrea to Yemen’s Houthis, as well as shifting its clandestine ballistic missile and nuclear research to various underground facilities in Africa, where they are unlikely to grow attention. In addition to growing Hezbullah presence, Iran can be expected to shift at least a small portion of its Al Quds forces – the intelligence arms of the IRGC – to African countries to engage in espionage, propaganda, and various subversive activities meant to instigate rebellions, recruit followers, and sow discord.  Al Quds has already been caught spying on Israeli and German targets in Germany; going after pro-Western targets in less stable African countries is just a tip of the iceberg for the possibilities.  Aggressive “spy games” are to be expected in the near future; to counter Morocco’s increasing vigilance and potentially strong future response to Hezbullah’s armament of Polisario, Iran may shift resources towards outright terrorism in the region, as well as aggressive discreditation attempts against Moroccan officials through its various proxy media outlets. Nevertheless, Iran has to maintain careful balance, so as not to instigate additional tensions related to Qatar, which has a positive relationship with Morocco, and has issued a general statement in support of Morocco’s right to the defense of its interests. Iran’s presence in the region lies in delicate balance. Its strategy is to build additional navy and other military bases in Africa, securing access to strategic waterways. Morocco stands in the way.  The path to disrupting Morocco’s strong presence and stabilization of the entire North Africa is to create an alliance of anti-Western countries which can assist in creating tense, unstable atmosphere with a potential for an outbreak of hostilities, which will allow Iran to capitalize on weakened vigilance and use terrorist proxies to spread mayhem. It has perfected the model of land corridors in Syria, and has already geared to control the Strait of Hormuz in the North, and Yemen’s Bab al-Mandeb in the South through similar strategies of bringing in forces allegedly to fight Sunni terrorists or by assisting Shi’a proxies in their separatist ambitions.  The goal, however, is less in the control of the physical territory and more in the control of the international water passages, and in the physical threat to its Sunni regional rivals.   For that reason, we may see increased Iranian overtures to countries and tribes surrounding Morocco; Tunisia is a particular concern. Iran is likewise likely to take advantage of the Touareg, and of the unstable militia-driven security situation in Libya. Morocco should be vigilant of these developments, and increase its security cooperation with the United States and France to guard against the emergence of these additional fronts.  The United States, meanwhile, should devote resources, to actively countering Iran’s threat in Africa, not only through defense forces and increased intelligence sharing with Morocco and other friendly countries, but through increased engagement, educational cooperation, and support for social and entrepreneurial initiatives that can help strengthen local economies and guard against hostile influences from abroad.

Rabat- The Islamic holy month of Ramadan will start Thursday May 17, declared the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM). The beginning of Ramadan is set by both lunar calculation and physical sighting of the new moon, which specifies when the last day of one lunar month ends and another begins. On Tuesday evening the new moon was not visible in France, and Ramadan fasting was declared to begin on Thursday by default. Traditionally, the majority of Muslims have begun fasting on  the dates set by Saudi religious authorities, but recently many have used their own astronomical calculations, rather than waiting to see the moon for themselves or for the Saudi declaration. Islam is the second most widely practiced religion in France behind Catholic Christianity by number of worshippers; the vast majority of French Muslims are immigrants by origin. In France, fasting will last for 18 hours. Muslims will begin fasting Thursday at 3:30 AM and break their fast at 9:29 PM. During Ramadan, Muslims have to abstain from eating, drinking and smoking from dawn to dusk.The annual observance is one of the five pillars of Islam. Based on the visual sighting of the crescent moon, Ramadan lasts 29 to 30 days and ends with Eid Al Fitr, which will likely fall on Friday, June 15.

Rabat – Muslims all over the world are preparing themselves for a month of fasting from dawn to sunset. The holy month of Ramadan, one of the five pillars of Islam, allows believers (excluding those pregnant or travelling) to purify themselves through fasting, prayers and spiritual activities. The duration of the daily fast depends on the number of hours between sunrise and sunset, which depends on which season Ramadan falls on. During summer months, those observing Ramadan have to fast longer hours due to longer days, which vary in length depending on the country they live in. Europe Denmark will have approximately 19 hours of fasting this year, down from 21 hours in 2017. As for Sweden, Iceland and Norway, the Nordic countries will still have 20 hours of fasting. Muslims in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany will fast for 18 hours, while those observing Ramadan in Spain will fast for 17 hours. Middle East and North Africa The Middle East and North Africa region will experience slight shorter fasting hours than those in Europe. Fasting will occur for 15 hours in Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and for 16 hours in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Meanwhile in Sudan, Muslims will fast for 13 hours. Asia and Australia In Asia, most Muslims will fast for 14-16 hours. Pakistan and Bangladesh will fast for 14 hours, while India will fast for 15. Australia, which is approaching its winter, will fast for 12 hours. North/South America Muslims in the United States and Canada will fast for 16 to 19 hours, depending on their exact location. Muslims in Brazil and Argentina will fast for 12 hours.

Rabat- Strangely similar to the May 4 incident at Rabat’s Hassan Mosque, a man who displayed signs of mental disorder attacked a random worshipper at a Casablanca mosque on Wednesday.   The National Criminal Police Brigade in Ain Chok, Casablanca, arrested a mentally disturbed individual who had stabbed a man at “Al Hamd” Mosque, as reported by the General Directorate for National Security (DGSN).  The same source explained that the disturbed attacker stabbed his victim in the abdomen with a kitchen knife “for no obvious reason.” The victim was immediately taken to a nearby hospital. Meanwhile the aggressor was taken into custody, undergoing investigation. The incident is similar to an earlier attack this month, when a confirmed mentally deranged man attacked an imam in the middle of Friday prayer inside Hassan Mosque in Rabat.  The attacker was later revealed to be 29 years old and was verified as mentally ill following a hospital examination, as DGSN concluded. Although no injuries were recorded in the Rabat attack, the incident sparked nationwide shock and outrage since it took place within a sacred space. Today’s attack also coincided with the day prior to the first day of the holy month of Ramadan in Morocco and in several other Muslim countries, Thursday, May 17.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has shared with his cabinet the latest updates on the development program in the southern provinces for 2015-2021, which has achieved 48 percent completion. El Othmani presented the latest data in a meeting held at the Parliament’s House of Councillors on Tuesday. The head of government said that the development projects for the southern provinces are expected to reach 70 percent completion by the end of the year. The projects are part of King Mohammed VI’s development model, which he launched in Laayoune in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the Green March in 2015. In his speech, the King shared the aim of the development model: to “seal these provinces’ integration into the unified homeland and to enhance the influence of the Sahara region as an economic hub and a crucial link between Morocco and its African roots.” The projects include a road network, airports to serve African destinations, a railway between Tangier and Lagouira to link Morocco with other African countries, and an economic development fund to “support businesses and the social economy, generate steady income and create jobs, particularly for young people.” During Tuesday’s parliament meeting, El Othmani said the model represents the exact tool to “speed up the broad regionalization process in the Sahara region to achieve the projected development goals in the region.” The ultimate developmental goal is to promote and increase the attractiveness of Morocco’s southern provinces, he added. The minister emphasized his government’s commitment to ensure the success of the new development model and to provide the financial and human resources to accelerate the pace of implementation. The projects also aim to enable the local population to manage their own affairs. The government has invested MAD 21 billion until the end of March 2018 on the development projects.

Rabat – Moroccan citizens supporting the boycott, including celebrities,  believe that the apology offered by Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani was too little too late after other ministers’ harsh comments against the boycott. Renowned Moroccan singer Latifa Raâfat was the first celebrity to comment on El Othmani’s apology message addressed in a Parliament meeting Tuesday in Rabat. After publicly supporting the campaign in the early days of the boycott, Raâfat took to her Facebook again to say that the apology came only days after a few statements that hurt consumers’ feelings.  Raâfat wrote: “My respect to you, Mr. El Othmani,  a few days ago you described and called us all kinds of insulting things.” She said the head of government “called us inconsequential.  How can you apologize and call on inconsequential people to turn the page. Are you talking to ghosts?” On Tuesday El Othmani apologized to people supporting the boycott, for the “verbal expressions and offenses” made against boycotters by several ministers. The head of government had previously refused to comment on the boycott, saying he would not respond to “inconsequential people.” “Your excellency,  the acknowledgment of a mistake is a virtue. I assure you that [Moroccan] people are very peaceful and carried out their boycott in a very peaceful and civilized way,” Raâfat said. Raâfat emphasized that it is time for the government to increase its efforts and satisfy the needs of citizens “through decrease of commodity prices, because Moroccan people are free and will not give up on things that you have promised people during your election campaign.” The Moroccan diva concluded her statement with the widely circulated hashtag #boycotting. “El Othmani ‘apologizes’  to boycotters and calls people to turn the page because Ramadan is coming without responding to the demand of citizens and decreasing prices. Your apology is not accepted,” another Moroccan boycotter wrote on Twitter. ?????? ??????? ???????? ?????, ????? ???? ?????? ?? ?????, ??????? . — mohammed labiad (@bacharamazouni) May 15, 2018  “Doctor El Othmani’s apology is not accepted,” said another.

Rabat- The Prefectural Judicial Police in Rabat has arrested a police commissioner engaged in deceptive activities, reported Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security DGSN. The suspect was engaged in employment fraud, promising to hire prospective employees if they paid him MAD 60,000. The suspect pocketed the money and gave candidates fake jobs. The suspect was also found in possession of illicit badges, cards of unidentified associations called “Chorafa,” and walkie talkies—all of which were used to dupe his victims into believing that they were members of DGSN, the same source maintained. Soon after arrest, the suspect was taken into custody on charges of fraud. Meanwhile investigations are ongoing to detect similar criminal activities.

Rabat- Muslim communities in North America will delay the first Ramadan fast, which was to begin on Wednesday, May 16, as the moon sighting was not confirmed on Tuesday night. Muslims in the US and Canada are unsure of when to commence Ramadan fast, as the sighting of “Hilal” crescent or new moon indicating the start of the holy month was not confirmed with the naked eye on Tuesday night. The Islamic Supreme Council of Canada has announced that the first day of the Ramadan fast, originally set for Wednesday, May 16, in Canada and Australia would be delayed. According to Canadian Television Network CTV: “There was no vision of Hilal in Canada or North America, so we are announcing that the beginning of Ramadan will be Thursday, May 17.” Start of Ramadan delayed as no confirmed moon sightings in North America https://t.co/Ph4FUwCfYR #yyc pic.twitter.com/PF7apyULCq — CTV Calgary (@CTVCalgary) May 16, 2018  Meanwhile in the United States, though some mosques already announced the start of Ramadan on Wednesday, others delayed the fast until Thursday, in line with Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and other countries in the Middle East. The Islamic Center of New England also announced that Ramadan will begin on Thursday in a recent statement, due to the fact that the “crescent was not sighted in the countries of the Muslim World who are using methodology of moon-sighting.”  The same source referenced Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): “Do not fast until you see the new moon, and do not break the fast until you see it, and if it is covered then complete the month.” Saudi Arabia and several other Muslim countries, including Morocco, Oman, Indonesia, and Egypt will begin the Ramadan fast on Thursday, May 17. Such confusions about the first day of Ramadan are quite common for Muslims living in foreign countries, like the US. While some Muslims follow astronomical calculations to determine the first Ramadan, others choose to follow Saudi Arabia when determining the start of Ramadan, as the kingdom serves as the primary benchmark for fasting times across most non-Muslim majority countries.

Rabat – When Morocco was unanimously chosen to host the 12th World Congress on High Speed Rail in 2021, it became the first Arab-African to receive the honor. The choice, which was made by participants at the 10th World Congress on High Speed Rail in Turkey, was due to Morocco’s ongoing infrastructure projects for rail development. Moreover, the quality of the kingdom’s rail infrastructure  played an important role. Morocco’s rail is the best in Africa and 33rd globally, according to the 2018 World Economic Forum report, as revealed in a statement from the National Office of Railways (ONCF). At the 10th congress, initiated by the International Union of Railways (UIC) and the Turkish Rail Network (TCDD), Morocco presented its strategy to develop the railway sector. Representatives focused on the flagship project of the high speed line that will link Tangier and Casablanca, highlighting its technical specificities, design, management modes, and its level of progress.   The biennial World Congress on High Speed Rail  is an unprecedented global meeting for railway managers and a great opportunity for information exchanges,  to discuss best practices for the development of high speed rail and to strengthen rail as a competitive, sustainable and efficient mode of transport.

Rabat – The research group BMI forecasts GDP growth at 3.6 percent in its latest economic outlook report. Linking public infrastructure investment to continued growth, BMI estimates are 0.4 percent higher than forecasts by the Bloomberg consensus. With employment on the rise following a fruitful agricultural season, BMI reports consumer confidence reaching “multi-year highs in recent months.”  As the agriculture sector employs approximately 40 percent of the nation’s workers, high consumer confidence and a productive harvest should lead to higher private consumption. Moreover, the aforementioned public investment in infrastructure, including new highways and solar power plants, will facilitate the higher employment and development in the public works and sustainable energy sectors. Morocco’s commitment to strong fixed investment growth has attracted global attention, featuring in the top 10 of Rand Merchant Bank’s “Where to Invest in Africa” ranking. RMB bases its assessment on market activity, the operating environment (rules and regulations), and investment attractiveness. BMI indicators align with the optimistic economic forecast by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) for 2017 and 2018. According to the HCP, 2017 saw improvements in national economic growth, agricultural value, and the growth rate of non-agricultural activities.  Although the HCP recorded slight deceleration in the aforementioned categories from 2017 to 2018, the overall economic environment forecasts positive growth and a consistent and strong economy for the remainder of the year.

Rabat – As a whole, the work of Tahar Ben Jelloun sparks intense debates, as it pours into the tale, the legend, the Maghreb rites, and ancestral myths.  However, its originality lies in its art of grasping all aspects of the North African traditions and cultures in a very singular symbiosis. Ben Jelloun is the most famous Moroccan writer both in the Maghreb and worldwide. He is very well known since the 1987 Goncourt Award.  His audacious writings have sparked debates. His works are taught in universities throughout the world and remain in many respects a reference of Francophone literature. As a whole, the work of Tahar Ben Jelloun pours into the tale, the legend, the Maghreb rites, ancestral myths … However, its originality lies in its art of grasping all aspects of the North African traditions and cultures in a very singular symbiosis. It is a great honor for me personally and for the international festival of Amazigh culture to give him a vibrant tribute at its 14th edition. In fact, the whole city of Fez has paid him a tribute. I thank him very much for giving me the opportunity to speak with him and for answering these questions: You are one of the greatest writers in the world. What is the secret of your success? What is the role that immigration plays in your writings? You exaggerate! I am a writer who witnesses his time; I am concerned with the problems of my society. I subscribe entirely to the novelist Balzac’s definition in “Small miseries of conjugal life”: “One must search all social life to become a true novelist, since the novel is the private history of nations.” There is no other secret except that of work, rigor and obligation. Writing is a difficult task. It is not enough to want to write to be successful. You have to read a lot of great books, classics to learn how to write. Immigration was a discovery for me when I arrived in France in 1971. I had not know anything about it. My father, who sold jellabas and serouals in a small shop in Tangier, was eagerly awaiting the return of the immigrants who were used to stop by at Tangiers to buy traditional clothes before continuing on their way to Agadir or Tafraout. He told me they were Moroccans who had been forced to go to work in France. But this theme will be a significant part of my literary and sociological work.  Could you have succeeded had you stayed in Morocco? What is the impact of your success on Morocco and Moroccans? I do not know what I would have become if I had stayed in Morocco. Circumstances had made me leave in order to finish my thesis in France. It was the beginning of the years of lead, the military coup of July 1971, the repression of intellectuals … In my latest book, “The Punishment”, I tell how the great history of my country affected my personal story. It was the same officers who mistreated us in the camp of El Hajeb and the school of Ahermemou who made the coup against King Hassan II. France was a chance for me to escape this arbitrariness and repression. I stayed in touch with my country all the time. Even in the dark hours when I risked having problems with the political police, I always came home to spend some time with my parents. I made concessions not to become a political exile, because I could not bear not to see my parents. -You have a very exceptional career; now in retrospect what are the main stations that have marked your intellectual biography? The main stations in my itinerary are simple: discovery of the loneliness and emotional misery of North African immigrants in France; meeting with Jean Genet, who was fighting for the Palestinian cause; meeting with Pierre Viansson Ponté, editor-in-chief of the French newspaper Le Monde; meeting with Edmonde Charles-Roux, who introduced me to François Mitterrand and who did his best to get me the Goncourt prize; meeting with Mahmoud Darwish and the poetry of the Arab world; commitment in the fight against racism, etc. You live between Morocco and France and you know the problems of long marginalized cultures, what place would you reserve for Amazigh culture in the multicultural and multi-linguistic panorama of Morocco today? At what point in your life would you have become aware of the Amazigh as part of the Moroccan identity, you who were born in Fez and come from a rather urban and Arabic background? I have always been sensitive to the Amazigh world. I embraced it better by falling in love with my future wife, born in Mzouda in the heart of Amazigh territory. My children are half Arab and half Amazigh. By writing “Eyes down”, which tells the story of a little shepherdess who joined her immigrant parents in France, I paid tribute to this essential component of Moroccan identity. I have never felt an antagonism between the two languages, the two cultures and the two worlds, yet they are so different. I quickly surpassed prejudices and totally invested in the struggle for the recognition of Amazigh and its cultural and civilizational wealth. You have written an impressive number of novels, among these works what would be the novel that most reflects your ideological leanings regarding democracy in North Africa? I wrote two novels totally inspired by the Moroccan reality: “Moha the fool, Moha the wise” on torture and the harsh inequalities in our society; then “The Broken Man”, which deals with the plague of corruption, which unfortunately still exists. Both books are an illustration of the need for democracy in our country. The whole of my poetry also deals with this need. For me, democracy begins at home, with education, learning of and respect for fundamental values. Then it goes on at school and finally on the street. Democracy is not a technique, voting is not enough to be democratic. It is also necessary to assimilate the culture of values, which leads to a system of freedom and responsibility. To be a novelist is to be an artist of ideas, what is the place of art in your life and your writings? Art is the essential superfluous element. We can say that art is useless, but we cannot conceive of a society without artistic production. It is in France that I discovered the importance of art; when I saw people in a line of several hundred meters, waiting to enter a museum for hours even in the rain, I understood the importance of art. I learned to look at a painting, to listen to a concert of classical music; I learned to appreciate theater … Then, I made a long trip to see an exhibition of Giacometti or Matisse. It is a pleasure to be in front of magnificent works. Morocco, especially Fez, is a major substratum of the imagination that feeds so well your novels, your essays, your art and your poetry. What about this substratum in the current times of social tensions in France and elsewhere, especially towards Muslims. Writing, and especially art, is often said to escape the ideological radars, what could, in your opinion, writing “do” to appease a mad world that is drifting? Literature has its limits. The great Austrian writer Thomas Bernhard said: “No writer has ever changed society. All writers have failed. There have only been writers who have failed. We have never seen a book change the decisions of politicians. On the other hand, several books, several works of art help to improve the consciousness of some people. There are people who consider cultural diversity in Morocco a source of ethnic rivalry between regions and between citizens. What do you think? What is the best way to protect and develop this diversity? Cultural diversity in Morocco is a chance, a wealth, and a strength. The mixture is a beautiful adventure. Beware of “purity”! The Nazis were very keen on making the purity of the race. We know how that ended up later. So, long live diversity, differences, encounters, ideas that collide! Some researchers see Moroccan festivals as a distortion of cultural diversity and describe them as a “cultural aberration” and a waste of funds. To what extent is the idea correct or false? The festivals are useful; we will not condemn them until Morocco has a real cultural policy in the long term and on the merits. The budget of the Ministry of Culture is so thin that it makes us feel ashamed. So we will not condemn festivals that allow hundreds of thousands of young Moroccans to consume culture. What is the future of democracy in North Africa, according to you? The future of democracy in the Maghreb? Let’s start by being modest and say that democracy is a slow and complex process that is just beginning to emerge. Democracy is education, the possibility of having a fair and efficient health system. At the limit, we could do without both Chambers of Parliament if we were seriously concerned about the education of our children whether in town or in the countryside. But the parliament is there to welcome one day democracy that is on the way, but it may take a long time before actually settling. As long as we do not respect each other in everyday life, as long as some resort to corruption to get what the law gives them in principle, as long as we do not believe in the emergence of the individual, we are not in a democracy. At the moment I only see Tunisia making progress: their constitution is the best of all the Maghreb; it is progressive because it recognizes freedom of conscience.

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani stressed that the government is dedicated to protecting consumers, referencing the ongoing boycott campaign in the parliament meeting with House of Councillors on Tuesday.  In the meeting convened to discuss the boycott against the high prices of Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone, and Afriquia, El Othmani emphasized his commitment and responsibility to “listen intently” to the requests of citizens. Staying up-to-date on the boycott, he pointed out the government’s commitment to serve the public interest: to promote purchasing freedom; encourage company production and investment; protect the dignity of the citizen, be he a consumer, trader, or employee in rural or urban areas; and to consider the benefit of the Moroccan economy. He assured the people that the government has taken measures to answer the question of consumer products and market satisfaction, as shown through its launch of a consumer complaint hotline “57 57” dedicated to citizen comments and complaints about market monopolization or corrupt business practices. On the threshold of Ramadan, El Othmani invited everyone to start a new chapter by embracing tolerance, positivity, and joint efforts working for the country’s economic growth, supporting consumers’ purchasing power and improving the situation of farmers and employees. In the process, El Othmani regretted some “verbal errors” expressed by ministers on the boycott, underscoring the government’s dedication to protecting all consumers. El Othmani also pointed to past examples of market monopoly during the holy month, when some enterprises took advantage of citizens’ increased demand for certain consumer products, by doubling their prices. Legal Protections El Othmani mentioned a set of legal texts concerned with consumer protections that the government upholds to protect consumers through a “free market” that ensures price stability and monetary freedom. These regulations include “Law 28.07 related to food safety; Law 31.08 related to safety measures for consumer protection; Law 24.09 related to products safety and service safety.”  The government has taken measures to reinforce the consumer protections through applicable law, as agreed upon by the minister of justice and the minister of trade on March 22, regarding Law 31.08 concerned with safety measures for consumer protection. El Othmani further announced draft resolutions adopted to track product prices and analyze their qualities, particularly widely consumed products. In 2016 and 2017, thanks to more than 28,400 monitoring operations, around 8,200 violations were detected. Online monitoring operations covered more than 220 websites, and issued warnings for 190 potential scams.

Rabat – Following the sexual assault scandal involving his daughter, Hervé Renard has released a statement, making it clear that he will allow the justice system do its job. A few days ago, French media Le Parisien reported that Candide Renard was allegedly a victim of a sexual assault during her participation in the French reality TV show “Koh Lanta,” which took place on the Fiji Islands. Following the release of the report, the suspect was arrested and later released, after new evidence was discovered. After giving a comment to Le Parisien where he confirms that there would be an investigation, Renard shut down all rumors in his official statement.  Communiqué : ‘’Beaucoup de choses ont été dites, concernant la déposition de ma fille Candide. Nous avons choisi de faire confiance à la justice dans cette affaire. Chaque partie est en droit de choisir sa stratégie. Le plus important pour nous, ne sera pas le show médiatique, dont nous n’avons pas besoin pour nous défendre, mais une cohérence pour respecter la justice. Nous attendrons le verdict de cette affaire avec patience et calme. Les grandes déclarations ne servent qu’à se rassurer soi-même et à attirer l’attention. Justice sera faite et l’honneur de ma fille sera rétabli face aux calomnies et divers mensonges à son égard. Le match ne fait que commencer.‘’ Hervé Renard A post shared by  Hervé Renard (@herve.renard.hr) on May 15, 2018 at 10:14am PDT  “A lot of things have been said regarding my daughter Candide’s deposition. We chose to trust the justice system during this case. We don’t need the media to defend ourselves,” the Atlas Lions coach shared on social media. The French coach added that he will “patiently and calmly wait for the verdict as he trusts the justice system.” “Justice will be applied and my daughter’s honor will be restored against the lies that she has faced. The game has just begun,” concluded Renard. The scandal came to light on Friday, May 12, when French TV channel TF1 released a statement canceling its famous adventurous show “Koh Lanta” because of “something that happened between two contestants.” In the middle of the night, Candide Renard, 21, warned the producers of an issue using the authorized emergency walkie-talkie.  The suspect, whose name was revealed as Eddy Guyot, was arrested Monday, May 14, when he got off the plane at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport. The 34-year-old contestant was placed in police custody and released less than twelve hours later, according to French magazine Closer, as new evidence emerged. Other contestants said that Candide Renard and Eddy Guyot were not isolated, but were with two other production participants at the time. One of the witnesses contradicted Renard’s previous statement, claiming he did not witness Guyot touching or attempting to touch Candide.

Rabat – After nearly a month since the launch of the online boycott, Saad Eddine El Othmani has finally reacted, apologizing to customers for “verbal expressions and offenses” made against boycotters. During a meeting held in the upper house of the parliament today,  Othmani addressed an apology message to people supporting the online boycott targeting three companies against “unjustified” increase prices of their products. The list of companies includes: Sidi Ali bottled water, Centrale Danone dairy products, and Afriquia gasoline. In his speech in the monthly meeting today, El Othmani said that “the government cannot be against the interest of citizens, as some think.” On the eve of the holy month of Ramadan, a month of tolerance and forgiveness, El Othmani has seized the opportunity to urge boycotters to cease their campaign and  “move towards the future, to tolerance and positive start.” He called on the boycotters then to turn the page. The head of government apologized for statements made by some ministers in his government, emphasizing that his cabinet is committed to fulfilling its responsibility to protect consumers. After the launch of the boycott on April 20, Minister of Finance and Economy Mohamed Boussaid denounced the campaign, calling supporters of the campaign “fools.” Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch also condemned the boycott, asserting the ineffectiveness of an internet boycott against 470,000 employees in the dairy sector. In response, El Othmani explained that his government is also responsible for preserving the dignity of the citizen, producers and consumers equally. He added that the government has been following the campaign and is implementing a set of measures to meet the needs and aspirations expressed and will ensure the protection of the purchasing power of citizens.

Rabat – Ramadan in Morocco will begin on Thursday May 17. The Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Endowment said that it would officially observe the sighting of the crescent moon on Wednesday. The ministry said in a statement issued earlier today that the observation of the lunar crescent that marks the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan will take place on Wednesday, Chaaban 29, 1439 (in the Islamic calendar), or May 16, 2018. Magistrates, nadhers (traditional moon sighters), and delegates of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Endowment are invited to inform the ministry of the observation of the lunar crescent or its non-observation by contacting it at the following phone numbers: (05.37.76.11.45), (05.37.76.09.32), (05.37.76.05.49), and (05.37.76.89.54) or the ministry fax number (05.37.76.17.21), according to the ministry’s website. Thursday will mark the beginning of Ramadan in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait as well as several countries including Malaysia, and Indonesia. Muslims living in the United States will begin the Ramadan fast on Wednesday, May 16, one day ahead of Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – The White House issued the annual US presidential message on Ramadan, wishing Muslims globally blessed Ramadan. Diverging from his typical fear-mongering messages about “radical Islamic terror,” US President Donald Trump sent his “best wishes” to Muslims around the world. In contrast to Trump’s past messages of Muslim vilification, Trump highlighted the “richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life” in his 2018 presidential message on Ramadan issued earlier today. Beyond claims of diversity, the US president also stated that “those observing Ramadan can strengthen our communities, help those in need, and serve as good examples for how to live a holy life.” These statements of communal unity directly contradict the message of fear and division behind the “Muslim ban” that Trump initiated early in January 2017. The Supreme Court of the United States will rule on the legality of the ban, which covers Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Rabat – The boycotted Sidi Ali mineral water company continues to argue with Moroccan customers. The company released another statement on Monday, refuting claims that the Sidi Ali Chérif source, located in Tarmilat, a few kilometers from the town Oulmes, has dried. After denying that it has increased prices on its bottled water, Sidi Ali also invited customers to travel to the source and check it for themselves. In its statement, published Monday on its Facebook page, the company wrote “in response to a number of misinformation that has been circulated on social networks about the source of water of Sidi Ali, Oulems mineral water.”  The company says that it operates within the framework of clear legal standards, “especially those relating to the provisions of Law No. 36-15 on water.” Contesting customers accusations, the company said it is subjected to strict monitoring by the Ministry of Health (Directorate of Epidemiology and Disease Control / National Institute of Health), which issues the license for land utilization and health approval. The Oulmes company said it is open to voluntary inspections by independent international bodies and has been awarded four quality certificates: ISO 22000 for food safety, ISO 9001 quality certification, ISO 14001 for environmental compliance, OHSAS 18 for certification OHSAS 18 001 on the health and safety of its staff and users. The statement received a wide online backlash, with commenters emphasizing that the boycott will continue anyway since the company refuses to lower its prices.

Rabat – Moroccan producer RedOne started filming a new video promoting the city of Agadir. The video, with 60 seconds devoted to Agadir, will be broadcast up to 5 times a day during the entire 2018 World Cup in Russia on all beIN Sports channels, revealing the city to the entire planet. On Saturday, the hitmaker’s company “RedOne Records” signed a partnership with the Souss-Massa region in southern Morocco as well as the Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT) to start shooting the promotional video.  “I want to use the magic of music to promote my country around the world,” Nadir Khayat, also known as RedOne, said to MAP. Given the worldwide success of his clip “Boom Boom”(114 million views on YouTube), which promotes the various treasures that Morocco has, the new song promises to be a great promotion Agadir, which is known as the “first national” seaside resort. “Music has a great ability to export around the world. Regarding my status as an artist and the success over the years that I had, I feel a great desire to use it to make my country known around the world,” he added. Several sites in Agadir will appear in the clip of the official anthem of beIN Sports channel for the World Cup, which the artist with 45 million sold singles is about to finalize. The clip called “One World”  was also shot in Moscow before Agadir. “I suggested to BeIN Sport officials to shoot partly in Morocco. They accepted. It must be said that since the realization of Boom Boom, I feel that I must continue to realize a long-time dream: to help make my beautiful country known throughout the world,” said the native of Tetouan. Accustomed to the global success of his hits, the two-time Grammy winner hoped that “the song will be a great success especially that the World is a beautiful showcase.” The initiative, taken in partnership with the Wilaya of Agadir Souss Massa, the Regional Council Souss Massa, the Municipal Council of Agadir and the ONMT, expects it will be “an advertisement that goes beyond the only segment of tourism. The whole city will gain prestige and influence.”

Rabat- Muslims living in the United States will begin the Ramadan fast on Wednesday, May 16, one day ahead of Saudi Arabia. US Muslims witnessed the birth of the holy month’s new moon on Tuesday, May 15 and will fast the first day of Ramadan 1439 (on the Islamic calendar) on Wednesday, May 16 which marks the beginning of a month of spiritual purification for American Muslims.  The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) predicted that Ramadan in the US would start on May 16, adding that the first day of Tarawih prayers performed after iftar (the breaking of the fast) will start May 15: “The Astronomical New Moon is on Tuesday, May 15 […] On that day, somewhere in the Pacific Ocean at sunset, the elongation is 8 degrees and moon is 5 degrees above the sun. Therefore the first day of Ramadan is Wednesday, May 16.” According to an official statement presented by Saudi Arabia, the country will start the Ramadan fast on Thursday, May 17, as the crescent moon was not observable on Tuesday. While the US will begin the Ramadan fast on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia and Morocco will have to wait one more day. Moroccan astronomers Dr. Hicham El Issaoui and Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani recently discussed their predictions with Morocco World News on Ramadan’s unified first day of fasting. Their predictions proved right. Morocco, other North African countries, as well as Saudi Arabia and several other countries in the Middle East will begin the fast together on Thursday, May 17. Eid Al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, may fall on Friday, June 15, Eid al-Adha on August 22, and the first day of the Islamic year, Fatih-Muharram, 1440, may be on September 11, as the astronomers formerly predicted. Determining the first day of Ramadan always creates confusion among Muslims immigrants living in foreign countries, especially in Europe and the United States. In the United States, for example, while some Muslims follow astronomical calculations and the predictions of the Islamic Society of North America, many others prefer to start Ramadan on the same day as Saudi Arabia. As Saudi Arabia announced that Thursday would be the first day of Ramadan, it is expected that many Muslims living in the United States will start fasting on Thursday.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia could not sight the crescent moon today, so the holy month of Ramadan will begin Thursday for the nation that holds Islam’s holiest sites. The Saudi Arabia Moon-sighting Committee convened on Tuesday night, after the Saudi Minister of Justice, Sultan Bin Saeed Al Badi issued a resolution earlier in the day. Saudi Arabia was expected to implement specialized infrared digital cameras to document the new lunar year Tuesday. But officials  The moon-sighting tradition follows the words of the Prophet Muhammed (PBUH), who said: “Do not fast until you see it [the crescent] and do not break the fast until you see it, and if it is covered then complete the month.” The announcement comes after Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia have said they will begin Ramadan on Thursday. The lack of a Saudi moon-sighting may prove disproves Al-Ifrani’s previous prediction that all Muslim countries would begin the Ramadan fast on the same day. The moon has not yet been officially sighted in Morocco, following the predictions of Moroccan astronomers Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani and Dr. Hicham El Issaoui, who declared that the Ramadan fast will begin on May 17, after the moon-sighting on the night of May 16. Following the beginning of Ramadan, Eid al-Adha will fall on August 21, and the first day of the Islamic year, Fatih-Muharram, 1440, will be on September 10. El Issaoui predicted that the birthday of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Mawlid al-Nabi al-Sharif, will be celebrated on Monday, November 19. Last year, Ramadan began in Saudi Arabia on May 26. Each year, Ramadan shifts forward by approximately 11 days.

Rabat- The French National Necropolis of Chastre paid tribute to the Moroccan soldiers who fought for Belgium’s liberation from the Nazis in the Battle of Gembloux-Chastre, on Sunday, May 13. In honor of the 76th anniversary of the 1940 Battle of Gembloux-Chastre in Belgium, the French National Necropolis of Chastre welcomed a number of high ranking military figures, politicians, delegates, and diplomats, including Morocco’s Ambassador to Belgium, Mohamed Ameur, and Morocco’s High Commissioner of Former Resisters and Members of the Liberation Army, El Mostafa El Ktiri, reported state-owned press, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The tribute commemorated the courage of the Moroccan soldiers, who fought heroically alongside the French army against the German forces in the battle. Approximately 233 Moroccan soldiers died during the historic battle. After the Battle of Gembloux-Chastre, the May 1940 campaign witnessed the first battle conducted with tanks in world military history. The French army was ultimately victorious in its campaign. During the memorial tribute, Belgian Minister of Staten, André Flahaut, paid respect to the Moroccan sacrifices, which he emphasized were not in vain and will never be forgotten: “It is very important in this difficult era, when hate speech is prevalent, to recall that some foreign soldiers had once come to defend us against the invaders, and they sacrificed themselves for our freedom.” Flahaut emphasized that everyone should recall these historical events and use them as a key to co-existence. For his part, El Ktiri expressed similar sentiments and insisted that the annual tribute is important to sustain the memory of the soldiers’ dignity and heroic deeds, a memory that both Morocco and Europe share together.

Rabat – Following three weeks of silence from Moroccan government officials and executives of three boycotted Moroccan companies the government spokesperson has finally spoken out, singling out the dairy boycott in a shocking press conference, in which he threatened its boycotters. The boycott is exposing great vulnerabilities in the communication strategies of the three affected companies, Centrale Danone and Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès (Sidi Ali), owned by Holmarcom, and AFRIQUIA GAZ, owned by the Akwa Group, which risk losing their market share. Until Government Spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi’s May 10 press conference, the government had not proposed any solution to the ongoing crisis. El Khalfi said that “the government has carefully studied the price structure of the milk company, calculated different factors and their impacts on the national economy, and found out that profit margin is reasonably within 0.20 MAD/ Liter.” He added that “the company didn’t increase its prices and that there was no disruption for the milk collection from the farmers.” The government spokesperson claimed that “the boycott in most part is based on false allegations that are spread by the boycott campaign,” which he considered “illegal and is not a freedom of speech” he added that the government will review the current speech laws.” While Morocco’s economy is considered relatively liberal, governed by the laws of supply and demand, the boycott exposes aggressive government intervention to protect the interests of certain companies over others. Threatening unsatisfied consumers to end their boycott is not only an attempt to do the affected companies’ communication homework, but an offensive intervention against the liberal economic principles that Morocco has embraced for decades. As the boycotted companies failed to open any proper communication channels with the angry consumers, they initially resorted to insulting the boycotters. Now they are threatening them via the government spokesperson. What Mr. El Khalfi and those who he speaks for seem to forget is the basics of economic theories. Adam Smith’s invisible hand theory revolves around the fact that liberal free market economies are built on the promise that companies sell products and services that people want to buy. If they can meet the demands of their customers they will enjoy financial rewards. In free market economies, the “invisible hand” guides the actions of both sellers and buyers through supply and demand, naturally directing the market towards efficiency. Today, in Morocco, instead of simply laws of supply and demand, the economy is also influenced by the government putting its thumb on the scale, distorting the market’s invisible hand. Such actions disrupt the notion of liberal economy by preventing smaller competitors from reaping the benefits of inefficiencies and mismanagement of the boycotted companies. As the failing companies lose their market shares and are forced out of the market, new smarter companies will emerge to meet the demands of the consumers by lowering their operating costs, increasing their profit margin without raising prices or compromising the quality of their products. As the boycott in Morocco progresses, both corporate and government officials in Morocco have demonstrated unconcern for consumers and constituents alike. Continuously failing communication strategies have pointed out the flaws in crisis communication, mitigation and risk management on both corporate and cabinet levels. An aggressive response to the boycott only spreads the message of the boycotters and exhibits the lack of foresight of these corporate and government officials in dealing with the boycott crisis.

Rabat – While Secretary-General of the National Rally of Independents Party (RNI) Aziz Akhannouch contested the ongoing boycott against exorbitant prices, the coordinator of the same party Abdelkader Tatou has acknowledged that prices may be too high for Moroccan customers. During a recent meeting of the RNI party, Abdelkader Tatou announced his support for the Moroccan boycott, blaming the government for not responding to the demands of citizens regarding high prices. RNI Secretary-General Akhannouch, made his stance against the boycott clear during the 13th annual International Forum for Agriculture (SIAM), held in Meknes just days after the launch of the boycott on April 20. Akhannouch, who is also the minister of agriculture and fisheries and owner of Afriquia gas, one of the three targeted companies, showed full support for Centrale Danone. He said publicly that the online campaign cannot stop 470,000 employees in the dairy sector and that citizens “should be thankful for the fact that there are no milk shortages and the product is available throughout the year.” Surprisingly, RNI party members applauded Tatou’s speech, which fully supported the boycott and even questioned that the campaign should generalize to include all products with high prices in the country. The RNI coordinator then criticized the government, led by Head of State Saad Eddine El Othmani, saying that if the government cannot shoulder responsibility “the way it should, then it should quit and let other people do it the right way.” There is no doubt that by “other people,” he was referring to his chief, Akhannouch, and his potential candidacy for the elections in 2020. To end his speech, Tatou said “long live the King, long live RNI, long live Akhannouch.” His comment sparked a backlash online. Not only for his “long live Akhannouch” comment, but for contradicting Akhannouch’s stance on the boycott campaign. The ongoing boycott also targets Sidi Ali mineral water company. The government have not made statements regarding Afriquia and Sidi Ali, but singled out Centrale Danone to defend it, emphasizing that the dairy company has at no time increased the prices of its milk products since 2013. Last Thursday, after the weekly government council meeting, Government Spokserperson Mustapha El Khalfi reacted to the boycott in a press conference.

Rabat- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan strongly denounced the Gaza massacre where the death toll of Palestinians by Israeli gunfire rose to 50 in one day, Monday, May 14. During a meeting with scholarship students of international news agency TRT World and Andalu News Agency in London, Erdogan condemned the mass murder, calling Israel a “terrorist state” and insisting that it has committed genocide: “What Israel has done is a genocide…I condemn this humanitarian drama, the genocide, from whichever side it comes, Israel or America,” according to the Independent. Erdogan added that this was not the first time that Israel has committed genocide, claiming it has done so since the creation of its state in 1948. Afterwards, Erdogan demonstrated his full support for Palestinians, saying that Turkey “will continue to stand with Palestinian people with determination.”  Erdogan pledged to deliver humanitarian aid and medical equipment to Gaza hospitals and to hold three days of mourning in Turkey for the slain Palestinians, beginning Tuesday. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to his official Twitter account on Tuesday, writing:“Erdogan is among Hamas’s biggest supporters and there is no doubt that he well understands terrorism and slaughter. I suggest that he not preach morality to us[.]” Erdogan is among Hamas’s biggest supporters and there is no doubt that he well understands terrorism and slaughter. I suggest that he not preach morality to us — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) May 15, 2018  At the same time, Erdogan recalled Turkey’s ambassadors to Israel and the US, as declared by Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag on Monday.

In the days leading up to the inauguration of the US Embassy on Monday approximately 35,000 Gazans joined the protests.

Rabat – Morocco’s Cherifien Office of Phosphates (OCP) has agreed to explore a joint venture with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) of the UAE to build two fertilizer production plants, one in Morocco and one in the UAE. The agreement follows a December deal in which ADNOC, the world’s greatest sulphur exporter, agreed to provide the resource to OCP, the world’s greatest sulphur importer.  The joint venture will assure the two firms’ global market reach and will accelerate the execution of both ADNOC and OCP’s international strategies. ADNOC CEO Dr. Sultan Al Jaber said, “The agreement builds on the expanded partnership model we announced last year, as we open our entire value chain to reliable, value-adding, long-term partners, who can complement our capabilities and resources, and enhance our market access.” ADNOC said the proposed joint venture will build on both companies’ competitive advantages. ADNOC specializes in sulphur production, ammonia, gas and shipping, while OCP has large phosphate resources, fertilizer expertise and a marketing network. The approach will enable ADNOC to increase its production by 50% from its current level of 7 million tons of sulphur a year, and hopes to increase both its gas production and sour gas production. OCP has engaged in a large-scale development program that will enable it to capture a share in the world’s growing demand for fertilizers. The first phase of the program was achieved this year and has brought the group’s existing fertilizer capacity to 12 million tons and its phosphate rock export capacity to over 18 million tons.

Rabat – Sustainable restoration of Morocco’s historic walled medinas (cities) was at the heart of a presentation ceremony, chaired by King Mohammed VI, at the Royal Palace of Rabat. The presentation discussed upgrading programs for four tourism destinations: Casablanca, Fez, Rabat and Marrakech. Morocco’s ministers, including Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit, presented the King with the programs and rehabilitation projects to promote four of the most renowned cities in the country, improve living conditions for inhabitants, to preserve architectural heritage, and to honor cultural wealth. During the ceremony, King Mohammed VI ordered the implementation of a third phase of the projects dedicated to repair buildings falling into ruin. The program is part of the MAD 300 million rehabilitation project of the old city of Casablanca. Projects in Rabat, “the City of Light, Moroccan Capital of Culture,” will restore ramparts, historic doors, mosques and zaouiyas (religious schools), and traditional hotels, as well as setting up green spaces and fixing other run-down buildings. Marrakech’s project, “City of Permanent Renewal,” was launched in 2014 and has been renovating the neighborhoods of El Mellah and Ezrayeb of the “Achouhada” Cemetery.  The projects are also developing tourist and spiritual tours of the old medina of Marrakech, Laftit added in his presentation. The minister added that the MAD 484 million Marrakech renovation program received a donation of MAD 150 million from the Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development. Fez has also benefited from several restoration programs. Laftit said that the programs are focusing on the rehabilitation of 27 historic hubs, including madrasas (schools), hotels, bridges and souks (markets). Fez’s MAD 583 million renovation program received a  MAD 100 million gift from the Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development. During the presentation, the minister said that King Mohammed VI ordered the third phase of the program dedicated to run-down buildings, as part of the rehabilitation program of the old medina of Casablanca, with a budget of MAD 300 million funded by the Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development. Following the presentation, Morocco’s Minister of Tourism and Handicrafts Mohamed Sajid said that the programs aim to reinforce the development dynamic experienced by these old medinas, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). During the same evening, King Mohammed VI chaired the signing ceremony of three partnerships and agreements for the upgrading programs of Marrakech, Fez, Rabat and a convention for the preparation of the third phase of the program for run-down buildings.

Rabat – When Moroccan sociologist Abdelkebir Khatibi wrote his sociological essay, “Maghreb Pluriel” (Plural Maghreb) in 1983, he sought to put forth a vision of a society built on the notion of multiplicity and “hybridity.” For Khatibi, Morocco and Moroccanness cannot be explored or conceived in fixated and monolithic terms. As Khatibi would later write in various other works (e.g. “La mémoire tatouée”), Morocco is essentially a site of multiplicities: it is plural, diverse, and chaotic; it has never been either monocultural or monolingual. So, too, thought the majority, if not all, of the participants in the fourteenth International Festival of Amazigh Culture which took place last weekend at the Merinides Hotel in Fez. The festival, which kicked off on Friday, April 11, seeks to celebrate Amazigh identity and popular culture, in relation with Morocco and the notion of Moroccanness amidst today’s changing and shifting notions of citizenship and nationality. On the second day of the festival, on April 12, a wide-ranging panel of experts—including historians, poets, anthropologists, political scientists, and activists—gathered to explore Amazigh culture and the ways it can serve as an incubator for a more inclusive, egalitarian, and democratic Morocco. What is Amazigh identity? What does it mean to be Moroccan today? How can culture and the recognition of minority rights foster and consolidate democracy in Morocco? And, perhaps more importantly, what is the future of Morocco’s still ongoing democratic experience? These were, among many others, the central questions that the festival’s different panels tried to explore and tackle. Democracy and Amazigh identity Discussing the theme of “Amazhité, citizenship, and democratic culture,” the panelists brought a diversity of opinions. Appraising Morocco’s experience with democracy and social inclusion, many of them provided guidelines and propositions to spur a vibrant democratic experience in the years to come. Though they spoke from starkly different intellectual, social and cultural spectra, their recurrent theme or shared belief remained the necessity of recognizing and integrating differences in the public and national discourses. For democracy to be fully consolidated, they argued, shared ideals and social values are as important as the acknowledgement of difference and contradiction in the public sphere. Speaking about the challenges of a “democratic public sphere,” Driss Maghraoui, associate professor at the Al Akhawayn University School of Humanities and Social Sciences, said that “in the making of democracy, citizenship must be rethought in Morocco.” He argued that to rethink citizenship includes accommodating cultural differences in how politics is approached and lived. He went on to propose the notion of “cultural and social citizenship,” arguing that a working democracy relies on its ability to “encourage multiple stories and carve out spaces for multiple voices in the public sphere.” Each segment of society should be given space to express its grievances and aspirations. George Joffé, a MENA region specialist at the department of Politics and International Relations at Cambridge University talked about “insurgent citizenship” and the challenges of democratic consolidation. Exploring these difficulties, he underlined the importance of the rule of law, saying that “democracy is a set of rules” by which everyone in a nation or country should abide: regulations and laws should be equally applied to any member in a given political community. “Down that road,” he suggested, speaking about democratic challenges, “there lie very dangerous choices.” Multiculturalism and mutual trust Quoting what he called “a recent World Bank study,” renowned linguist Moha Ennaji said: “To enrich itself, Morocco needs democratic and egalitarian policies.” Mr. Ennaji further mentioned what he called “immaterial capital,” noting that culture and cultural citizenship cannot be taken out of the democratic equation. But he also proposed the inclusion of civil society and other non-state actors as vital actors in the materialization of a well functioning and full-fledged Moroccan democracy. Alberto Tonini, professor of international history at the University of Florence, talked about prerequisites for the emergence and the survival of democracy. For Mr. Tonini, despite differences in national democratic expression, three factors are universally needed for any democracy to work: awareness, participation, and mutual trust. In this regard, the Italian suggested, being aware of your rights as a citizen, participating in public life, and “trusting the other players of the democratic game” are elements without which no democracy can prosper. Moreover, democracy needs shared values, a common ground, mutual social confidence, and an understanding that the “winners” (majority) of elections have a solemn obligation to respect and protect the rights and interests of the losers (minority). “If I do not trust the rules of the game or the motives of the other players, how can I join the game?” the Italian asked, suggesting the crucial importance of mutual social trust. Other speakers mentioned the significance of history. They presented Amazigh culture as the foundation of Moroccan history and civilization, saying that Morocco needs to reconnect with its own history and devise a political culture based on multiculturalism and the acceptance of diverse notions of Moroccanness. They said that Moroccanness today should be defined on the basis of an expansive and “institutionalized citizenship,” one that accommodates disagreements, makes room for diverging interests and sensitivities, and amplifies the voices and stories of those who have been marginalized and left out. Through different experiences and perspectives, participants agreed that, without a sincere commitment to public dialogue, contestation, and inclusiveness, democracy dies.

Montana, 33, has been pursuing a successful career. The native of Casablanca recently released a new track called “Corazon” on Maître Gims’ new album, featuring the Congolese rapper himself and rap sensation Lil Wayne. His career aside, Montana is also dedicating himself to help the community. Last month, the Moroccan-American hip hop recording artist opened up to DIRECTV about his volunteer work in Uganda, where he helped two associations, Mama Hope and Global Citizen, to improve the public health situation. During his time, he visited a hospital where he met women and children without healthcare. With the help of superstars P. Diddy and The Weeknd, he raised over $500,000 to benefit the Suubi Health Center in Uganda. Montana continues his service in his hometown Casablanca, through his work with the PanAfrican Movement and CARE Morocco, which ensures that the children of Casablanca have full access to a quality education and healthcare. Born in Morocco as Karim Kharbouch, French Montana spent the first 13 years of his life in Morocco before immigrating to the US with his family. His love of Morocco, though, is never hidden.  Throughout his career, French Montana has collaborated with big hip-hop names such as Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and Ne-Yo. Released in 2012, his first single, “Pop That,” was certified platinum within weeks. His album “Excuse My French,” distributed the following year, propelled French Montana to the forefront of the scene across the Atlantic.

Ouhssata, a member of Morocco’s Authenticity and Modernity (PAM) party won the election, joining the important committee of the African Union (AU) Consultative Assembly, with 11 votes. The Justice and Human Rights Commission is one of PAP’s most important organs, whose recommendations and decisions are submitted to the AU. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the AU body was exploited by the members of the  Polisario Front, who were using their position to pass decisions hostile to Morocco’s territorial integrity. Morocco’s accession to the Commission on Justice and Human Rights will help thwart the separatist group’s attempts, said Ouhssata. She told the press that the election will also allow Morocco to be represented in the PAP. Morocco’s membership at the Pan-African Parliament aims to reinforce the country’s position in Africa.   It will also serve as a new dimension for Morocco’s contribution to the political, legislative, and economic development of the continent.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI hailed the efforts of Royal Armed Forces (FAR) on its 62nd anniversary, in a congratulatory letter to FAR officers on Monday. In his message, King Mohammed VI expressed his high regard for the efforts demonstrated by FAR through the year and applauded their dedication to their duties and good nationwide reputation, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat – As outrage over exorbitant commodity prices continues, the Ministry of the Interior has announced the launch of a new hotline to register citizen complaints specifically related to consumer products. Starting May 15, anyone with a Moroccan phone number will be able to dial 5757 to voice consumer complaints to their local or provincial prefecture in charge of consumer and market satisfaction. The launch date is a mere day prior to the predicted start date of Ramadan. For the cost of a phone call to a fixed number, citizens can call the hotline anytime between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (the same hours apply throughout Ramadan) to submit their comments and complaints related to a wide range of consumer topics, including food safety, storage, quality, and official statistics, such as price margins. Citizens concerned with market monopolization and corrupt business practices can also call the 5757 hotline to report their issues. The release of the new consumer hotline arrives as the ongoing boycott campaign against Sidi Ali (Oulmès) water, Afriquia gasoline, and Centrale Danone dairy products threatens to continue into the holy month of Ramadan, which is set to begin Thursday, May 17. The continuation of the boycott would yield significant losses, especially for the Centrale Danone company, which typically experiences its peak consumption demand during the holy month. The boycott has received widespread support from the Moroccan public, including several Moroccan celebrities, such as Dounia Batma, Saida Charaf, Rachid El Idrissi, Latifa Raafat, Abd El Fattah Grini, and Asmae Lmnawar. Meanwhile, several government officials have denounced the boycott, calling it “fake news” and voicing concern for the small dairy farmers that are suppliers of Centrale Danone. Sidi Ali is the most recent company to release a statement, in which it reiterates the company’s commitment to keeping prices low and points to high taxes as its primary obstacle to price cuts.

By Intissar Faouzi Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, and Scientific Research has implemented the anti-fraud law and installed cameras for baccalaureate candidates’ final exam. While thousands are studying hard to take the test, there are always those who choose to cheat. The Ministry of Education will continue its fight against all attempts at cheating with the installation of cameras. Each candidate caught with a smartphone, tablet, or any other tool of communication will also be punished. A source in the ministry reported that each year before the exam, the ministry sets up scanners and cameras to detect cheating and prevents candidates from doing so. However, the measure is not implemented in all exam centers in Morocco,  as it is expensive to put cameras in every classroom. The ministry has not abandoned traditional methods of preventing students from cheating: before each exam, candidates are obliged to sign a commitment confirming that they will respect all exam rules and asserting that they are aware of the consequences of cheating. The objective of the camera installations is to sensitize students and create an atmosphere of equality between candidates. The ministry also hopes to impact parents who encourage their children to cheat by buying them the most developed electronic gadgets. The Ministry of Education warns students every year that any student who is caught cheating could be prevented from taking exams for two years and sentenced to prison for six months to five years.

Rabat – Munir El Haddadi is officially out of the competition. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has delivered its verdict, destroying El Haddadi’s dream of wearing the national team’s colors for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The CAS rejected the request of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) in a hearing held on Monday, without providing an explanation. “The CAS panel in charge of arbitration held a hearing in Lausanne today. After deliberating, the Panel issued its decision, without the grounds. The reasoned award with the grounds will be issued in due course,” the CAS wrote in a statement.  Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, El Haddadi represented Spain at the youth level and made a brief appearance as a substitute in an international game against Macedonia with the Spanish national team in 2014. Unfortunately, his substitute appearance may have ruined his chance to represent the Moroccan national football team, according to the FIFA eligibility committee. For months, the FRMF has been attempting to convince the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) to give the 22-year-old the right to represent Morocco. Back in November, the dual Spanish-Moroccan athlete visited FIFA officials in person to appeal that they “defend the rights of binational players.” However, the FIFA Players’ Status Committee rejected El Haddadi’s request to play with the Atlas Lions. FRMF and El Haddadi decided then to appeal to the CAS.   El Haddadi currently plays for the Spanish club Alaves, where he is on loan for the 2017-2018 period.

Rabat – Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis is expected to land in Morocco on Wednesday to hold bilateral talks with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita. During his visit, Dastis will address issues of mutual interest for both countries, including trade, tourism, immigration policies and measures against terrorism, Spanish news agency Europa Press reported. Dastis paid his first foreign visit to Morocco in February 2017, when he held talks with Morocco’s former Minister of Foreign Affairs Salaheddine Mezouar. In a statement made to the press after the meeting, Dastis said “Spain and Morocco have exemplary relations at all levels.” Spain is among Morocco’s main European trade customers in terms of total exports, which increased by 11.2 percent over the past year. Data from the European Statistical Office published in February shows that Spain has been a primary export destination and an importer of Moroccan goods since 2012. In 2017, electrical materials were Morocco’s main export to Spain, making up 29.3 percent of the northbound trade between the countries. Electrical materials are followed by clothes at 23.1 percent, and mollusks and crustaceans at 8.1 percent. Morocco and Spain also have a strong cooperation in the fight against terrorism. On May 9, Spanish Minister of Interior Juan Ignacio Zoido underscored the efficiency of Moroccan-Spanish security cooperation following the arrest of a five-member cell with alleged connections to ISIS in north Morocco and Spain. “I would like to congratulate Moroccan security services for the anti-terrorism operation, which was crowned today by the arrest of five alleged terrorists who belong to a cell meant to perpetrate attacks in Spain and Europe,” said the Spanish minister.

Rabat – Candide Renard, daughter of Morocco’s national football coach Hervé Renard, was allegedly a victim of a sexual assault during her participation in the French reality TV show “Koh Lanta,” which took place on the Fiji Islands. The suspect was arrested and released after new evidence was discovered. Was Candide Renard sexually assaulted? Here’s what we know so far. The scandal came to light on Friday, May 12, when French TV channel TF1 released a statement canceling its famous adventurous show “Koh Lanta” because of “something that happened between two contestants.” According to Le Parisien, the alleged sexual assault took place on Tuesday night, at the end of the fourth day of filming of the new season of “Koh-Lanta.” In the middle of the night, Candide Renard, 21, set off the emergency walkie-talkie to warn the production, as the rules of the game authorize its use in case of danger. Renard stated that she was a victim of sexual assault. Immediately, the young woman was cared for by the show’s psychologist. The accused was immediately detained. No witnesses were present at the time of the alleged assault. It is impossible at the moment to confirm or refute them. The two protagonists were isolated from the game and placed in separate hotels. Renard flew back to France on Sunday. According to the same source, Hervé Renard reacted to the news, saying that there would be an investigation. The suspect, whose name was revealed as Eddy Guyot, flew back to France on Monday, May 14. When he got off the plane at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, he was greeted by the police and transferred to SDPJ Seine-Saint-Denis, to deliver his version of events. The 34-year-old contestant was placed in police custody and released less than twelve hours later, according to French magazine Closer, as new evidence emerged. Other contestants said that Candide Renard and Eddy Guyot were not isolated, but  were with two other candidates at the time. Also, a witness contradicted Renard’s version, claiming he did not witness Guyot touching or attempting to touch Candide.  Candide Renard first appeared on television last November in the sport show Telefoot to surprise the of her father who was invited. She first made the headlines when several media reported that she was physically assaulted at the end of a Morocco-Cote d’Ivoire match last November, following a video posted online that portrayed a young woman being placed on a stretcher. Following the story, Hervé Renard told Jeune Afrique that his daughter had not been targeted personally.

After meeting football superstars Iniesta, Eto’o, and Messi, the Moroccan football fan has flown to Las Vegas to secure Gad El Maleh’s endorsement for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. For his challenge of “meeting 26 celebrities in 26 days in 26 countries,” Abid is traveling with a half-deflated balloon–representing “Moroccans’ state of mind”–and wants to inflate Moroccans’ hopes and the balloon with the breath of the personalities he will meet to promote Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. French-Moroccan comedian Gad Elmaleh was the first Moroccan celebrity to donate his “breath.” “Faithful to himself and his attachment to Morocco, Gad Elmaleh is the fifth celebrity to join the #Maymkench2026 Challenge!”Saad Abid wrote on his Facebook page, sharing the video of his meeting with Elmaleh. The meeting, organized in Las Vegas by HitRadio host Momo, was an opportunity for Abid to introduce the funny side of his challenge. Abid had a very interesting chat with the humorist, who was preparing for his show at Comedy Cellar. The comedian, who spoke in a mixture of English, Arabic, and French,  expressed his pride as a Moroccan and of being a part of Abid’s crazy journey, saying that he will “always be there for his country.” Elmaleh signed the balloon and nominated Zinedine Zidane for the initiative. For the 6th day of his challenge, Abid was also supposed to meet Moroccan producer RedOne in Los Angeles, but he has not yet posted the video. Through his promotional campaign, Abid hopes to rally “symbolic but not official” international support for Morocco in order to give more weight to its candidacy.

Rabat- While Israelis in Jerusalem celebrate the new US embassy’s inauguration, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has doubled, as protests against the US embassy move continue. The Gaza protests began on Friday, May 11, in opposition to US President Trump’s decision to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The protests were met with Israeli gunfire from throughout the weekend into Monday, May 14. On Saturday, May 12, over 150 protesters were wounded and four were killed, including a 15-year-old boy, according to the Independent. So far, death toll of Palestinian protesters killed by Israeli soldiers along the Gaza Strip border has risen to 41–including several teenagers–while at least 1,900 protesters have been injured, as reported by the Gaza Health Ministry.  In line with Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, the US embassy officially relocates to Jerusalem today. In the days leading up to the inauguration, protests erupted along Gaza border, including approximately 35,000 Gazans. According to the New York Times, the Israeli military has testified that some of the crowds of protesters planted explosives, adding that emergency men also hurried to extinguish a spreading wildfire. No Israeli injuries or deaths have been reported thus far. The current protests coincide with the anniversary of the Nakba (“Catastrophe”), which marks the mass expulsions of Palestinians in conjunction with the creation of the state of Israel. Approximately 700,000 Palestinians died during the event, nearly 70 years ago, in 1948. On Sunday in Rabat, protests emerged in support of the Palestinian people and denunciation of Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israeli capital Meanwhile, the inauguration of US embassy’s opening in Jerusalem is moving forward as planned. Around 32 of 86 envoys participated in the inauguration attended by US president Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her Jewish husband Jared Kushner. According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, a delegation arrived earlier today, with representatives from Albania, Angola, Austria, Cameroon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Kenya, Macedonia, Burma, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Romania, Rwanda, Serbia, South Sudan, Thailand, Ukraine, Vietnam, Paraguay, Tanzania, and Zambia.

Rabat – In a new letter addressed to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, King Mohammed VI has once again expressed his serious concerns over the US embassy move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The King wrote in his letter addressed to the Palestinian leader on Monday: “We follow with deep concern the implementation of the US Administration’s decision to recognize Al-Quds as the capital of Israel and to move its embassy there.” The letter came amid the US embassy inauguration ceremony planned for today in the presence of a US delegation. Waves of mass protests in the Gaza Strip continue in opposition to the US decision. Israeli law enforcement has responded violently to the protests, killing at least  41 Palestinians and wounded 1900 others, including 27 critically on Monday. The King, who is also the Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, said that he has reiterated to US President Donald Trump and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres the “extreme importance of the city of Al-Quds,” not only for the parties to the conflict, but for all three Abrahamic religions. The monarch then reiterated Morocco’s rejection of the US embassy move and its decision to recognize the city as the capital city of Israel. “We reiterate our rejection of this unilateral act contrary to the will expressed continuously by the international community, through Security Council resolutions,” said the King. The said resolutions warn against any actions that would undermine the legal and historical status of the holy city. The King also reaffirmed his firm commitment to work with the US administration to adopt a “balanced” stance that will revive the peace process between the parties to the conflict. “We will spare no effort in mobilizing the international community and its forces to  triumph over the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent state, with Al-Quds as its capital.” The King concluded his letter, expressing Morocco’s full solidarity with Palestinian people for the defense of their just cause, “especially with regard to the city of Al-Quds.” Trump announced his decision to recognize Jerusalem as capital of Israel and to move the state’s embassy to the area on December 6. His decision received backlash from the international community, with Arab leaders, including King Mohammed VI, rejecting the announcement. The monarch sent a letter to the US president on the eve of the decision, stressing how such a move would undermine peace negotiations in the region. The King also sent a letter to Guterres, in which he expressed his deep concern over Trump’s decision and emphasized that such an action would end peace negotiations between the two states.

Rabat – Algeria’s denial tour continues, as the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly denies its responsibility in the Polisario-Hezbollah collusion. In the last few weeks, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been pointing fingers at its eastern neighbor after its decision to cut ties with Iran over the “proven” support of Hezbollah for the Polisario Front. Last week, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita accused Algeria of directly supporting Hezbollah-Polisario collusion. Bourita, in an interview with Jeune Afrique, said Algeria has backed the collusion by “giving an opening, backing, and operational support.” “Some meetings between the Polisario and Hezbollah were held in a secret Algiers hideout, ” he added, Bourita also presented Tehran with a detailed document containing evidence of the country’s collusion. Spokesperson for the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abdelaziz Benali Cherif underplayed Algeria’s role in the ongoing tension, saying “instead of producing the ‘irrefutable’ proof that he claims to hold, the Moroccan minister has chosen the track of mystification and fabrication.” Quoted by French news agency AFP, Cherif added that Algeria “wishes to express its strong condemnation and total rejection of the irresponsible remarks made against it.” The Algerian official called Morocco’s accusations “unfounded and unjustified,” describing Morocco’s stance as a “virulent campaign” against Algeria. Algeria and Iran have continued to deny their involvement.  However, Bourita stated that Morocco “would not have bothered to submit a file to Tehran if its [evidence] was not solid.” “The file was carefully prepared, for weeks, on the basis of information collected and cross-checked over several months,” said Bourita, adding that the document summarizes “proven and precise facts: dates of visits by senior officers of Hezbollah in Algeria, dates and venues of meetings with Polisario officials, and a list of names of agents involved in these contacts.” The file presented to Tehran includes the names of officials who traveled to Tindouf camps to meet the Polisario Front and to oversee training sessions. According to Bourita, the list includes: Haidar Sobhi Habib, chief of Hezbollah’s external operations; Ali Moussa Dakdouk, military advisor to Hezbollah; and Haj Abou Wael Zalzali, head of military training and logistics. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already made its stance clear on Algeria’s denial. On May 3, the ministry dismissed Algeria’s attempt to distance itself, asserting that it “understands Algeria’s embarrassment,” especially regarding the evidence that Morocco demonstrated to show the connection between the parties.

Rabat – Over 15,000 Palestinian protesters rallied along the Gaza Strip’s border with Israel on Friday against the US decision to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday. The Palestinian Gaza protests began peacefully on Friday, but Israeli gunfire later killed four Palestinians, including a 15-year old boy, and wounded over 150 on Saturday, according to the Independent. According to the BBC, Israeli soldiers have killed 40 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since the launch of the “March of Return.”  On Sunday, activists in Rabat protested in support of the Palestinian people to denounce the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The National Action Group for Palestine Support and the Moroccan Association of Solidarity on the Palestinian Question organized the march. Activists in Jordan and Turkey also stormed the streets on Friday, protesting the US embassy move that is scheduled to take place May 14, the anniversary of the creation of the Israeli state, also widely known as the Nakba (Catastrophe) across the Arab world .. The number of protesters in Palestine is expected to double in the next few days, as the move and the Nakba draw near. Many Israelis have also warned their government about the threat the US decision poses. According to Jerusalem Post, Israeli demonstrators marched around Jerusalem’s streets Saturday night, denouncing the Flag March, planned for Monday, and the US embassy move. Activists from Israeli movements, including Standing Together and Peace Now, chanted slogans against the Israeli government, calling on Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. “Peace is worth more,” protesters said. Suf Patishi, a member of Standing Together, told the Jerusalem Post that the US move and the Flag March will escalate tensions in the region. Patishi said, “We are saying here in a clear voice that Jerusalem belongs to the people who live in it – Jews and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians.”  Patishi added that “whoever loves Jerusalem will not move the embassy just for political gain.” The activist denounced the US decision to relocate its embassy asserting that it would “only  put [his] life at risk.” “I would like to see moves that will make our lives better, for both Israelis and Palestinians,” he added. In December, US President Donald Trump shocked the world with his decision to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing the city as Israel’s capital. International leaders, including King Mohammed VI, British Prime Minister Theresa May, and French President Emmanuel Macron, denounced the declaration.  Despite global condemnation, Trump is standing firm behind his decision. Earlier this month, signs were put up in Jerusalem indicating the direction to the old US consulate building, which will house the new US embassy. The move came amid an ongoing escalation in Gaza between Palestine and Israel.

Rabat – Morocco’s Counter-Terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) arrested four suspects with alleged ties to the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) in Casablanca, Fez, Kenitra, and Driouch Monday morning. Moroccan news outlet 2M.ma said the four suspects were not connected to each other, but they were all connected with the terrorist group Daesh, also known as ISIS. The suspects were aged 20-27. The first suspect, an unemployed 20-year old, was arrested in Driouch, a town 90 kilometers southeast of El Hoceima. The second suspect was arrested in Casablanca. The third suspect, a 27-year old, was arrested in Fez, where he had been living with his wife for only a month. The final suspect, a 21-year old undergraduate, was arrested in Kenitra. Authorities seized several electronic devices and military uniforms during the operation. The suspects were placed in custody for further investigation to determine possible links with ISIS. The arrests mark the fourth terrorist crackdown in Morocco recently, after last week’s arrest of five suspects and the dismantling of 2 terrorist cells in February and March. On May 8, BCIJ dismantled a five-member terror cell with alleged connections to Daesh in North Morocco and Spain.  The BCIJ and Spanish authorities carried out the arrest operations in Fnideq, a city in northern Morocco, and in Bilbao in northern Spain. On February 21, the BCIJ dismantled a terror cell made up of six extremist supporters of ISIS in Tangier, including one member of the Polisario Front. In March, BCIJ dismantled another terror cell in the cities of Oued Zem, near Khouribga, and Tangier. Investigations revealed that the members were planning to murder one of their own after doubting his loyalty to the terrorist organization.

Rabat – Hind Bensari has been awarded “Best International Documentary Award” in Toronto for her documentary “We Could Be Heroes,” making her the first African filmmaker to receive the distinction. The 31-year old producer premiered her documentary “We Could Be Heroes” as part of the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary at the Toronto Film Festival, which took place April 27-May 6.   “We Could Be Heroes” is a story about  Azzedine Nouiri, Moroccan world champion in seated shot-put, who inspires his childhood friend Youssef to take on the challenge of qualifying for the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games despite their lack of means and formal training. Through this inspiring friendship, the documentary narrates the struggles of outcasts wanting to conquer the extraordinary in order to achieve the same rights and opportunities as ordinary athletes in Morocco. Born in Casablanca, Hind Bensari grew up in London where she graduated with a degree in economics and Middle-Eastern studies from Edinburgh University and received a degree in development studies from the London School of Economics. Bensari quit her job at an investment fund to return to Morocco and produce her first documentary “475: Break the Silence” in 2014. The movie received critical acclaim from “The New York Times” and Germany’s ARD channel. It broke the season’s audience record at 2M TV in Morocco and has been broadcast on channels worldwide including Denmark, Portugal, Canada. More importantly, her debut film was part of a civil society movement that pressured the government to repeal a law that allowed rapists to marry their victims and avoid prosecution. “The video started with Article 475 translated into English. I then explained that I was in the process of questioning and that I wanted to understand why Morocco came to privilege the rapist’s rescue or marriage to the integrity of a girl. I also said that I wanted to make a documentary to ask questions of people and experts to better understand this problem,” Bensari said to Media24.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid has asked Moroccan citizens to suspend their boycott of Centrale Danone, one of the three companies targeted due to “unjustified” price increases in Morocco. Ramid made his comments on the boycott on the Saturday television program, “Une heure pour convaincre” (one hour to convince) that aired Moroccan channel Medi1tv. Defending Centrale Danone, Ramid said that the “milk boycott will be very detrimental for small milk producers” working for the dairy company. The minister said that he does not need to provide proof of the damage caused to small farmers due to the boycott. Rather, he invited boycotters to visit  “Doukkala [a rural region in west-central Morocco] and ask local farmers if they could sell their products, should the company targeted by the boycott [Danone] closes.” The boycott, according to Ramid, arrived in conjunction with the spring peak yield in milk production. “That is why I am asking Moroccans, who have always been known for their wisdom and rationality, to suspend the boycott of milk.” According to Ramid, the boycott of milk has a “direct impact on the most fragile layers of the company.” Ramid then echoed statements made by both spokesperson of the government Mustapha El Khalfi and the Centrale Danone company. He said that the profits of the concerned company are low, making it impossible to further low its prices.  He also commented on the #let_it_spoit hashtag launched by the boycotters on April 20, at the beginning of the campaign. “It is nice to let it spoil.” However, the minister raised the question whether this campaign will damage the company’s interest or the local farmers.  “When I was little, I used to help my father, who was in charge of a dairy cooperative, during my vacation, and I can tell you today that if the boycott continues, it is possible that it will impact on small producers, whose weekly income is around MAD 200.” On Thursday after the weekly government council meeting, El Khalfi reacted to the boycott in a press conference. The minister called the profit margins of the company “reasonable.” He also called on the government to review its current speech law “because no one can accept misinformation that can damage the reputation of the country and its economy.” The boycott also targets Sidi Ali mineral water company and Afriquia gasoline, two Moroccan giants that are widely considered to maintain a monopoly in their respective markets.  The government’s response, however, singled out the Centrale Danone boycott specifically, calling on supporters of the campaign to end the boycott for the sake of local farmers.

Rabat – Algeria may be convinced that it has no responsibility in the Western Sahara conflict, but for Morocco, its eastern neighbor has always failed to shoulder its role in the decades-long regional conflict.  In an interview with the France-based magazine Jeune Afrique, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, discussed all of the recent development in the conflict, as well as Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran. Bourita started his interview by discussing Algeria’s denial of its status as the main party to the ongoing conflict over Western Sahara. According to Bourita, “nobody in his right mind” could believe that the Western Sahara conflict can be solved without Algeria.  Over the years, Morocco has been urging the United Nations to urge Algeria to participate in the UN-led political process. This year, Morocco escalated its rhetoric and called on the United Nations to pressure Algeria, as its separatist ally, Polisario, has increased its illegal actions east of Morocco’s defense wall.  On April 4, King Mohammed VI addressed an urgent letter to the United Nations, emphasizing that “it is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario.” In his interview, Bourita recalled a paragraph added in the latest Security Council resolution 2414, which calls on Algeria to contribute more to the political process and to “strengthen its commitment to the negotiations.” Algeria Will Create More Troubles “Morocco knows that Algeria will remain stubborn, rejecting its role in the regional conflict,” he said. Bourita said that the country is expecting more problems from its eastern neighbor. “As we know them, they will certainly create other problems in the region and beyond.”  He added that Algeria is still working to “mislead the public,” referring to both the Algerian and international public, through its media claims that the resolution was in favor of Algeria itself. The minister added that Algeria continues to cover up its political, social, and economic crises by creating problems and tensions to “distract Algerians from their real concerns.” He emphasized that Morocco has long called on Algeria to discuss the Moroccan-Algerian border issue, with the aim of reopening the border, regardless of the status of the Western Sahara conflict.  Algeria Backs Hezbollah-Polisario Collusion In his interview, Bourita also discussed Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran because of its interference in Morocco’s domestic affairs.  The Moroccan official pointed that Algeria has backed the collusion between Hezbollah and Polisario. He said that some meetings between the separatist front and its Iranian proxy Hezbollah were held secretly with Algeria ’s knowledge. He added that Algeria is eagerly trying to push out Polisario from the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria to clear its responsibility as the country that shelters the “regionally destabilizing separatist group.” On May 1, Morocco decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran, as Morocco presented evidence of collusion between Polisario and Hezbollah, specifically proof that the “Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has provided the separatist group with weapons and training in the Tindouf camps in Algeria.” While Algeria, Iran, and Polisario denied any involvement, Bourita said in his interview that Morocco “would not have bothered to submit a file to Tehran if it [evidence] was not solid.” “The file was carefully prepared, for weeks, on the basis of information collected and cross-checked over several months,” said Bourita, adding that the document summarizes “proven and precise facts: dates of visits by senior officers of Hezbollah in Algeria, dates and venues of meetings with Polisario officials, and a list of names of agents involved in these contacts.”  Bourita added that Morocco did not make any move until all elements were studied, verified, and confirmed. In the document sent to Iran, the minister also unveiled the names of senior Hezbollah officers who have traveled Tindouf since March 2017 to meet Polisario leaders, and oversee training sessions and the construction of facilities. The list of the officials includes: Haidar Sobhi Habib, chief of Hezbollah’s external operations; Ali Moussa Dakdouk, military advisor to Hezbollah; and Haj Abou Wael Zalzali, head of military training and logistics, he added stressing that Algeria has a hand in the recent tension between Iran and Morocco, Bourita said that the Iranian embassy in  Algiers served as a liaison between Hezbollah, Algeria, and Polisario, through its “cultural advisor” Amir Moussawi. Recently, Algerian activists and officials have urged Algeria to expel the Iranian cultural attaché for his alleged suspicious activities in the country. The animosity against the Iranian official escalated after Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran. Denouncing the collusion between Hezbollah and Polisario and Algeria and Hezbollah’s support for this action, Morocco said that the government “understands Algeria’s embarrassment,” especially regarding the documented proof that demonstrates the connection between the parties.

Rabat – Renowned investigative journalist Alain Jourdan has published a book that praises Morocco as a regional bulwark against global terrorism. Titled “Le Maroc sur la ligne de front” (Morocco on the Frontline), the book documents the inner workings of Morocco’s intelligence and field operation services, tackling the country’s remarkable success in thwarting terrorist plots both in Morocco and in Europe. “Most of the people involved in terrorist acts are not necessarily Moroccans, but we always hear foreign governments thank Morocco for its support [in the anti-terrorism fight],” the journalist remarked when asked what motivated him to write on the subject. Be it the US, France, Germany, or even Belgium, the journalist writes, “almost everyone acknowledges the effectiveness of Morocco’s intelligence units, namely in the fight against ISIS or Al Qaeda.” It is this paradox—Morocco leading the fight against terrorism—he continues, that gave birth to this book, as  Jourdan said he wanted to comprehend what Morocco does to earn the respect and validation of so many foreign governments. Meticulously documenting the North African country’s invaluable contribution to both deradicalization and intelligence sharing, Alain Jourdan relates specific incidents in which intelligence shared by Morocco helped thwart terrorist attacks in Europe or helped police arrest perpetrators after an. “When the Bataclan attacks took place, Morocco provided a lot of information that led to many arrests,” Jourdan remarked. He adds that the efficacy and proven reliability of Morocco’s intelligence has established the kingdom as a noted leader in the global effort against terrorism, putting the North African country on the “diplomatic frontline.” Jourdan also shed light on how the creation of the Central Bureau of Judiciary Investigation (BCIJ) has considerably improved the country’s global reputation, especially considering that “investigations and arrests are now made or conducted within a legal framework respectful of basic human rights.” In addition to the impressive work done by its intelligence and field operation units, however, another equally significant element in Morocco’s success in the anti-terrorism battle is the country’s tradition of “tolerant” and “open” Islam. Although Salafis represent 20 percent of Morocco’s religious life, Jourdan points out, “most Moroccan mosques preach an open and middle-way Islam. Besides, the country has always been a cradle of multiculturalism.”

Rabat – Morocco’s United Nations Permanent Ambassador Omar Hilale underscored Morocco’s plans to promote development in Western Sahara, emphasizing that socio-economic progress “should not be held hostage by the political process.” For more than 30 years, Morocco has been increasing its efforts to enhance further progress and to empower local residents. During the United Nations C24 regional seminar, held on May 9-11 in the Caribbean country, Grenada, Hilale reaffirmed that the Western Sahara conflict remains a question of national unity and territorial integrity for all Moroccans. In his statement to the seminar, Hilale emphasized that the region was neglected before its “return to the homeland in 1975.” “Morocco has made important public investments,” he said, to serve the region at different levels, including infrastructure, industry; services, agriculture, health, education, and tourism. The official added that the aspects of human development in the region are “higher than the national average and have enabled the opening up and upgrading of the Saharan provinces.” Hilale also discussed King Mohammed VI’s development plan for the region, which launched in 2015 with a budget of nearly USD 8 billion. Morocco’s regional development plan has enabled local inhabitants to take care of their domestic affairs in a “democratic, participatory and inclusive way,” he said. Hilale also expressed that Morocco is committed to the UN-political process on the basis of Security Council resolutions since 2007. The ambassador concluded his statement, underscoring the importance of the recent Security Council resolution 2414, adopted on April 28. The resolution, according to Hilale, reaffirmed the parameters of the political solution, which “must be pragmatic, realistic and compromise.” The resolution also obliged the Polisario Front to withdraw from the region immediately and to stop its maneuvers that could hinder and destabilize the region. The UN also urged Polisario’s main backer, Algeria, to not shrink from its duty to contribute to the political process and find a mutually acceptable solution to end the 40-year conflict over the region.

Rabat- Goalkeeper of Swedish Uppsala Women’s Football team, Ronja Andersson recently announced her conversion to Islam. Years of thorough research about Islam have proved fruitful for 19-year-old keeper Anderson, who came to accept prophet Muhammed peace be upon him as Allah’s messenger and announce her religious conversion to the public. In an interview with National Swedish newspaper Expressen, Andersson expressed devotion to her new faith, saying that she is proud to be a Muslim despite the hate she received from certain people: “They are full of prejudice against me… I was also exposed to hatred,” she said. Anderson said that her friend introduced her to Islam when she was 15 years old. Ever since, she started to learn more about the religion, which helped her see it with new eyes: “I discovered that there were so many nice things that attracted me. I then began to attend religious events, and went to the mosque,” she added. Anderson maintained that after her conversion to Islam she realized how “beautiful” a religion it is, and that she is now preparing to do her first Ramadan fast. According to Muslim Council of Sweden, around 350,000 citizens are registered Muslims, including nominal Muslims and those from Muslim background. Meanwhile, a 2009 US report revealed that around 450,000 to 500,000 Muslims live in Sweden. According to a Pew Research Center survey released in 2015, there are 1.8 billion Muslims in the world, making up 24 percent of world population. The report also predicts that the Muslim population will grow further in European countries in the coming years, given the factor of the increasing migration rate from Muslim countries.

Rabat – The Moroccan football team’s excellent performance in the 2018 World Cup qualifying games are still making international headlines. Nearly eight months after the qualifying games, FIFA said that the best defensive record came from Morocco. On Friday, FIFA published a list of the teams that boasted the best records in the qualifying games for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Unsurprisingly, the Atlas Lions made the list of the  “defensive heroes hoping for [a] Russian repeat” published by FIFA. FIFA commended the Moroccan team’s near-miraculous defensive records that secured its ticket for the much-awaited World Cup tournament, which will kick off June 14. FIFA has named Morocco’s Munir Mohand Mohamedi as one of the best goalkeepers in Africa. FIFA also ranked Moroccan football team captain Mehdi Benatia the best defender on the continent. Moreover, Morocco emerged as the team with the best defense in the world. While it scored 11 goals in 6 games, the national team did not concede a single goal. When the tournament begins on June 14, Morocco will play against its first game against Iran on June 15. Morocco’s second game will be against Portugal on June 20 and the third against Spain on June 25. 2018 is the fifth time Morocco qualified for the World Cup after Mexico 1970, Mexico 1986, United States 1994, and France 1998. In Mexico 1986, Morocco became the first African and Arab team to qualify to the second round of the World Cup after they came out as first in their group, comprised of England, Poland, and Portugal. Morocco is determined to achieve good results in the 2018 World Cup.  Herve Renard, coach of the Moroccan team, said in an interview with sports outlet Goal in April, that it will be very disappointing if his team leaves the World Cup in the first round of the competition. In another interview with France 24, the Frenchman said that he will raise the Moroccan flag as hard as he can during the tournament and commended the “magnificent” Atlas Lions members, especially Benatia. Renard is set to unveil the final list of Moroccan players who will take part in the tournament in the early days of June. The team will also play a set of friendly games before going to Russia. The three friendlies will be against Ukraine, Slovakia, and Estonia. The Atlas Lions will play against Ukraine on May 31 at the Geneva stadium in Switzerland. The second friendly match will be against Slovakia on June 4, and the final friendly game will be against Estonia on June 9.

The documentary shows how the region has become a breeding zone for terrorist groups, drug dealers, human trafficking and other illegal activities. The documentary also discussed Polisario’s alleged involvement in terrorist organizations, based on testimonies of former hostages held by Polisario members. It also dwells on how the Polisario Front “spreads terrorist and separatist ideologies among young people living in the Tindouf camps in southern Algeria.” The documentary unveiled Polisario’s involvement in the embezzlement of humanitarian funds intended for the Tindouf camps, evidenced by several reports from the World Food Program (WFP) and the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF). The situation in the Sahel is concerning for the international community as the region has become a fertile zone for both terrorists and drug smugglers.  The filmmaker’s aim is to unmask the true face of the Polisario and its involvement in human trafficking, as well as its repeated misappropriation of humanitarian aid intended for the Sahrawi in the Tindouf camps, according to a statement he gave to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) in 2017. The film was also screened in Oslo in October 2017, as well as at the European Parliament’s headquarters in April 2017.  In a recent interview with MAP,  Yonah Alexander, director of the Inter-University Center on Terrorism Studies, called on the international community to express their firm stance against Polisario’s activities in the region. He emphasized that the separatist group has become a “backer” of terrorist networks in the region.

Rabat- Top military leaders at the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, have briefed the press on investigation findings on the fatal ambush in Niger that resulted in the death of four US soldiers at the hands of IS Jihadists in October 2017. On October 4, 2017, four American and four Nigerien soldiers known as “Team Ouallam,” who went on a joint mission in the “Tongo Tongo” desert in Niger near the Mali border, were were ambushed and killed by fighters of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara led by former Polisario Front soldier,  Adnan Abu Walid Al-Sahrawi. The men were said to be on a mission to find Al-Sahrawi when they found themselves outnumbered and outgunned by more than 100 ISIS militants, as US Army Maj. Gen. Roger Cloutier said in a Pentagon briefing on Thursday: “The direct cause of the enemy attack in Tongo Tongo is that the enemy achieved tactical surprise there and our forces were outnumbered approximately three-to-one.” Cloutier explained the failure of the mission and its tragic outcomes resulted from a “lack of situational awareness and command oversight at every echelon” and “lack of attention to details,” as the fallen US special forces did not undergo relevant training with their Nigerien counterparts before the mission, reported CNN. According to the investigation report, which has not yet been fully released,  the team left its base on October 3 to carry out a mission in search of the Islamic State leader suspected of kidnapping an American aid worker. In a deadly mistake, the team supervisor submitted a mission different from the one mentioned to his higher command. The death of the American soldiers, identified as Sergeant First Class Jeremiah Johnson, Staff Sergeant Bryan Black, Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright, and Sergeant La David Johnson, has ever since been a sensitive subject in the US, especially following Donald Trump’s condolence message which was criticized as “insensitive.” When asked last year by US reporters if he gave permission for the mission of the deceased soldiers, Trump answered:”No I didn’t. Not specifically.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara has received support from the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. The chamber has adopted a motion to support Morocco’s autonomy plan to reach a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict. The motion, according to Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, invites the Brazilian parliament to express support for Morocco’s autonomy plan and respect its territorial integrity. MP Cleber Verde of the Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) promoted the motion, which was signed by 260 parliamentarians in the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, including leaders of opposition parties and Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Rodrigo Maia. The international community has long described Morocco’s initiative as serious, pragmatic and credible to end the conflict. The Chamber added that Brazil’s support will be in line with United Nations Security Council 2414, adopted on April 24, and “consistent with the position of the  international community on this issue.” The UN resolution extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission for Referendum (MINURSO) in Western Sahara and put heavy pressure on the Polisario Front to withdraw from Guerguerat after a long series of illegal maneuvers east Morocco’s defense wall. The members of parliament further called on Brazil to support Morocco’s commitment to find a durable solution to the regional conflict, in accordance with UN resolutions. MPs also called on Brazil to strengthen the partnership between the two countries to develop cooperation in trade and tourism.

Rabat- Chinese Ambassador to Algeria Yang Guangyu announced China’s donation of MAD 900,000 (DZD 10 million) to the Sahrawi Red Crescent (SRC) to support Sahrawis in Tindouf camps in Algeria. Guangyu made the announcement in SRC headquarters, saying that the donation is dedicated to provide necessary food aid, particularly for the women, children, and elderly of the Tindouf camps. Guangyu told Algeria Press Service that the Chinese embassy to Algeria resolved to grant the donation on the night before Ramadan to help ease the suffering of children, elderly and women refugees, noting that they are especially vulnerable to the difficult circumstances in which they have been living for more than 40 years.  Meanwhile President of Algerian Red Crescent Saida Benhabyles manifested her sympathy with the Sahrawi refugees and hailed China’s initiative, affirming that it will bring happiness to the refugees. President of the Sahrawi Red Crescent Yahia Bouhabini expressed his gratitude for China’s humanitarian initiative, saying that the Sahrawi refugees did not choose to live in camps as they have been forced to for over four decades. Bouhabini hailed China’s continuous efforts to support those caught in the middle of war conflicts. China’s stance on Western Sahara and Morocco’s autonomy proposal remains unclear since China abstained from voting on the UN Security Council resolution 2414, adopted April 27, to extend MINURSO’s mandate until October 31. The issue of humanitarian aid to the Tindouf camps remains a hotly debated topic. While the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in his annual report on the Situation in Western Sahara expressed about the lack of humanitarian aid to the Tindouf camps, a report issued by the European Union anti-fraud committee (OLAF) published in 2015 revealed that the Polisario and Algerian officials were involved in the embezzlement of humanitarian aid for the past four decades.  OLAF’s findings confirmed the findings of a 2005 UNHCR reports, which revealed the existence of a large scale embezzlement of humanitarian aid destined to the Tindouf camps over the past four decades.

Rabat – While Morocco bid is gaining support for its 2026 World Cup bid, the world’s governing football body, FIFA, has expanded the list of countries supporting North America’s bid. FIFA has dismissed Morocco’s request to exclude four US-governed territories from the vote, scheduled for June 13 in Moscow. Morocco and the countries represented in the United 2026 bid  (US-Canada-Mexico) cannot vote. The North African country asserts that US territories American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands should also be excluded from the vote since they are governed by the US. The Moroccan bid committee addressed a letter to FIFA, asking whether the four territories, considered four separate football nations by FIFA, would be excluded from the vote. FIFA, however, told the Associated Press that at the time “no member association has notified FIFA about its intention not to perform their duties in connection with the bidding procedure for the hosting of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.” Morocco urged FIFA to “make sure that FIFA Council members Sandra Fruean, Sunil Gulati and Victor Montagliani,” stay out the room when the 2026 World Cup vote is discussed, “as they are from America Samoa, the US and Canada, respectively.” It is well known which bid FIFA prefers. US-based sporting news outlet ESPN said that United 2026 “is thought to be the preferred option of FIFA president Gianni Infantino.” ESPN added that United 2026’s potential profit is “welcomed” by Infantino since he is looking to fund the “development handouts he promised national associations when elected in 2016.” For Morocco, FIFA’s tactics are no longer suprising.  FIFA has already unveiled an unwelcome last minute development: a task force to determine bids’ preparedness. On March 25, the Royal Football Federation (FRMF) addressed a letter to FIFA regarding  Morocco’s concerns about the fairness and transparency of the procedure. “To my surprise, the scoring system was finally sent to us on March 14–24 hours before Morocco submitted its file and two days before the deadline for the submission of applications to FIFA,” wrote FRMF president Fouzi Lekjaa. On April 3, FIFA responded that the aim of the task force is to “determine whether the bids meet the requirements in terms of infrastructure and revenue-cost criteria.” FIFA’s response did not convince Morocco, which sent a second letter to FIFA. “We have taken note of your answers, but unfortunately they have not resolved these concerns and we are still convinced that the scoring system does not comply with the requirements of the bid rules,” reads Lekjaa’s second letter. Lekjaa further said that Morocco was surprised this measure surfaced only hours before Morocco submitted its bid. CEO of the Moroccan bid committee Hicham El Amrani told BBC Sport earlier this week that the task force  will publish its assessments of their visit on May 29, eleven days before the Moscow vote. The outcome will decide whether Morocco’s bid meets FIFA’s criteria to be a candidate for the vote.

Rabat – The prestigious hotel la Mamounia of Marrakech has been awarded “Best Urban Hotel in the World” in the Spanish version of UK travel magazine Condé Nast Traveler. Managing Director Pierre Jochem received the award Thursday, May 10, during the 10th ceremony of “Traveler 2018 Awards.” The hotel has won numerous awards since it reopened in 2009. The award confirms la Mamounia’s position as the flagship of the Moroccan hotel industry. La Mamounia was built in 1923 but received a makeover at the hands of French designer Jacques Garcia in 2009. In traditional Moroccan style, complete with intricate patterns and arabesques based on Berber and Arab-Andalusian architecture, la Mamounia is set in royal gardens, marked by Moorish opulence.

Rabat – While Morocco may witness the first Hilal or lunar crescent on the evening of May 16 as some Moroccan astronomers predict, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries are expected to observe the moon May 15, beginning the fast May 16. The new moon may be clearly visible to the naked eye in Morocco, Iran and Pakistan on the evening of May 16, but Saudi Arabia is expected to begin the fast one day earlier, according to Al Jazeera. Last year Saudi Arabia used specialized infrared digital cameras to photograph the new moon last year. If they do the same this year, the country may observe the moon on May 16 and begin the fast on May 17. The information matches that of Moroccan astronomers, who recently presented their predictions that Ramadan in Morocco will commence on Thursday, May 17. Moroccan astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani told Morocco World News that May 17 will witness the unified fasting of all Muslim countries, including North Africa and Saudi Arabia: “The moon will set directly after the sunset in Saudi Arabia and other eastern countries, not long before the crescent appears in Morocco and other countries in the west,” he said. Meanwhile, astronomer Dr. Hicham El Issaoui, who also predicted that Ramadan will begin May 17 in the kingdom, forecasted that Eid al-Adha will fall on August 22, and the first day of the Islamic year, Fatih-Muharram, 1440, will be on September 11. El Issaoui predicted that the birthday of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Mawlid al-Nabi al-Sharif, will be celebrated on Tuesday, November 20. When will Ramadan begin? Will Muslims really start the Ramadan fast on the same day, as some astronomers predict? These are the questions that cross the minds of the many Muslims who are looking forward to the first day of the holy month. Still, the exact first day will only be confirmed when all Muslim countries see the crescent with their naked eyes. As Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) said: “Do not fast until you see it [the crescent] and do not break the fast until you see it, and if it is covered then complete the month.”

Rabat – The United States Embassy in Rabat has launched its 2018 “My Summer of Discovery” program at the International University of Rabat (UIR). The program, launched Friday, May 11, aims to inspire young Moroccans to explore science, arts, and English language learning through American-style summer camps held in cities and provinces across Morocco. It is also a unique opportunity for young campers to express their creativity, strengthen their confidence, and develop their professional skills. “I am so proud the U.S. Embassy is supporting the aspirations of Moroccan youth. Through these summer camps, we seek to help Moroccan youth explore and discover their potential through innovative science, technology, engineering, arts, and math programs and promote positive community engagement, volunteerism, and social entrepreneurship initiatives,” Chargé d’Affaires Stephanie Miley said. This summer, more than 1,500 young Moroccans from 9 regions will participate in this interactive learning initiative. The US Embassy has awarded approximately $200,000 (MAD 2,000,000) to 12 Moroccan civil society organizations to oversee 21 summer camps. The opening ceremony will be followed by a two-day training weekend at UIR, where civil society leaders will learn American leadership principles and effective summer camp interactive models. This is the second edition of the “My Summer of Discovery” initiative. In 2017, the US Embassy funded 19 summer camps in 17 different cities and provinces throughout Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco is determined to carry out the projects listed in its 2026 World Cup bid book, even if the North African country loses hosting rights of the 23rd FIFA World tournament. Chief Executive Officer of the Moroccan bid committee Hicham El Amrani told BBC Sport that the country has decided to implement the projects listed in its bid book, “because it is for the good of our country and continent, not only to host the World Cup.” According to the official, the Moroccan committee is focusing on one goal now: winning the hosting rights. “But even if we don’t win and we lose in fair play and that will be fine.” The bid book outlines Morocco’s determination to host the massive tournament. Explaining its readiness for the event, the file says that the country will offer football fans and footballers with an unprecedented experience. The book includes a set of development projects, covering infrastructure, stadiums, and hotels. Chairman of the Moroccan bid committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy told reporters in a press conference held in February that Morocco is planning to build six 40,000-seat stadiums, in addition to a seventh 100,000-seat stadium in Casablanca. Morocco’s bid has collected the support of several African countries, including that of Algeria, Kenya, Tunisia, Nigeria, and Botswana. Surprisingly, South Africa retracted its support for Morocco’s bid on May 9, after pledging support for the African bid back in April. “It is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is,” said South African Minister of Sport Tokozile Xasa. Commenting on African nations support, El Amrani said that no one is “forced” to back the Moroccan bid if “he believes that it doesn’t serve the country or the country’s football interest.” El Amrani added that “even if Africa has always acted in unity, unity does not mean 100% of all the member associations, this is part of the democratic process.” He added that Morocco has support from all over the world, including  Africa, Europe, and Asia. Commenting on the FIFA task force visit to Morocco back in April, El Amrani said that the FIFA inspection committee is set to publish the outcomes of its visit on May 29. The assessment will decide whether Morocco’s bid will continue its race until the big day, when 211 football federation will cast their vote for their favorite bid on June 13, in Moscow.

Rabat – The Spanish parliament has once again rejected separatist motions hostile to the EU-Morocco fisheries deal. Spanish news agency EFE reported that Spain’s ruling Popular Party (PP) undermined a motion suggested by the Republican Left of Catalonia Party (ERC) and supported by Polisario’s Spanish supporter, the Podemos party. ERC’s motion aimed to discuss “the illegitimacy of the Moroccan Government to negotiate the current fisheries agreement” before the EU. PP senator Clara San Damian contested the proposed bill, emphasizing that the proposal has a political stance that is not related to the fisheries deal. She added that the 40-year old conflict in Western Sahara should not be resolved outside the auspices of the United Nations, asserting that the Spanish “government supports the current negotiations” between the EU and Morocco. The motion, according to EFE, would make the negotiation of the EU’s fisheries deal with Morocco conditional on the “peaceful solution of the  Western Sahara conflict as part of the UN process.” The proposal also urged the EU to negotiate directly with the representatives of the  self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), allowing the separatist group to benefit from “their natural resources.” Morocco and the EU started talks on new fisheries deal in April. Back in February, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) decided that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco “is valid in so far as it is not applicable to Western Sahara and to its adjacent waters.” The Moroccan government then opposed the ECJ’s decision. In April, Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha EL Khalifi said the government’s position is to only engage with deals and agreements that respect the country’s national integrity. He added that although Morocco is keen on its strategic partnership with the EU, it will allow no one to question or challenge its national borders.  The Moroccan government also emphasized that it would reject an agreement that leaves out Western Sahara. Spain was among the countries that contested the ECJ’s decision (ECJ) and has supported launching  EU-Morocco negotiations on a new fisheries deal, since the current deal will expire on June 14. The motion does not mark the first time that Podemos and its allies have proposed pro-Polisario motions to undermine Morocco’s integrity. On May 1, Podemos-Compromise suggested before the Spanish parliament that the government express its concerns over the fisheries and agriculture agreements. The Spanish government, according to ERC and Podemos, needs to stand against “the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara by European companies, which are violating international law.” Spain’s ruling PP then rejected the motions and has said that adopting such an institutional declaration “would be very counterproductive” for technical contacts between the EU and Morocco. The motions, according to PP Senator Agramunt, would even “lead to a political crisis with Morocco.”

Rabat – Muslims in the US expect to observe the holy month of  Ramadan on May 16, according to the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). On March 12, the US-based organization published that the astronomical new moon will be observed on May 15, “Therefore the first day of Ramadan 1439 (Islamic calendar) is on Wednesday, May 16, 2018.” The source added that the first day of Tarawih, Ramadan prayers performed after iftar, or break fast, will start on May 15. CNN Arabia and Al Jazeera have reported that Saudi Arabia, which serves as the benchmark for fasting times across non-Muslim majority countries, will observe the crescent moon on May 15 and commence fasting on the following day. ISNA also predicted when Muslims in the US will celebrate Eid Al Fitr. According to the source, the astronomical new moon will be on June 13, at 7:43 p.m. Universal Time.  “On that day there is no place on earth where at sunset the elongation is 8 degrees and moon is 5 degrees above the sun.” Thus, the first Shawwal (month in the  Islamic calendar), when Muslims celebrate Eid Al Fitr will commence on June 15.  However, Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani, is predicting that Arab countries will collectively fast on May 17. The Moroccan researcher told Morocco World News that the appearance of the crescent moon will be clearly observed from countries in the Western Hemisphere, including Morocco.

Rabat – The Marrakech Court of Appeals has sentenced three men to 20 collective total years in jail for the attempted rape of a teenage girl in Benguerir, near Marrakech. Three perpetrators were arrested and sentenced after forensic evidence confirmed the assault, which was videoed and posted on social media. The court sentenced the attempted rapist to 10 years in prison. The 21-year-old man was seen forcibly removing the young girl’s clothes touching her inappropriately as she screamed, “Don’t you have a sister?” The second perpetrator, a 20-year-old, accused of recording the video in concert with the aforementioned perpetrator, with the intention of blackmail and defamation, was sentenced to 8 years. The third, a 23-year-old man, was accused of neglecting to report the crime, since he was the first to receive the recorded video. Consequently, he was sentenced to 2 years. The incident sparked anger among social media users, who said the attempted rapist and his partner should receive the strictest possible punishments. Sexual violence has long been a controversial issue in Morocco, but recently, the issue has become a nationwide topic after multiple sexual assault and rape cases were highly publicized on social media.

Rabat- Iran has probably lied about its nuclear program. But hasn’t Israel also? It seems that the geographical name the Middle East is truly inappropriate for the region that has been unstable for over seven decades, experiencing many regional wars between Arabs and Israelis, between Iraqi Arabs and Americans, between Arabs and Iranians, and of course, Arab civil wars in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. The region should probably be renamed the Warring East instead of the Middle East. As a matter of fact, many Arab political analysts have tongue in cheek changed the name Middle East in Arabic (sharq al-awsat) into the humiliating name (sharq al-awsakh), meaning “the dirty east.” The Latest Middle East News is, yet again about, gearing up for another war, but this time it will probably be more destructive. A new war could last longer than protagonists’ plans on paper because, once ignited, nobody will be able to stop it unilaterally. The risks are very high and the gains are probably very low. The drumbeat of war sounds again On April 30, 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented to the Israeli people, and by extension to the world, what he called evidence that Iran is lying. The media exercise was well-orchestrated to come just before the American campaign to disengage from the nuclear agreement with Iran and to engage in a potential war with it afterwards. The war-to-be will  be waged by America, Israel and all Saudi Arabia-allied Arab Sunnis in the region. The conclusion was foreshadowed by an article in the British paper The Guardian, February 23, 2015, titled “Leaked cables show Netanyahu’s Iran bomb claim contradicted by Mossad,” written masterfully by Seumas Milne, Ewen MacAskill and Clayton Swisher. In the past, the Obama administration  was willing to give Iran a regional leadership role just short of becoming a nuclear power, but the current administration has other plans for the country: an Iran without nuclear capabilities and mullahs, a secular Iran that will not export its revolution or religion to neighboring countries and thereby threaten their stability. The play within the play In reality, Netanyahu did not come up with anything new; the whole world knows that Iran is working hard to become a nuclear power. It is no secret. It is an old dream that started with the Shah of Iran in the 1960s and continues today with open support from Russia, which wants to build an eastern coalition to counter American hegemony. Nevertheless, it seems the coming war is fully scripted by Washington, and especially by the Trump administration. The main actors in the play are Trump himself in the leading role with Mohamed Ben Salman (MBS)  and Benjamin Netanyahu in support roles. Since arriving in the Oval Office, Trump has been demonizing Iran and expressing willingness to pull the US out of the nuclear agreement. MBS, who recognized Israel’s statehood, joined Trump on stage to make the American-Israeli-Saudi alliance legitimate and official. In an interview with the Atlantic newsmagazine, he called the Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei Hitler, imitating President Bush’s actions before declaring war on Saddam’s Iraq. And last, but not least, Netanyahu who, “brought to light” Iran’s hidden game, appears on stage. Now that every actor has pronounced his faith, action will probably ensue after the holy month of Ramadan. The war will be executed by America and Israel, but Saudi Arabia’s role will be to finance the effort (or, if you will, produce the play). What else can Saudi Arabia do, anyway? Netanyahu’s speech and the previous actions of MBS in recognizing Israel and demonizing Iran is similar to “the play within the play” in Shakespeare’s  Hamlet. Hamlet’s instruction on proper delivery to the actors could be seen as Trump coaching Netanyahu and MBS. How is the war going to unfold? America and Israel are hoping to conduct an aerial war, short and sweet. They will bombard the strategic locations where the nuclear installations are and destroy military targets to cripple Iran’s potential to respond adequately in the initial stages of the military operation.  America and Israel are not planning to commit ground forces to avoid colossal troop losses. They are banking on crippling the enemy with a massive initial blow that will probably lead to a popular uprising in the major cities of Iran that will finish off the regime. But Iran has another plan: a war of attrition that could be costly in human life to America and Israel, and an uprising of Shiites in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Iran will wage a total war. Attacks will come from Syria and Lebanon where Hezbollah will play a major role. Indeed Hezbollah’s missiles will rain on northern Israel and aim to maximize casualties. If America and Israel are planning on a short war, Iran is planning a long and costly attrition war, which will reduce the Middle East to an inferno for a long period of time. There will be no navigation of the Persian Sea, no security in the air and no peace on land. Iran’s strengths are: 1- Geographical depth 2- Shiite sense of sacrifice 3- Religious fervor and discipline 4- Military discipline and combat-readiness Iran’s weaknesses are: 1- Aerial power weakness 2- Land encirclement 3- Lack of active alliances Iranians are planning to wreak havoc on the Arab world, whom they suspect to be aligned with America and Israel. The Iranians will activate their dormant cells in the Arab world, and probably also in the West, to punish those who support the war. If Iran  has to go down the drain, they will incur as much damage as possible a la après moi le deluge. Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of Foreign Policy and senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy and Energy Security and Climate Initiative, wrote in an article titled “After dumping the nuclear deal, Trump has no strategy for Iran” in Brookings: “The premeditated American dismantling of an agreement that was the product of more than a decade of intense diplomacy and economic pressure marks a staggeringly counterproductive step. That it was undertaken over the vocal objections of Washington’s closest allies and without a clear strategy of mitigating the newly heightened risks of Iranian proliferation and conventional retaliation represents an abdication of American leadership on the international stage that is unparalleled in recent history.” Expectations The war might be destructive for Iran but that alone will not end the regime of the mullahs because they can rely on the Revolutionary Guards and the Basij to protect them from any internal uprising. So, the onslaught might diminish the mullahs’ power but it will not put an end to the theocracy at the country’s helm. However, a weak Iran in the Middle East will be good news for Israel and its Arab allies, because it will lead to the probable downfall of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Alawites in Syria and the Houthis  in Yemen, ultimately destroying the Shiite Crescent in the Middle East and ending Iran’s expansionist dreams once and for all. Consequently,  Israel will come out of the painful war as the only power in the region and even as a co-protector of Arab countries alongside America. The demise of Iran will foretell the demise of Hamas in Gaza, and Abbas will take over the strip and sign, under gentle pressure, a peace agreement  with Israel. Saudi Arabia will regain its leadership of the Muslim world, but will be totally broken. All in all, if everyone plays his cards right, Israel will probably pay the biggest price in human casualties but will undoubtedly win big, destroying Hamas, reining in Abbas and emasculating the Arabs, gaining peace in the Middle East and a huge market for its exports. A make-believe scenario America, Israel and Saudi Arabia are probably heading to war for fear of destabilizing a region that already has so many problems: the Palestinian problem, the Syrian conflict, the Yemeni war, etc. What if these three countries are only putting pressure on Iran to make it abandon its nuclear program entirely, without firing a single shot? These countries are attempting to create a North Korean scenario, whereby the Americans used tremendous pressure on North Korea to make it accept talks, first with South Korea, and later with the US, in order to arrange future denuclearization. Will such pressure bring the mullahs to their senses and make them abandon their threats towards Israel and destabilization schemes vis-à-vis Saudi Arabia and the Sunni world? The mullahs have always been practical and sensible in politics, and chances are they will choose moderation and negotiation to avoid annihilation. If they do so, Trump will have won a political gamble, adding to his apparent present success on the Korean peninsula. These two political breakthroughs will probably ensure his reelection against the odds and will prove him right by making America great again. The war on Iran will, probably, be costly as all wars are anyway, but in the end it will probably be worthwhile if it brings peace to the region and a new era of much-needed cooperation and goodwill. Will the war, if it ever happens, bring democracy to the Arab world, at long last? Or will Arabs continue to prefer bread over a political system of representation and full accountability? It is difficult to see the outcome because the horizon is very hazy. Only time can tell.

Rabat – Muslims across the world will soon be preparing for the holy month of Ramadan.

Rabat – Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran is still making international headlines. Moroccan media have reported that Yonah Alexander, director of the Inter-University Center on Terrorism Studies, has urged the international community to remain extremely vigilant against “proven collusion” between Iranian alley Hezbollah and Polisario Front separatists. According to state-owned Maghreb Arab News Agency (MAP), Alexander called for the collusion between Iran and Polisario to be denounced on Wednesday. “The revelation of Polisario-Hezbollah collusion is the latest in a long series of examples of Iran’s harmful and destabilizing influence in the Middle East and Africa,” Alexander said. He told the state-owned Maghreb Arab News Agency (MAP) in Washington that the issue is an urgent warning call on the international community to “hold the Iranian regime accountable for its actions.” Commenting on Polisario and the threat it poses to the region’s stability, Alexander said that the separatist group has become a “backer of terrorist groups operating in the Sahel region,” he emphasized the need for an immediate solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Another international expert has warned the international community of Polisario’s links with terrorist groups. On the sidelines of the 13th World Social Forum in Brazil, Italian academic and journalist Massimiliano Boccolini warned of the presence of Tindouf camps in Algeria and Polisario are a direct threat to stability in the region and in the Sahel, according to Moroccan media reports. He added that the separatists of the Polisario Front have been involved in other crimes, including “all types of trafficking” and migration issues. Echoing Massimiliano’s statement, Alexander warned that the international community will face a “new generations of terrorists” due to Polisario’s worrying activities in the region. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced Iran’s interference in the country’s internal affairs on May 1, presenting “detailed evidence” of Hezbollah-Polisario collusion, including Iran. Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita explained that Hezbollah offered military training to Polisario separatists in the Tindouf camps in Algeria. Sahel, Polisario’s New Target In March, Head of Morocco’s Counter-Terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame warned the world of Polisario’s connivance with terrorist groups. In his interview with Jeune Afrique, Khiame said that the separatist group can also be “considered a terrorist organization in Sahel” as hundreds of members of the Polisario Front are working for Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and “they have been involved in attacks in northern Mauritania.” Terrorist groups are not the only concern in the region; drug traffickers are also exploiting the region, which has become a fertile zone for both terrorists and drug smugglers. Khiame also underscored that illegal activities serve as a means of escaping poverty for “separatists living in Tindouf.”

Rabat – The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations honored “righteous Muslims” who protected Jews during the Holocaust during its recent event in New York. The Conference of Presidents, an umbrella organization that represents over fifty US Jewish organizations, hosted Mohammed al-Issa, the secretary general of the Saudi-based Muslim World League, as the featured guest.  During his keynote speech, Al-Issa discussed the state of Jewish-Muslim relations and highlighted the importance of Holocaust education in the Muslim world. In January, Al-Issa wrote a letter to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in which he publicly acknowledged the tragedy of the Holocaust, “an incident that shook humanity to the core, and created an event whose horrors could not be denied or underrated by any fair-minded or peace-loving person.” He also asserted that “true Islam” opposed the Nazi genocide. The Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of the Conference of Presidents said: “In the presence of many leaders of the American Jewish and Muslim communities, Dr. Al-Issa joined us as we commemorated and paid tribute to the immensely important, but too little known, acts of human decency and kindness of people in many majority Muslim countries during the Holocaust that enabled Jews to survive the horrors of the Nazi drive to exterminate them.” Mimouna highlights Muslim-Jewish camaraderie The Conference of Presidents also honored Laziza Dalil, Vice President and Co-founder of the Moroccan-based Muslim student movement, Association Mimouna, which promotes Jewish heritage in Morocco and Muslim-Jewish dialogue. The Moroccan Jewish festival of Mimouna, a 24-hour food-centered celebration, begins one week after Passover ends. This commemorates how, for many centuries, Moroccan Jewish homes would empty their cupboards of leavened bread and flour during the week of Passover and give the flour to their non-Jewish neighbors. After the holy week, Jewish families would receive their grain from their Muslim neighbors, who were trusted with preserving the food, due to their own careful maintenance of halal dietary restrictions.  Most older North African Jews remember the age-old “Mimouna” tradition. At the end of Passover, when Muslims came to Jewish homes to return the flour, they were always invited to stay for a few hours and enjoy the soon-to-be-baked treats.  Thus, Jewish homes were filled with neighbors, friends, and family exchanging traditional Arabic blessings of good luck and success while awaiting the laden trays of delicious Mimouna baked goods. The celebration was often also repeated the next day, with even more pastries and neighborly exchange. Prior to the rise of secular political nationalism in the 19th century and the rise of politicized Zionism and Islam in the 20th century, Jewish-Muslim relations were usually characterized by neighborliness and amity, as the North African Jewish celebration of Mimouna shows. The Association Mimouna co-founder concluded her statement by telling the audience of her group’s hope to preserve Jewish heritage in Morocco and announcing the first Holocaust education curriculum for Moroccan students.

Rabat – Morocco’s Spokesperson of the Government Mustapha El Khalfi has denounced the ongoing campaign against the high prices of certain products, asserting that online activists’ claims of price increases are “fake news.” After nearly a month, the government has officially made its stance clear on the boycott campaign targeting three companies: Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone and Afriquia Gas. The official singled out Centrale Danone’s milk products in a statement made before journalists on Thursday following the weekly government council. El Khalfi said “the profit margin of the company is reasonable and does not exceed 20 centimes [per liter].” The official added that the company has not increased the price of milk since 2013, echoing Centrale Danone’s May 2 statement in which it denied increasing the prices of its dairy products. “Conscious of the value of milk and its health benefits, Centrale Danone has maintained the price of milk since July 2013, despite the continuous rise of its production costs.” El Khalfi then said that online activists are “circulating false information.” “Spreading false allegations is an illegal practice that does not fall under the freedom of expression,” he added.  El Khalfi then warned that the government will work to review current speech law “because no one can accept misinformation that can damage the reputation of the country and its economy.” Failing Customers’ Expectations? In response, Moroccans launched a hashtag, using the Arabic translation of “fake news,” on networking services. “Meat is offered at MAD 10 and vegetables is distributed for free #fakenews,” wrote one Twitter user. Another Twitter user said that people who were not supporting the boycott will join the campaign “in response to the government’s provocation #fakenews.”  ????? ?? ?10 ? ?????? ????? ????? #?????_????? — sami (@samimel740) May 10, 2018   
El Khalfi’s reaction to the boycott appeared to shock for social media users, who have been waiting for an official statement from the government for more than three weeks.  ??? ????? ????? ????? ??? ????? ?? #???????? ???????? ????????? ???? ??? ??? ??????? ???????#?????_?????#???????? — youssef Jajili (@YoussefJajili) May 10, 2018    Two of the targeted companies, Sidi Ali and Centrale Danone, issued statements denying that they have increased the prices of their products. And the boycott continues.

Rabat – Hakim Ziyech has his picks for the summer mercato (transfer window). The Moroccan football player is drawing the attention of numerous prestigious clubs, especially after he announced his wish to leave Ajax Amsterdam at the end of the season. Courted much? According to Calciomercato, Liverpool and Tottenham are now interested in signing Ziyech this summer, joining West Ham, AS Roma and Inter Milan, which have already expressed interest in recruiting the Moroccan sensation. Liverpool will be in the market for another playmaker this summer, and have their eyes on Ziyech, who would  fit the bill perfectly, according to the same source. Tottenham has a great relationship with Ajax, having signed several players from the Dutch giant in the last six years. The English club may strike another deal with the Amsterdam side, with Ziyech representing a creative midfield option. Italian charm Meanwhile, Italian clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan have been monitoring Ziyech’s performance and considering signing him since last winter. Inter Milan has been in negotiations with Ajax over Ziyech since late 2016, with board members offering EUR 15 million for the Moroccan player. Other European clubs seems to want their piece of Ziyech’s magic. Dortmund and Marseille both expressed their intentions to recruit the 25-year-old Atlas Lion. Road to Spain? The Moroccan playmaker has also raised the interest of Spanish club Atlético Madrid, which is ready to formulate an offer during the summer transfer window. Ziyech wants to make his choice after the World Cup. “A lot can change after the World Cup especially if we lose, it can work to my disadvantage. But I do not think so,” Ziyech said to Dutch media outlet Voetbalzone. However, the Moroccan player’s value is predicted to rise remarkably after the Russian World Cup, especially considering the fact that he recently received Ajax Amsterdam’s “Player of the Year” award for his excellent skills and performance this season. The Moroccan has been sensational for Ajax, hitting 9 goals and 15 assists last season.

Rabat- With Ramadan approaching, Morocco will suspend the daylight savings time and revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), on Sunday, May 13. Sunday, May 13 at 3:00 a.m, Moroccans will switch their clocks 60 minutes back to GMT, said the Ministry in Charge of Reform Administration and Public Service in a statement. The country suspends daylight savings time exclusively for the month of Ramadan because it affects the fasting time; afterwards, the kingdom returns to GMT+1. The time change comes in accordance with the Decree N 2-12-126 issued on Jumada I, 1433 (April 18, 2012). Morocco switched to the daylight savings time on Sunday, March 25. Daylight savings has been adopted in Morocco since 2008 to increase the competitiveness of the national economy through reducing energy consumption and time difference between the kingdom and its regional and international trading partners, such as France. However, going back and forth in time does not appeal to many Moroccans who voice their displeasure with the measure and question its effectiveness. The measure has been under review since late February by the European Parliament (EP). Across the 28 member states of the EP, 384 deputies out of 549 voted in favor of the resolution. Previously in 2015, a group of Moroccan citizens launched a petition, urging the government to consider ending the daylight savings due to the negative impacts it brings on health. A study conducted by EU Parliament in October 2017 stated: “While daylight-savings time benefits the transport industry, helps outdoor leisure activities, and reduces energy consumption, it is associated with disruptions to the human biorhythm.” The origins of daylight savings date back to the First World War in the UK, where it was adopted to give factories more daylight hours to support war efforts.

Rabat – The US Department  of Defense has provided US aerospace and defense technology giant Northrop Grumman with a military fund to power up Morocco’s M1A2S tanks with eye-safe lasers. On May 8, the defense and weapons procurement publication Defense World  reported that Northrop Grumman “was awarded a  [USD] 9,491,066 modification (P00001) to foreign military sales (Morocco) contract W56HZV-18-C-0065 for eye safe laser range finders for Morocco’s M1A2S tank,” as per a US Department of Defense announcement Monday. Northrop Grumman will work on Morocco’s new shipment in Florida “with an estimated completion date of May 1, 2020.” The statement quoted by the Defense World added that Morocco has purchased 220 Abrams tanks “refurbished for the Kingdom through the US Army’s Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program.” The tanks, M1A1 and M1A2, are colored with camouflage “specifically for Morocco.” The Abrams tank represents the third-generation of main battle tanks used by the United States military. On April 18, research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Joseph Dempsey shared on his Twitter pre-delivery videos of 48 Abrams tanks being delivered to Morocco from the US. In the same month, the US Pentagon approved the delivery of USD 115 million in military equipment, as of September 2017. A 2018 report released by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute identifies Morocco as the second largest arms importer in Africa, representing 12 percent of the continent’s total military imports during the 2013-17 period. The report shows the US is Morocco’s main military supplier, with a 52-percent share in Morocco’s imports. In November 2017, the US sent its third batch of American Abrams tanks to Morocco following delivering two shipments in July 2017 and September 2017. Military deals between Morocco and the United States for the tanks began in 2012, according to the American Defense Security and Cooperation Agency. France is Morocco’s second military supplier, with 44 percent, while Italy is third, with 1.4 percent, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s 2018 report.

Rabat – Just days before the D-Day, June 13, when the FIFA Congress will convene to decide the 2026 World Cup host, the Moroccan organizing team is buckling down on persuading the world of the merits of the country’s candidacy.   Last Tuesday, surrounded by over 200 journalists gathered for the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) Congress in Brussels, Moroccan bid representative Hicham El Amrani seized the opportunity to reveal Morocco’s hosting vision for the footballing world’s most celebrated tournament. Transcending the label of a “bidding nation,” the Moroccan representative told attendees that Morocco 2026 actually encapsulates the realization of a national dream. The bid is ultimately about the whole African continent, the belief that the continent is once again capable of hosting the biggest sporting event. This is echoed in the concept that the Morocco 2026 executive committee has chosen for the Moroccan candidacy: Africa meets Europe, an indication of the country’s unique location as a bridge linking the two continents. While United 2026 officials in Brussels highlighted the huge financial benefits that the North American bid could yield, saying that they would “expect to… generate the most successful and profitable World Cup ever,” El Amrani brought in the social aspect of sports, how the World Cup should primarily be based on desire to have a defining impact on people’s lives. According to El Amrani, helping emerging countries should be an essential element of sports, especially the organization of a World Cup. “The World Cup is not attributed only to the number of seats you offer in stadiums or who makes more money,” the Moroccan official insisted, adding: “We will make enough money to make FIFA profitable. That is a crucial end. We proved that our bid will make double the amount of what was accomplished in South Africa and Brazil.” If the sporting world continues to fixate its hosting criteria on formidable infrastructures and big financial returns, El Amrani warned, hosting rights of tournaments such as the World Cup and the Olympics will always be rewarded to the “same countries around the world,” namely the developed countries. “The power of sport is also to help develop certain areas of the world,” he said, a suggestion that the developmental aspect of the game should never be taken out of the picture when it comes to hosting the World Cup. El Amrani also mentioned Morocco’s thriving and dynamic economy and its developing and modernizing infrastructures. Perhaps most importantly, he added, is “Moroccans’ exceptional passion for football.” Asked about the chances of Morocco 2026, Kamal Lahlou, a member of the Morocco 2026 team, said that Morocco’s candidacy puts forward the humane side of sports—touching and changing lives, which he believes is more important than the economic calculations. Besides, he added, “FIFA will be responding to the desire of millions of football fans who have given so much to the sport, namely Africans and their representative [Morocco 2026].”

Rabat- Connecting Africa through enhanced communication channels and improved intra-Africa exchanges has lately been in vogue among political actors and important economic stakeholders on the African continent.  Consistent with such a spirit of increased South-South exchanges and economic relations, Morocco’s BCP Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB) have recently signed a $100 million agreement to boost intra-Africa commerce. Technically known as “risk participation agreement,” the deal is a cooperation aiming to promote trade between African states and meet the growing demand on continental financial transaction, particularly considering the growing and dynamic middle classes in many African countries. In its statement about the deal’s terms and expectations, BCP Bank said that in addition to stimulating the continent’s dream of advancing intro-African exchanges, the deal is part of a much larger agreement, with $700 million of trade deals set to materialize on the continent in the next three years. “Our partnership with the AfDB is a perfect response to one of the main outlines of our strategy, which aims to actively support the development of intra-African trade by providing Moroccan companies with appropriate financing mechanisms,” said Kamal Mokdad, the BCP Group’s Director General for international relations. For his part, Mohamed El Azizi, Managing Director of the AfDB for the North African region, asserted that this joint deal will help consolidate and boost continental integration by unleashing the growth potentials of intra-African trade. Also, he added, the deal will be a venue for encouraging investment and job creation. Among the sectors prioritized by the deal figure agriculture, industry, and services.

Washington D.C –  Morocco cannot afford a diplomatic confrontation with the U.N. veto yielding Russia. Nonetheless, the two nations should be able to talk frankly about issues of national interests without damaging their friendship. For some Moroccan activists, Moscow’s backing of the Polisario separatists is hypocritical given Russia’s violent annexation of Crimea and its current meddling in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Russia views Crimea and Donbas as essential to its security and is willing to pay whatever price to keep the territories Russian. The same goes for Morocco and Western Sahara. Moroccan diplomacy known for its passivity at times need to approach the Russian and remove any diplomatic ambiguity about the impact of Moscow’s double standards. Rabat stayed neutral in the Ukraine and Georgia conflicts and should ask the Russian to stay out of the fray in Western Sahara. Moscow cannot present its positions in the Caucuses and Ukraine as lawful and legitimate then denied Morocco’s rights to Western Sahara.  If proud Russians view Crimea’s rightful place in Russia, then Moroccans should present the same narrative about the Sahara to the Kremlin. In fact, Moroccans find Moscow’s apathy toward Morocco’s right to liberate Western Sahara from Spain and unify its people with the Kingdom selfish. Russia has justified its invasion of Georgia in 2008, its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its current covert intervention in the Donbas as unification crusades to protect ethnic Russians. While Morocco’s liberation of Western Sahara was peaceful and its historic claims undisputable and well documented, Russian’s claims in Crimea are recent going back 1780’s, and shaky at best since most of the ethnic Russians settled in the area from other part of Russia and the ethnic Crimean Tatars were forcibly exiled all over the Soviet empire. It is curious to see Russia pushing for a United Nations’ administered referendum for self-determination in Western Sahara when Moscow self-conducted referendums without international observers in Crimea, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Further, Russia manipulated the disputed results to justify its annexation or appropriation of these territories that remain internationally recognized as Ukrainian and Georgian. In the name of national interests, Russia has swallowed Georgian and Ukrainian land with impunity. It used force to create a fait accompli where the United Nations and the world community had no options but to ignore international law violations and accept the Russian versions. Traditionally, Russia and the Soviet Union before it, adopted the Algerian positions favoring independence for Western Sahara, nevertheless, focusing on Russia’s role and tactics in Crimea and the Donbas region help the Russians to gain a perspective on what the Moroccans are facing in the Sahara. While it may not be publicly stated, Russia will always support Algeria because of the close economic and military corporations dating back to the 1970’s. This should not stop the Moroccan diplomacy from trying to temper future Russian maneuvers at the U.N. Security Council A Russian veto of U.N. resolutions supporting Morocco has no real adverse effects on Moscow foreign policy in North Africa, Morocco will just have to deal with it at the official level. However, Moroccan civil society and national media should expose Russia’s misguided diplomacy in the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – The Sidi Ali-Oulmes mineral water company has finally reacted to the online boycott which targets “unjustified” price increases in Morocco.  After three weeks of silence, the company has contested boycotters’ arguments by pointing fingers at Morocco’s taxation policies.  The company’s statement does not seem to answer the boycotters’ demands. However, Sidi Ali believes that this was the right time to release an official reaction to the campaign. On Wednesday, the mineral water giant, managed by CGEM standing CEO Meriem Bensaleh, released an exclusive statement explaining its reasons for “not lowering” its prices. While boycotters were eagerly waiting for the company’s official reaction, Sidi Ali told customers not to expect any decrease in prices unless country’s taxation policy changes. In the statement, Sidi Ali claims  bottled water is “subjected to high taxation.”  The company then shared it has “paid MAD 657,072,912 in taxes,” in 2017, which includes the value-added natural resources consumption tax and environmental tax. The company justified its delayed response, emphasizing they wanted to “take our time to listen and analyze the expectations of citizens and loyal customers.” 
Sidi Ali “ Has Minimal Profit” Bensaleh’s company asserted that it paid a municipality tax of MAD 99,056,958 to the Commune d’Oulmès in 2017, and paid MAD  48,288,916 to the state for the natural resources consumption tax. The statement explained that the selling price includes other expenses, such as distribution costs and a margin for retailers. The statement claimed that the company earns a very small profit. “The margin earned [on the sale] of Sidi Ali is 7 percent, or 40 centimes per bottle of 1.5 liter.” 
Prices Remain the Same Refuting the claims of boycotters, who said that the company has monopolized the Moroccan market and increased its prices, Sidi Ali wrote that it made a decision not to “increase the selling prices of all bottle sizes since 2010.”  The decision was taken “despite steady inflation and the increase of the costs of items,” including taxes and raw materials. The statement added that Sidi Ali bottles of 1.5 litres are distributed at the recommended prices of MAD 5 in supermarkets and MAD 5.50 at small retailers. According to the statement, the prices can be “freely modified” based on Law 06-99 on the freedom of pricing. Backlash Sidi Ali’s response has not satisfied the demands of boycotters. The statement received widespread backlash from Moroccan online activists. “Everyone knows that in other countries, mineral waters and spring waters are much cheaper than ours. In Morocco, the purchasing power is higher. In some countries, these waters are even free,” argued one angry commenter. Another consumer wrote that Sidi Ali is “refusing to lower its prices and asks Moroccans to pay more instead.” Sidi Ali’s response came after Centrale Danone’s reaction to the boycott last week. Centrale Danone published a statement denying that it had increased the price of its dairy products. “Conscious of the value of milk and its health benefits, Centrale Danone has maintained the price of milk since July 2013, despite continuous rise of its production expenses.” The company also apologized to its consumers for statements made by its purchasing director Adile Benkiran, who characterized the boycott as a “betrayal” of the country and its products. Afriquia Gas is the only company that hasn’t released an official stance. However, Aziz Akhannouch, owner of Afriquia Gas and Minister of Agriculture made his position clear on the boycott when he expressed support for Centrale Danone at the International Agriculture Fair, which took place in Meknes in April. Denouncing the boycott, Akhannouch said that the “internet cannot stop 470,000 employees in the dairy sector.” The boycott, which started on April 20, is ongoing.

Rabat- The proliferation of the internet today has paved the way for many individuals to connect with each other and even to find love, sex and companionship at the click of a button, leaving behind the need for the traditional khtabbat (female matchmaker). Several dating applications, available for almost every city, sexual orientation, religion, race and interest, have conquered Moroccans’ smartphones and altered traditional methods of meeting romantic partners. Happn, Spotted and the most famous application Tinder, have taken dating to another level, providing their users with an infinity of potential relationships in their vicinity. With an estimated 91 million people using dating websites and applications around the world, the straightforward application Tinder is massively popular. Indeed, only two years after its 2012 launch, the app registered more than a billion “swipes” a day. With Tinder’s “swipe to like” approach, users can swipe right to like or left to reject. If someone likes them back, it’s a match—a match that could signal the beginning of a life-long relationship or just a one-night stand, depending on the individuals’ pre-existent preferences that technology reinforces. Tinder CEO Sean Rad defended the app, saying, “All Tinder’s doing is we’re connecting people…. What you want to do with that connection is completely up to you. Sometimes there’s marriages, friendships and everything in between … There are Tinder babies. There are many Tinder babies!” Since 2015, Tinder has gained popularity among Moroccans, with more than 150,000 users in the country. Happn, which is also a location-based application, has swept more than 110,000 Moroccan smartphones, by connecting people who crossed paths within 250 meters of each other throughout the day. Speaking to Morocco World News, Jean Zaganiaris, a French sociologist and author of the book “Queer Morocco: Sexuality, gender and (trans) identities in Moroccan literature,” asserted that “Online dating is indeed gaining ground in Morocco.” However, it would be questionable to talk about any “sexual revolution” on social networks given the diversity of ways Moroccans use social networks. “The behaviors on dating websites and applications range from playful roleplay to physical meeting, to platonic love. Not to mention all the meetings, including the short-lived ones, which are not done in the virtual sphere. What these dating apps have of interest relates to a certain desire of becoming autonomous of the spheres of socialization, in particular of the family,” Zaganiaris said. Morocco World News spoke to several Moroccans, users and non-users alike, to hear their thoughts on online dating apps. “Online dating apps are not like any other social media apps. People don’t try to accumulate specific credits, there is no number of followers on Tinder, like Instagram. You define yourself to only one person, not to a public or a number of followers, and you direct your attention to one person. For dating it’s something effective, but can not be used for social interactions,” argued Hamza, a 24-year-old student living in Rabat. Some have praised the faster pace online dating applications allow, making it easier for people who are not socially active to seek relationships. “Just by a chance you can find someone from your workplace, or in the same university. [It is] a great and easy way to stumble on someone that you couldn’t approach in real life,” explained Sara, a 25-year-old graphic designer. Meanwhile, others see dating apps as a means for hookups that could not result in lasting partnerships. “These apps are more valid for one night stand[s], and rarely can turn into serious and mature relationships,” asserted Mehdi, a 22-year-old graduate student from Rabat. Brahim, a 29-year-old from Marrakech, went further, saying he used Tinder once and deleted it after a very short time, since the concept did not appeal to him. “Having only the picture and the geographic location as a way to choose people is not sufficient, unlike Facebook through which you have the opportunity to see more aspects about the people before talking to them. The app looks like a prostitution app, not a real platform of networking with people. Users are reduced to simple objects, I like this person, I don’t like this one. It is very degrading,” Brahim maintained. Finding a compatible partner involves several steps that all require an investment in time. In the same vein, some have claimed that converting swipes to dates is not as easy as it sounds. “At the beginning, it’s like a game, it boosts your ego when you have a match, but it takes too much time and organization to find a date. Sometimes, you find yourself communicating with so many people all the time. But there’s nothing I hated… [more] about Tinder than the girls who want to text me for ages and never actually take a further step to meet in person. I realize that I spend a lot of time on it while it is not necessarily conclusive,” complained Omar, a 22-year-old student. Some interviewees made the point that these applications are able to break social taboos, claiming that they can be an excellent tool for women’s sexual emancipation. Others argued that some women still have difficulty acknowledging their choices. “Whenever I meet a girl, the first thing she tells me is that I am the first person she meets. It’s hard to believe that all the time. Unfortunately, many women do not… [admit] being on these apps,” Nabil, a 25-year-old worker from Rabat.

Rabat- The Swedish Parliament’s (Riksdag) Committee on Foreign Affairs has presented its annual report on the situation in the MENA region for the years 2016-2018, in which it stated Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara could be the basis for “negotiation.” The Committee’s report has referred for the first time to Morocco’s proposed Autonomy Plan to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara dispute. While 20 MPs of the leftist party in the Swedish Parliament voted in favor of holding a referendum to determine the fate of the territory, 221 members of the Swedish Parliament voted against it. On the other hand, the Committee on Foreign Affairs showed support for the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, known by its French acronym as MINURSO, and acclaimed its efforts invested in peace-making to end the decades-long conflict between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario over the territory. The vote comes in stark contrast to Sweden’s attempts to recognize the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in the fall of 2015. The swift and firm reaction of the Moroccan government coupled with Sweden’s economic interests in Morocco deterred Swedish officials from making any move against Morocco’s territorial integrity.

Rabat- Morocco produced 345,000 passenger vehicles in 2017, overtaking South Africa, which produced 331,000, as the leader of the automotive industry in Africa, according to an annual business report conducted by IOL. The report states that South Africa, traditionally the continent’s leading car-producing country, is intimidated by Morocco’s growing production capacity in the automotive sector. Executive manager of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) and Automotive Industry Export Council Norman Lamprecht believes the kingdom’s proximity to Europe allows it to focus northward, posing a threat to South Africa’s automotive industry. Regardless, South Africa’s automotive industry continues to strengthen globally; the report asserts South Africa’s total automotive export sales garnered USD 13.4 billion (R 164.9 billion) in 2017, representing 14 percent of total South African exports. Morocco is optimistic about its achievements, as Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment, and Digital Economy Moulay Hafid Elalamy recently predicted the kingdom will exceed MAD 100 billion in export sales by 2020 and further make MAD 200 billion in exports with a production capacity of one million vehicles by 2025. Morocco’s automotive industry registered a turnover of MAD 70 billion in 2017, compared to MAD 40 billion in 2014, making it an immensely attractive investment destination for many of the world’s leading car manufacturers such as Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën.

Rabat – Youssouf Hadji has made up his mind. The 38-year-old Moroccan soccer player, who is currently playing for the French club AS Nancy-Lorraine, will retire at the end of the season, according to France Football.  The former Atlas Lion announced his decision Wednesday to the club, staff and his teammates. On Friday, he will likely play his final game at Marcel-Picot against Orleans. “Youssouf Hadji will hang up his cleats at the end of this season. He is the second-leading scorer in club history with 85 goals,” wrote the French club on Twitter.  Hadji’s career was formed with Lorraine, for whom he played during three different periods (1998-2003, 2007-2011 and 2014-present) and with whom he won the French Ligue 2 champion title in 2016. Hadji also wore jerseys from Bastia, Rennes (twice), Al-Arabi and Elazigspor. In the 347 games he played for AS Nancy, he scored 85 times, making him second only to Michel Platini (98 goals in 182 games) in club history. Hadji will always be remembered as an iconic Atlas Lion who helped Morocco’s national team reach the finals of the African Cup of Nations in 2004.

Rabat- El Othmani and Lahcen Daoudi have joined the list of government officials speaking out on the boycott campaign. Weeks after online activists launched a boycott campaign against the exorbitant prices of Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone and Afriquia, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani finally broke his silence, news outlets reported Wednesday, May 9. In a statement to the media following a May 7 meeting between The Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS) and Justice and Development Party (PJD), El Othmani demonstrated his concern about workers, particularly small farmers working for Centrale Danone. El Othmani said there are “120,000 farmers, 80 percent of whom are small farmers working for this establishment [Centrale]…we are worried about their situation and are thinking of means to support them during this hard time which will impact them into the future.” At the same time, El Othmani slammed accusations that the PJD party was the mastermind behind the campaign, saying: “We do not know who speculates these accusations…for this reason we will not answer to these anonymous [groups].” In a speech during Parliament session on Monday, May 7, Minister Delegate to the Head of Government for General Affairs and Governance Lahcen Daoudi said that while the reasons behind the boycott can be justified, it will certainly come with a price, not only at the expense of the kingdom’s reputation but also a loss of foreign economic investments. Daoudi pointed out the consequences forced on the families of thousands of Centrale employees, reminding the public that the company is not Moroccan but is a subsidiary of French multinational company Danone, which may not hesitate to leave the country. Daoudi added that the previous remarks made by some ministers do not define the government’s stance on the boycott.  Before Daoudi and El Othmani spoke out, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, owner of boycotted gasoline company Afriquia, also warned of the campaign’s consequences for Centrale employees, stating that the campaign cannot stop 470,000 dairy workers from doing their jobs. Meanwhile, former government officials voiced their support for the boycott, such  Secretary-General of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) Nabil Benabdellah, Head of the Istiqlal Party Baraka, and Secretary-General of the Unified Socialist Party Nabila Mounib. Moroccan celebrities were the first to comment and show their support for the boycott on social media networks. These celebrities include Ihab Amir, Dounia Batma, Saida Charaf, Najat Aatabou, Doc Samaad, Rachid El Idrissi, Latifa Raafat, Abd El Fattah Grini, and Asmae Lmnawar. Under the slogans “Say No to High Prices,” and “Let it Spoil,” young protesters first launched the campaign on Twitter and Facebook April 20. Since then, the boycott has come to embody unified Moroccan citizens speaking out against rising commodity prices.

Rabat – Moroccan Juventus defender Mehdi Benatia is very proud of his exploits during the final game of the Italian Football league. The national team captain won his second Italian Cup with Juventus.  “The Juve” defeated AC Milan 4-0 in the 2018 Coppa Italia final game Wednesday night, helped by two goals from Benatia. The French-Moroccan international player scored for first goal in the 55th minute of the match. Benatia scored his second goal in the 63rd minute. Taking advantage of the bouncing off the Rossoneri goalkeeper, the captain of Morocco’s national team scored at close range.  The 31-year-old player expressed his joy by sharing a picture of himself holding the cup on social media. “What a night! I’m so proud to be a part of this team,” he wrote.    Questa e la migliore risposta possibile. Tropo orgoglioso di fare parte di questo gruppo. ????? ???? ? #forzajuve #finoallafine #MB5 A post shared by  Medhi Benatia (@m.benatia5) on May 9, 2018 at 3:37pm PDT   Soirée de rêve ? ???? #FORZAJUVE #FINOALLAFINE A post shared by  Medhi Benatia (@m.benatia5) on May 10, 2018 at 1:53am PDT  Wednesday wasn’t Benatia’s first Italian Cup win. In 2017, the Atlas Lion defeated Crotone with a 3-0 victory. He celebrated the winby proudly carrying the Moroccan flag around his shoulders. Benatia’s skills have not gone unnoticed. Earlier this week, Olympique Marseille (OM), which has long shown interest in the defender, has sent recruiters to negotiate with Juventus for the summer transfer window. The French manager of OM, Rudi Garcia, asked for the Juventus defender, remembering his collaboration with AS Roma a few years ago when he was Benatia’s coach. In order to recruit Benatia, OM will have to spend more than EUR 25 million. However, Benatia and Juventus seem to be in a good place now. Beppe Marotta, sports director at Juventus, isn’t ready to give up on his defender and shot down rumors of a transfer, saying the French-Moroccan sensation isn’t going anywhere.

Rabat – SDX Energy, an oil and gas exploration company, has announced a discovery of natural gas at its LMS-1 exploration well in the Lalla Mimouna area, near Ksar El Kebir in northwest Morocco. The discovery, the seventh since SDX Energy’s arrival in Morocco,, marks the ninth well drilled by the British oil company. After drilling to a depth of 1,158 meters in the Lalla Mimouna area the London-based company found  “16.4 meters of net conventional gas pay sands” according to a statement. “We are very pleased with the results of this exploration well as it has significantly exceeded our pre-drill estimates for both reservoir quality and pay sand thickness,” said Paul Welch, President and CEO of SDX.   “This was a higher risk exploration prospect into a sequence that had not been previously penetrated in a similar structural location. We were prepared for the overpressures in this area and as a result have been able to successfully log and complete this well,” he added. Having arrived in Morocco in January 2017, SDX has completed a nine-well drilling program in the Sebou region. The latest discovery ends its drilling program in Morocco on a positive note: seven of the nine wells have revealed gas. The company obtained authorization to explore the Gharb center area, in northwest Morocco, for 8 years, linking permits in Lalla Mimouna with Sebou. In addition, the company obtained a four-month extension on its Lalla Mimouna permit in July. The British company is one of the primary companies specializing in gas exploration in North Africa and operates in various areas of Morocco, which benefits from low costs and is particularly flexible in low oil prices.

Washington D.C. – South Africa made an unexpected about-face last week when it retracted its support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. After it had declared officially in April that it would vote for Morocco on June 13, South Africa’s authorities walked back on their pledge and withdrew their support. On Monday, South Arica’s Minister of Sports and Recreation, Tokozile Xasa, made clear why her country had decided to retract its initial support for Morocco. The South African official simply said that voting for Morocco would not serve her country’s agenda.  “Our parliament was very straightforward in this regard‚ it is the mandate of the country and it is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is,” she said.  The timing of the decision suggests that it was made following American President Donald Trump’s tweet threatening to withdraw support for countries that do not support the United States’ 2026 bid.  Nevertheless, when one reads between the lines of South Africa’s Minister of Sports it appears that the decision goes beyond sports and beyond any fear of U.S. retaliation.  Strong economic and political ties between Iran and South Africa  South Africa’s geostrategic and economic interests appear to be the driving factor for the decision. An analysis of South Africa’s relations with Iran shows that its about-face regarding Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid has nothing to do with Trump’s tweet. It has to do rather with Morocco’s decision to sever its ties with Iran and to escalate its rhetoric against Algeria and the Polisario. That South Africa has decided to retract its support just days after Morocco cut ties with Iran speaks volumes of the reasons underlying this decision.  South Africa and Iran have strengthened their relations since 1994 with the exchange of high-level visits between the two countries. At the political level, South Africa’s foreign policy towards Iran has been shaped and influenced by the African National Congress, the ruling party of South Africa. Since the apartheid era, the party’s political ideology found inspiration in Iran’s “revolutionary” regime and its anti-imperialist ideals. As a result of the ideological affinity between the ANC and Iran’s ruling elite, South Africa has been among the few countries that lent political support to Iran during its protracted negotiations with world powers over its nuclear program. In addition, it supported Iran’s accession to the BRICS, the gathering of major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.  The relations between the two countries were further cemented following Iran’s Foreign Minister, Mohamed Javad Zarif’s visit to South Africa in October 2017. Iran’s chief diplomat headed a high-level delegation that participated in the 13th joint commission between the two countries, as well as the South Africa-Iran business forum. The visit’s aim was to encourage South Africa to resume banking relations with Iran to strengthen the economic and political ties between the two countries.  In addition to its affinity with Iran’s “revolutionary” ideals, South Africa’s foreign policy moves towards its Iranian ally were motivated by its heavy dependence on its oil exports. For many years before the imposition of sanction against Iran in 2012, the latter represented 27 percent of South Africa’s oil imports. And immediately after the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the 5+1, South Africa announced its intention to sign trade and oil deals with Iran.  Increasing South Africa’s military exports to Iran is also among the goals pursued by South African leaders. South Africa is aware of Iran’s appetite to modernize and strengthen its military capabilities and seeks to carve in a spot for its military companies. Iran’s open door to South Africa  Iran appears appreciative of South Africa’s support for it while it faced heavy economic sanctions from the United States and the European Union. Speaking at the 2017 business forum, the Iranian Foreign Minister lauded the political support that South Africa had provided to Iran throughout its negotiations on the nuclear deal with world powers. The Iranian official went further and pointed out that as a token of recognition from Iran to South Africa, South African companies will have free license to invest in Iran’s economy. “The doors of the Islamic Republic of Iran are open to South African state-run companies as well as the private sector,” he said.  South Africa has been among the first countries to benefit from easy access to Iran’s economy following the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear program on October 18, 2015. Less than five weeks after the signing of the deal, South African telecommunications company the MTN Group obtained 49 percent of stakes in Irancell, Iran’s second major cellphone company. The South African conglomerate — which between 2011 and 2013 was headed by Cyril Ramaphosa, the current President of South Africa — controls 45 percent of Iran’s mobile market where it generates 24 percent of total revenue. As of 2016 Iran’s was MTN’s third major market after South Africa and Nigeria with a revenue that stood at $1.2 billion. MTN’s positioning on the Iranian market seemed to be a reward to South Africa for its longstanding support for Iran and for denouncing the economic sanctions that crippled Iran’s economy for many years. During the 12th meeting of the South Africa-Iran joint commission held in Tehran on May 11, 2015, International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana, condemned the sanctions regime imposed on Iran and described it as “irrational and illegal.”  South Africa’s support for Iran’s nuclear program and its opposition to punitive measures by the West was not mere rhetoric. Prior to the referral of the Iran’s nuclear program to the Security Council in 2005, South Africa left no stone unturned to prevent the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Board of Governors from referring it to the Security Council. Between 2002 and September 2005, South Africa made use of its membership of the IAEA Board of Governors to urge the international community to prioritize dialogue with Iran and to avoid any attempts to punish it or isolate it. When the Iran nuclear program came under the purview of the Security Council while South Africa was member of the Security Council in 2006-2007 it reluctantly voted in favor of the resolutions aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program.  When we put all these intricate economic, political and geopolitical interests linking Iran and South Africa in the balance, it appears abundantly clear that the reason that South Africa decided to retract its initial support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid has a direct link to Rabat’s decision to sever its ties Tehran.  American priorities  The claim that South Africa has succumbed to the American President’s pressure overlooks both this aspect of Pretoria’s ties with Tehran, as well as its past decisions to go against the U.S foreign policy in matters that are of utmost importance to the Washington foreign policy establishment.  If South Africa were to fear any American pressure, it would have done so when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened last December to withhold financial aid to countries that planned to vote in favor of the General Assembly resolution condemning his move to transfer the US embassy from Tel Avis to Jerusalem. Immediately after this statement, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikey Haley, sent a letter to 180 members out of the 193 members of the Security Council saying that she will be “taking names” of countries that planned to vote against her country.  Despite all the pressure the U.S. put on its partners throughout the world, it failed to deter them from voting in favor of the resolution. Among the countries that voted for the resolution was South Africa. Chief among all foreign and domestic policy issues on Trump agenda, the question of Israel undoubtedly is at the top. If Trump were to take retaliatory measures against countries that do not support the U.S., he would do so against those who condemned his move to transfer the US embassy to Jerusalem. This appears more plausible when one knows that Sheldon Adelson, the person behind Trump’s move, is his biggest donor and one of the biggest donors to the Republican party.  Based on these elements, there is not a shadow of doubt that South Africa’s decision to withdraw its support for Morocco 2026 signals a clear repositioning of Pretoria’s foreign policy in favor of its traditional allies, namely Iran, Algeria and the Polisario. Additionally, this repositioning herald the emergence of new geopolitical fault line in the Middle East and North Africa pitting Morocco and its traditional allies (U.S, France, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar) against an axis formed by Algeria, South Africa, Iran, and its proxy Hezbollah with the support of Russia.

Rabat – Romeo and Juliet like you’ve never seen it before. From May 11-13 the public of Rabat will have the opportunity to discover the most tragic play of Shakespeare in the form of ballet, performed in the National Theater Mohammed V. For their inaugural ballet, the Moroccan Philharmonic Orchestra (OPM) has chosen to interpret Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev’s two-hour version of the tragedy, accompanied by  Yacobson Ballet dancers. Prokofiev’s two-act ballet, written in 1935 and based on Shakespeare’s play, is one of the major works of the Russian composer. OPM’s ballet will be presented in partnership with the Yacobson Ballet, the first independent Russian troupe founded in 1969. Yacobson Ballet will present an intense choreography to portray the Shakespearean tragedy with sixty-five Russian dancers performing live.   The revised Shakespearean tragedy now takes place in a theater where a quarrel is raging between two dynasties of actors. Prokofiev’s ballet focuses on the opposition between classical and modern styles, between tradition and innovation, between the search for a new perspective and the desire to perfect established standards; he unfolds a conflict arising from love and a struggle between ideas and ego. The conflict divides two theater companies: the Capulet Classic Ballet Theater and the Montague Modern Dance Theater. The OPM is a nonprofit association created in 1996, which aims to introduce all forms of classical music to the public in Morocco. With this in mind, the OPM has been producing one opera a year since 2000. Last year, the OPM expanded its experience of performing arts by offering an operetta, “The Merry Widow” by Franz Lehart.

Rabat – Morocco’s social media impact has been tested for the past two weeks in an unprecedented economic boycott of some of Morocco’s most popular consumer product brands. #Boycotters is a trending hashtag that represents the widely spread boycott of the brands of three major popular Moroccan companies.  The French majority-owned Central Danone and Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès, owned by Holmarcom, and AFRIQUIA GAZ, owned by the Akwa Group, are losing this digital battle that has been sweeping Morocco for the past two weeks.  The backlash of the boycott has caused the shares of these companies to plummet as the angry boycotters continue to control their message and focus on their target companies. In a poorly planned attempt to absorb the crisis when it started, an executive at Central Danone insulted the boycotters and called them “traitors” in a video. He later apologized and was presumably fired by the company after he made the situation even worse for Central Danone, whose hashtag #LetItSpoil targeted the company and its dairy products.  It was rumored that Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès lowered the prices for some of its brands for fear that the boycott would spread to other companies and brands owned by Holmarcom. Without any strong digital strategy to respond to the boycott, this was used as an attempt to contain the crisis. The price decrease was reported to have reached 20% to 55% in the last twenty-four hours. The prices were slashed by 20% off the popular brand Sidi Ali, which was targeted in the boycott, and were reduced even more for other brands, such as Bahia.  However, Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès still lacked a proper social media response and exhibited no proper digital communication strategy about the boycott.  In a continuously defiant response to the boycott, Afriquia has neither issued an apology nor lowered its prices, despite a 6% loss in its shares. In an attempt to regain investors’ confidence in the midst of the crisis, the gas and oil distribution company owned by the Akwa Group published its results for 2017 two days ago. The company reported making a 24.2% or 4424 million Dirham increase compared to 2016, distributing dividends of 125 MAD per share. The company, run by the strong Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, remains silent in the digital sphere, displaying no efforts to contain the ongoing boycott.  In analyzing the Moroccan boycott crisis, it is clear that the social media campaign in support of the boycott, spread by ordinary citizens, is far more successful than the actions of the corporate entities in Morocco. The boycott crisis will mark an important milestone in the history of media in Morocco, as the boycotters exposed corporate Morocco’s lack of preparedness. They are causing large losses in corporate profits and are disparaging the professional profiles of executives in some of Morocco’s largest companies.

Rabat – Juan Ignacio Zoido, the Spanish Interior Minister, has highlighted the efficiency of Moroccan-Spanish security cooperation following the arrest of five members of a terrorist cell with alleged connections to ISIS, reported Maghreb Press Agency. The joint counterterrorism operation arrested three Moroccan nationals in Fnideq and two other individuals of Moroccan and Senegalese nationality in Bilbao, Spain, on Tuesday. The members of the cell have been placed in custody while investigations are ongoing to determine other possible suspects. The operation shows the efficiency of the cooperation between Morocco and Spain, whose security services are closely and tirelessly working together to arrest terrorists wherever they are, the minister told the press. “I would like to congratulate Moroccan security services for the anti-terrorism operation which was crowned today by the arrest of five alleged terrorists who belong to a cell meant to perpetrate attacks in Spain and Europe,” said the Spanish top official. After the successful operation, Zoido hailed excellent Moroccan-Spanish relations, especially in the field of counterterrorism.

Rabat- Around one million of Moroccan students attend private schools, making up 14 percent of the student population in the country.  During a meeting of House of Representatives on Monday, May 7, in Rabat, the Moroccan Secretary of State for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Khalid Samadi, reported that students pursuing private education make up 14 percent of the total Moroccan student population.  Samadi also referred to 32 private schools that incorrectly entered exam grades in the national education system, resulting in the loss or inaccurate reporting of grades. However, the education official emphasized that private educational institutions are not rivals to public education, but partners, especially since the implementation of the National Charter for Education and Training. Declared by King Mohammed VI within the framework of “2000-2009 Decade of Education,” the National Charter aims to fight gender and class inequality, reduce the illiteracy rate, improve the quality of education, and develop private education in the kingdom.  The poor conditions of public schools have resulted in Morocco’s ranking amongst the least effective educational systems worldwide, according to UNESCO. Morocco is taking measures to improve the quality of education for all levels as part of the implementation of the strategic vision of the 2015-2030 reform program, in line with the 2016-2021 Government Action Program. So far, the government dedicated more than MAD 70 billion to improve the educational conditions and material resources for university students during the current academic year.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Malika, president of the Moroccan Red Crescent (CRM) has presided over a ceremony in Ain Atiq, near Rabat, to launch Morocco’s Red Crescent week. The launch on Wednesday, reported by Le Matin, came one day after World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. The day is commemorated on May 8, the birthday of Henry Dunant, Swiss founder of the Red Cross. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is the world’s largest humanitarian network, comprising 17 million volunteers and serving 150 million people through its 190 national societies. As is her custom each year, Lalla Malika, sister of the late King Hassan II, presented eyeglasses, clothing, wheelchairs, and crutches to residents at the Ahmed Ben Zayed Al Nahyane Institution. She also gave computer equipment and hygiene products to the Benzekri School in Temara. In a statement to the press, National Coordinator of Programs and Projects of the CRM Mohamed Souali said that the Red Crescent week will comprise activities in different regions and provinces of the kingdom including donations of first aid and volunteer training sessions for disasters or emergencies. As part of the launch, the CRM started a campaign under the theme “The Power of Humanity at the Service of Vulnerable Populations” to benefit Ahmed Ben Zayed Al Nahyane Institution. The campaign aims to serve five thousand people with ophthalmic treatment and donations of clothing, hygiene products, wheelchairs, crutches, and bicycles.

Rabat – If you want to live in the United Kingdom, you have probably considered the possible routes to citizenship, like further studies or work.  You might be surprised to hear that specialists in immigration law claim investment is the best approach to citizenship. Candidates need only to submit an application for the Level 1 Business Owner Visa or the Level 1 Trader Visa. Nationals of states outside the Western European Economic Area and Switzerland who meet the criteria to submit an application are eligible for either visas. If approved, the visa lets you stay in the UK for three years, after which time you can easily seek an extension for 24 additional months. After staying five sequential years in the UK, you may submit an application for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), or long-term residence. Economic Thresholds The Level 1 Business owner and Trader Visa have different economic thresholds. For the business-owner visa, the candidate must have access to GBP 200,500 in capital. On the other hand, there’s a preventative measure  for GBP 50 ,000. It is a beneficial option since it requires a lower investment. Individuals can also develop a business team comprising two candidates. In this setup, the candidates can make an agreement to invest and earn citizenship by each providing GBP 100,500. No Job Offer Required Both the Level 1 entrepreneur and trader visas make it possible for the candidate to set up a solid business in the UK or to invest in an existing business. However, if you immigrate to the UK for work, you will have to obtain a work permit from a particular sponsor. Citizenship by investment depends on the requirement for a job offer and therefore speeds the entire process of submitting an application for permanent residence over the long term. Easy Skill Set Aside from the investment, there are not many requirements to be approved for the Level 1 entrepreneur visa and businessperson visa. The candidate will only need to prove her English proficiency, ability to sustain her stay in the United Kingdom, and pass a health and fitness check to rule out severe illness. Authorization To Bring Your Family While trying to get your personal visa, you can also submit an application for the visas of your dependents, your partner and children under eighteen. Your dependents are inevitably included in the entrepreneur visa plan. Sponsored Content.

Rabat – If you ask any African or Arab who their country should vote for, the vast majority would most likely want their football federations to support Morocco 2026. African and Arab countries willing to go against the will of their own people and vote against Morocco are making a big mistake, as their action will be interpreted by Morocco’s supporters as a vote against the people of Morocco.  Leaders should also understand that fearing Trump’s retaliation is not a winning formula to keep the US on your side.  These countries would be better off hiring someone who understands how America works. They will realize that Trump’s reign is temporary and regardless of their vote, Americans in power know their true friends, their enemies, and those who are labeled “shithole countries” by Trump and his administration. America’s system of dealing with the rest of the world is based on its national security and interests. In other words, America does what is best for America. Those Arab or African leaders who believe that stabbing their fellow Arab and African nation in the back will place them closer to the current US administration are making a big mistake.  Take Macron, the president of France, for instance. Recently, he was honored by Trump at the White House, and he even made a major speech on Capitol Hill to the US Congress. He did not return to France to revoke France’s support for Morocco 2026 because France is a strong country with values and history.  Only weak countries are afraid of a bully and will do anything to please the one in power. Trump does what’s good for Trump: he fired his own friends and allies, and if other Arab or African nations thinks that Trump will be their savior, then they have much to learn about how America works under this president. To the  African leaders who will follow South Africa’s lead, let it be known that the South African government has just stabbed another African nation in the back after promising their support for Morocco 2026. The South African government has broken FIFA rules by interfering in their football federation (SAFA), which previously pledged its support for Morocco 2026. SAFA President Danny Jordaan said, “It is an old myth that Africa doesn’t have the capacity and naysayers should stop using the political argument.” He pledged that he will personally lobby the Council of Southern African Football Associations (COSAFA) and the rest of the continent in support of the Moroccan bid. If the South African government defied its own football federation, what do you think it will do for a fellow African nation?  When South Africa decided to retract its support for Morocco 2026, it wasn’t a real surprise, it was more of a disappointment.  But it is a surprise that Saudi Arabia will not support Morocco 2026, after Morocco sent its soldiers and F16 jets to Saudi Arabia to defend the Saudi people. It’s a surprise, but not really shocking considering their recent treatment of Qatar. To the Gulf countries that intend to follow Saudi Arabia, fear your own people who are adamantly for Morocco 2026, don’t fear Trump or Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed Bin Salman. Trump will not be there for you forever. The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent any institution or entity.

The event, which took place Tuesday in the presence of the ambassador of Morocco to the Kingdom of Norway, Lamia Radi, and several diplomatic and cultural personalities, is a part of Qotbi’s two-day visit during whichhe had meetings with many museum directors and officials in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture.

Rabat – Saad Abid has done it. The Moroccan Youtube sensation, who challenged himself to meet 26 celebrities in 26 countries in 26 days to support Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid, has finally secured the support of soccer legend Lionel Messi. Abid is asking 26 soccer celebrities to inflate a balloon, symbolically inflating the hopes of Moroccans to host the 2026 World Cup. In the previous episode where he flew to Barcelona for a very special meeting with the superstar Barcelona player, Abid was prevented from seeing Messi, who was held up in another interview. Eto’o,who arranged Abid’s interview with Iniesta,called to say Abid could meet Messi the following day. On the third day of his #Maymkench2026 (I can’t) challenge, Abid was anxious to meet the Argentinian football superstar. The ambitious fan released a video on his social media  as he prepared to meet Messi and request his “breath” for Morocco. “Before going in, I really want to thank you, Eto’o. You are the one who made this challenge possible from the beginning. Thank you so much,” said the supporter. After waiting for 3 hours, Abid finally met his idol who signed the inflated balloon and nominated two footballer players for the next step of the challenge: Nouha Dicko and Lucas Hernandez. Saad Abid took the opportunity to convince other FC Barcelona players to sign the balloon, such as Samuel Utiti and Nélson Semedo, who said “Morocco is a great country,” and sent his regards to the Moroccan people. Supportive statements backing Morocco 2026 continue to pour in, as thirty-four days remain until the 68th FIFA Congress, when international football federations will cast their votes for the 2026 World Cup host on June 13. Saad Abid, a fervent defender of the environment, has pledged to calculate all the CO2 emissions generated by his travels in order to plant the number of trees that will cancel out his carbon footprint. Abid will recruit several young Moroccans to join him in his ecological approach raise awareness of sustainable development. And of course, Abid will produce a new video each day, recounting his adventures around the world.

Rabat – Morocco’s high-resolution satellite imaging is shifting power relations across North Africa. Nearly a month ago, when discussions on the Western Sahara reached their peak at the UN Security Council, Moroccan representatives at the UN provided the Security Council with unprecedented proof—high-resolution satellite images—of the many Polisario Front intrusions in the buffer strip. Some in the international community, especially the notoriously pro-Polisario axis, perceived the images as fake news, unfounded narratives aimed at discrediting and criminalizing the separatist group. Algeria’s foreign minister, for instance, dismissed Morocco’s evidence in an interview with France 24, calling them fabricated proof to challenge the legitimacy of the Polisario Front and sabotage the UN-led negotiations. However, as UN officials would later reveal in a statement urging Polisario separatists to respect and uphold the terms of the cease-fire agreement by withdrawing from the buffer strip, Morocco’s visual proof was eventually accepted as authentic. That the Polisario Front has orchestrated military maneuvers in restricted areas east of the Moroccan defense wall was a well-known fact to anyone well-versed in the decades-long Western Sahara question. When Nasser Bourita met with UN Security General Antonio Guterres in mid-April this year, Morocco’s concerns went beyond mere accusations, “allegations,” or the blanket condemnation that Morocco typically delivers. Instead, the Moroccan foreign affairs minister, Nasser Bourita, handed the UN official a documented file of high-resolution satellite images illustrating that, in addition to military maneuvers, the Polisario Front was actively developing its facilities in Tindouf, with a number of “administrative buildings” already established. A week later, both the UN Secretary General and his personal spokesperson, the French diplomat, Stéphane Dujarric, called on Polisario to refrain from military actions and respect the spirit of the military agreement N.1. This statement followed Mr. Dujarric’s previous statement denying any evidence of the separatist military transgressions. These new images document threats to Morocco’s territorial integrity and ensure that all threats are visible to national and international observers. Launched in early November 2017, the Mohammed VI-A satellite is Morocco’s second functioning satellite. However, in terms of quality and performance, the five-month old device is by far the North African country’s premier satellite. The Mohammed VI-A satellite operates from Kourou, in French Guiana, at the Centre Spatial Guyanais. It is Morocco’s first satellite dedicated to high-resolution imaging, with high resolution Imager (HiRI) playloads that can perform a resolution of up to 70 centimeters and 28 inches. In addition to the quality of its images, Mohammed VI-A, can capture over 500 images on a daily basis and update its data every six hours, providing an important update in the threat identification capabilities of Morocco’s intelligence agencies. As the satellite is expected to operate for five years, one spatial security specialist told Moroccan outlet le360 that Mohammed VI-A is already offering considerable and unprecedented advances to Morocco in its deep-rooted regional rivalry with Algiers. Despite its recent acquisition of a Chinese satellite, the specialist asserted that the Algerian military will require “at least four years” to develop a satellite with capabilities similar to those of Mohammed VI-A. Considering how Moroccan officials and security experts continue updating technology during those years, the specialist suggested that Mohammed VI-A may have “irreversibly” swung the North Africa’s regional balance of power in Morocco’s favor. Although the satellite project received sizable support from France in its early phases, the satellite has been totally monitored by more than 100 Moroccan national engineers since its launch in November 2017. The specialist further explained that these top-performing engineers studied at two of the country’s best information and documentation agencies and received “three years of solid training in total discretion.” When Morocco announced that it was cutting off diplomatic ties with Iran last week, the move hardly shocked national and international observers, due to the polar ideologies of the two countries, both politically and religiously. Beyond ideology, however, Morocco’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, linked Morocco’s decision to clear and “indisputable evidence” of the Tehran-backed Hezbollah military support for the Polisario Front. Though Algiers, Hezbollah, and Tehran have all denied Morocco’s accusations, calling them “unfounded allegations” and “unconvincing pretext,” Morocco’s foreign ministry insists upon its ” irrefutable evidence, including names, images, and particular incidents.” Although Bourita did not say whether Mohammed VI-A played a role in the Iran incident, many specialists and journalists have suggested that the “irrefutable proof” and images that the minster mentioned were likely taken from the satellite’s database. This new technology transcends Morocco’s verbal condemnation that has historically characterized its response to Polisario’s transgressions in the Western Sahara. The implementation of new technology like Mohammed VI-A allows Morocco to present its receipts to the UN and other international institutions and demand a shift in status quo of separatist escalations.

Rabat – The US State Department has condemned “Iran’s support for Hezbollah and other terrorist groups.” Referring to Morocco’s decision to sever diplomatic ties with Iran, the US State Department told the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that its condemnation is partially linked to Morocco’s decision to sever ties with Iran and its “destabilizing” regional action. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, announced the nation’s decision to cut diplomatic relations with Iran due the country’s alliance with the Hezbollah movement in a press conference on Tuesday, May 1. Furthermore, the Moroccan government announced the existence of detailed evidence of Hezbollah’s military training and arms delivery to the Polisario Front on May 2. The US State department added that Iran “remains a designated State Sponsor of Terror and Hezbollah remains a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.” “The United States seeks our partners’ support to neutralize Iran’s destabilizing influence, constrain its aggression—particularly its support for terrorism and militants—and restore a more stable balance of power,” the statement concluded. The announcement comes on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s decision to end US participation in the Iran nuclear deal, announced Tuesday evening.

Rabat- Capitalize on digital business opportunities, open doors to the close-boundless opportunities in African markets, and increase Africa’s connectivity—these were the driving themes of the Transform Africa Summit, recently held in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali. The summit, which kicked off on Monday, welcomes over 4,000 delegates from 75 countries—most of them African—to discuss economic trends and promote policies and regulations needed to propel the continent in the global “ongoing digital revolution.” According to organizers, the theme, “Accelerating Africa’s Single Digital Market,” will entail the promotion of intra-African exchanges by establishing seamless communication channels among African countries. Speaking to the press prior to the event’s opening economic forum on Monday, Jean-Philbert Nsengimana, special advisor to the executive secretary of Smart Africa, said that this year’s summit is different, as it puts an emphasis on the efficient use of information and communications technology (ICT) to promote life-transforming businesses on the continent. “The inaugural economic forum will discuss how to use ICT to drive the African Continental Free Trade Area,” he said, explaining that further discussions will concern tech innovations, smart cities, space, satellite technologies, artificial intelligence, and cyber security. As crypto-currencies and cybercrimes are on the rise globally, many of the panelists who spoke at the summit underscored the importance of interconnectivity and integrated response capabilities to face continental challenges. Harmonizing policies and cooperating on tech innovations, they emphasized, will help facilitate the continent’s economic integration. Amrote Abdella, Microsoft 4Afrika’s general manager, called Big Data the “new oil,” saying that ICT are more than ever needed to support sustainable development at national and continental levels. “It’s instrumental to get the right policies in place to make the single digital market a reality…how do we build capacities and right skills as well as enabling environment for the youth, startups and entrepreneurs to thrive and become globally competitive? Technology plays a critical role.” Throughout the discussions, the shared sentiment among the continent’s ICT stakeholders was that policies should be implemented to allow technological innovations to drive the continent’s socio-economic transformation. President Paul Kagame, the African Union’s incumbent chairman, who was also present at the economic forum, echoed the same sentiment. President Kagame called for a more digitally-connected Africa, arguing that free movement and free enterprise can only materialize when communication channels are functional and effective. “We want free trade in Africa. But who trades? Business people. It’s time for our people to start trading freely across the continent as Citizens of the continent. This is why we need free movement of goods, people, services and capital,” he said. The summit is set to end on Thursday.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump backed out of the international Iran nuclear deal Tuesday evening, to the consternation of many US allies. The deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was agreed between Iran and the US, UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany in July 2015, and signed by former President Barack Obama, Trump’s predecessor. Though plagued by criticism in the US, the deal marked the conclusion of a decade of careful diplomacy between the UN Security Council and Iran, in which Iran agreed to stop its nuclear program in exchange for relief from UN, US, and EU sanctions. Trump’s announcement means that the US Treasury will reimpose lifted sanctions, “subject to certain 90 day and 180 day wind-down periods,” making the US the first country to breach the JCPOA. While Trump insists that Iran has breached the “spirit” of the deal, the White House has given no indication that Iran violated the deal first. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said April 12, that he had “seen no evidence that [the Iranians] are not in compliance today.”  Leaders of France, Britain, and Germany met Trump’s unilateral move with a joint statement expressing “regret and concern.”  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian insisted “the deal is not dead. There’s an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there.” Indeed, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he would continue to “negotiate with the European countries, China and Russia in the coming weeks.” But Rouhani warned: “I have instructed the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation to take the necessary measures for future actions so that if necessary we can resume industrial enrichment without limit.” Iran’s regional rivals, including Israel, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain, applauded the move. It remains to be seen how Morocco, which cut diplomatic ties with Iran on May 1, over Iran’s ties to Hezbollah, a known Polisario Front supporter, will respond.

Rabat- After US and Guatemala, Paraguay has announced its decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem at the end of May. Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Emmanuel Nahshon, wrote on his Twitter on Monday that Paraguay will move its embassy to Jerusalem by the end of this month. “Paraguay will open its embassy in Jerusalem until end of May ! President [Horacio] Cartes will open the embassy !” Expressing joy for the decision, the official said this is a “Wonderful news as the international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital gathers momentum. Gracias Paraguay por su amistad.”  BREAKING!!- Paraguay will open its embassy in #Jerusalem until end of May ! President Cartes will open the embassy ! Wonderful news as the international recognition of #Jerusalem as #Israel’s capital gathers momentum. Gracias Paraguay por su amistad ?? ?? @IsraelMFA — Emmanuel Nahshon (@EmmanuelNahshon) May 7, 2018  On Monday, the US embassy installed signs in Jerusalem indicating the direction to the old US consulate building, which will house the new US embassy headquarters. The US is planning to inaugurate its embassy on May 14. The Trump administration’s decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem followed the US president’s announcement in December 2017 to recognize Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel and relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city. Guatemala was the first country that vowed to follow in US’ steps and move its embassy to Jerusalem two weeks after Trump’s decision, announced on December 5, 2017. Trump’s decision has sparked a backlash in the region and was widely condemned by Arab and Western countries alike. Global leaders, including King Mohammed VI, denounced the US decision, considering it a significant threat to peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel. Despite condemnation from Arab and Western nations, Trump is standing firm behind his decision. In February, the US President said in an interview  with the Israeli newspaper, Israel Hayom, that “by taking Jerusalem off the table I wanted to make it clear that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and as for specific boundaries, I would support what both sides agree to.” On December 21, the United Nations General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution that rejects President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel capital and to move the US embassy to the holy city.

Washington D.C. – As more information becomes available, Morocco’s decision to sever ties with Iran starts to make sense. According to the well-connected French journalist François Soudan, the source of the crisis between Rabat and Tehran is Hezbollah’s new covert operations in Algeria to retaliate against Morocco’s decision to arrest Beirut financier Kassim Tajideen in behest of the Americans. According to Reuters quoting a source in Rabat, “Tajideen was arrested on March 12 at Casablanca airport on an arrest warrant issued two days earlier by Interpol’s Washington office for alleged fraud, money laundering and financing of terrorist activities”. He was subsequently extradited to the United States. “Tajideen and his brothers, Ali and Husayn, lead a family business that has dominated poultry and rice markets, amassed real estate, and is reportedly active in construction and diamonds in Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and western Africa, where Tajideen settled in Sierra Leone with his family in 1976. The three brothers were added to the U.S. government’s terrorism sanctions list in 2009 and 2010 for their prominent support of Hezbollah”, according to the Washington Post. However, the souring of relations between the Shi’a militia began earlier, after news stories of a visit of high-ranking Polisario representatives to East Beirut emerged in the Lebanese press.  Iran, not too happy with the Morocco’s close relations with its arch-rival Saudi Arabia, decided to reach out and endorse the Algeria backed Polisario fighting the Moroccans in Western Sahara. The Hezbollah’s overtures did not stay political. Right after the arrest of Tajideen, the Shi’a militia elevated their assistance by sending surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and military advisers to the Algerian desert to upgrade Polisario’ s military capabilities against the Moroccan Air Force. Hence, Mr. Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, visit to Teheran was not to inform the Iranian of the Kingdom’s decision to cut ties but rather a chance for Iran’s Minster of foreign affairs to explain Hezbollah actions in Algeria. Mr. Javad Zarif’s silence on the activities of his embassy in Algiers was an endorsement of Hezbollah’s hostile conducts in Algeria. Mr. Bourita complained specifically about the anti-Morocco activity of Iranian diplomat Amir Moussaoui known for his intelligence work for Hezbollah in Algiers. Rabat had no choice but to close its Embassy in Tehran. It is true that the Lebanese Shi’a movement operates in area where Shi’a population live and tend to stay away from inter-Arab conflicts unless its interests are threatened. Nevertheless, Morocco’s decision to arrest a Hezbollah operative and extradite him to the U.S. put Rabat on the militia’s hit list. This new diplomatic crisis between Rabat and Tehran is different from previous ones. It is not about Shi’ite proselytizing or a plot to export the Iranian revolution, it centers rather on a specific plan by Hezbollah to use the Polisario militia to extract revenge on Morocco for its decision to transfer a Shi’ite banker to the US. The news of Hezbollah’s plots to use Algerian territory to destabilize Morocco came as a surprise to many Algerians, even though the Algerian military is the chief patron of the Polisario that has been waging a war against Morocco for years. The fact that Lebanese nationals used the Iranian embassy in Algiers to send money and weapons to the Sahrawi separatists sounded the alarm among ordinary Algerians who always suspect Iran’s’ true motives in North Africa. Numerous analysts continue to qualify Morocco’s action as a product of Saudi pressure. Yet, recent news reports in media close to the Moroccan Ministry of foreign affairs clearly show that the decision was a  response to Hezbollah ’s hostile actions directed by Iranian operatives from Algeria to destabilize the Kingdom.

Rabat – The Ministry of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs decided to dismiss the imam of Mosque Ibrahim Alkhalil in Salé on May 4, for preaching against increasing prices on food products and the ongoing boycott in Morocco during Friday prayers. When Imam Mustafa Al Mouhri delivered his sermon (khotba) about the ethics of trade in relation to current political and economic circumstances in Morocco, he did not expect to receive a strong state response. The Ministry of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs indicated in a statement published Monday, that it has dismissed the preacher, “who is a retired professor, for his repeated violations to the ‘Guide of the Imam and Preacher,’” which prohibits the discussion of social issues that are borderline “political.” The statement added that the imam has previously discussed topics outside of the scope of his authority and publicly apologized, referring to his sermon on the Eid al-Fitr, June 26, 2017. The ministry further stated that this is not the first time that it has warned preachers to avoid political issues in their Friday sermons. Across the country, other imams have also been banned from delivering sermons due to “political speech,” including Yahya Almdaghri, who spoke about the Hirak movement in the northern Rif region of Morocco in February 2016. The ministry’s decision to dismiss Al Mouhri adds to the backlash surrounding the online boycott against the high prices of three companies: Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone and Afriquia gas station. Moroccans took to their Facebook pages to denounce the ministry decision. One facebook user wrote that the ministry took “Sale’s residents by surprise by sacking the imam.” The same commentator said that the imam has always delivered sermons related to high commodity prices in conjunction with the holy month of Ramadan.  Several other internet users echoed the sentiment. The boycott, which demands that the three sector giants cut the prices of their products remains to date. No official statements have been released, with the exception of an official apology by Centrale Danone, following a statement made by its purchasing director, Adil Benkirane calling boycotters “traitors.” Consumers have not let up, despite Centrale Danone’s apology statement, as the boycotters have vowed to maintain their protest until the companies cut prices.

Rabat- In 2018 and 2019, Morocco’s fiscal deficit is expected to narrow slower than in recent years, according to a new report by BMI Research.  The report reveals that Morocco’s fiscal deficit will “shrink over 2018 and 2019, although more slowly than in recent years,” due to Morocco’s growing revenue, government subsidies, and public wage expenditures, which will soon improve the government’s fiscal position. On the downside, the report anticipates that the government’s spending on several projects in line with Morocco’s five-year development vision may disrupt the country’s fiscal balance. BMI, a member of the Fitch Group for macroeconomic, industry, and financial market analysis, also expects fiscal consolidation to slow as the government will miss its 2018 target of a budget deficit at just 3.0 percent of GDP. The government set the target to reduce its deficits of debt stock, but BMI predicts the budget deficit will come in at 3.3 percent of GDP in both 2018 and 2019, albeit down from 3.6 percent in 2017. The report continues in an optimistic tone, stressing that the slowly shrinking fiscal deficit will decrease Morocco’s debt-to-GDP ratio. With respect to the government’s revenue, BMI forecasts that it will experience continued growth over the upcoming quarters at 3.6 percent in 2018 and 3.2 percent in 2019, down from 5.2 percent in 2017 when it accelerated with strong GDP growth which widened the tax base. The budget focused on business-friendly tax cuts instead of revenue-raising measures for 2018 and expectations for revenue growth have been lowered to 4.0 and 3.5 percent respectively in 2018 and 2019. BMI points out that the government’s efforts to improve the fiscal balance through limited spending are paying off. Morocco slashed food and energy subsidies between 2012 and 2015, in addition to the implementing an organic budget law. BMI insists that cutting the government wage bill “will strengthen budgetary monitoring and accountability” and “increase contractual employment.” Despite the good news, BMI warns that increased spending will hinder fiscal consolidation and offset wage spending gains. Government spending on wages increased from 18.7 of its total spending in 2013 to 24.5 percent in 2017 and will continue at this rate in future years. Not only that but also the government’s initiatives such as the green project dedicated to reducing “the impact of drought through innovative technology [provided] to small-scale farmers” will consume increased funds in 2018 and 2019.

For their 10th wedding anniversary, Debbouze wanted the world to know how much he loves his wife. “10 years of love,” wrote the comedian to his 1.1 million followers on Instagram, capturing a beautiful moment with his sweetheart.  10 ans que je l’aime… ?????? A post shared by  Jamel Debbouze (@jameldebbouze) on May 7, 2018 at 7:40am PDT  Jamel Debbouze tied the knot with French television host Melissa Theuriau in 2008, in both Paris and Marrakech. They are the happy parents of Léon, 9, and Lila, 6. “The first time I saw her was on television,” recalled the actor in a 2015 interview on French television show “Vivement Dimanche.” “I met her officially on the set of ‘Asterix at the Olympic Games,’ where I was acting. She was there because she was doing an interview. In that moment I knew my life will change,” added the actor of “Les indigenes.” Personal life aside, Jamel Debbouze is also thriving professionally as his last show, “Maintenant ou Jamel,” has achieved great success. After six years’ absence, Debbouze has made a successful return to his favorite playground: the stage.

Rabat- Mohamed Salah’s performance has been astounding this year, leading him to win multiple Player of the Year awards in his first Liverpool season. He’s scored fantastic goals, made assists, and has greatly impacted Liverpool’s game. His grace, pace and clinical finishes have led many soccer legends to place him in the highest pantheon of soccer today, alongside Ronaldo and Messi. For Liverpool fans, Salah’s imposing aura has rendered Coutinho’s absence essentially insignificant. It is almost as if Coutinho were never there in the first place, having quickly become part of the furniture in a Salah-dominated tale of unsuspected brilliance. But even though former Liverpool playmaker Steven Gerard dubbed Salah the best player in the world today, many fans and commentators feel that Salah’s season will be defined on May 26, in Kiev, when the Egyptian and his teammates will take on Real Madrid and their magical Portuguese talisman.  Fans have suggested that the match in Kiev will essentially boil down to a Salah vs. Ronaldo standoff. Following that logic, many believe whoever triumphs in Kiev will be this season’s undisputed hero. And so here we are: the blitzing emerging star vs. the established giant. It all seems as though Ronaldo is standing in Salah’s way to absolute prominence; the Portuguese player is the final opponent Salah must face to earn his place among soccer legends. Amidst the Ronaldo vs. Salah obsession, Salah sees the matter in a very different light, Whether surprised by his own dazzling season or a genuine team player concerned with the team’s success rather than his own triumph, he says Kiev will be Liverpool vs. Real Madrid, not Salah vs. Ronaldo. The Egyptian recently told the press that Liverpool’s success in Europe’s greatest soccer celebration, is due to their collective acumen and the fiery power the team has to strike from every side of the pitch. No single player can claim to be the ultimate shaper of Kloop’s team, Mo Salah suggested. It is a team built on an unyielding esprit de corps, a fervent spirit to win and lose together. Liverpool’s outstanding form is not about Salah alone. What about the underrated fury of Firmino? Or the unstoppable runs of Mané? And who can even say that all of these would have been as effective had it not been for the admirable job of the midfield? What about the defense and the technical staff? It is all about teamwork, Salah explained, adding that on May 26, he will be targeting not the Ballon’ d’Or, but a sixth European trophy for the Reds. “I know all of the Arab people wish the best for me, and they are happy every time I win, but now at the moment I’m only thinking about the final and to bring the trophy to Anfield,” Salah said after the dramatic second-leg against Roma. He added: “It is not going to be a final between Mohamed Salah and Cristiano Ronaldo. I am playing for a great club and we have great players, so qualifying to the final came with great teamwork. I cannot do it alone – it is collective work. When we score a goal it’s because we are all doing good, when we concede it means we all need to work harder.” Salah should be respected for his devotion to the team. Ideally, every player should always put the team first. However, in an era that celebrates individuals (mostly players who score goals and give assists) and obliterates the incredible contributions of other departments on the pitch, all eyes will undoubtedly be set on Salah and Ronaldo when Liverpool and Madrid face off in the Ukrainian capital. Madrid has defied every team in this Champions League campaign. They embarrassed Neymar’s PSG, broke the veteran Buffon’s heart, and made Bayern Munich look like a team that does not know how to score. “Cristiano Ronaldo is the most decisive player in the world,” Buffon said in the immediate aftermath of the Portuguese player’s overhead kick that brought a standing ovation from Juventus’ fans. Metaphorically, though, there was another message behind Buffon’s acknowledgment of Ronaldo’s otherworldly instincts: Real Madrid’s current aura of invincibility is largely dependent on Ronaldo’s unsurpassed propensity to score in the most defining hours. Ending Madrid’s unchallenged triumphalism is Liverpool’s surest way to help their “Egyptian King” terminate the Messi-Ronaldo duopoly in the Ballon d’Or scramble. If Liverpool wins, Salah can hope to for his soccer coronation banquet to be celebrated before Neymar’s. And if he scores the winning goal, he will guarantee himself the Ballon d’Or. In other words, should Salah come triumphant out of his confrontation with Ronaldo, witholding the game’s highest individual accolade would be an outrage that UEFA—however corrupt—wouldn’t dare. A perfect season needs something to flaunt, a trophy. Salah got the Premier League’s Player of the Year award. But that is not enough for absolute greatness. To be considered among soccer’s most defining players, the trend-setters, Salah needs more than the validation of the Premier League’s players. So, on May 26, the Egyptian should give his utmost to block Ronaldo. Or, better yet, he should prevent Ronaldo from blocking him.

Rabat – Moroccan international player Mehdi Carcela has been named “Belgium’s Best Lion” of 2018, according to several sports media outlets. The distinction rewards the best Arab player of the Belgian championship. “I would like to dedicate this award to my coach, Ricardo Sa Pinto, who does a great job,” said the Standard of Liege player when he received his award. “What we realize, nobody expected. That’s what I wanted to do by signing at Standard, I wanted to give a beautiful image to the club,” added the Atlas Lion, who actively participated this weekend in the victory of Standard (5-0) against Genk, scoring two goals and delivering two assists. By receiving this award, Carcela hopes to get the attention of Morocco’s national team coach Hervé Renard, who will give his list of 35 shortlisted Moroccan players on May 14 for the World Cup. “By coming back in Standard, I was hoping to be taken in for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. I constantly try to show that I have the qualities to be there,” said the football player. Mehdi Carcela-González, 28, is a midfielder for Standard Liege. He was born in Liège, Belgium, to Moroccan and Spanish parents. Carcela’s football career started at the age of 5, at Standard Liège youth academy. He played for various youth teams at the club until signing with Standard Liège on a 4-year contract at age 19. In September 2008, he made his debut for the club in a 2-0 win against K.V. Kortrijk. Later, Carcela debuted in a European competition  in a UEFA Cup match against Stuttgart.  During his first season, Carcela started in 15 matches and won the Belgian League and Belgian Supercup.  In 2010 the midfielder featured in 44 matches and scored 14 goals, and won the Belgian Cup with Standard Liège. In 2011, Carcela signed for the Russian club Anzhi on a three and a half year contract. Two years later, the Moroccan returned to his former club. Carcela started his international career with the Belgian U-16 team and eventually made it all the way up to the senior national team. However, at the age of 21, the midfielder experienced a change of heart and decided to play for Morocco’s national team.  In January 2012, Carcela debuted with the national team in the Africa Cup of Nations. Most recently, the footballer joined Morocco’s national team for the Africa Cup of Nations in 2017.

Rabat- According to a recent study released by the Madrid-based think tank, Elcano Royal Institute, nearly half of the jihadists arrested or killed in Spain in the past five years were Moroccan-born or of Moroccan descent.  The think tank, which analyses world events and trends from a Spanish, European, and global perspective, explored the prevalence of Moroccans suspected of engaging in Islamist terrorism activities in Spain between 2013 and 2017 in a study entitled “Moroccans and second generations among the jihadists in Spain.”  Elcano’s 2013-2017 database on jihadists in Spain reveals that approximately 46 percent of the 233 people arrested or killed for alleged involvement in terrorism related activities in Spain are Moroccan nationals. Those of Spanish nationality represent nearly 37.9 percent, while the rest are made up of 19 other nationalities. The figures also show that six out of ten people in this study are second generation descendants of Moroccan immigrants, who were radicalized and recruited in the Iberian country by various Islamist cells or networks.  According to the report’s authors, Fernando Reinares and Carola Garcia-Calvo, the majority of those detained for suspected terrorism offences came from provinces and cities located in the northern Rif region of Morocco, and they blame the spread of jihadism on the Rif’s economic woes and substandard social conditions.  The study further notes that Spain’s north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla are the biggest hub of jihadist activity on Spanish territory. The cities are the birthplace of almost 73 percent of all detainees who were convicted of jihadist terrorism or who died in suicide attacks in Spain in the time period studied.  Further, the authors postulate that jihadists’ involvement in terrorist activities comes in response to spatial segregation and social marginality as well as, unemployment, illiteracy, delinquency, and the lack of urbanization, which denotes an effective absence of state authority in both cities.  In mainland Spain, Catalonia, especially Barcelona, was also recognized as a jihadi hotspot. Of all foreign jihadists arrested across Spain, 14.3 percent were detained within this metropolitan area.  The Spanish think thank recognizes that Catalonia is increasingly known as a centre of extremism, with nearly one third of ISIS-linked arrests in Spain made there. Furthermore, Spanish authorities identified the region as a “major Mediterranean centre of radical Islamist activity” and a “magnet for terrorist recruiters,” such as al Qaeda and Ansar al-Islam.  The study notes that four out of 10 jihadists sentenced or killed in Spain in the selected time period had resided in Catalonia.  Extremism thwarted in the homeland Although a large majority of the jihadists in Spain are currently Moroccans or second generation descendants of Moroccan immigrants, the authors indicate that it is easier for someone of Moroccan origin to engage in terrorist activities if he/she resides in Spain than in Morocco, due to Morocco’s relative success in containing its own domestic jihadism threat. In the aftermath of the 2003 suicide bombings that occurred in multiple locations in Casablanca, Morocco has devoted considerable resources to preventing t violent Islamism at home by implementing a mixture of tight security measures, in-depth intelligence gathering, and religious reforms. Morocco strengthened security at borders and implemented anti-terrorism laws, imposing heavy jail terms (up to 20 years) and fines on people returning from the Islamic State battlefields in Syria and Iraq. Morocco’s counter-terrorism strategy may make it difficult for jihadi groups to operate in the country.  Issandr el-Amrani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, told the Financial Times last year that “Morocco has been very successful at driving deep underground any major al Qaeda or ISIS group.” “There hasn’t been a single successful attack since the formation of ISIS [in 2014]. Moroccan jihadis have largely gone to fight abroad, rather than stay at home because the security lockdown is too pervasive,” el-Amrani said.  However, the prevalence of Moroccan expats among the perpetrators of high-profile attacks sparked concerns in recent years that the country is becoming a breeding ground for jihadists.  Elcano claims this “implies that an existing problem in Morocco is projected on our country [Spain],” recalling that eleven of the twelve suspected accomplices in the Barcelona and Cambrils attacks which killed fifteen people on August 17, 2017, were Moroccan-born or of Moroccan descent, and the twelfth was  from the Spanish enclave of Melilla, according to Spanish authorities.  Abdelhak Khiame, head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations, believes the reasons for radicalization are far from being related to the jihadis’ birthplace but rather to the environment in which they were raised. Khiame told the BBC two years ago that the radicalisation of Moroccan youths in Europe was “due to factors in the countries where they live.” “Yes, these people have Moroccan roots but they were born, grew and acquired values from Western countries,” he said.  “Even their education in Islam was not carried out by those who [teach religion] in Morocco.”

Rabat – The International Sports Press Association (AIPS) has reacted to South Africa’s decision to rescind its support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. The article, titled “South Africa challenges FIFA with government order on World Cup vote,” followed a statement made by South African Minister of Sport Tokozile Xasa, who publicly announced that her country “cannot support Morocco.” The comment is a remarkable departure from South Africa’s first statement, posted on April 16, when President of the South African Football Association Danny Jordaan promised to lobby Africa’s soccer leaders to promote the Moroccan bid. AIPS linked South Africa’s about-face with a tweet posted by  US President Donald Trump in April, threatening countries supporting Morocco’s bid. “South Africa’s government showed every sign of running scared from  United States Donald Trump after backtracking at high speed on a pledge to back Morocco’s bid,” wrote Keir Radnedge, AIPS Football Commission Chairman. Radnedge further said that the world’s soccer governing body (FIFA) may “face demands to consider disqualifying” South Africa from the vote, scheduled to take place at the 68th FIFA Congress on June 13, in Moscow. South African Minister of Sport said that the country’s policies cannot allow a vote in favor to Morocco to happen. “It is the mandate of the country and it is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is.” According to FIFA’s regulations “Discrimination of any kind against a country, private person or group of people on account of ethnic origin, gender, language, religion, politics or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.”  This is not the first time that South Africa has denied its support for Morocco 2026. Last week, South Africa’s Football Association published a statement denying that it had supported the Moroccan bid. AIPS further stated “now that the South African government has expressed a clear partiality, the country’s vote in FIFA Congress would appear to have been compromised irrevocably.” Many countries from all the corners of the world have already promised support for the Moroccan bid, including Saint Lucia, Qatar, Botswana, Nigeria, Kenya, Belgium, France, Egypt, Tunisia, and Russia.

Rabat – South Africa has made its stance on the 2026 World Cup race clear: the South African Football Association (SAFA) will likely support United 2026 in the vote FIFA World Cup bid vote next month. Yesterday, South African Minister of Sport Tokozile Xasa said that it is “an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is.” Following the threatening tweets of US President Donald Trump last month, South Africa has broken its silence and announced the reasons why it will not cast its vote for Morocco 2026. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the reason is political. “We are very clear that we cannot support Morocco,” the South African official said. Quoted by South African news outlet Times Live, the Minister continued, explaining that the country’s parliament “was very straightforward in this regard, it is the mandate of the country, and it is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is.” Diplomatic relations between Morocco and South Africa have been rocky ever since Morocco withdrew its ambassador from Pretoria in 2004, when Pretoria recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Commenting on the April 16 statement in support of Morocco, delivered by the President of the South African Football Association (SAFA), Danny Jordan, Xasa said, “there is so much competition to host these kinds of events in Africa. This is why you can hear Danny Jordaan saying I am going to assist [the Moroccan bid].” These comments follow similar statements by South African Football Federation that denied its support for African bid on May 3. South Africa’s change of heart came only one day after Morocco announced its decision to cut ties with Iran due to the country’s political interference in Morocco’s internal affairs.  The proximity of the two developments raises questions linking these two events, especially considering South Africa’s strategic partnership with Iran, consolidated through dozens of bilateral investment agreements.  SAFA’s National Executive Committee (NEC) recently released a statement, announcing that the 2026 World Cup bid decision will be made by the federation alone. It added that the federation received presentations from both parties competing to host the 23rd tournament in 2026. “SAFA wants to reiterate that no decision has been taken at this stage on the matter on who to support,” said the statement, emphasizing that none of its officials have announced the federation’s position on any bid. The statement contradicts an April statement posted on the official federation page, which has since been deleted from the website. However, a tweet posted by the federation confirms SAFA’s original support for the Moroccan bid.

Rabat – Rabat will convene the members of the African Union Peace and Security Council (PSC) on May 9 and 10 for a seminar on “Improving the working methods of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union.” Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Mohammed V University of Rabat are organizing the two-day event to reaffirm Morocco’s determination to tailor the PSC’s work to counteract the many challenges and threats facing the continent in peace, security, and conflict prevention, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Elected to AU’s Peace and Security Council in January, Morocco promised to give special attention to terrorism prevention, fighting violent extremism, and post-conflict reconstruction. The seminar will include four roundtables and a closing session and aims to tackle the challenges hindering the continent’s development as well as discussing measures to curb those issues. The seminar will also cover measures to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the council, to strengthen the role of the PSC mediation and conflict prevention. Since April, Morocco has held a seat in the PSC for a two-year term. A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time noted that Morocco’s strategy will also prioritize socio-economic development and South-South cooperation, which constitute bedrock principles of the union, as well as a “condition sine qua non for peace, stability and prosperity in Africa.” As a member of the PSC, Morocco also aims to fight human trafficking and to ensure food and environmental security on the continent.

Rabat – The Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) has managed to secure its phosphate shipment back from South Africa, where it was detained on May 1, 2017, after Polisario claimed that the cargo was illegally taken from Western Sahara. The Executive Vice President and General Council of OCP Group, Otmane Bennani-Smires, said in a statement,“Today, after unsuccessful attempts to sell the cargo, the refusal of all potential buyers to acquire this merchandise is clear and irrefutable proof of the illegitimacy of the property granted by [South Africa’s High] Court in Port Elizabeth to Polisario.” After handing a pro-Polisario verdict against the Moroccan phosphate shipment, the court opened an exclusive bid auction in March to sell the detained 55,000 tons of phosphate cargo, which had been transported on the NM Cherry Blossom from the Marshall Islands. The court decided that “phosphate ownership has never been legally held by the Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) and/or Phosphates de Boucreaa SA,” because the cargo was deemed illegally obtained in Western Sahara. Historically, South Africa has supported the Polisario Front and has recognized the so-called Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic since 2004, which has contributed to political tension between Morocco and South Africa. According to the statement, the shipowner bought the cargo by paying legal fees and returned it to OCP for a nominal dollar. OCP group denounced South Africa’s High Court decision, which had prevented the group from selling the phosphate cargo to Ballance Agri Nutrients Limited of New Zealand or any other international firm. Morocco World News co-founder Samir Bennis wrote in May 2017, that the detention violated international law, which holds that foreign ships cannot be held unless they constitute a threat to the port country. After the shipment seizure in South Africa, the Polisario Front made a similar complaint against OCP cargo in Panama. However, a Panama court denied the Polisario’s claims of ownership on grounds of “insufficient evidence” and released the cargo.

Rabat – Hervé Renard and the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) have set the record straight about a leaked list of 35 shortlisted Moroccan players. Officially set to be released on May 14, Renard’s list has been circulating on social media for over 24 hours, after being shared by Arabic sports media outlet Almarssad. “A list of 35 shortlisted circulates on social networks. It is a fake one. The real list will be sent by the FRMF to FIFA mid-May,” wrote the French coach on his Twitter account. Renard will release his final list on June 4.  FRMF also addressed the rumors, saying that the list will only be released on FRMF’s official website and on the official Twitter page of the Moroccan national team.  In an interview granted to Channel France 24 a few days ago, Hervé Renard said that there should be no surprises in the list, as it is almost finalized. “There is a large majority of those who are going to the World Cup who are already here. Then there will be the final list of 23 players on June 4,” he said. After the tournament begins on June 14, the Atlas Lions will first battle Iran on June 15. The team will face Portugal in their second game on June 20 and will complete first round in a match with Spain on June 25.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled five-member active terrorist cell with alleged connections to Daesh, in collaboration with Spanish authorities on Tuesday.  A statement by Morocco’s Ministry of Interior said today that the five suspects are aged between 22 and 33 and active between Morocco and Spain. The BCIJ and Spanish authorities carried out the arrest operations in Fnideq, a city in northern Morocco and Bilbao in northern Spain. The operation,  which is part of the cooperation between the Moroccan and Spanish security services against terrorism, allowed for the arrest of three Moroccan members in Fnideq and two other individuals of Moroccan and Senegalese nationality in Bilbao, Spain. Authorities seized knives, military uniforms, and electronic equipment, during the arrest operation. According to initial investigations, the members of this cell were in contact with fighters from Syrian-Iraqi terrorist cells and were recruiting young people hoping to join the Daesh ranks in order to commit terrorist acts and undermine the security of the countries.  The members of the cell have been placed in custody, while investigations are undergoing to determine other possible suspects. This was the third terrorist cell dismantled in Morocco, after members of two other terrorist groups were apprehended in February and March. On February 21, the BCIJ dismantled a terror cell made up of six extremist supporters of ISIS in Tangier, including one member of the Polisario Front. In March, BCIJ dismantled another terror cell in the cities of Oued Zem, near Khouribga, and Tangier. Investigations revealed that the members–aged 21 and 31 years old–were planning to murder one of their own, after doubting his loyalty to the terrorist organization.

Rabat – Morocco’s Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan is celebrating his 15th birthday today. The prince was born May 8, 2003, the firstborn son of King Mohammed VI and his wife, Princess Lalla Salma, in the Royal Palace of Rabat. As the heir apparent from birth, the prince’s arrival was greeted with a 101 gun salute, as thousands of well-wishers gathered outside the palace gates to celebrate the birth of their future king. King Mohammed VI named the infant Moulay El Hassan in a fitting tribute to his own late father, King Hassan II. Educated at home in the royal palace, the prince has indicated his intention to begin attending the Royal Preparatory High School for Technical Aeronautics (CRPTA) in Marrakech. As a young teenager, the prince takes his royal role seriously. He has presided over numerous events, including the 13th International Agriculture Fair (SIAM) in Meknes; a dinner in honor of former French President Francois Hollande; the 24th International Publishing and Book Fair (SIEL) in Casablanca; and the 5th African Nations Championship of Local Players, a game which Morocco won handily, to the delight of the nation. Prince Moulay El Hassan was notably the youngest participant at the One Planet Summit in France last November, earning him international admiration. Recently, Prince Moulay El Hassan appeared in a picture with his father after King Mohammed VI underwent a successful heart surgery in France. In a cover story devoted to the crown prince, Jeune Afrique proclaimed Moulay El Hassan as “educated to become a revolutionary monarch in the Arab world.” All of Morocco wishes the remarkable young prince a joyous birthday and a wonderful year.

Rabat – “26 celebrities in 26 different countries in 26 days.” This is the crazy challenge set by Moroccan supporter Saad Abid to promote Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid. For his challenge, called #Maymkench2026 (Impossible), Abid is traveling with a balloon half deflated–representing “Moroccans’ state of mind”–and hopes to inflate it with the breath of the personalities he will meet. After meeting the Cameroonian icon and ambassador of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, Samuel Eto’o, last week in Turkey, the football fan flew to Barcelona to have a very special meeting with superstar Barcelona player, Andrès Iniesta.   “I just realized the dream of meeting Andrés Iniesta, one of the most respected players on the planet,” wrote Abid on his Facebook page, adding that he needs the public’s support “because it will not be easy to travel to 26 countries in 26 days to meet 26 celebrities.” “My goal is not only to promote our country internationally but also to generate support among the people,” he added. Abid shared a video of his journey on his Facebook account where he explained his challenge and showed his meeting with Samuel Eto’o and Andrès Iniesta, who accepted the challenge to “breathe” into the balloon representing Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid.  “Morocco is a big country, and more is close to mine. Unfortunately, I have not visited much but I intend to take the time for that,” said Iniesta. Through this promotional campaign, Abid hopes to rally international opinion around Morocco in order to give more weight to the candidacy. Samuel Eto’o was the one who set up Abid’s meeting with Andrés Iniesta. The sports activist was also supposed to meet Lionel Messi, but the legend was held up in a meeting. Later on, Eto’o  called Abidto inform him that he could meet Messi the following day. To be continued then! Supportive statements backing  Morocco 2026 continue to pour in, as only forty days remain until the 68th FIFA Congress, where international football federations will cast their votes for the 2026 World Cup host on June 13.

Rabat – Algerian officials and activists have been urging recently the Algerian government to expel Iran’s Cultural Attaché to Algeria, Amir Al-Moussawi, for his alleged “dangerous and suspicious” actions in the country. The online animosity against the Iranian official comes only six days after Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran for its involvement in the country’s internal affairs. On Thursday, Morocco’s government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, announced that Morocco is in possession of evidence verifying collusion between Hezbollah and a member of the Iranian embassy to Algiers who carries an Iranian diplomatic passport. The alleged member, according to El Khalfi, facilitated communication and meetings between Iranian ally, Hezbollah, and Algerian military officials and provided them with all logistical facilities to travel to Tindouf camps and meet Polisario officials. International news sources, including Algerian news outlets, have pointed out the connection between recent Moroccan-Iranian tension and the “suspicious” actions carried out by Al-Moussawi in the country. Former Algerian officer Nawar Abdel Malik believes that Al-Moussawi is the cause of the new tension between Tehran and Rabat. “Since 2015, we have been warning Algeria from the Iranian embassy, but the Algerian authorities have ignored this, despite serious information we have presented in our campaigns against Amir al-Moussawi, because of his suspicious activities in a diplomatic crisis with Morocco,” said the former officer. “Whatever the extent of disagreement between the rulers of Algeria and Morocco on various issues, especially the Sahara issue, they must unite against Iran’s destructive project targeting the Maghreb identity and works to destabilize the Maghreb national security. The damage will affect Rabat, Algeria, Tunisia, Nouakchott, and all North African countries,” he added. Former Algerian adviser to the Minister of Religious Affairs Adda Fellahi commented on al-Moussawi’s alleged moves in the country, and urged the Algerian authorities to expel the Iranian official for the benefit of  Algeria’s interests. The official wrote on his Facebook:  “I think that – in order to preserve the public interest, it is necessary for the Cultural Attaché of the Iranian embassy to personally initiate [the process], and ask to be relieved of his duties and his position. “ According to the Algerian official, the Iranian’s actions “have become a source of concern and pose many critical and embarrassing questions, even for Algeria’s security interests.”  The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, voiced Morocco’s decision to cut relations with Iran on May 1, explaining that Hezbollah offered military training to the members of Polisario in the Tindouf camps in Algeria. In an attempt to deny its implication, Algeria summoned Morocco’s ambassador to Algiers and condemned Bourita’s statements. Algeria’s reaction, however, did not take Morocco by surprise. The Moroccan Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement a day after its announcement to cut ties with Iran, saying that “it understands Algeria’s embarrassment,” as Morocco has documented proof that demonstrates Hezbollah’s connection with the Algerian-backed Polisario.

Rabat – President Donald Trump said the United States will be “watching very closely,” as he called on the same African nations that he previously deemed“shithole countries” to support USA’s joint 2026 World Cup bid. Considering his past statements, many assumed that African countries would come out in droves to support Morocco’s bid. Instead, since Trump’s threat, no African country has pledged support to Morocco.  Needless to say, Morocco has been very active in the last decade helping other African countries improve their economies and with 2.57 billion dollars of foreign direct investment, Morocco is the first in Africa’s 2017 Investment Index. As soon as President Donald Trump spoke, South Africa obliged. The South Africa Minister of Sport and Recreation Tokozile Xasa, announced, “We are very clear that we can’t support Morocco,” adding, “ Our parliament was very straightforward in this regard‚ it is the mandate of the country and it is an obligation for sporting bodies to understand what the country’s agenda is.” South Africa prides itself as one of the most active defender of Africa’s causes, even though this recent action reveals that it is not above stabbing the back of another African nation.  Despite past differences, Morocco prides itself on prioritizing the needs of other African nations. We should help each other in time of need and not be at the mercy of a bully. While United 2026  has received the endorsement of all South and Central American countries for 2026, Morocco has yet to receive more than few votes of support from the 54 African countries.  Morocco has been at odds with Algerian leadership for more than 5 decades, and yet, they are still supporting the Moroccan bid. Algerian leadership understands that a vote against Morocco is a vote against the Moroccan people. The Algerian people would never forgive their leadership, had they endorsed United 2026. African countries are not the only ones hesitant to support Morocco; Arab nations have displayed mixed responses, as well.  Saudi Arabia–a state that Morocco typically defends tooth and nail–chose the 2026 World Cup bid to retaliate against Morocco for being neutral during the kingdom’s previous political breakdown with Qatar. While the Arab League and the OIC came out in collective support of Morocco’s bid, not many individual countries from these 2 organizations have come out in full support of Morocco. Most African and Arab countries are secretly hoping that FIFA disqualifies Morocco before the final vote, so that they won’t have to consider disappointing Trump.  However, this will not happen. FIFA was supposed to send another group of inspectors to Morocco, and as of today, they have not shown up. Gianni Infantino, the FIFA head has apparently decided to let the vote to take place on June 13.  No one would have expected that France, which maintains an excellent relationship with the United States and Canada, would support Morocco without any reservations so early in the bid process. That’s a real friendship without any calculations. The French people and government are Morocco’s true friends. They have been defending our sacred cause at the UN for decades, and they are not about to let go of the Moroccan people. Moroccans will continue to say “Vive la France!” Meanwhile, Spain is cleverly waiting for the right moment to pledge its support to whichever bid will cause less embarrassment. One thing is sure: a vote against Morocco will not make the more than 700,000 Moroccans calling Spain home very happy.

Rabat – After being denied press cards by the Ministry of Culture and Communication, Yabiladi can finally breathe. As for LeDesk, the French media is still waiting to receive official acknowledgement of their press presence in the kingdom.  “Historical. 7 months of waiting and it took only 48 hours for the Twittoma to speed things up. Thank you for your mobilization to ball, thank you to the friends who supported me and thank you to the Head of gov for his intervention,” tweeted CEO of Yabiladi, Mohammed Ezzouak, this morning.   On Friday, an unknown source leaked a list of online media outlets authorized by the Ministry of Culture and Communication. Facebook and Twitter users were surprised to see that the list did not include French well-known French outlets Yabiladi and LeDesk. Yabiladi CEO Mohammed Ezzouak announced Friday on his Twitter account that the government refused to give press cards to journalists of Yabiladi and LeDesk. “The Ministry of the Com confirmed to me yesterday that we were not entitled to have press cards. 10 journalists who did not find favor in their eyes,” wrote Ezzouak, adding that since press cards are obligatory, he would have to shut down Yabiladi to avoid working illegally. LeDesk also confirmed the information, but thanks to public support, they have been contacted by the Minister of Communication, who promises to address their situation. Social media users, journalists, and media influencers were outraged that the ministry denied press cards to two of the most influential media outlets in Morocco. They expressed solidarity with Yabiladi and LeDesk on Facebook and Twitter. “I invite readers of both sites to express their support by sharing the reasons why they read them, their stories or their experiences with these two media with hashtags #JelisYabiladi #JelisLeDesk,” wrote Reda Zaireg, a political journalist.  Called out by Twitter users, Head of Government El Othmani assured the public that he will be working on “fixing the problem.”  Yabiladi and LeDesk are not the only outlets who have dealt with this issue, as other online media organizations remain in a delicate situation. On Twitter, Médias24 claims to have received only 4 press cards for 12 journalists.

Rabat- Each year, Muslims around the world predict the first day of Ramadan using one of two acclaimed traditional methods: astronomical calculations and moon-sighting. The first appearance of the “hilal,” or lunar crescent, determines the beginning of the month in the Hijra Islamic lunar calendar, as Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) said:  “Do not fast until you see it [the crescent] and do not break the fast until you see it, and if it is covered then complete the month.” Weather conditions and the distance between the sun and the moon affect the visibility of the crescent to the naked eye. Cloud cover, in addition to the proximity of the sun and moon, can obscure the crescent sighting. As a result, the first day of Ramadan and other Islamic celebrations like the Eid vary across Muslim countries. The entire Islamic world anticipates the emergence of the crescent moon in the night sky to mark the start of the Ramadan fast the following day.  Some experts apply precise astronomical calculations to predict the first day of the holy month, in order to augment the direct visual sighting method. The synodic, or lunar, month takes about 29.53 days to transition from one new moon to the next. After the conjunction with the sun, the new crescent moon is visible.  Many Muslim countries, like Morocco, Saudi Arabia, India, Iran, China, Oman, apply only local sighting. On the other hand, countries like Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Turkey, and Tunisia primarily rely on precise astronomical calculations for their religious predictions, including the timing of the waning moon and its precise position between the Earth and the sun.  This year, according to Moroccan astronomers, the crescent will appear on the evening of Wednesday May 16; Ramadan will commence Thursday, May 17. Recently, Moroccan astronomer and researcher Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani told Morocco World News that all Muslim countries will fast the first day of Ramadan in unison on May 17, a rare incident. He explained that the crescent will likely remain hidden on Tuesday, May 15, the day that countries like Saudi Arabia have predicted for the moon’s appearance. Regarding other important Islamic holidays, astronomer Dr. Hicham El Issaoui has predicted that Eid al-Adha will occur on Wednesday, August 22, and that the first day of the Islamic year, Fatih-Muharram, 1440, will occur on Tuesday, September 11. The birthday of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Mawlid al-Nabi al-Sharif, will be celebrated on Tuesday, November 20, 2018. Ramadan month can last from 29 to 30 days during which Sunni Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, while Shiites wait to break their fast until the redness of the sun disappears from the sky. Ramadan is not only a month for Muslims fulfill one of the pillars of Islam through abstinence from food and drink: it is also a time for spiritual cleansing and reflection.  As the messenger of Allah said, as narrated by Imam Al-Bukhari: “When Ramadan enters, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hellfire are closed and the devils are chained.”

Rabat- Earlier today, the people of Jerusalem woke up to newly installed road signs reading “US Embassy” in English, Arabic, and Hebrew pointing to south Jerusalem, where the new United States Embassy will open on May 14. At least three “US Embassy” signs were set up, pointing to the old US consulate building that will house the new US Embassy, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.    The same source notes that street signs often fall prey to political vandalism by both Arabs and Jews, erasing names in Arabic or Hebrew, which suggests that the new signs may also face the same outcome. On his official Facebook page, Mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat posted a photo of himself next to a new sign and wrote: “This is not a dream – it’s reality!…I thank President Trump for making this historic moment come to fruition. Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people – and the world is beginning to recognize this fact.” 

In line with Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel and upon his request, the US Embassy, previously located at 71 HaYarkon Street in Tel Aviv, has been relocated to Jerusalem and will be inaugurated on May 14.

Rabat – Etihad Airways of the United Arab Emirates has delivered 1.2 million passengers between Morocco and the UAE since the launch of direct flights the two countries in 2006. Etihad’s Vice President for Commercial Affairs, Mohammed Abdullah Al-Bloki, underscores the strong ties between Morocco and UAE, including language, common values, and cooperation in the fields of tourism and trade. In a statement to the UAE-based newspaper, Al-Ittihad, Al-Bloki expressed his gratitude to “the various governmental bodies in the Kingdom of Morocco for their great efforts to increase the level of close cooperation.” He further said that “We are proud of the great contributions made by the Moroccan talents and the various expertise in developing the work system.” Morocco’s Minister of Tourism, Handicrafts, and Air Transport, Mohammed Sajid, also commended Morocco-UAE relations in different areas, added Al-Ittihad. Sajid said that the Emirati carrier has accomplished many impressive successes globally, which place it among the best international airlines. The company’s increase in flights to Morocco corresponds with a growing number of tourists. Said added that this step will reinforce business ties between Morocco and the Emirati airway, opening a door for more business projects to serve the interests of both countries and enhance trade exchange. The airline launched its first Abu Dhabi-Casablanca flight on June 2, 2006, according to Al-Ittihad. “The airline provided [originally] four weekly flights between the two cities via the Airbus A330-200 and then increased to five flights per week.” In March 2013, Etihad Airways increased its flights to Casablanca and launched a new daily round-trip flight between Abu Dhabi and Casablanca. In 2016, the airline announced that it would expand its presence in Morocco by launching two new weekly flights between Abu Dhabi and Rabat to provide a direct link between the two capitals via an A340-500 airplane. Earlier this month, Etihad Airways also introduced its Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to serve its daily flights from Abu Dhabi to Casablanca.

Rabat – The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) voiced full support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid to host FIFA’s biggest sporting event. The decision to support Morocco’s bid took place during the 45th Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the OIC held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on May 5-6, with Morocco ’s participation. The OIC includes 57 member states from all corners of the world, including Europe and Asia. OIC also includes Saudi Arabia, which has not yet decided which bid it will support. In a recent interview with CNN, the head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Federation Turki Al-Sheikh emphasized that the Saudi vote will be cast in its best interests. Speaking about the United 2026 bid, Al-Sheikh said that the US is Saudi Arabia’s “biggest and strongest ally,” commending the 1994 World Cup in the US for generating a massive number of soccer supporters. The Saudi official implied that Saudi Arabia’s vote will go to the US. When Beki asked him directly if he was referring to supporting the North American bid, Al-Sheikh answered: “You are intelligent Beki. You can read between the lines.” It remains to be seen whether Saudi Arabia will support Morocco’s bid or that of its “strongest ally,” especially after Donald Trump’s now-infamous threatening tweet. In his tweet, Trump said “would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid.” Trump’s tweet may have made an impact already, with South Africa recently retracting its support for Morocco’s bid. On May 3, the South African Football Federation denied its support for Morocco’s bid, deleting a previous statement in April that had promised Morocco its vote. Less than two months before the final vote to host the World Cup, Morocco was able to gain the support of several African, Arab and even European countries: France, Belgium, Russia, Luxembourg, and Serbia have already publicly endorsed Morocco 2026. The list of Arab countries that supported Morocco’s World Cup bid includes Palestine, Qatar, Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria. Botswana and Nigeria also promised to give  Morocco their votes. On April 15, Arab nations buoyed Morocco’s hopes to host the World Cup during the 29th Arab Summit, which took place in Saudi Arabia. The summit, which saw the participation of Morocco’s Prince Moulay Rachid,  voiced unanimous support for Moroccan 2026 “and called upon all states to provide full support for Morocco,” Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita told the press after the symposium.

Rabat – Travelers from Agadir will soon be able to sail to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. According to a statement released by several Spanish media, a maritime route  between Tenerife and Agadir will be available soon, as announced by Carlos Alson, president of the Tenerife Island Council, on Thursday. Alonso, accompanied by Tenerife’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Delia Herrera, traveled to Morocco to reinforce the friendly relationship between the Canary Islands and Morocco, and, in particular, with the city of Agadir, which has collaborated with Tenerife on many sector project. Alonso is confident that this new route will strengthen the islands’ relations with Morocco. Alonso toured the port in Agadir, explaining his intention to establish a maritime route for the transport of goods and passengers, based on the study he carried out three years ago in the Port Authority of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. “It seemed like a dream and we realized it. Tenerife already has 2 airlines with Casablanca and Agadir. Now, a new step has been taken by the Island Council of Tenerife to make the Tenerife-Agadir maritime route  a reality, opening up new opportunities!” tweeted Delia Herrera. Alonso met with representatives of strategic economic sectors and the mayor of Agadir, with whom he analyzed the cooperation projects between both territories. “It is about updating the data and defining together with the Moroccan authorities the type and conditions [transport goods, location, etc.] of line,” the president said. The friendly relationship between both territories has consolidated and strengthened relations between the Canary Islands and Morocco, specifically the Souss Massa region. The new maritime route will add a third connection between Tenerife and Morocco, on top of  two air routes, operated by, Royal Air Maroc and Binter, which serve Tenerife from Casablanca and Agadir.

Rabat- The chairman of the US bid has denied that US President Trump’s recent “threatening” tweet will harm the United 2026 World Cup bid.  Carlos Cordeiro, the president of the US Soccer federation, said the tweet was not a threat, but rather, just the president’s way of supporting his country’s efforts to host the World Cup. In part, Trump’s tweet said, “It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us…” While some interpreted the tweet as an exercise in extortion and blackmailing, Trump added insult to injury two days later when he specifically addressed African countries on Monday. Speaking at the White House during the visit of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, Trump called Africans to stand with the US bid. “We will be watching closely,” the president warned. Mr. Cordeiro, however, insists that neither the tweet nor the White House address are “damaging” to North America’s World Cup candidacy. Speaking to Reuters, Mr. Cordeiro, who is also the chairman of United 2026, the US/Canada/ Mexico joint bid for the 2026 hosting rights, said that President Trump did not mean to threaten FIFA voters (national federations) when he tweeted a message that targeted countries “lobbying against” North America’s “strong bid.” Although the tweet was understandably shocking (no one had expected Trump to treat soccer with such concern), Mr. Cordeiro explained that FIFA voters and other observers should simply view it as Trump’s “usual rhetoric.” “I don’t see it as threatening,” he said. “I think you have got to appreciate how he says things. I think what was implicit in what he said was that he would like to see people support our bid and that is what I like my head of state to say.” The US Soccer president also hinted at a tendency in the media to overanalyze or disproportionately scrutinize anything President Trump says. “Mexico and Canada tweeted on the same day and no one talks about their tweets. But the reality is that all three heads of state have been very vocal in support of our united bid. I think that is fantastic.” “It doesn’t damage us,” he said, and mentioned the impressive help the bid has been receiving from the American government. Each bid requires support and cooperation from its government, he said, adding that geopolitics and President Trump’s global unpopularity will not prevent the bid from attaining its goal. “We’re going to get strong support across Europe regardless of the geopolitics.”

Rabat- Morocco’s High Commission of Planning (HCP) recently presented a report on the link between training and employment, in hopes of broadening government awareness about the quality of training and increasing job opportunities in Morocco. In its report, which was postponed from the scheduled launch date on April 18, the HCP explains that the difficulties of domestic job market integration are likely tied to the imbalance between job requirements, quality of training, and the qualifications guaranteed by different diplomas. The HCP traces statistics to the period between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, during which time the country created 116,000 jobs–39,000 in rural areas and 77,000 in cities.  These job growth included new employment opportunities in the agriculture and fishing sectors (50,000) and the construction sector (43,000). As a result, the total number of employed people in the country is up to 10,882,000, marking an increase by 6,000 in urban areas. However, percentage share of unemployment in the country increased from 10.5 to 10.7 percent: 15.7 in cities and 3.5 percent in rural areas, which translates 30,000 unemployed individuals in rural areas. As it stands, the economic sector employs two-thirds of the active population, despite declines in employment levels. Meanwhile, employment in trade jobs is estimated by 19.6 percent; 17.8 percent in sectors of healthcare, administration, and education; 17.3 percent in automotive repair services; and 14.0 percent in extractive and manufacturing industries. The report reveals higher levels of general education–which typically ranges from elementary school to college–correspond with lower likelihood of employment are, as half of the active population (estimated at 52.2 percent) are not degree holders, compared to the 34.2 percent of unemployed degree holders. Furthermore, the active population is 52.2 percent of the total population, 47.8 percent of whom have received the primary school certificate. On the other hand, 65.8 percent of the inactive population, estimated at 34.4 percent of the total population, are primary school graduates. According to the 2014 General Population Statistics, which maintains a record of graduation rates in Morocco with the aim of providing research facilities, the active population in the country is divided into three categories: unemployed graduates, middle-school graduates who are employed, and highly-qualified post-graduates, which includes masters and PhD degree holders, senior technicians, engineering graduates, preparatory classes students, and well as undergraduates. The unemployment percentage in the highly-qualified category ranges from 15.1 to 22.4 percent: 18.9 percent of bachelor’s degree graduates, 15.9 percent for masters degree holders, 7.7 percent for engineering graduates, and 3.9 percent for medical graduates. Regarding the link between employment and job type, a high majority of the employed population are manual workers in non-agricultural fields, at 72.4 percent. Workers from two job categories suffered a decrease in employment: 20.9 percent of housekeepers and the workplace cleaning staff and 15.1 percent of tradesmen.   Across all sectors, the study details that the demographic of potential workers between the ages of 35 and 44 are the more likely to be employed than those age 15 and 24.

Washington D.C – Morocco’s rough gallop during last month’s United Nations Security Council deliberations on the Western Sahara proved the final straw.  The reluctance of certain supposed friendly government, namely Russia, to understand Morocco’s predicaments at the UNSC was a testimony that the Moscow-Tehran-Damascus axis would back ally Algeria at the expense of Morocco regardless of Rabat’s good relations with the Russian Federation. Rabat’s sobering diplomatic quagmire at the U.N.  was the catalyst behind the conception of a new geopolitical view.  A view that matches the tough, rough and take-no-prisoners attitude of Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Since King Mohammed VI’s goodwill diplomatic détente with Algeria seemed to hit a brick wall, Moroccan officials decided to raise the tone and went into the attack confronting enemy governments. Consequently, the kingdom’s decision to cut ties with Iran is part of a larger plan to reshape Morocco’s foreign policy tactics. It became evident to  Rabat the importance of belonging to a coalition of countries that would back its positions when it matters the most. In brief, Morocco espouses M.B.S. aggressive anti-Iran policy and puts the spotlight on Algeria’s support of the Mullahs, Hezbollah and Bashar al-Assad. Moroccans stand firmly behind their allies who form the American-Saudi-Emirati alliance. Saudi support to Morocco, at this sensitive phase of the Sahara conflict, is crucial and imperative under the leadership of M.B.S. Algeria’s long-running record of supporting unsavory governments went unchecked for years. Nevertheless, with the arrival of M.B.S. on the scene, it is time for each country to choose a camp. The policy experiment of using the Polisario to harass Morocco has failed. Today, the Algerian military has to stand along Iran, Hizbollah and Bashar al-Assad and answer for Tehran’s belligerences around the world. While the facts that Iran sent advance weaponry to the Polisario separatist movement fighting Morocco on behalf of Algeria and that Hizbollah is training fighters in North Africa are in dispute, the reality that Iran and its proxies remain the forces that fuel Algeria’s war against Morocco is undisputable. Last month when the UNSC veered toward the Algerian version, it was the United States and France that came to the rescue. Thus, the Trump admiration and President Macron are Morocco’s true friends and their agenda should be sustained. For many Moroccans, pictures of Polisario missiles paraded on or near Algerian territory and shown with pride on Algerian national television is a constant reminder of the war threat coming from the eastern borders. After all, these surface-to-air missiles (SAM) were paid for and transported by Algerians for the purpose of hurting Moroccans. Last month, the Moroccan-Algerian relations reached dangerously high levels when Morocco threatened military actions to repel Polisario militia who infiltrated the UN-patrolled buffer zone in Western Sahara. It is depressing to write but the fact is, in case of war, Morocco will lean on the Saudis and the Emirati to help against the Algerians and their supporters. Therefore, Iranian Scud missiles attacks fired by the Houtis in Yemen on Saudi capital Riyadh is an attack on Casablanca. Furthermore, the Iranian threat to the security and stability of Bahrein and Shia’ s on-going interferences in the affairs of Iraq, Syria and Lebanon represent a clear and present danger to the stability of the region including North Africa. While this crisis must be resolved completely through trilateral meeting among Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario, Rabat needs to prepare for the eventuality of armed hostilities no matter how unlikely it could occur. Standing with M.B.S. gives Morocco a solid cover when push comes to shove.

Rabat – Algeria remains Africa’s largest military importer, spending three times as much on defense equipment as Morocco, according to a 2018 report issued by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The report, “Trends in world military expenditure 2017,” estimates that the world’s arms spending stood at USD 1,739 billion in 2017. The globe’s military expenditures in 2017, according to the report, are at the “highest level since the end of the cold war.” Although Algeria decreased its military expenditure by 5.2 percent between 2016-17, the country remains Africa’s largest importer of military arms, spending USD 10 billion.  The report opines that the decline in Algeria’s military spending is related to “low oil and gas revenue in recent years.” SIPRI added that this was the first decrease in Algeria’s military spending since 2003. SIPRI’s report does not feature Morocco’s military expenditures. However, in a previous report on international arms transfers, SIPRI listed Morocco as the second largest arms importer in Africa, at the rate of 12 percent of African arms imports from 2013-17. The Polisario Front has been involved in illegal military actions in the region until last month, when the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 2414, pressuring the separatist group to withdraw from the region. The resolution urges Polisario Front’s main supporter, Algeria, to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict, after a long series of Morocco’s condemnations of Algeria. Algeria is not only an importer of arms. For decades, Morocco’s eastern neighbor has been exporting armored vehicles and weapons to Polisario. Furthermore, Algeria has refused to cooperate in the United Nations-led political process to find a solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara, despite its long-term support of the separatist group. However, Algeria is no longer hiding its support for the self-proclaimed Polisario Front. In May 2017, the Algerian government delivered a generous number of arms to Polisario, escalating the conflict in Western Sahara. On April 2, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressing his deep concerns over Algeria’s denial of its involvement with Polisario. “It is Algeria that hosts, arms, backs up, and brings diplomatic support for the Polisario,” said the King. This is not the first time that Morocco condemned Algeria’s involvement in supporting the separatist group. On May 2, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation announced its decision to cut ties with Iran and has unveiled “detailed evidence” of a delivery of military equipment from Iranian ally Hezbollah to the Polisario Front through Algeria. Polisario, Algeria, and Iran have denied a coalition. The Moroccan ministry, however, stands firm in its argument, presenting evidence, including names and documented action, that implicates Iran. Algeria condemned the ministry’s statement, but Morocco’s ministry labeled Algeria’s reaction predictable. “We understand Algeria’s embarrassment, as Morocco has documented proof that demonstrates Hezbollah’s connection with the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.”

Rabat – Mehdi Benatia is much courted. Olymique Marseille (OM) is not giving up on recruiting the Moroccan soccer player and has sent its people to negotiate with Juventus for the summer transfer window, according to Tuttosport. The French manager of OM, Rudi Garcia, has asked for the defender of Juventus, remembering his collaboration with AS Roma a few years ago when he was Benatia’s coach. In order to recruit Benatia, OM will have to spend more than EUR 25 million. Originally formed at OM, could  Morocco’s team captain wear the French club colors this summer? Juventus doesn’t seem to agree. Benched in the last two days of Serie A by his coach Massimiliano Allegri after his mistakes against Real Madrid and Napoli, the 31-year-old player was rumored to be on the chopping block at the Italian club. According to local media however,  the sports director of Juventus Beppe Marotta has shut down the rumors once and for all, saying Benatia isn’t going anywhere.. Asked about the Moroccan player by Mediaset, Marotta said: “I’m not concerned. We play on all fronts and we must have a minimum of rotation in the team. The players who are on the bench are as strong as those who are on the ground.” Benatia, also called “El Capitano,” has a lot on his mind with the World Cup coming. Leading Morocco’s Atlas Lions, Benatia will battle the Ukrainian, Estonian, and Slovakian teams only a week prior to the kickoff for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Benatia, 31, has spent most of his career in Italy, where he has played for Unidese, AS Roma and Juventus. He joined the latter on loan from German football giant Bayern Munich. Earlier this year, Benatia was voted best Maghreb player in 2017 by France Football, ahead of Algeria’s Riyad Mahrez and Moroccan player Hakim Ziyech.

Rabat – More than 7000 Moroccan women took the admissions test to become public notaries (adoul) on Sunday. Public notaries in Morocco, similar to lawyers, typically handle the paperwork for a multitude of transactions, including sale of property, marriage contracts, and commercial contracts.  The position of adoul (a public notary official) was traditionally held by a religious man certified by the government to draft marriage papers and manage inheritance matters. The number of total candidates, both men and women, selected to take the examination was 18,948, according to a statement from the Ministry of Justice. The tests are held in ten institutions located in several cities across the country: Rabat, Casablanca, Tangier, Fez, Marrakech, Oujda, and Agadir. This exam follows the unprecedented decision by King Mohammed VI on January 22 to open up the position of adoul to women candidates.  His announcement at the Council of Ministers and instruction to the Minister of Justice Mohammed Aujjar to take the necessary measures to accomplish it served as a formal acknowledgment of the skills and capabilities of women throughout the country. Following the announcement, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would create up to 800 jobs for Moroccan men and women wishing to become public notary officials. The ministry said in its statement that women taking part in the exams applauded the royal decision, which gave them the opportunity to participate in the social project under the auspices of the King. The statement added that the change is designed to promote equality and equity in society. The royal decree allows Moroccan women throughout the country to carry out several duties in accordance with the Islamic law (Sharia), such as documenting witness testimony in courts and handling inheritance cases and real estate transactions.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump sparked a backlash in France and Britain after his gun law’ speech to the National Rifle Association (NRA) on Friday. In his statement, Trump said that easy access to guns in France and Britain could have helped prevent deadly attacks in Paris in 2015 and knife crime in London. Trump mimicked the 2015 Paris deadly attack and said if people were carrying arms “it would have been a whole different story.” “They took their time and gunned them down one by one… Boom! Come over here… Boom! Come over here … Boom!” said the President. The French government slammed Trump’s comments, urging the US President to apologize. CNBC quoted a statement issued by French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that “France expresses its firm disapproval of President Trump’s comments about the Paris attacks on Nov. 13, 2015 and demands that the memory of the victims be respected.” The ministry added that the French government is “proud” of its strict gun control. The Minister of Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire denounced Trump’s comments, urging Trump to “retract his words and express regret.” The minister described Trump’s comments as “shocking and not worthy of the president of the world’s greatest superpower,” he told BFM TV on Sunday. In March, hundreds of thousands of people rallied the streets of the US capital for the “March for Our Lives,” calling for stricter gun control in the country. The march came on the heels one of the deadliest attacks in the US, which took place in Florida at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, claiming 17 students. The Washington Post estimated in 2015  that there were 357 million firearms in the US in 2013 “40 million more guns than people.” The news source added that estimate does not include “firearms that enter and exit the country illegally, and guns that break down, or are lost or destroyed.” Most recently on April 22, four young adults were killed at a Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee. Prior to that, a lone gunman sniped at the audience of an open-air country music concert in Las Vegas, killing more than 50 people and injuring more than 400 others. The gun safety is a cause of major concern in the US, especially as the US submitted its joint bid with Canada and Mexico to host FIFA 2026 World Cup. Since the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, massive rallies have brought protesters to the streets and government offices in US states to condemn the the high death toll due to gun violence and protest against the availability of military-grade weapons and bump stocks, in addition to the absence of a universal background check requirement in the majority of states.

Rabat – Angry comments of Moroccan football fans have not gone unnoticed. The German-based multinational corporation, Adidas, will release a new design of the official kits of the Moroccan national team for the 2018 World Cup. Adidas will release the new design between May 22-24. In an interview with Moroccan TV channel 2M, FRMF spokesman Mohamed Makrouf announced that the new design is being prepared and will be officially released between May 22-24. The official kits for the Moroccan team shall be featured during a press conference in the presence of media and a group of Moroccan footballers. In recent weeks, Moroccans have been expressing their anger over the Adidas design for the Atlas Lions jerseys. The public has shaken networking services, including Twitter and Facebook, mocking the uniforms. Moroccan football fans were not the only ones to denounce the Adidas design kits. Former Moroccan footballer Abdeslam Ouaddou also voiced his concern over the kits, asserting that they require further development. Slamming Adidas, Ouaddou said that the company should have devoted more time and energy to an appropriate design suitable to the Moroccan public. After the online storm, news sources speculate that FRMF president may cancel the contract with Adidas for non-compliance with the contract term, according to Moroccan newspaper Assabah. Adidas’s executive committee agreed to delay the official release of the Atlas Lions’ World Cup jersey to avoid forgery. Citing Adidas’s concerns, Al Massae added that there might be “counterfeit duplication of the kits” if uncovered before the opening of the Russia FIFA tournament. Adidas unveiled the first version of the kits on April 26. The jerseys are simple: mostly white with accents red and green, representing the Moroccan flag.

Rabat – After the Hirak protests of the Rif and Zagora and more recently in Jerada, Moroccans need to find another form of civilian resistance to fight those who “own the country” and, ultimately, hit them where it hurts the most: their businesses and profits. The prices of consumer goods have been rising at an alarming rate in the last five years, while the salaries have not increased at all. As a result, the working class citizens are the most affected. They are living in total unfavorable conditions, with no hope of improvement in sight. The government—unable to scrap the remaining subsidies of such foodstuffs as bread, oil, sugar, and butane, for fear of facing a popular uprising—is resorting to increasing prices of other products, including petrol. Two Moroccos, two different speeds In the past, right after independence, there were three social classes: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Today, the situation has changed tremendously. There are only two classes left, miles apart from each other: the very rich made up of the Makhzen families, military top brass, co-opted politicians, and nouveaux riches, who made their wealth from corruption and embezzlement; and on the opposite side is the class of survivalists, comprised of the former middle class, the poor, and the very poor. As a matter of fact, since the beginning of the third millennium, Morocco has split into two Moroccos, each one cruising at a different speed: The Morocco of the Golden Triangle comes from the colonial Maroc Utile, which has expanded its territory lately. It starts in Tangier and goes all the way to Laayoune from north to south, then from Casablanca to Fes from west to east. Beyond that are the rural areas and the Amazigh Mountains, where poverty exists to an extreme. There is no decent infrastructure, very high illiteracy, no means of independent subsistence, and rampant poverty. In the past, these regions survived because of employment in Europe, but in the mid-1980s, Europe closed its borders to immigration and the people of these regions fell into total despair, with no jobs and no future for their families. Officially, Morocco encourages foreign investment, but in the Golden Triangle, the lack of adequate infrastructure in the periphery perpetuates the hopelessness in that part of the country. The colonial Maroc Utile instead becomes truly useless and forgotten when it comes to government development programs. Moroccan Slums Even inside the Golden Triangle, not everything is golden when it comes to the life of the total population. Almost every Moroccan city has its own belt of poverty made up of people who migrated decades ago from the countryside because of the drought, hoping to improve their economic status. Instead, they live in utter poverty and are easily recruited by Islamists to carry out terrorist attacks in Morocco or elsewhere or even to join ISIS. This is evidenced by the case in Casablanca in 2003, which was highlighted in the excellent film of Nabil Ayouch, “Horses of God.”[i] Most big cities in the Moroccan Golden Triangle have their own slums, from which we see pickpockets, drug peddlers, muggers, thieves, prostitutes, and cheap labor emerging en masse. In these slums, the living conditions are terrible. The families are usually large and live in over-crowded and unhealthy shacks where sleeping is done in shifts due to the scarcity of rooms and beds. Nobody has yet died of hunger there because the main foods are still subsidized by the government. However, if the government gives in to the pressure of the World Bank, a popular revolution will no doubt ensue. In these poverty belts the common investment is a café, of which there are so many. Poor people often joke by saying that, in the poor quarters, “between a café and a café, there is a café,” meaning there is no serious infrastructure. These cafés are crowded all day by unemployed youth seeking escapist solutions to their predicaments by chatting on their smart phones, watching soccer games on satellite television, smoking hashish, or talking to their friends while waiting for the change that is unlikely to arrive on its own. During the Arab Spring, the Moroccan social movement 20 Février denounced, in massive demonstrations, all the problems of modern Morocco, i.e. corruption, nepotism, embezzlement, patriarchy, and tribalism. Activists called on the monarchy, which is respected and seen as a symbol of stability, to become a true constitutional monarchy through the adoption of incremental democracy. Realizing the strength of this popular uprising, the monarchy revamped the Constitution in 2011 and triggered the devolution of power. The ensuing general elections brought the Islamists of the Partie de la Justice et du Développement (PJD) to power. However, they did not have any real executive authority since the Moroccan electoral system does not permit strong independent parties, but rather parties that must resort to coalition government cooperation. Thus, the Islamists governed for a full term of five years but were unable to enforce the new Constitution or stay true to their electoral platform. Instead, they had their own share of power abuse and sex scandals, just like other secular parties in the past. Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane spent those five years squabbling with opposition parties instead of bringing the programs of his party’s electoral platform to fruition. As a result, the Islamists fell in popularity with the general public, which had originally wholeheartedly supported their policies and objectives. However, in 2016, despite the general public disapproval of their performance, PJD still won more seats in the general elections (125 of the 395 seats in the House of Representatives, a gain of 18 seats compared to the 2011 elections). In contrast, they lost the support of the Makhzen because they could not form a coalition government for almost six months due to the intransigence of the opposition. This was somewhat blamed on Benkirane’s pig-headedness, but in reality the perception of the Islamists’ strength is waning worldwide. The opposition wanted to impose their own man, the rich businessman Aziz Akhennouch, to curtail the Islamists’ influence and potency. The rich population in Morocco has always had access to the Makhzen and its privileges in return for blind allegianceand unquestionable support. Akhennouch and all the rich people of the country are automatically allies of the monarchy and are in agreement with a mutual advancement agenda. The Cyber Hirak The government does not seem to show any signs of wanting to end the grassroots Hiraks of the country peacefully. Instead, it is putting the militant activists on trial and might even condemn some of them to the death penalty to preserve its hiba (loftiness) and state standing. In the face of the intransigence of the establishment and as a further manifestation of the Arab Spring, the Moroccan poor people launched the electronic Hirak, boycotting the products of two rich Moroccan rentiers:  Akhennouch’s dairy products (Lait Centrale, Danone, etc., as well as Afriquia petrol) and Meriem Bensaleh’s popular mineral water (Sidi Ali). In this regard, Safae Kasraoui states forcefully in Morocco World News that:[ii] “Baraka criticized the exorbitant prices of hydrocarbons, ‘which have reached a maximum that citizens can no longer stand.’ While several officials called the campaign a weak plot, Baraka said that ‘the important thing is not to know who is behind the campaign, but rather to understand the message conveyed’ through the campaign. The official said that the campaign reflects the suffering of citizens due to the high cost of living. Several Moroccan celebrities have also expressed their support and solidarity with the online boycott campaign in protest of the rise in commodity prices, including Moroccan divas Asmae Lamnawar, Latifa Raafat, Saida Caharf, and Najat Aatabou.” So far, the boycott, using primarily Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp, is a total success because Akhennouch, his profits dwindling, publicly called the boycott an act of treason. Nevertheless, the grassroots activists, angered by his attitude, will be tempted to include his other products in the boycott in order to punish him and bring down the prices of foodstuffs on the eve of Ramadan, a month of larger consumption.  The electronic Hirak will certainly strengthen the Islamists and their government, now led by Saadeddine Othmani, which were powerless since the formation because of heavyweight politician Akhennouch. Now, the chances of the latter leading the next non-Islamist government are nonexistent. This will undoubtedly disappoint the establishment that was counting on him to reduce the influence of the Islamists, especially after the miserable failure of the palace party Parti de l’Authenticité et de la Modernité, led by Ilyas Omari. This electronic uprising might even weaken other politicians close to the palace in the future. Who is behind this electronic Hirak? This uprising calls itself a “spontaneous movement,” but in reality, it is not. It is more likely that the PJD is behind it because Benkirane holds a grudge against the establishment for removing him from the government. It is a well known fact that one of the strengths of PJD is its electronic army, known as Al-kataib Electroniya, which is able to shape the public opinion through WhatsApp and other social media using the partaji ya mouwatin (“citizens, share the message”) successful scheme. On this particular point, Zoubida Senoussi writes in Morocco World News:[iii] “While some believe that this campaign comes as a direct result of denouncing the high cost of living–especially ahead of Ramadan, which witnesses a high peak consumption demands of dairy products–others opposed the boycott, asserting that this call is essentially a settlement of political accounts rather than an outburst of popular anger. Moroccan media outlets, such as the Arabic daily Al Ahdath Al-Maghribiya, claimed that this campaign, which will run for over a month, is a facade for a deeper political manipulation, orchestrated by what they have termed an ‘electronic army’ close to Abdelilah Benkirane, former head of the Moroccan government and former Secretary General of the Justice and Development Party (PJD).” The Arab Spring has turned violent in Yemen, Syria, and Libya lately and has dissolved the dream of democracy of the majority of Arabs. Will the Moroccan electronic uprising be able to revive the moribund Arab Spring and offer the poor a new means to make their voice heard? Only time will tell.

Rabat – As the Russian World Cup draws near, Morocco’s national head coach Hervé Renard seems deeply in love with Moroccan culture. On Friday night, the white sorcerer, as football commentators endearingly call him, took to his Twitter account and shared a picture that showed him with a large and beautifully embellished bowl of couscous, Morocco’s world-renowned traditional dish. The photograph was accompanied by caption that read: “Friday’s traditional Moroccan couscous.” The Frenchman’s Twitter followers immediately reacted to the post, sharing their views of a “lovable and elegant coach” deeply in love with the culture and ways of life of his host country. Le vendredi c’est couscous traditionnel marocain
Friday’s traditional Moroccan couscous#morocco #couscous ?? pic.twitter.com/egXnDy40fS — Hervé Renard (@Herve_Renard_HR) May 4, 2018  “Our coach likes our tradition. He is a true Moroccan now,” one user said, sharing an older picture depicting Renard in a traditional Moroccan djellaba. Adding that it is warming to have a coach with such a degree of cultural immersion, the same user thanked Renard for “everything [he’s done] for Morocco.”  Others also thanked Renard for his love for Moroccan culture as well as the performances of the national squad since he took over as head coach. “Bring it with you to Russia. It will bring you luck,” another said. Overwhelmed by Hervé’s continuous deference to Moroccan culture, one user performed the final consecration of the night, bestowing upon Hervé Renard his Moroccan name. “Africa’s best coach: Hamid Renard,” he wrote. Renard, whose name is now synonymous with Morocco’s present footballing Renaissance, with a remarkable qualification to the World Cup after two decades of absence, has often expressed his love for Moroccan culture and Moroccans at large. He has said that his time in Morocco is one of the best of his coaching career, considering “Morocco’s hospitality” and the “incredible warmth of Moroccan supporters.” “I don’t think I can live anywhere else,” Renard said in an interview in mid-April with Moroccan magazine Hola!; he declared his passionate love for Africa, a continent where he “feels free” and enjoys “exceptional recognition.”

Rabat – After the support of the Arab League, Romania, and Gulf Cooperation Council, Djibouti has voiced its “full” solidarity and “total” backing of Morocco’s decision to cut diplomatic ties with Iran due to its interference in Morocco’s internal affairs. Djibouti’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and spokesman of the government Mahmoud Ali Youssouf sent a letter today to his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita, to emphasize Djibouti’s support for Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran. Commenting on the Moroccan move, Youssouf reaffirmed his country’s support “for all measures taken by your country to guarantee its security and stability and to face any attempt to undermine its territorial integrity and the safety of its citizens.” On May 1, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the diplomatic break, confirming the presence of “tangible evidence” of Iran’s involvement in delivering military equipment to the Polisario and training its militias. In response to the Moroccan statement, Djibouti’s official denounced Iranian interference, stressing the importance of respect for the principles governing relations between states, especially “respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.” The decision to cut ties with Iran followed the adoption of the United Nations Security Council resolution 2414, which urges Polisario to withdraw from the Guerguerat buffer zone and to stop their illegal operations in Western Sahara. The country’s announcement represents further evidence of Polisario’s involvement in illegal actions, which have deemed destabilizing for the region as a whole. Polisario and Iran have denied their connection, while Algeria has attempted to distance itself from the regional conflict over Western Sahara. On Wednesday, Algeria summoned Morocco’s ambassador to Algiers and condemned Bourita’s comments accusing Hezbollah of providing military training and weapons to the separatist group through Algeria. Reacting to Algeria’s action, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the Algerian declaration, reframing the public condemnation in terms of Algerian embarrassment over the repeated instances documenting Algeria-Polisario collusion.

Rabat – Supportive statements backing the 2026 Morocco World Cup bid continue to pour in, as only forty days separate the world from the 68th FIFA Congress, where international football federations will cast their votes for the 2026 World Cup host on June 13. According to international football news outlet Sofoot, the Moroccan bid has started worrying the US and its President Donald Trump, referring to the threatening tweet Trump posted in April against countries promising support for the Moroccan bid. “Unlike Morocco, the United States is not a real football country,” said the sporting source. Sofoot further questioned how a country that has immigration issues due to Trump’s administration could be able to host the tournament.  “How can they build a coherent bid if Trump insists on extending the wall that separates the two territories?” he wondered. Trump’s immigration policy is detrimental for the North American joint bid, according to Sofoot, which extends to include the travel ban on Muslim countries. The US’ claims of infrastructural superiority is no longer a winning card, as news analysis sites have expressed concerns over how the US will deal US President Trump’s stance on refugees, immigration, and anti-terrorism policy. Trump’s now-infamous World Cup bid tweet may cost the US the bid, if FIFA’s regulations are upheld, as they prohibit any political interference in the bid process. The world’s governing football body, has not reacted on Trump’s threat. Recently, Morocco World News asked FIFA about its stance on the tweet, to which the organization said that it “cannot comment on specific statements in connection with the bidding process.” MWN’s questions have already been answered by both FIFA President Gianni Infantino and President of the US Soccer Federation Sunil Gulati, who both have previously said that Trump’s immigration policy could prevent the US from hosting the tournament. “Teams who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup. That is obvious,” Infantino told British press in March 2017, emphasizing the incompatibility of Trump’s policy with FIFA regulations. In January 2018, Gulati said that “This is not only about our stadiums and hotels. It is about perceptions of America…it is a difficult time for the world.” Countries from all the corners of the world have already promised support for the Moroccan bid, including Saint Lucia, Qatar, Botswana, Nigeria, Kenya, Belgium, France, Egypt, Tunisia, and Russia.

Rabat – New information from the Moroccan government, confirmed by Algerian sources, details the depth of the Iran-Polisario-Hezbollah collusion, and clarifies the need for a strong international response to Polisario’s repeated transgressions east of Morocco’s defense wall. As Polisario and Iran continue to deny any military cooperation with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, an Algerian source confirms that Hezbollah has previously offered training and support for the separatist group. On April 24, the Algeria Times reported that Polisario separatists receive Tehran-backed “continuous military training from Hezbollah in tunnels, dug under the Moroccan defense wall,” also known as the Berm. The source also confirmed separatist maneuvers in the Bir Lahlou area, where young separatists have been trained to conduct urban guerrilla operations against the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces. This information confirms detailed evidence that Morocco recently presented to Iran “on the role of Hezbollah, and the involvement of the Iranian embassy in Algiers in the military training and arms delivery for urban guerrilla operations.” The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, voiced Morocco’s decision to cut relations with Iran on May 1, explaining that Hezbollah offered military training to the members of Polisario in the Tindouf camps in Algeria. Illegal (and Dangerous) Past Escalations The latest links between Polisario and Hezbollah reveal the critical risk to the territorial integrity and national security that Morocco is currently facing in the east of Morocco’s defense wall. The Moroccan government and various Moroccan media outlets have reported extensively on Polisario’s illegal maneuvers in the area, which violate the 1991 ceasefire agreement and represent an international transgression, typically under the jurisdiction of the UN Mandate on the United Nations Mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO). In March, the Polisario Front further escalated already-high tensions with Morocco by reportedly moving to relocate its facilities to the Berm region. Despite these illegal maneuvers, MINURSO had been denying the illegal Polisario transgressions for the past the several months, prior to an altercation with separatist “security forces” east of the Berm on April 16. At that time,  MINURSO observers were intercepted by Polisario elements, who then proceeded to fire warning [shots],”  according to United Nations Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. He added that the observers were deterred from doing their job and could only resume working much later in the day. Since the incident, MINURSO and the UN Security Council seem to be taking a stronger stance in response to Polisario incursions, as demonstrated by the recent adoption of Security Council Resolution 2414, which was approved one week prior to Morocco’s diplomatic break with Iran. The new resolution urges the separatist group to withdraw immediately from the Guerguerat buffer zone and cease its illegal maneuvers east Morocco’s defense wall. Unlike previous years, Resolution 2414 applies strong language, explicitly stating that the separatists’ main backer–Algeria–should “increase their engagement in the negotiating process to fulfill their special essential role in supporting the political process.” Increasing Militant Potential Given Hezbollah’s militant history throughout the Middle East, the Hezbollah-Polisario connection carries grave implications for the region and should be met with a strong domestic and international response. As it stands, Gulf countries and 60 members of the European Parliament (EP) have designated the Hezbollah militia a terrorist organization whose aim is to undermine the stability of the Middle East. Washington has also deemed the Iranian ally a terrorist organization and a threat to regional security, especially in Syria. Several states have even blamed Hezbollah for the escalations in the Syrian civil war, including one institute that labeled “Hezbollah’s deepening involvement in Syria” as “one of the most important factors of the conflict in 2013 and 2014.” Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, have warned Morocco of Hezbollah’s strategy and its motives to jeopardize Western Sahara. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubeir wrote on his Twitter on May 2  that Iran “is destabilizing the security of Arab and Islamic countries by igniting sectarianism, interfering in their international affairs and supporting terrorism.” The official went on to explain that the Iranian-backed movement, Hezbollah, and its affiliation with Polisario’s activities in Western Sahara proves it as a threat against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Morocco’s decision has received full support from Gulf countries, including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.  The Arab League has joined the list of the opposition parties that condemned Hezbollah’s interference in Morocco’s internal affairs. Polisario Confirms Desire to Reinforce Ties with Iran Though Polisario representatives have repeatedly denied any partnership with Hezbollah, Mustapha Sayed, a “minister” at the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) expressed Polisario’s desire to reinforce relations with Iran in an interview with Russian news outlet Sputnik. “We have traveled to Beirut repeatedly, and we have asked to meet with the Hezbollah leadership, but we have not succeeded,” he said. Algeria condemned Bourita’s statement on May 2. The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has labeled Algeria’s response predictable, with the ministry explaining, “it understands Algeria’s embarrassment, as Morocco has documented prove that demonstrates Hezbollah’s connection with the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.

Rabat– This year, Islamic countries around the world will begin their Ramadan fast on the same day, May 17, according to Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani. In an interview with Morocco World News, astronomer, researcher,  graduate of Madrasa Al-Atiqa in Souss, Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al-Ifrani is predicting that the first day of Ramadan will fall on Thursday, May 17, marking unified fasting throughout all Muslim countries, including North Africa and Saudi Arabia. According to Kharbouch, whose previous predictions for Ramadan and other religious celebrations were all correct, the appearance of the crescent moon will be clearly observed from countries in the Western Hemisphere which includes Morocco: “The moon will set directly after the sunset in Saudi Arabia and other eastern countries, not long before the crescent appears in Morocco and other countries in the west.” Kharbouch added that the moon may be visible in Saudi Arabia in the evening of Tuesday, May 15, as the nation mainly follows the Al-Qura calendar, which is based on astronomical calculations. However, it is unlikely that the moon will be visible on that day. As a result, Saudi Arabia will see the crescent and fast on Thursday, May 17, the same day as Morocco and other Muslim countries, noting that the crescent will be very clear by then. This is also the case for Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic lunar calendar that follows Ramadan, which is expected to be celebrated in unison by all Muslim countries, a rare phenomenon. Kharbouch’s prediction for Ramadan matches that of astronomer Dr. Hicham El Issaoui, who recently said that Ramadan will start on May 17 and last until June 15. El Issaoui also predicted that Eid al-Adha will occur on Wednesday, August 22 and that the first day of the Islamic year, Fatih-Muharram, 1440, will occur on Tuesday, September 11, while the birthday of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, Mawlid al-Nabi al-Sharif, will be celebrated on Tuesday, November 20, 2018. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, it lasts from 29 to 30 days depending on longitude, and observance of the crescent moon or on relevant astronomical calculations, as prophet Muhammed (PBUH) said:  “Do not fast until you see it [the crescent] and do not break the fast until you see it, and if it is covered then complete the month.” In this holy month, Muslims all across the world fast from sunrise to sunset, fulfilling the second basic pillar of Islam after the profession of faith (shahadah), prayer (salah), charity (zakaat), and pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). Beyond abstention from food and drink throughout the days, however, Ramadan inspires Muslims to strive for the highest realms of spirituality and self-reflection, as Allah’s messenger said: “Whoever fasts during Ramadan out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah’s rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven,” according to the Hadith narrated by Imam Bukhari.

Rabat – The head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Federation, Turki Al-Sheikh, has again commented on the 2026 World Cup bids, publicly emphasizing that Saudi Arabia’s interests come first. In an interview with CNN, the Saudi official said that though his country has not voiced its official stance on the bids, Saudi Arabia is looking out for its interests first. Commending the North American bid, Al-Sheikh said that the US “is our biggest and strongest ally,” adding that the 1994 World Cup in the US “was one of our favorites; the fans were numerous and the Saudi team had achieved good results.” Al-Sheikh made it clear during his interview with Beki Anderson that Saudi Arabia’s vote will likely go to its “strongest” ally. When Beki asked him directly if he was referring to supporting the North American bid, Al-Sheikh answered: “You are intelligent Beki. You can read between the lines.” pic.twitter.com/RDdfyMvObg — ???? ?? ????? (@Turki_alalshikh) May 3, 2018  Al-Sheikh’s stance on the Moroccan bid has been clear from the get-go.  The Saudi official recently posted several tweets implying that his country would vote for the bid that will serve its interests first. From these messages, it is clear that Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis between the Saudi Arabia coalition and Qatar incensed the Saudi official. In one tweet, Al-Sheikh wrote that “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. In another interview with Saudi-based sports news platform Arriyadiyah in March, Al-Sheikh said that friendship has been “very detrimental to the Saudis.” He added that what really matters now to him is that “the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted  in the best conditions.” Saudi Arabia’s implied support of the US bid is likely tied to US President Donald Trump’s own recent tweets bullying nations for support just weeks before the vote scheduled to take place on June 13, in Moscow. In his tweet, Trump wrote that it “would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid.” The effect of the tweet is already shifting opinions. On May 3, the South African Football Federation denied its previous support of the Moroccan bid, deleting an early statement in April that had promised Morocco its vote.

Rabat – Head of Morocco’s Counter-Terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame has underscored the enormous challenges posed by returning Moroccan terrorist fighters. In an interview with French news agency AFP, Khiame says that 200 Moroccan ISIS fighters have been arrested and brought to justice since returning to Morocco. Khiame told the news source that Morocco’s provisions regarding returning fighters was established in 2015 and allows police to apprehend them for investigation and put them in custody.  Returnees typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. Khiame said that the number of Moroccans in the ranks of jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria was estimated at more than 1,600 in 2015. “Some have committed bombing suicide or were shot by coalition forces and others have fled to other countries.” Moroccan fighters in foreign countries are “regularly involved in attacks in Europe,” including in France, Brussels, Belgium, Spain, said the BCIJ head. With the widespread of extremism and Islamophobia across the world, several countries continue to link terrorism to Islam and specific nationalities. Contesting the misleading concept, Khiame asserts that terrorism has no nationality.  The Moroccan official added that Morocco has effectively implemented its legislation against terrorist groups, especially following the Casablanca and Marrakech terrorist attacks in 2003 and 2011, respectively. Recalling his staff’s achievements, Khiame said that Morocco frequently announces the dismantling of “terrorist cells.” He added that the country also recently released data on the terrorist groups dismantled from 2015 to 2017. During the interview, Khiame also discussed the role of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. “Thanks to our services, attacks have been foiled in France, Belgium, Germany, England, Denmark, Italy, and Spain.” Khiame stressed that the alarming security situation in the Sahel remains one of the Moroccan government’s main concerns, as it has become a  “fertile ground” for terrorism and a safe zone for certain terror cells, including AQIM and ISIS, that face security crackdowns from law enforcement in Middle Eastern conflict areas.

Rabat – The Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie managed to capture an Italian suspect last month, on charges tied to his alleged involvement in international drug trafficking. French news agency AFP reported that the suspect was convicted to an 11-year prison sentence in absentia. The Moroccan authorities arrested the suspect, Angelo Filippini, in mid-April in Temara, 11 kilometers south of Rabat. The authorities have held the suspect in a Sale prison, pending an extradition decision by the Moroccan authorities. Italian news outlets reported that Filippini is involved in the trafficking group “Spinella-Ottina,” which has been active since early ‘80s in the region of Como, North Italy, and is affiliated with the Calabrian mafia. During the arrest operation, Moroccan authorities seized false documents and a false passport issued in Bulgaria under a pseudonym, added AFP. This arrest is the latest in a string of major trafficking busts within the past year. On April 29, Moroccan authorities seized 490 kilograms of cannabis resin at the Tanger-Med port facility.  A similar operation took place in Tangier Med Port in the first weeks of April, when police seized 53 kilograms of cannabis in a shipping truck. The authorities arrested the truck driver en route to Spain after X-rays revealed the drugs concealed behind the vehicle frame and the engine cooling system. In January, Moroccan authorities also arrested a 35-year-old French national of Algerian origin, who was wanted by the International Police Organization for his involvement in an attempted murder and drug trafficking. Prior to that, in October 2017, Marrakech authorities apprehended a suspect who was the subject of an international search warrant for drug trafficking

Rabat – Censorship has followed Moroccan director-producer Nabil Ayouch to Egypt.  “Razzia” will not be dazzling the Egyptian public anytime soon. Ayouch’s production has been shot down by the censorship entity controlling the country’s artistic work.   According to Middle East Eye, the entity claims that the movie is “encouraging the revolution, especially that the film tells the story of the marginalized poor in search of justice in Morocco.” The censorship body explained its point, pointing to specific events in the movie that recall the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Politics are not the only issue here. The Egyptian entity is also concerned with the impact of religion, as it strongly believe that projecting “Razzia” “will inspire the sympathy and compassion of the audience,” as Ayouch’s movie follows the daily life of a Jewish restaurateur. It’s not the first time that the French-Moroccan director has had to deal with censorship, as the Moroccan government banned his controversial film “Much Loved” in Moroccan cinemas in 2015. “Razzia” is set in Ouarzazate, the Atlas Mountains, and Casablanca, and is composed of five stories, which span the 1980s to the present day.  The film primarily focuses on social issues, such as the class differences and intolerance, in addition to freedom of speech. The French-Moroccan director was born in Paris to a Muslim Moroccan father and a Jewish Tunisian mother. His lineage informs his work as a film director in the personal, cultural, social, and religious narratives that characterize his innovative and engaging movies. The 48-year-old filmmaker achieved widespread past success for his 2012 film, “Horses of God,” about the 2003 suicide bombers in Casablanca. His 2015 film “Much Loved” on prostitution in Morocco received intense criticism for its graphic sex scenes–“undermining the moral values, and dignity of Moroccan women”–before ultimately being banned in Morocco.

Rabat – There is nothing holding him back. Hakim Ziyech has repeated his hopes of leaving his current club, Ajax Amsterdam, prior to the summer mercato, or trade. The Moroccan football player has also announced that he will probably not be staying in the Netherlands. In an interview with the local media Algemeen Dagblad, the 25-year-old sensation–voted best player in the 2015-16 season–explained that he had maximized his opportunity to develop in the Netherlands. “I need a new challenge. At some point, it’s time to go. Of course, I wasn’t at by best sometimes, but I feel that I need [something to] click by changing my environment,” said the Moroccan international. Though his contract with Ajax stretches to June 2021, Ziyech is confident that his club will easily let him go. “When I arrived here, I said I wanted to continue to grow for two years. I also discussed with Marc [Overmars, the sports director, that ] if everything is good for Ajax and for me, then I do not see why it would not happen.” When it comes of picking a club, the Atlas Lion has attracted the interest of numerous European clubs, including Inter Milan and AS Rome. The two Italian clubs have been monitoring Ziyech’s performance and considering signing him since last winter. The Italian club Inter Milan has been in negotiations with Ajax, since the fourth quarter of 2016, with board members offering 15 EU million for the Moroccan player. Other European countries have expressed their intentions in recruiting Ziyech, namely, Liverpool, Dortmund, and Marseille. However, the Moroccan player’s value is predicted to rise in a notable way after the Russian World Cup, especially considering the fact that he recently received Ajax Amsterdam’s “Player of the Year” award for his excellent skills and performance this season. The Mercato (trade) aside, Ziyech will be busy this summer playing alongside Hervé Renard’s Atlas Lions during the the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Rabat – The public prosecutor at the Rabat Court of Appeals has opened an investigation into Friday’s attack on the imam of the Hassan mosque by the allegedly mentally ill suspect. Police will transfer the 29-year old suspect to a hospital for examination to verify his state of mental health. The man accessed the mosque during Friday prayers, broadcasted on both state-owned TV channels, Al Oula and 2M. Carrying two knives, the suspect moved to the preacher’s minbar, or pulpit, to attack the Imam. However, a group of people intervened and stopped the suspect before calling the authorities. After further investigation at the police headquarters, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) confirmed on Friday that the Hassan Mosque attacker displays signs of a mental disorder.

Rabat – The Moroccan American Network will bring together small business owners from the US, Africa, and around the world to share ideas and help small businesses maximize their potential at its third annual CEO Summit, “Shaping the Future of Africa: Challenges and Prospects,” on May 10, 2018, in Washington D.C.  “We will be engaging in dialogue and exchange of ideas for macro-opportunities, such as investments, as well as micro-opportunities, in areas such as infrastructure and health, and creating an environment where business leaders can meet other business leaders,” said Mohamed El Hajjam, CEO of AV Actions Inc. and President of the Moroccan American Network.   The upcoming summit will have US Congressman Don S. Beyer, Jr. (D-VA) and the Honorable Robert White, Councilman-at-Large for the D.C. government, as special guest speakers, along with His Excellency Carlos Dos Santos, Ambassador to the US from the Republic of Mozambique, as Guest of Honor. Creating an attractive business environment that encourages investment is a key factor for African countries hoping to succeed in attracting capital. Every year the World Bank publishes a global “Doing Business” ranking of countries’ business environments, rating them on how easy it is to start a company, raise finance, connected power grid and other key indicators for entrepreneurs.  The World Bank publishes a parallel ranking of the countries that have pushed through the most business-friendly reforms. Of the top-10, five African countries–Kenya, Mauritania, Senegal, Benin, and Uganda, made the list.   Over the past decade significant advances have been made in the establishment of various Free Trade Agreements (FTA). For example, the US Census Bureau reports that Morocco’s FTA with the United States has cumulatively increased by 337 percent since the FTA came into effect on January 1, 2006, totaling USD 2.1 billion in 2017 alone. Conversely, imports from Morocco totaled USD 1.2 billion, a cumulative increase of 642 percent since the FTA came into effect Trade agreements facilitate improvements of commercial opportunities and act as a springboard for small business growth. In its mandate to act as a driver for the promotion of entrepreneurialism, the Moroccan American Network serves as a platform to educate the American public, US media, and US government officials about business and investment opportunities through dialogue, forums, and events. Beyond education, the network connects the American, African-American, and African small business and media communities to facilitate the mutual growth and collaboration.

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation led by the Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water, Abdelkader Amara, and the Chairman of the Marchica Med’s board of directors, Said Zarou, was received on Monday by Ivorian head of state, President Alassane Ouattara. The leaders of the two countries discussed bilateral ties, including construction projects, commercial relations, and the progress of the ongoing rehabilitation works within the framework of strengthening the socio-economic and diplomatic ties between Morocco and Ivory Coast. Abdelmalek Kettani, Morocco’s ambassador to Abidjan, also took part in the meeting, briefing Ivorian officials on the progress of the Cocody Bay rehabilitation project. Speaking about the economic and diplomatic significance of the Abidjan visit, Minister Abdelkader Amara told MAP that meeting with the Ivorian president served as an opportunity to highlight the progress of the large-scale project in construction at Cocody Bay and the many other benefits of a strong and larger Morocco-Ivory Coast cooperation. Noting that the Cocody Bay project is advancing at a rapid pace,  Zarrou reiterated the Moroccan side’s commitment to the bilateral relations linking the two parties. Morocco seeks to contribute to the realization of other projects of similar significance, he explained. “We will work on the part relating to the upgrading of the Cocody Bay as provided by the Agreement relating to this project, signed before the two Heads of State, King Mohammed VI and President Ouattara,” he said.  Speaking on other prospective projects, he added: “We are also studying the construction of a marina and a fishing port in the city of Grand Bassam…The two parties are working together, not only on the technical side but also on the financial, institutional, and heritage rehabilitation aspects.”

Rabat – Francophone Belgian media outlet La Libre Belgique suggests in a recent article that there are links between the Polisario Front and the Iran-backed Hezbollah. Analyzing “primary data” and interviewing a number of experts specializing in MENA region security issues, the article provides facts to corroborate Rabat’s recent accusations: the existence of an ideological and strategic collaboration between Hezbollah and the self-proclaimed SADR. “Given that Hezbollah and the Polisario present themselves to the world as freedom fighters opposed to occupation and exploitation,” La Libre Belgique argues, it is only natural that they cooperate. Perhaps the notion of lending a helping hand to a brother movement spurred Hezbollah into action, the article suggests. More importantly, article substantiates a stronger case for a broader plan to build a security backdoor to promote and protect Iranian strategic interests on the African continent. As far as Iran’s African interest are concerned, weakening and destabilizing staunch American allies is a typical Hezbollah strategy, suggesting that the destabilization of Morocco’s security system may well be the tip of a much larger iceberg. As for the arms deliveries and urban warfare training charges that Morocco levied against Iran and Hezbollah earlier this week, the same source says that Morocco’s claims have considerable substance, especially considering that, in 2016, a pro-Polisario campaign was organized in Lebanon by Hezbollah militants. Since then, the source elaborated, the relationship has only gained strength, with shipment of sophisticated Hezbollah weaponry arming Polisario forces. The article also notes that the Hezbollah campaign was “followed by the visit of a military delegation of the Shiite militant group to Tindouf… which is Polisario’s headquarters” Hezbollah-Polisario: Similar Groups on Different Continents The 2018 Tindouf visit reportedly cemented the two groups’ strategic collaboration, with the as the overarching political goals of the rapprochement first and foremost concerned the establishment of a pro-Iranian (and more subtly, a pro-Moscow) corridor on the African continent. Commenting on the broader geopolitical implications of Teheran’s use of proxies to advance its interests in Africa, Elena Aoun, professor of political science and international studies at the Catholic University of Louvain, said that Morocco is a target because it is seen as a staunch US ally in the African security corridor. “For this and other countless reasons, Morocco needs US support on its Western Sahara position,” Mrs. Aoun explained. For his part, Didier Leroy, senior researcher at the Superior Royal Institute for Defense Studies (IRSD) and assistant professor at Université Libre de Bruxelle, said that the accusations are plausible because the Lebanese Shiite militants “have, through the businesses of many families of the Shiite Diaspora, numerous financial interests in West and North Africa.” He added that “They [Hezbollah] are constantly on the lookout for business opportunities,” further noting that access to the abundance of natural resources on the Atlantic seaboard, especially phosphate deposits, constitutes a key financial opportunity for the group. Polisario and Hezbollah are similar militant groups sharing “the same political and military ideology,” the article states, concluding that the two militant groups’ rapprochement likely serves much grander geopolitical interests of bigger global players.

Rabat – Romania has joined the list of countries that condemn the Iranian interference in Morocco’s domestic affairs. On Friday, Romanian Foreign Affairs Minister, Teodor Melescanu, expressed his approval of Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran, emphasizing that his country is against any interference that may undermine the stability of Morocco. Commenting on Morocco’s diplomatic move, the Romanian official said that the stability of Morocco vital to the security of the region and the world. Melescanu made his remarks in Rabat on Friday, during his meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita. Currently on a working visit in Rabat, the Romanian minister confirmed that Morocco can count on the support of Bucharest. “We are against any interference by states, organizations, political parties, or others, which can affect and harm the stability of Morocco,” he added during a press conference at the end of his talks with Bourita. On Tuesday, Morocco announced its decision to cut ties with Iran due to its involvement in delivering military equipment to the Polisario and training its militias. The Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council backed Morocco’s move, calling Iran’s support of Hezbollah an attempt to “destabilize Morocco and undermine its territorial integrity.” Gulf countries have noted that Iran “is destabilizing the security of Islamic countries by igniting sectarianism, interfering in their internal affairs, and supporting terrorism.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Justice Mohamed Aujjar and head of the Irish Senate Denis O’Donovan convened on Thursday in Rabat to discuss the potential cooperation in the fight against terrorism and human trafficking. After the meeting, the Aujjar told the press that he presented the Irish official with Morocco’s justice reforms and Morocco’s efforts to fight against terrorism, illegal immigration, and human trafficking. According to O’Donovan, the three-day official visit to Rabat aims at strengthening relations between the countries and its legislative institutions. The Irish official saluted Morocco’s justice system, which respects gender equality, separation of powers, and respect for human rights. The Irish official was impressed by “Morocco’s weight on the continent at both democratic and economic levels.” Morocco currently cooperates with several European countries in international anti-terror efforts, including France and Spain. In September 2017, Morocco’s security services assisted French authorities in the arrest of three individuals suspected of engaging in terrorism. Additionally, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said in February 2017, that cooperation with Morocco is “fundamental” in combating terrorism, and human and drug trafficking. In late December, Zoido reiterated his comments on Spanish-Moroccan anti-terrorist collaboration, after the arrest of four individuals suspected of disseminating propaganda supporting terrorist groups in Tangier, Barcelona, and Madrid. The joint operation was carried out by Spanish and Moroccan authorities. Morocco has established itself as a world model of success in combating terror acts. Moroccan authorities have dismantled more than 127 terrorist cells since 2002, 51 of which were linked to Daesh. Head of Morocco’s Counter-terrorism Bureau (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, told French news outlet Le Monde in February that his staff has managed to dismantle 49 terror cells since 2015. Forty-four of the 49 terror cells dismantled since 2016 maintained direct links to the so-called  Islamic State (ISIS). According to the BCIJ chief, 772 people linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) have been arrested since the creation of BCIJ in 2015.

The DGSN concluded that the 29-year-old attacker is mentally fill following the interrogation of the suspect.

Rabat – With the holy month of Ramadan around the corner, the Moroccan government is promising a “diversified” market that responds to all the needs of citizens, including stable commodity prices. Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit said in a press conference in Rabat on Wednesday that the government will establish a national phone number to receive possible complaints from both traders and consumers concerning the price of Ramadan supplies. The statement arrives on the heels of the ongoing national boycott, which demands that three sector giants cut the prices of certain products: Sidi Ali bottled waters, Centrale Danone dairy products, and  Afriquia gasoline. Government Ambivalence or Delayed Response? Surprisingly, the meeting did not mention the boycott or the demands of people, who have been asking the concerned companies to lower product prices for the past two weeks. Rather, Lafit generalized his message, discussing Ramadan supplies and the prices of products nationally, “especially those of high consumption” during the holy month of Ramadan. To date, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akhannouch, and Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Boussaid,  have denounced the campaign, with Boussaid calling supporters of the campaign “fools.” However, former ministers Nizar Baraka and Nabil Benabdellah disagree with the ministers’ dismissive stance, identifying the boycott as an urgent call for change that requires serious government consideration. The government has not officially commented on the boycott, as the campaign’s target companies continue to suffer from major losses in revenues, especially Centrale Danone and Afriquia gas. The boycotters, however, are not looking for more empty promises, but rather, real price drops prior to the start of the holy month. Commodity Prices ‘Stable’ In a press release reported by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Laftit verified that presidents of national  institutions and ministries, and representatives of prefectures and provinces provided updated data that ensures diversified options in the Moroccan market to meet all Ramadan needs. Commodity prices “remain mostly stable and at their usual levels except for some products whose prices are changing slightly, mainly due to cyclical or seasonal factors,” he said. Commenting on the national complaint hotline, Laftit said that the monitoring committee should take the complaints and grievances of citizens and traders seriously and ensure efficient communication with consumers, by informing them of prices and market data, in order to ensure regular supply trends, transparency in commercial transactions, fair competition, and consumer protection. The statement added that 167 coordination meetings were held in April across the country to monitor prices of products in local markets. Furthermore, an awareness campaign for suppliers, merchants, and owners of commercial services and sales facilities launched recently and will continue throughout the holy month of Ramadan, in order promote the necessary preventive measures to preserve health and food safety, in addition to compliance with legal standards for consumer protection.

With MAP Rabat – The woman who recorded a video in a women’s hammam in Temara was arrested Friday, announced the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN). A few weeks ago, 50 seconds of footage of naked women in a hammam circulated on social media, generating resentment among a large number of Moroccans, who demanded an investigation. The video was taken without the women’s knowledge, shot as the filmer pretended to be on the phone. Security services conducted investigations following the publication of the video, leading to the eventual arrest of the suspect on Friday in Temara, the DGSN reported. During the first stage of the investigation, the accused claimed to have shot the video at the request of an individual “who is actively sought by the authorities.” The woman has been placed in police custody under the supervision of the competent prosecutor, as research and technical investigations continue to clarify the circumstances of this case, according to the same source.

Rabat – Nearly a month after publicly announcing its support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, the South African Football Association (SAFA) has rescinded its support, claiming that it has not decided whether to support the African bid or the North American joint bid. The South African football federation denied supporting the African bid yesterday, emphasizing that the decision should be taken by SAFA’s National Executive Committee (NEC). “The decision whether to support Morocco or the USA FIFA World Cup 2026 bid is for the SAFA NEC to take,” reads a statement by the federation. SA will support Morocco’s 2026 FIFA WC bid, Jordaan. Full details here: https://t.co/zHkQbRE70g @CAF_Online @COSAFAMEDIA @FIFAcom pic.twitter.com/vtfimSQ2ZP — SAFA.net (@SAFA_net) April 16, 2018  The statement added that the federation received presentations from both parties competing to host the 23rd tournament in 2026. “SAFA wants to reiterate that no decision has been taken at this stage on the matter on who to support,” said the statement, emphasizing that none of its officials announced the federation’s position on any bid. The statement contradicts an April post on the official federation page, which has since been deleted from the website. However, a tweet posted by the federation confirms that SAFA’s original support for the Moroccan bid. Morocco World News reported on South Africa’s support for the bid on April 16, quoting statements of the SAFA president, Danny Jordaan, who promised Morocco’s bid committee that he will “personally lobby” Africa’s football leaders before the vote. Jordaan also promised the Moroccan bid that he will be personally engaged in attracting support from the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA). “It is an old myth that Africa doesn’t have the capacity and naysayers should stop using the political argument. Africa hosted the best FIFA World Cup ever and with good support, Morocco can emulate South Africa,” said the SAFA president. SAFA’s change of heart follows US President Donald Trump’s recent tweet, which threatened countries supporting the Moroccan bid. “Would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid,” Trump wrote, insinuating broader financial implications for nations with pro-Morocco federations. The statement comes one month ahead of the big day, when 211 international football federations will gather in Moscow to vote for the host of the tournament.

By Alexandra Gritta Rabat- A man who allegedly raped a minor under the threat of violence has been arrested in Mohammedia, a port city on the west coast of Morocco, on Thursday, May 3. The Directorate General of National Security (DGSN) announced that the Mohammedia judicial police force arrested a man suspected of raping a 10 year-old girl. A complaint was filed back on April 12, when the sexual assault victim was allegedly violated in the stairway of the building where she lives. According to AlYaoum24, the girl was assaulted while she was on her way to the local grocery store to purchase more data for a mobile phone. Her rapist reportedly already had criminal record, and threatened to harm the victim if she did not comply with him. The young girl suffered from severe hemorrhage as a result of the rape, and was immediately transported to Ibnou Rochd, a children’s hospital located in Casablanca. An investigation leading up to the man’s arrested provided both biological and technical evidence for his incrimination. Furthermore, the investigation revealed that the accused approached the girl several times prior to the rape incident, and that the 10 year-old’s family was unaware of the suspicious behavior, and thus did not report it earlier to the police. The incident has disturbed Mohammedia locals, inciting many angry and worried responses. The question of what sentence the rapist will serve, if any, has been a huge point of contention. With more than 26,000 children raped in Morocco each year, legal norms governing rape and pedophilia cases have been largely criticized as weak and ineffective by the Moroccan public. In an interview with Huffpost, Najia Adib, Founder and President of the “Don’t Touch My Children” association, raised the point, “[Pedophiles only receive] one or two years, and are sometimes completely acquitted. Often…we are shocked by the leniency of certain judges. The law permits jail sentences of up to 30 years, but they prefer to pardon the pedophiles!”  In 2016, another girl, just 11 years old, was raped multiple times by a 40-year-old man in Marrakech. The predator was sentenced to a mere two years, despite the fact that he was a repeat offender. In 2017, a 16-year-old girl hung herself after being gang-raped in Marrakech after the court released her rapists without charges. In some cases, a rapist will also kill their victim in a effort to silence them. In 2014, a two-year-old girl was raped and killed by her uncle in a town outside of Casablanca. Childhood trauma, particularly in cases of rape, often lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Children are often too young to understand the nature of the assault and are confused about how to report or seek help from an adult. Growing up, they continue to relive the unresolved trauma, and may turn to unhealthy outlets for their frustrations, such as drugs, self-harm, and attempts at suicide. As investigations into the Mohammedia rapist have concluded, it remains to be seen how authorities will proceed with case.

Rabat- Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has reaffirmed the government’s strong commitment to social dialogue for the benefit of Moroccan citizens, stressing that the country is resolute in its intolerance against any threat to its deeply-rooted principles. During the weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday, El Othmani stated that the government is dedicated to social dialogue with both of the Moroccan Labor Union (UMT) and the Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT), the two most representative trade unions in the country. Though El Othmani admits that there are issues that need to be discussed, he emphasized that the government is actively working to solve challenges to employment in both private and public sectors.  He added that the government intended to sign into action prior proposals designed in the framework of social dialogue by the time of the council meeting, but were delayed in the process. Despite the delay, the head of government added that the government’s door is open for dialogue to groups from all backgrounds.  El Othmani also thanked institutions that participated in the social dialogue on International Workers Day, May 1. Following the dialogue, El Othmani addressed Morocco’s decision to end diplomatic relations with Iran, stating that Morocco stands firm against any threat aimed at its standing principles. El Othmani stressed that such issues require absolute firmness, and that King Mohammed VI’s stance regarding them is “strong and strict.” With respect to Morocco’s territorial integrity, El Othmani insisted that it is a question that embodies the Moroccan people’s unified voice, wired to defend the nation’s rights, as was recently proved in UN Security Council resolution 2414. The UN Security Council’s decision to adopt a resolution extending MINURSO’s mandate for six months pushes the Polisario Front to cease its provocations and illegal maneuvers in the regions, including Bir Lahlou.  Concluding, El Othmani hailed Morocco’s diplomatic efforts to dissolve the separatists groups’ presence east of the Moroccan defense wall:  “This shows the world that Morocco, mobilized behind his Majesty the King, defends its rights and handles its issues with strength.

Rabat- Morocco’s decision to cut diplomatic ties with Iran is receiving strong pushback from the nations under international fire for supporting the separatist group, Polisario. While Algeria’s foreign minister summoned Morocco’s Ambassador to express Algiers’ condemnation of Morocco’s position, Hezbollah issued a statement that blamed Morocco’s move on foreign pressure. It called Morocco’s accusations “unfounded and baseless allegations” serving “an unconvincing pretext” to cut off ties with Iran. Iran’s statement echoed the same rhetoric, proclaiming its commitment to respecting territorial integrity. A recent interview of a high-ranking Polisario official, however, suggests a narrative slightly different from Iran’s proclaimed position of “non-interference” in countries internal affairs, casting doubts about Iran’s denial of involvement in Western Sahara. Speaking to the Arabic edition of Russian news outlet Sputnik, Bachir Mustapha Sayed, Minister of Interior of the self-styled Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), denied any links to Tehran and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. He said that the front does not need arms supplies from any third parties. “Sahrawi people have for many years been in possession of sophisticated weapons,” Mr. Sayed argued, alluding to the absence of cooperation between the Front and Tehran. Sayed went on to discredit reports linking Polisario to Hezbollah, claiming that “During our many visits to Lebanon, we repeatedly tried to meet with Hezbollah leaders, but to no avail.” Towards the end of the interview, however, Mr. Sayed acknowledged the existence of “diplomatic ties” between Iran and SADR. “We [already] have an embassy in Tehran, and we envision consolidating our relations with Iran and Hezbollah,” he noted. Sayed’s statement casts doubt on Iran’s repeated denial of any collusion with Polisario. Following Morocco’s decision to sever diplomatic ties with Iran, Tehran strongly dismissed any allegations of Iranian arms deliveries to the Western Sahara separatist group. Tehran insisted that it does not meddle in countries’ internal affairs. “Remarks attributed to the foreign minister of Morocco about cooperation between an Iranian diplomat and the Polisario Front are false,” read Iran’s statement.  Referring to Morocco’s “security and integrity pretext,” the statement added that Tehran “respects the sovereignty and security of countries with which it has diplomatic relations,” and has a policy of “non-interference in internal affairs.” In opposition to these statements, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement on Wednesday, disclosing Morocco’s possession of “detailed” evidence that proves Polisario’s involvement with Hezbollah, including names and specific instances of Hezbollah-Polisario partnership.

Through this memorandum, the two financial business centers hope to encourage the development and sharing of expertise in the context of the internationalization of the Renminbi and the development of the FinTech sector. Moreover, it aims to consolidate both parties’ efforts to attract financial institutions, holding companies, multinationals, and service providers in Xicheng District and within Casablanca Finance City.  “On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Morocco, we are honored to sign this partnership to explore cooperation opportunities in China, Morocco and Africa,” said Lu Wuxing, Director of the Xicheng District Financial Development Promotion Center of the Beijing Municipality (XDFDPC). “We look forward to actively devoting our energy to a friendly and fruitful exchange between our two financial centers in the future,” he added.  As for the CEO of CFC, Said Ibrahimi, he believes “that such cooperation will play a decisive role in promoting business relations between China, Morocco and Africa.” Casablanca Finance City is an economic and financial hub that aims to attract and encouraging international investors to expand in Africa by offering an integrated ecosystem. It is managed by the Casablanca Finance City Authority (CFCA), established by the Moroccan authorities in 2010, as a public-private partnership under the leadership of King Mohammed VI. In 2016, Casablanca Finance City (CFC) received the Economic Francophonie Award in Brussels, as a Moroccan financial center with Pan-African vocation.

Rabat- In its latest economic analysis report, BMI Research asserted that Moroccan authorities will remain committed to maintaining the country’s currency liberalization, which will only happen very gradually to avoid a rapid depreciation of the dirham and associated imported price pressures. After Morocco’s Ministry of Finance officially announced the dirham liberalization a few months ago, the move has prompted public fears of a similar scenario to that of Egypt.  In this sense, BMI Fitch Group Firm, echoes reassurance from Bank Al Maghrib, stating that Morocco’s move to liberalize its currency sharply contrasts with Egypt’s situation in November 2016, when economic pressures forced the government to suddenly release the currency peg, causing a sudden spike in the price of imported goods.  According to the firm, Moroccan authorities are in a much stronger position, thanks to a gradual, proactive approach to currency liberalization. BMI’s report noted that Morocco’s first step in currency liberalization did not significantly weaken reserves, which stood at USD 25.7 billion in February, corresponding to 6.3 months of imports. It added that the decision to liberalize dirham underwent preparations for several quarters and occurred only when reserves were deemed sufficiently robust.  The Fitch firm believes that Morocco’s new flexible exchange rate regime is unlikely to prompt a sharp currency sell-off, stating that international reserves will rise over the coming years as crucial sources of foreign currency, such as tourism revenues and foreign direct investment will see a robust growth.  “We believe short-term risks lie towards a moderate appreciation, which would support the BAM’s reserves and further underpin the peg’s stability,” the report reads. 
 Gradual Currency Reform The BMI firm attributes this outcome to Morocco’s gradual approach towards a free floating currency, in order to avoid a rapid depreciation of the dirham and associated imported price pressures. The report further notes that “full liberalisation may not materialise even within our ten-year forecast period.” As BAM governor Abdellatif Jouahri recently stated, the full release of the peg “could take five to 15 years and it would be conditional on further structural reforms, for instance on boosting exports and cutting the current account deficit.” According to BMI, these reforms will occur only very gradually and when depreciatory pressures are deemed as small as possible. For BMI, this gradual liberalization comes in line with Morocco’s economic ambitions to become an investment hub in the region and to diversify trade away from Europe, as part of its strategy to unlink from the euro zone and reduce its dependency on European markets.  Additionally, currency reforms also demonstrate authorities’ commitment to attract greater foreign investment and boost export competitiveness, which will drive Morocco into a political impetus to gradually release the peg. “We believe that the gradual move towards a free float will be positive for foreign investment in the kingdom,” the report concludes.

Rabat- King Mohammed VI and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia held a phone conversation on Thursday to discuss Morocco’s recent decision to cut ties with Iran. During their discussion, the Saudi King reiterated his country’s full support for Morocco and the kingdom’s security, stability, and territorial integrity, reported the Saudi Press Agency. The Saudi King’s statement came just three days after Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to sever ties with Iran on May 1, regarding Iranian involvement in delivering military equipment to the Polisario Front and training the militias of the separatist group. Morocco received the official support of Saudi Arabia and its coalition, and their condemnation of Iran’s interference in Moroccan domestic affairs, on Wednesday. The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the existence of detailed evidence connecting Iran, Hezbollah,  and the separatist group, on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Adel bin Ahmed Al Jubeir, wrote on his Twitter on Tuesday that Iran “is destabilizing the security of Arab and Islamic countries by igniting sectarianism, interfering in their internal affairs, and supporting terrorism.” He added that what Iran has done to Morocco through its alliance with Hezbollah is the “best proof of that.” Morocco’s announced its decision to cut ties nine days after the adoption of the  United Nations Security Council resolution 2414, which urges Polisario to withdraw from the Guerguerat buffer zone and to stop their illegal maneuvers in Western Sahara, as the Security Council deems the maneuvers an attempt to destabilize the security of the region. With both parties denying their prior cooperation, Morocco has announced documented evidence proving the Hezbollah-Polisario connection. In an attempt to shrink its responsibility in the issue,  Algeria–Polisario’s main backer–summoned the Moroccan ambassador on Wednesday to condemn comments by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, that accuse Hezbollah of providing military training and weapons to the separatist group through Algeria. Morocco slammed the declaration, reframing the public condemnation in terms of Algerian embarrassment over the repeated instances documenting Algeria-Polisario collusion, despite the country’s attempts to distance itself from the regional conflict over Western Sahara.
 Morocco has been calling on the United Nations and the Security Council to urge Algeria to cooperate in the conflict.

Rabat – Said Barodi, a Muslim American born in Morocco, has been hired, fired, re-hired, and then fired again by the FBI for “unprofessional conduct” and “lack of candor”–charge the former agent links to racism, deep-rooted Islamophobia, and the FBI’s lack of diversity. Throughout his near-decade with the bureau, Barodi confesses that appreciated his position because it allowed him to reciprocate the privileges and opportunities that American citizenship brought him. Looking back on his FBI career, particularly the events that led to his “unfounded dismissal,” he says that his religion and origin played the most significant role in the unequal treatment he endured. Born in Morocco, Barodi moved to the US in January 2001, settling in Washington, D.C. He first worked various “odd jobs” to make ends meet. Post-9/11, Barodi began preparing to enlist in the US Army, but was discouraged by friends and relatives who warned him about potential Islamophobic discrimination and mistreatment that he could face as a Muslim. He subsequently enrolled in a community college studying English, and set his sights on enrolling for a four-year university degree. He became a US citizen in 2006, and the later the same year, he began his studies at George Mason University, pursuing a degree in global affairs and specializing in the MENA region. Barodi began working as a contractor for the FBI while still a student at George Mason. After fallen in love with his contracts with the Bureau, he applied for a full-time vacancy. His application was approved and he became an FBI analyst in 2009. “They needed a linguist. So I applied,” Barodi later told ProPublica, explaining that his fluency in French and various Arabic dialects, as well as his religion and national origin helped in the process: the US intelligence community was in desperate need of “people from my background” (“Muslims,” he later clarified) to “infiltrate” terrorist circles or make sense of their messages, Barodi explained, before explaining that necessity did not mean Bureau became more welcoming or diverse as a result. From ‘Excellent’ Employee to ‘Unprofessional’ Agent ‘Lacking Candor’ Barodi’s recalls that his first months—and even years—at the bureau were filled with good moments. His was happily absorbed by him, and he “never complained,” as some of his supervisors’ notes later acknowledged. He would mentor newly-hired analysts, and performed tasks that went beyond what the bureau expected of him, according to his superiors. On some occasions, he now recalls, he even confronted and spoke out against other Muslim agents who thought they were being unfairly treated and discriminated against for their faith. Barodi’s works constantly received “excellent” rating from supervisors, with James Comey, the then FBI-Director, once personally thanking him for his “service to the FBI and the nation” via an email exchange. Barodi’s troubles began in 2012 when he “learned of Islamophobic materials being used to train agents.” He filed a complaint that the bureau dismissed. From that moment on, he explains, he started feeling alienated within the bureau, though that did not affect his “excellent” records and satisfying performances. “I was able to use my skills and knowledge to help my country, and I loved it,” he says. However, following an incident with a plainclothes Department of Homeland Security Agent at the Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris (Barodi refused to cooperate with the agent, whose questions he deemed intrusive and Islamophobic), he learned that the bureau intended to dismiss him from his post. He emailed James Comey about the vicissitudes of Muslim agents, saying: “We feel the FBI resents needing us, and we are not set up to succeed.” In response, Comey emphasized the need for effectiveness and appropriate scrutiny. Minority agents shoudl draw the line between what is unduly offensive and the necessary scrutiny needed for people from some backgrounds with possible risky connections, he continued, referring to friends or relatives who might be threats to national security. “Airports are choke points to harass and humiliate us,” Barodi now says.  “I’ve had it with my friends having to go through this, I’ve had it with my co-workers having to go through this,” he now laments, unable to comprehend how a trivial incident at a foreign airport with a plainclothes agent could lead to the professional downfall agent deemed excellent and acknowledged for his serious and thorough work as an analyst. Barodi was later fired for the incident, because his refusal to fully cooperate with an agent’s questions was deemed “unprofessional.” He filed a rebuttal against the decision, as a matter of pure protocol, and was surprised to hear that the bureau’s review board ruled that his appeal was strong enough to overrule his initial dismissal from the FBI. Barodi was ostensibly reinstated in the Bureau, with only a standard security check–which he had passed several times during his time with the FBI–between him and full employment. However, the week-long process was delayed and passed between various departments. Five months passed between the time that the bureau vacated his dismissal, and yet Barodi was not receiving transparent contact with the former agent. The Bureau left him “in the dark” about his career, effectively terminating his FBI tenure and creating further barriers to employment at other security sector positions.. “I can’t get my FBI job back, I can’t get any decent paying job anywhere, he explained. Being a Muslim agent is “a cancer,” he later told the Guardian, explaining the bureaucratic complications and unfounded procedures that would subsequently lead to his second dismissal from the Bureau. After months of unemployment and searching for an opportunity to provide for his family–he and his wife had their first child shortly before his dismissal–he finally found a job a as a security guard manager for a Department of Defense contractor. No longer the America-enthusiast he was in his early FBI years, he says that his own plight is just one insignificant example among the many indignities and ordeal that “people who look like me” endure in the FBI, and by extension in the US. “We are a target. We are either suspects or snitches; that’s our station in society. We’re not allowed to be patriotic or serve our country. All that stuff about family, and we’re a big family, blah, blah. No, I was not family. I was the enemy within.”

Rabat – As the #Let_it_Spoil boycott campaign grows in intensity and scope, angry consumers are showing no sign of retreat, despite repeated apologies from the targeted companies. Since the campaign’s launch on April 20, the boycott has already demonstrated the Moroccan public’s ability to impact sector monopolies. Arabic daily newspapers, including Al Massae and Akhbar Al Yaoum, reported on April 30, that both Afriquia gasoline and Centrale Danone faced stock market share depreciation at -5.97 percent and -5.69 percent, respectively.  Akhbar Al Yaoum added that Centrale Danone may have lost up to 20 percent of revenue from April 20-30, a loss that will likely increase as the boycott has shown no signs of ending any time soon.  Meanwhile, Afriquia’s losses are estimated between 25 to 45 percent of daily revenue. In Nador, Afriquia gas stations reportedly lost 47 percent of daily revenue, while service stations in Casablanca lost 39 percent. Despite these noteworthy numbers, the campaign has been labeled a target of derision and dismissal by the company heads.  At the International Agricultural Fair in Meknes (SIAM), Minister of Agriculture and Afriquia CEO Aziz Akhannouch raised a glass of Centrale Danone milk alongside other officials, in a patronizing gesture of solidarity with the boycotted company. More recently, the Purchasing Director of Centrale Danone, Adil Benkirane accused the online protesters of treason, increasing the already-high tension between the company and Moroccan consumers.  Such condescension has struck a resounding chord at the heart of the public’s frustration with the three companies. With Ramadan less than two weeks, the stakes of the boycott are increasing each day. The concerned companies, especially the French-owned dairy company, Centrale Danone, finally seem to realize the potentially devastating implications, if boycotters decide to extend the campaign into the holy month. Ramadan represents the company’s most profitable month, leading annual dairy production and sales, as milk is a traditional drink served alongside iftar dishes after the fast. In a video published yesterday evening, the vice president of the company, Abdelkarim Likaymi, offered a company apology, emphasizing that Benkirane’s prior disdain does not reflect in any way the factory’s official stance on the boycott.   Benkirane also offered a personal apology on May 1, saying that he was not intending to offend Moroccan consumers, but rather aimed to emphasize that farmers need for consumers’ support. As the boycott continues, consumers are telling the companies to save their words and devote more efforts to decreasing product prices. Commenting on the apology videos and Centrale’s statement, consumers reiterated that the campaign’s motive is to urge the companies for “an immediate decline in prices, rather than empty promises.” “Apology not accepted,” wrote one Facebook user.    Another protester criticized Benkirane’s apology message, writing, “Resignation is a must! [An] Apology is required in the form of re-evaluating the product prices by the company board.” “We don’t need apology, we need prices to be lower.” Recently, the boycotters have expanded their messaging to encompass the companies’ notable lack of public response to the protesters. Afriquia gasoline and the Sidi Ali have still not released any official statement on the boycott. Furthermore, consumers are criticizing the companies’ failure to outline a crisis management plan (CMP), which would have precipitated the timeliness and efficacy of company responses. Morocco World News recently surveyed dozens of shoppers and grocery store workers in Rabat about the boycott, and the majority of respondents announced their solidarity with the campaign. “I am boycotting the three of them [Sidi Ali, Centrale Danone, and Afriquia],” said one shopkeeper in the Hassan neighborhood in Rabat. Shop owners in Fez and Sale echoed the sentiment. Earlier this week, a Centrale Danone truck driver confirmed to Morocco World News that several shopkeepers rejected the company’s goods due to the decrease in demand.  Centrale Danone staff was expected to meet this week to discuss potential solutions to reduce major losses in the future. It remains to be seen whether the companies will meet the demands of citizens and decrease the prices of their products, or risk the long-term financial blow that will certainly follow.

New York – A recent article polling Moroccan professionals shows an alarming trend of people under age 35 looking to move to other countries in search of better compensation and working conditions. According to the article, 74% of those working abroad wish to come back and invest their skills in Morocco; however, lack of local resources and poor responsiveness by companies prevent them from doing so. According to the article, Moroccan physicians are particularly dissatisfied with being sent to distant parts of the country to work for low salaries. They frequently have to serve in regions with underdeveloped infrastructure, which motivates few people to pursue this career. Energy Initiatives But this situation is about to change as a result of a developmental process and a progressive, visionary strategy that can best be described as the Moroccan Renaissance. Already, Morocco has been making progress on the issue of energy, first by building an impressive solar plant in the Sahara, second by cooperating with other countries to build a trans-continental gas pipeline which would help send power to remote areas, third by building several nuclear power plants in different parts of the country, and fourth by planning several dam projects and desalination plants that would address water shortages. As the country opens up business opportunities in the West, it seeks to attract investors to water-related projects and technologies. Meanwhile, cities around the country are undergoing renovation and build-up. New cultural facilities are rising up from the debris of condemned houses and beautiful new architecture is transforming the landscape, even in cities such as the relatively mild Rabat. Cultural Revival These developments show a glimpse of Morocco’s concerted efforts to highlight its visibility in the African and international scene. What started with King Mohammed VI’s tour of Africa led to the strengthening and renewal of important relationships with many countries across the continent, while also positioning Morocco as a central and rising actor in politics and development of the continent. At the same time, Morocco has been pursuing security and business ties with Europe. It has also been  engaging in cultural activities in the Middle East. Moroocco is becoming an increasingly popular vacation destination for American tourists, who are beginning to discover the diverse appeal of the country. Still, in order to achieve its goals in becoming a country fully integrated in the international community and in being seen as more than just an exotic tourist spot, several developments need to happen. Some are already in the works. The Path to Economic Liberalization First, Morocco needs to open up to internal competition and privatize many of the sectors that are currently entirely government-controlled or heavily dependent on government sponsorship. Coupled with investments into infrastructure, this would address the issues that are driving would-be doctors away from practicing medicine. However, privatization alone will not solve the problem and without taking steps to combat the inevitable side effects of the phenomenon, there may be unintended consequences that will cause more internal dissatisfaction. A crackdown on government corruption, already in its nascent stages in certain cities, will provide public reassurance that bureaucrats will not manipulate the system to exercise monopolistic control over developing industries, thereby leaving regular Moroccans scrambling for scraps as a result. Simultaneously, creatin civil society initiativesimed at private assistance to the poor and other vulnerable segments of the population will help ensure that those dependent on government services will not be left behind as a result of aggressive competition. A new competitive country would require a gradual transition because with bigger financial rewards come bigger risks, and implementing changes too quickly, even for a potentially better future, would not end well. Integrating Civil Society However, there are a number of social and cultural initiatives that would benefit from private involvement and investment. NGOs and private businesses could lead the way in development of these initiatives, which would also generate additional jobs.  Reconstruction of employment structures towards more competitive model should starts with the sectors that do not initially hold significant risks, opening up other sectors will be easier. Government services would also be restructured towards more efficient models over time. Many government jobs could be eliminated, but these functions would be naturally picked up by the private and non-profit sectors. For instance, medical doctors could open up private offices, and spend a portion of their time in more profitable private practice, that would compensate them for the time spent in public hospitals – ensuring that even poor patients get adequate medical care. That would likely require the restructuring of the insurance system, as well as greater investment in underdeveloped regions, where few doctors want to go, and where there is little opportunity to become financially successful.  Such a system would face challenges, but it would also be merit-based. It would reward initiative, entrepreneurship, and investment in education rather than excessive control by a bureaucracy, which kills off opportunities for individual ideas. However, talented Moroccans who wish to see their country prosper and benefit from increased opportunities should not wait for the reforms to trickle down from the government. They should actively contribute to the Renaissance by thinking globally, not just locally, and promote their businesses to the West, particularly the United States, which alone has a potential market of 330 million people. India and China should also be explored, along with other places with growing upper and middle classes and with a potential interest in luxury goods, craftsmanship, and other products that Morocco has to offer. Growing Business Relationship with the United States Promoting business in the U.S. should be an active process that involves several simultaneous steps: 1) networking with industry practitioners; 2) setting up expos to showcase available products to the public; 3) designing online platforms to introduce goods to the marketplace; 4) conducting specific market research on the demand for particular goods; 5) facilitating contact with US government officials; and 6) actively participating in local U.S. cities and their relevant organizations. An example of this final step is M.A.N.Y. (Moroccan Americans in New York), which is an organization that helps community members traveling to and from Morocco with various local arrangements, social issues, and promoting small businesses. It would be a good contact for new entrepreneurs looking to enter that market. Boston, Washington D.C., and Dallas, which all have significant Moroccan communities, may have similar non-profit or community organizations. These activities will also help the entrepreneurs attract domestic and foreign investors to grow their businesses inside Morocco.  Internal investment and local entrepreneurship could also be encouraged through private investment into incubators and competitions such as Shark Tanks. One example of a creative local idea that is now reaching international audiences is the Marjana Cooperative outside Essaouira, a collective run by women that produces the widely popular Argan oil. It started in 2005 to address the lack of employment opportunities for women in the region and has since grown from 25 to over 60 women working to produce high-quality oil for cooking and cosmetics. They lead demonstrations of their process, have opened a restaurant, and now have a large store with various products that are also sold abroad. Cultural Diplomacy Simultaneously, the cultural blossoming of the country is in full force, with dozens of cultural and artistic festivals taking place in Morocco annually, as well as many other regional events involving Morocco as a participant. All of that, however, is just a start. Morocco is looking to revive industries that have fallen in popularity, as well as to develop new pursuits that can make it one of the cultural leaders in Africa, thereby introducing Moroccan culture to the world. Moroccan cuisine is already well-known in many large cities around the world, but with the help of an active entrepreneurial mindset, it may eventually make it to parts of the U.S., Europe, and even Asia, which has had little exposure to this culture. Sushi in the U.S. proves this strategy’s success. Sushi was once considered an exotic delicacy, but it has now become so popular that even small towns in the middle of America have sushi restaurants.  To promote Moroccan culture, there should be three concentrations: 1) support of new and fresh public relations campaigns; 2) financial investment, both public and private; and 3) partnerships with national and international organizations that can work congruently to achieve these goals. Investing into the Arts While Morocco hosts several film festivals annually (and is trying to organize more), the cinema as a forum has been dying out in part due to piracy and in part due to the availability of other means of watching movies. However, creative thinking can still preserve this forum. In the West, successes that have helped bring the audiences into the cinemas have been experiential and impossible to replicate in the home environment. Investment in 4D technology has made a difference for movies focused on special effects. For more psychological or artsy films, investing in high-quality digitization or film can elevate the art form into a transcendent experience. Rebuilding beautiful cinemas and creating lavish experiences with fancy leather chairs that turn into couches, or even restaurants, are restoring movie nights back to the earlier days of the cinema, when such outings were special and joyful occasions, not simply an easily accessible form of entertainment. Morocco has an opportunity to replicate the Golden Age of Cinema with the renovation of theaters across the country. Rather than trying to outcompete each other with available technologies, these cinemas can be reinterpreted as experiences geared at the needs and interests of contemporary audiences. For instance, Fez alone has over 80 cinemas that are ripe for restorations. Restoring them would mean reinvesting in the local economies and using them for additional film festivals and other cultural events, which could increase the flow of tourists and investors into the city. Fez, which is a cultural gem in Morocco with a rich history, is often overlooked in favor of Marrakech, which has been the primary beneficiary of investments and restorations, causing the city to attract the bulk of the visitors.  Increasing the number of cities that are engaged in cultural and international events, and hosting a mini-Renaissance in each, would make Morocco a model for the development and revival of historic places. It would also provide opportunities for new artists, business people, and professionals of all backgrounds to get involved in this effort. Last, but not least, expanding Morocco’s relationship with the United States would benefit both countries and open up a myriad of possibilities for growth and discovery. The young Moroccan population is industrious, creative, and interested in the outside world; many are already living in the United States while looking for opportunities to aid Morocco in various ways. More joint ventures between the U.S. and Morocco would provide opportunities for mutual investment and meeting of common interests. High Level Government Contacts Can Promote Stronger Relations Overall Official state visits, for instance, would highlight the importance of Morocco-U.S. cooperation and partnership. The administrations could expand defense and development alliances that would serve as examples for greater engagement between lower-level officials on other issues, which would confirm a mutual openness for private sector industries in both countries. Moroccans could introduce their luxury goods to the United States market, creating jobs in areas seeking to revive industrialization. Both high-tech giants and start-ups looking for new markets would help Morocco flourish and innovate. Investment into joint scientific research and educational exchange would generate progress in both countries. The more researchers and educators are able to combine their expertise, the more people benefit overall. Cultural diplomacy between the two countries would introduce a far greater number of Americans to Moroccan music and more Western artists and entertainers visiting Morocco would enhance its international image. Mutual Security Interests Finally, in regard to security and technology, far more can be done to upgrade both countries’ cooperation for their mutual benefit. Morocco is becoming a cyber-hub of Africa and is already attracting attention from Europe, whereas the U.S., despite its impressive signals intelligence capabilities, has been dealing with certain cyber challenges in both private industries and the government. With the increased involvement of U.S. troops in African counterterrorism operations, closer relations with Morocco should be a priority. For Morocco, that would afford opportunities to expand the influence of its own cyber capabilities, find more allies to combat common enemies, and join international cyber-security leaders in contributing to innovation and the resolution of common problems. Morocco is progressing quickly. Over the next few years, the Moroccan Renaissance will be fully underway. Coupled with a distinct focus on improving public relations—by developing closer relations with Western media; gaining support for English-language programs; broadcasting Moroccan issues of interest to the West; and welcoming American government officials, think tanks, artists, festivals, and experts from all areas to Morocco for meetings with professionals and young people—Morocco stands to become a prominent leader in the global advancement of culture, science, technological innovation, and unique business ideas.

Rabat – While a host of pundits and political commentators have presented the recent Rabat-Tehran rupture as multilayered, former Pentagon official Michael Rubin believes that the real reason can be attributed to a far simpler cause: differences in ideology. At a news conference on May 1, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita announced Morocco’s decision to sever diplomatic ties with Iran, citing “strong evidence” of Hezbollah’s moves to destabilize Morocco with blessing of Iran and Algeria. In a recent op-ed article in the Washington Examiner, Rubin argues that ideology is the primary shaper of Iran’s attitude towards Morocco. He writes: “Make no mistakes: Iran’s problems with Morocco are ideological.” By undermining and destabilizing the North African kingdom, Tehran not only seeks to further its image of itself as the leader of the Islamic world, but it would also be destroying the strongest anti-terrorism center in the Arab world. He writes that Iran’s only interest in reaching out to Polisario is to undo Morocco’s sovereignty and security apparatus, creating space for Tehran to disrupt the deep theological tradition of tolerant Sunni Islam that constitutes Morocco’s trademark in the MENA region. “Iran has no interest in Sahrawi independence or the Polisario’s supposed cause,” he argues, explaining that Tehran is hiding behind its proxies to export Shiism and political instability to Morocco. And the Polisario Front, which Rubin describes as “prostitutes of global terrorism,” is being used to realize Tehran’s ideological and geostrategic aspirations. Michael Rubin concludes by saying that the USA and the international community should not stand by and allow Iran to get away with destabilizing the region: Iran and the Polisario threats should be confrontationally dealt with, allowing Morocco to reclaim its sovereignty over the southern provinces. If Iran succeeds in sabotaging Morocco by exporting its ideology to the kingdom, he warns, the international community would be losing “the most successful model of regional tolerance and peacemaking the Arab world and Africa have.”

Rabat – After losing to Rapide Oued Zem (3-1) on Wednesday in the small town of Oued Zem, the players of Raja Casablanca were targeted by “angry supporters,” who threw several rocks and firecrackers at the players’ bus, injuring four, according to AFP. Videos that circulated in social media showed the players–visibly shocked–talking to the press about the attack. One of the player said that he wanted to lodge a complaint against the perpetrators. The Raja spokesman told AFP Thursday that four people were injured (three players and the driver) during the assault, adding that the club was going to file a complaint. “The Raja [supporters in the] public is very severe with the team because they are used to winning,” he said. “It’s a shame…we almost lost our lives,” he added.  The triple winners of the African Champions League is known for the fervor of their fans, the atmosphere that prevails during their matches, and acts of violence and vandalism accompanying some of their games. In February, supporters of the green team started a fight with the supporters of the red team, KACM, which resulted in considerable material and financial loss for Marrakech Football stadium. The disciplinary committee of Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) penalized Raja team supporters for vandalizing the stadium and throwing chairs at other spectators and law enforcement agents, which resulted in 14 injured. FRMF fined the Raja club MAD 50,000 and restricted Raja supporters from attending two upcoming matches. Twenty supporters also received jail time. According to AFP, Morocco’s iconic football club, Raja, “has been in financial crisis for several months, with repeated strikes by players protesting delays in paying their salaries.” The Raja club president, Said Hasbane, resigned from his position last month.

Rabat- The Arab League announced their full solidarity with Morocco’s decision to sever diplomatic relations with Iran on Wednesday, following an announcement of support from the Gulf. Spokesperson of the Arab League Mahmoud Afifi expressed solidarity with Morocco, announcing the league’s decision to cut ties with Iran after their alleged interference in Morocco’s internal affairs, according to a statement obtained by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Afifi said that the situation, which occurred as a result of Iranian foreign interference, “requires action by the Arab countries to face the Iranian strategy aimed at bringing anarchy and instability.” Morocco announced its decision to cut ties with Iran on Tuesday, emphasizing that Hezbollah, a close ally of Iran, offered military training and weapons to the Polisario Front. Prior to the Arab League’s decision, several  Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and  Bahrain, backed Morocco’s decision and denounced Hezbollah’s alleged cooperation with the separatist group. On Wednesday,  the Gulf Cooperation Council’s (GCC) Secretary-General, Abdullatif bin Rachid Al-Zayani, expressed the council’s full support, condemning the Iranian interference in domestic affairs. Al Zayani added that Iran’s support to Polisario is “meant to destabilize Morocco and undermine its territorial integrity.” The official statement followed a similar comment from the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs, Adel bin Ahmed Al Jubeir, who yesterday condemned Iran’s interference in Morocco’s internal affairs. Al Jubeir wrote on his Twitter on Tuesday that Iran “is destabilizing the security of Arab and Islamic countries by igniting sectarianism, interfering in their internal affairs, and supporting terrorism.” Iran’s interference in Morocco through its alliance with Hezbollah, the Saudi minister wrote, is the “best proof of that.”

Rabat – Les Inqualifiables are taking their festival to the next level. In a press conference held at Mega Mall Rabat, the comic duo composed of Amine Belghazi and Obeid Allah Hlal, announced the line-up for the 4th edition of “Aji Tehdem (Come and Digest!)”, which will take place in several cities (and countries) during the holy month of Ramadan. This year, the event will become a humorous traveling festival that will bring together comics from all horizons such as the iconic Abdelkader Secteur, Winner of the “Comedia Show”; Bassou, the actor of “Lahbib”; Haytam Miftah; and humorist Youssef Ksiyer, among other prominent names on the Moroccan stand-up scene. Speaking to Morocco World News, the comedian Bassou has expressed his joy at being a part of such an “entertaining festival that gives to the stand-up comedy more visibility.” Alongside Les Inqualifiables, the comedians will criss-cross several the kingdom, hitting cities like Fez, Meknes, Oujda, Tangier, Marrakech, Rabat, and Casablanca. “We are very proud and honored to perform with such big names and to see them participate in our show–it’s something that we never thought would happen,” Amine Belghazi told MWN, adding that he want to see the festival go even bigger next year. Les Inqualifiables will also take on some international cities, traveling to Paris, Montreal, and Quebec. “During each edition, we present a new show with new ideas and more creativity. This is the year of our consecration, as we’re going global,” said Belghazi to MWN adding that the duo is currently negotiating to perform in the United States.   Amine Belghazi and Obeid Hlal are not just two young people looking for laughs–they are also comedians who aim to help people in need. Every year, the duo devotes a portion of their income to an association responsible for the care of low-income families during Ramadan. “Just like last year, we want help the ‘Red Circle’ that is an association of 10 women struggling to improve underprivileged environments in Morocco,” explained the comedian to MWN. “Aji Thdem” is a festival of humor created by Amine Belghazi and Obeid Hlal to “entertain Moroccans during Ramadan after a day of fasting, and allow them to digest with a smile or a laugh out loud.” “Ramadan is a special month that’s why we wanted to create something special for this period as there were no stand-ups and few cultural activities,” said Belghazi to MWN, adding that after three successful editions, they wanted to “refine” the “very special concept” that they have created. Since Ramadan 2015, they have brought together a large audience for the show. Last year, the 3rd annual humor festival attracted 1,500 festival goers in the Mohammed VI Theater of Rabat. As for their personal careers, Les Inqualifiables told MWN that they are planning to expand into TV appearances, perform at the Jamel Comedy Club during Ramadan, and play their stand-up show in the 2018 Marrakech Du Rire.

Rabat – A Russian fighter jet crash-landed in the Mediterranean shortly after taking off from Hmeimim airbase, located in Syria. The crash resulted in the death of both pilots, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced Thursday. According to American newsource CNN, the cause of the crash might have been a bird flying into the engine. The incident was preceded by a crash that occurred last March and claimed the lives of 32 people on board. Yet another accident occurred last February, when a Russian Sukhoi-25 ground attack aircraft was shot down in a rebel-held area in Syria’s northwestern province, Idlib. Back in October 2017, a Su-24 bomber crashed during takeoff from Hmeimim, killing both pilots. In December 2016, a plane carrying Russian military personnel to Syria crashed in the Black Sea. All 92 passengers on board perished. Since Russia launched its military operations to fight ISIS in Syria back in September 2015, the number of its aircraft accidents has increased.

Rabat – Centrale Danone Purchasing Director Adil Benkirane has apologized to consumers for characterizing participants in the online boycott as betraying the country and its products. Following apologies from Central Danone in a statement earlier today, Adil Benkirane shared a video on Facebook, also expressing his regret: “I have read the reactions about my statement, and I know I made a mistake,” he said. Benkirane expressed his remorse for hurting the Moroccan citizens: “It was not my intention.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities dismissed the Algerian Foreign Ministry’s move to summon Morocco’s ambassador to Algiers in relation to Algeria implication in Hezbollah’s alleged cooperation with the Polisario. The Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Moroccan Ambassador to Algeria on Wednesday to condemn Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister’s statement in which he said that “Hezbollah has provided military training and weapons to the Polisario through Algeria.” Reacting to the Algerian move, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the while it understands Algeria’s embarrassment, it has “tangible evidence” that prove its implication in enabling Hezbollah’s support to the Algeria-backed Polisario Front. “Morocco understands Algeria’s embarrassment, its need to express its solidarity with its allies of Hezbollah, Iran and the polisario, as well as its attempt to deny its hidden role in this action against the Kingdom’s national security,” said the spokesperson of the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “The Kingdom of Morocco has precise data, tangible evidence, regarding Hezbollah’s political, media and military support for the polisario, in connivance with Iran. The Moroccan authorities took the necessary time to study all these elements carefully before making their decision, in full responsibility,” he added. The Moroccan official added that “it is common knowledge that Algeria, since 1975, has sheltered, armed, financed, trained and diplomatically been mobilized for the polisario separatists.” The recent tension comes on the heels of the Security Council Resolution 2414 on Western Sahara, which was adopted by the Security Council last Friday April 27. The resolution puts heavy on the Polisario, urges it to withdraw from the buffer zone and to refrain from taking any actions that could destabilize the region. In addition, the resolution called on neighboring countries (Algeria and Mauritania) to enhance their contribution to the UN-led political process. Morocco has for long called on the United Nations to consider Algeria as full-fledge part in the conflict. Though the United Nations has repeatedly called on the parties to the conflict to resume talks with the view to reaching a mutually acceptable political solution, Morocco has stressed in recent months that any negotiations without Algeria’s involvement would be fruitless.

Rabat – “There is no alternative to dialogue” for the Euro-African partnership on migration and development, Morocco’s minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, said Wednesday in Marrakech. He added, at the opening of the 5th Euro-African Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, dialogue is the only way to support the new mobility standards, making the migrant a central player in the Euro-African space. The renewed partnership that Morocco is advocating call for an element of complementarity, which would open opportunities for the two continents, he pointed out, noting that migration is not inevitable, but a global issue and a social and structural reality. “Migration is here to stay. It will continue to increase irregularly, at worst, and, at best, in a safe, orderly and regular manner,” the minister pointed out.  Indeed, the Euro-African dialogue on migration must be the subject of a renewed partnership, which allows Europeans and Africans to participate on an equal footing in the joint definition of the terms of cooperation, he added, noting that the partnership must be based on intra-continental and inter-continental solidarity. Bourita shed light on Morocco’s national migration and asylum strategy, which promotes the sustainable integration of migrants. “This policy has enabled two regularization operations, the last of which was marked by the submission of 28,400 applications, of which 95% were made by African nationals,” he said. The minister added that King Mohammed VI, the African Union Leader on the issue of migration, proposed at the 30th AU Summit an African Agenda on Migration. The summit would represent the culmination of an approach that considers migration a lever for co-development. The Agenda recommends the setting up of an African Migration Observatory in order to develop observation and the exchange of information between African countries and promote controlled management of migration flows, Bourita added. The Fifth Euro-African Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development kicked off Wednesday in Marrakech, with the participation of ministers from more than 50 countries.  The Euro-African Dialogue on Migration and Development (Rabat Process) is aimed at tackling questions arising from migration issues. The Rabat Process provides a framework for consultation and coordination; contributes to meeting the challenges posed by migration; and encourages opportunities for exchange and development.

Rabat – Following Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Tehran, the Polisario Front pledges to reinforce ties with Tehran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah. In an interview with Russian news outlet Sputnik, Mustapha Sayed, an official of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic denied Morocco’s accusations against Iran and Hezbollah. “Morocco’s accusations against Iran and Hezbollah of supporting the Polisario Front militarily are far from the truth, because the Sahrawis have had all the advanced weapons and missiles in their hands for years,” claimed Sayed. However, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita affirmed that the country has documented evidence, including names and specific incidents, that proves Hezbollah and Iran’s support for the Front logistically and strategically. Bourita added that Hezbollah sent military troops and offered the separatist group weapons and training sessions on urban warfare. The separatist representative told Sputnik, “We have an embassy in Tehran, but it is closed without a staff, and we are looking to develop our relations with Iran.” The Polisario, according to Sayed, “wants a strong partnership with Hezbollah.” “We have traveled to Beirut repeatedly, and we have asked to meet with the Hezbollah leadership, but we have not succeeded.” He added that the separatist group does not need weapons from Iran or Hezbollah. Sayed also claimed that Morocco’s decision was due to “pressure from Saudi Arabia.” Earlier today, Bourita denied that Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran is related to any foreign interference, including the current situation in Syria. “This decision was not taken under influence or pressure,” said Bourita during a meeting with representatives of the national and foreign press. Contesting Polisario’s claims, Bourita said, “When it comes to its territorial integrity, its national security, and the security of its citizens, Morocco can only be firm and makes clear decisions.” Gulf countries, including Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia have all welcomed Morocco’s decision, expressing full solidarity with the North African country and its territorial integrity.

Rabat – Morocco is denying that its decision to cut ties with Iran was taken in response to foreign pressure. The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign affairs said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the country has presented a detailed evidence to Iran “on the role of Hezbollah” and Iranian officials involved with military training, arms delivery for the Polisario Front separatists. Referring to claims by separatist media, the ministry published a set of arguments in conjunction with the statement, denying all claims that Morocco severed ties with Iran because of foreign pressure. In an interview with Sputnik, Mustapha Sayed, “minister” of the self-proclaimed  Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, claimed that Morocco was pressured into its decision by Saudi Arabia. “Following the rupture by the Kingdom of Morocco of its diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, some circles, in need of arguments, claimed that the Kingdom would have taken this decision under pressure from some countries,” said the statement.  According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Morocco has historically proven that it takes its positions independently in all regional and international crises. Furthermore, all  stances “correspond to its principles and respond to its own assessment.” The statement added that Morocco has demonstrated detailed evidence to Iran  on the role of Hezbollah, and the involvement of the Iranian embassy in Algiers, in military training, arms delivery and training for urban guerrilla operations.” Morocco has also denounced separatist claims, linking Morocco’s position to the adoption of the latest Security Council resolution on Western Sahara. “Firstly, the Security Council resolutions adopted in recent years have all strengthened Morocco’s position and recognized the preeminence of its Autonomy Initiative,” said the statement, adding that the front is grossly misrepresenting the situation through these claims. The ministry added that the most recent Security Council decision reflects the position of the international community on the situation in Western Sahara and Polisario’s illegal actions in the region. In conclusion, the source emphasized that Morocco’s decision “in no way concerns the friendly Iranian and Lebanese populations, who are strangers to this kind of hostile action, taken by Hezbollah in connivance with the Polisario under the blessing of Iran.”

Rabat – Moroccan football player Sofiane Boufal has caught the attention of the French club OGC Nice. After being suspended from Southampton Premier League following a fight with his coach Mark Hughes, the Atlas Lion is on the verge of leaving his club at the end of the season. Boufal may return to the Premier League, where he shined under the colors of LOSC.  According 10 Sport, OGC Nice is interested in the 24-year-old player, who is now training with the under-23 years. However, nothing has been made official, as there are no active negotiations at the moment. If Boufal is recruited by the French club, he will be following the footsteps of French-Moroccan attacking midfielder Younès Belhanda, who, before joining the Galatasaray Turkish football club, was playing for OGC Nice in 2016. Boufal has had his ups and downs with Southampton since he arrived in the summer of 2016, after trading from LOSC for nearly EUR 19 million. Born in Paris, Boufal came through the youth system at Angers and made his debut in the French second division at the age of 18. The following season, he became a first-team regular. Lille paid EUR 4 million for the Moroccan player in January 2015, which he quickly repaid with his speed and dribbling. Boufal first attracted the attention of top European clubs in 2016, when Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, and Inter Milan all reported expressed interest.

Rabat – Iran denied involvement in weapons delivery to the Polisario Front on Wednesday. One day after Morocco severed diplomatic relations with Iran due to its alleged alliance with the Hezbollah movement, a Polisario military supporter, Iran’s foreign ministry has announced in a statement that Bourita’s allegations are “false.” As the Iranian ministry calls Morocco’s allegations a “pretext” to sever ties, Hezbollah has condemned Bourita’s claims and attributed the diplomatic break to outcomes to “foreign pressure.” In contrast, Bourita has denied the influence of any regional or international developments on its decision and stressed that Morocco’s decision was purely bilateral, unrelated to situation in Syria or the Middle East. Upon his return from Tehran after meeting with the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammad Javad Zari, Bourita announced on Tuesday that Morocco possesses the names of Iranian supporters of the Polisario Front, as well as tangible proof of Hezbollah’s connections with the separatist group.  The same day, Morocco’s Ambassador to Iran, Hassan Hami, departed the country and returned to Morocco. Bourita also called on the Iranian ambassador in Rabat to leave Morocco “without delay.” As tension over the issue stretched throughout the day, Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, showed support and solidarity for Morocco’s decisions.

Rabat – At the first Blue Funds International Summit, held last weekend in Brazzaville, all eyes were set on the Moroccan monarch, as he delivered the keynote speech at his most high-profile public appearance in months, following his successful heart surgery in France. Invited as the special guest of Africa’s go-to summit on climate change and biodiversity, the King brought an armada of ministers and business leaders with him to reintroduce Morocco’s Africa-focused and South-South diplomacy positioned at the heart of discussions on the sidelines of the Brazzaville climate conference. Guinean President, Alpha Condé, once joked about king Mohammed VI being better versed in diplomatic dealings than his ministers and expert advisors. “He knows the dossiers more than his ministers,” the Guinean president said. On April 29, Condé’s joke seemed especially fitting, as the monarch filled the summit docket with continental projects for Pan-African sustainable development and South-South cooperation, bringing a close to months of a relatively uninspiring continental agenda. It is evident that King Mohammed VI is back in the driver seat of an initiative that he personally launched. With King Mohammed VI restored to leadership, it seems, Morocco not only gains in momentum and confidence, but possesses become the gravitational center of the continent that the King himself has put at the core of Morocco’s diplomacy. Speaking at the conference, the King reminded his “African brothers” of the centrality of sustainable development and socio-economic self-sufficiency, all of which he said entail the integration of the challenges facing African populations into decision-making processes. Beyond national representation, King Mohammed VI spoke for the entire continent in Brazzaville, illustrating his conviction that if Morocco is serious about its aspirations of continental leadership, it must be a reliable and exemplary leader poised to step in, inspire, and propose alternatives whenever urgent needs arise. In a speech that emphasized the necessity of “an awakening of consciousness” for a new and prosperous Africa, the Moroccan monarch told his peers and other participants that Morocco will never relent in its determination to contribute to the making of “a new Africa.” “Morocco will work with a determined and tireless mindset to realize our continent’s biggest projects,” the King said, referencing Morocco’s economic and strategic support since the inception of the Blue Funds project in November 2016, in Marrakech. Further showcasing Morocco’s determination to be an example and a reliable partner, the King oversaw the signing of dozens of bilateral agreements–spanning agriculture, maritime fisheries, rural development, scientific research, education, and tourism–with his Congolese counterpart, President Sassou Nguesso, on the sidelines of the Blue Funds conference. Regarding climate and biodiversity-related development alone, the Congolese Ministry of Energy and the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) signed many cooperation deals to develop and promote a culture of renewable energy-driven development. “We have a collective responsibility,” the King stated, adding that “shared accountability” and a “sense of sincere engagement” should be the driving light of intra-African collaboration. He also spoke about “Pan-African solidarity” as an essential tool to face up to the numerous challenges (climatic, as well as socio-economic) facing each the continent as a whole. Calling for a common vision, Mohammed VI said, “Challenges must be perceived as priorities, not threats.” The King’s return to the spotlight as a spokesperson for Africa was welcomed and applauded by  a number of observers, with some Congolese outlets hailing him as “a model of sincere engagement,” and others calling him “the King of Africa,” a reference to his commitment to Africa and his belief that “Africa should trust Africans.” However, decrying previous initiatives that failed to deliver on their promisess–like the Blue Funds–Congolese economist Daniel Koutia called for “more concrete results.” Nonetheless, he seemed more hopeful about the terms of the Blue Funds. “The perspective of having a tool for the sustainable development of Africa is very good. We must no longer depend on contributions from elsewhere [outside of Africa],” Mr. Koutia told France 24. Even prior Morocco’s return to the African Union, an institution the King calls “Morocco’s institutional family,” the North African country never really left Africa’s diplomatic stage. Morocco was already a leading African investor on the continent; as early as 2000, the King was already showing signs of turning Morocco’s diplomacy towards the South in general and Africa, in particular. The monarch conducted several royal visits to most of Africa’s French-speaking countries. On July 30 2015, the King said in speech that it was time for a total shift towards a diplomacy not only focused on Africa, but also was “more responsible and participative.” This, King Mohammed VI explained, meant that “Morocco should step outside of its comfort zone” by strengthening diplomatic ties with the whole continent, including the southern and eastern parts, known for a pro-Polisario stance (although this has been recently changing). Other watershed moments, including AU membership followed this bold and daring diplomatic step: working visits to almost every other African country, annulling the debts that fellow African states owed Morocco, and Morocco’s ECOWAS bid, all of which culminated in the establishment of a ministry entirely devoted to African affairs. In this sense, the recognition and respect that king Mohammed VI received in Brazzaville on April 29, symbolized the acknowledgement of Morocco’s continuous presence and efforts in providing its resources–both human and financial–to the strategic challenges facing Africa. As the King is expected to start another round of visits to further promote Morocco’s ECOWAS bid soon (specifically in West Africa), it remains to be seen whether his presence will boost an otherwise-sluggish process, brought about by his successful negotiation of Morocco’s entry into the continent’s largest and most promising regional market.

Rabat – Real Madrid has secured a pass to the Champions League final for the third consecutive time over Bayern Munich, after a 2-2 draw match with the visitors losing 4-3 on aggregate. After the referee’s whistle, the Bavarians scored an early goal in the second minute of the game, thanks to Muller’s cross into the box, netted by Kimmich. Eight minutes later, Real Madrid made a quick comeback with a surprisingly, simple header by Benzema, crossed by Marcelo from the left. Despite Madrid’s burst of strength, Bayern continued to dominate for the remainder half. Just seconds before the end of the first halftime, a cross from Kimmich struck the left arm of Marcelo inside the penalty zone. However, the referee waved away Bayern’s claim to a penalty, a fact that Marcelo later admitted. He told reporters, “It’s a hand–it hits me in the hand, and it’s a penalty. If I say it does not hit me, I’m lying, but football is like that. “I do not talk about the referees, but it is clear that sometimes it is wrong in our favor and other times against. No matter what happens, you have to play football.” Despite the Germans’ effort to shake their rivals’ net, Benzema exploited the goalkeeper’s fault just a few seconds after the second half-time to score the second goal for Real Madrid. With determination and team spirit, the former Real Madrid player, James Rodriguez, evened out the score, followed up an initial kick to net his own rebound, 62 minutes into play. The German club was determined to pull out a win, but Zidane have managed to keep the score in Real Madrid’s favor. This match was marked by the Benzema comeback, who apparently went quiet this season, but Zidane, Ronaldo, and the rest of the team did not stop believing in his skills, as Marcelo told the press: “It is clear that he had to arrive, Karim is a great player and he does not need to score goals every day to show what he is worth.” In April, Ronaldo agreed, “As long as I’m with Real Madrid, you [Benzema] will have your place secured.” Despite Real Madrid President Florentino Perez’s anger over keeping Benzema as an attacker, Ronaldo and Zidane have reminded Perez of Benzema’s ability to achieve his goals, in addition to his importance among the players. Zinedine Zidane has repeatedly proven that he is good at what he does; he was right in sticking with his current team and working through obstacles to achieve better results. Will Zidane leave his mark on history and lead Real Madrid to its 12th Champions League title, the third in a row?

Rabat – Kanye West can’t seem to hold his tongue. After declaring his love and support for Donald Trump, West is under fire once again for controversial comments suggesting slavery was a “choice.” The American rapper–who recently lost 9 million Twitter followers after his pro-Trump tweets–continued to praise Trump during an interview with the American tabloid TMZ. Kanye with the worst take yet “You hear about slavery for 400 years. 400 years?! That sounds like a choice.” pic.twitter.com/jJwtByDuyH — Alazar Moges (@zarzarbinkss) May 1, 2018  “When you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice!” Trump’s new BFF said. “Like, you was there for 400 years, and it’s all y’all? You know, it’s like, we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks,” he continued. West didn’t stop there; he continued to make his point, saying that prison is something that “unites [people] as one race.” Following his comments, Kim Kardashian’s husband was completely shut down by writer and TMZ’s podcaster Van Lathan, who gave West a history lesson. “I just don’t think you are thinking anything. I think what you are doing right now is an afterthought…And while you are making music and being an artist, the rest of us in society have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice,” he said. Lathan was very hurt and disappointed by West who has “morphed into something that is not real.” “I will combat your free thought with my free thought, because mine is grounded in the reality that I have been given and the reality that I am going to change, but I am not going to do it by pretending that the enemies are on the same team as me,” concluded the writer. West later tweeted that his comments on Tuesday had been misinterpreted. “To make myself clear, of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will,” he wrote.  Alas, it was too late for the 40-year-old singer to explain himself: the hashtag #IfSlaveryWasAChoice has taken Twitter by storm, as the Black community ironically responds to “Yeezy” with memes mocking his statements.    The winner of multiple Grammy Awards returned to social media two weeks ago, after a year-long silence on Twitter, following his hospitalization in a Los Angeles psychiatric facility in November 2016.  In his Twitter comeback, the artists has been rapid-fire posting up to 20  messages per hour, on subjects ranging from politics to philosophy and fashion.

Rabat- United Nations Special Representative for International Migration, Louise Arbour, acknowledged Morocco’s role in addressing migration-related issues on Tuesday in Marrakech. Arbour discussed Morocco’s migration policy during talks with Morocco’s Minister of Interior, Abdelouafi Laftit, prior to the 5th Euro-African Ministerial Conference on Migration, which opened today.  The event convenes ministers and high-level representatives from the European Union and Africa, and will feature the official adoption of the Marrakech Declaration and the Marrakech Action Plan.

In addition, Marrakech will host the intergovernmental conference on international migration in December, which will see the adoption of the global compact for safe, orderly, and regular migration. The global compact seeks to address human rights-related and developmental aspects of international migration.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar have all expressed their full solidarity with Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran, regarding its involvement in delivering military equipment to the Polisario Front. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry expressed the country’s support in a statement published by the official Saudi news agency, SPA, on Tuesday. In the statement, the ministry emphasized that Saudi Arabia stands by “the  Kingdom of Morocco in all that threatens its security, stability, and territorial integrity.” Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, confirmed that Morocco has evidence of Hezbollah’s connection with Polisario, including the names of supporters. “The Saudi government strongly condemns the Iranian interference in Morocco’s internal affairs through its tool, Hezbollah’s terrorist militia, which is training the elements of the so-called Polisario.” Saudi Arabia also supports Morocco and its rights to safeguard its interests and territorial integrity, emphasizing that the Saudi Kingdom affirms its support for Morocco in “all that guarantees its security and stability, including its decision to sever its relations with Iran.” Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Adel bin Ahmed Al Jubeir condemned Iran’s interference in Morocco’s internal affairs. Al Jubeir wrote on his Twitter on Tuesday that Iran “is destabilizing the security of Arab and Islamic countries by igniting sectarianism, interfering in their internal affairs, and supporting terrorism.” He added that and what Iran has done with  Morocco through its alliance with Hezbollah is the “best proof of that.” The same statement was echoed by UAE’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, and Bahrain’s Foreign Minister, Sheikh Khalid Al Khalifa. Gargash wrote on his Twitter that his country “stands by Morocco in its concern over its national issues and against Iranian interference in its domestic affairs.” He added that UAE’s policy and supportive stance towards Morocco “is based on a deep historical foundation established by Sheikh Zayed and King Hassan, may they rest in peace.” “Our stance is fixed for better or worse,” he added. Quoted by Bahrain News Agency, Al Khalifa confirmed that Iran was backing and financing “the enemies of Morocco.” “This requires a collective Arab stance and actions to confront all forms of Iranian interference in the internal affairs of the Arab states and to stop Iran’s attempts to threaten Arab security and spread violence and chaos in the region,”  he said. Qatari News Agency QNA quoted a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar in support of Morocco’s interest to preserve security and stability against all attempts to undermine its territorial integrity, or to target its safety and that of its citizens. Qatar also stressed “the importance of respecting the principles governing relations between states, with respect for sovereignty.” The show of Gulf support follows an official statement by Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita issued Tuesday, which declared Morocco’s decision to sever diplomatic relations with Iran due to the Iranian alliance with the Hezbollah movement, a military supporter of the separatist group. The minister also verified that Morocco has also recalled its ambassador to Tehran, adding that the country plans to close its Tehran-based embassy and expel its ambassador. “We have strong [and indisputable] proof, including names and specific incidents, that indicate that Hezbollah is logistically and strategically supporting the Polisario Front,” the minister’s announced, specifying that “Hezbollah sent military officials” to Polisario, “provided the front with weapons, and trained its troops on urban warfare.”

Rabat – Former Franco-Moroccan journalist at the satirical magazine “Charlie Hebdo,” Zineb El Rhazoui, has opened up about anti-Semitism in the world, especially in Morocco, where she was born. Zineb El Rhazoui, who is now living under police protection following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015, has spoken up in the French publication L’Observateur regarding the recent manifesto signed by 250 French personalities against the “new anti-Semitism.” In the newspaper column, the 36-year-old activist supports the signatories, who have been accused by some groups of stigmatizing Muslims and increasing religious sectarianism. El Rhazoui spent most of her childhood in Morocco where she recalls hearing the word “Yhoudi” (Jewish) as an insult for the first time 30 years ago. “It was in a large family reunion and someone had used the phrase ‘Yhoudi ould lyhoud’ (Jewish son of a Jew) to tell him he was a naughty kid,” she said. Though the former journalist explained that she would hear different variations of this “insult” throughout her life in Morocco, she still identifies her homeland as “the least anti-Semitic in the Arab world.” She then recounts how the director of her primary school severely punished her and her classmates, after they threw trash in the yard of the neighbor’s house and insulted to the residents, a Jewish family. “For the first time, we realized that our anti-Semitism was wrong. Ironically, it was our professor, a brilliant Palestinian intellectual refugee in Morocco–the founder of our school–who taught us.” “The New Anti-Semitism” is a book to be published Wednesday in France where fifteen French intellectuals take the pen to denounce the “poison of anti-Semitic crimes committed in France by Islamists,” according to French media Le Parisien. More than 250 signatories responded to a call by a collective, including El Rhazoui, the former director of “Charlie Hebdo” Philippe Val, the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, three former French prime ministers, religious representatives, intellectuals, and several artists.

Rabat – Morocco has recalled its ambassador to Tehran, indicating the country’s decision to effectively sever diplomatic ties with Iran over the latter’s military support for the Polisario Front, the self-styled separatist group advocating for independence in Western Sahara. The announcement was made on Tuesday this week by Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, who confirmed that the country will close its Tehran-based embassy and expel Iran’s ambassador. Bourita said that Morocco has strong evidence implicating Hezbollah, the Tehran-backed Lebanese Shiite militant group, in military exercises aiming to disrupt Morocco’s interests, namely the country’s territorial integrity in Western Sahara. Hezbollah is arming and training the separatist front through the Iranian embassy in Algiers, the minister revealed. “We have strong [and indisputable] proof, including names and specific incidents, that indicate that Hezbollah is logistically and strategically supporting the Polisario Front,” the minister’s announced, specifying that “Hezbollah sent military officials” to Polisario, “provided the front with weapons, and trained its troops on urban warfare.” The Western Sahara Question or the Regional Power Balance Morocco’s decision came immediately after Mr. Bourita’s visit to Tehran, where the Moroccan official met with his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, and explained Morocco’s unfailing seriousness and high sensitivity about the inviolability of its sovereignty. And while this is not the first time that Rabat has ended diplomatic relations with Tehran over Morocco’s commitment to geographical boundaries—Morocco previously severed ties with Iran in 2009, when Tehran engaged in comments and activities that “challenged and endangered Bahrain’s territorial integrity.” Meanwhile, Hezbollah sees Morocco’s move as a veiled political desire to weigh in on the power dynamics of the region. In response to Bourita’s announcement, the militant group issued a statement that accused Morocco of propagating “false and politically motivated allegations.” “It is a pity that Morocco yields to American, Israeli, and Saudi pressures to make such false accusations,” the militant group said in a statement that immediately followed the official announcement of Morocco’s decision. The statement ironically added that “Morocco’s foreign ministry was free to come up with a more convincing reason for severing ties with Iran,” a suggestion that other factors were at stake. Morocco is adamant about the “sacredness” of its territorial integrity. Speaking under conditions of anonymity, a Moroccan diplomatic source told one national outlet that Morocco is unrepentant when it comes to its sovereignty. “For Morocco, nothing outweighs national integrity,” the source said, explaining that although diplomatic versatility (broadening alliances and extending the country’s diplomatic reach, even to countries historically hostile to the kingdom) is of paramount importance in King Mohammed VI’s new diplomatic guidelines, Morocco could not repeatedly tolerate Iran [and Hezbollah’s] unacceptable intrusion in Morocco’s internal and religious affairs. “There is proof of collaboration between Hezbollah and the Polisario Front to thwart Moroccan interests,” he concluded. Unbridgeable Ideological Differences? In 2014, five years after the 2009 diplomatic rift, King Mohammed VI appointed a new ambassador to Tehran, resuming Rabat-Tehran bilateral ties. However, the ties were reportedly never resolved conclusively, due to pointed disagreements in both religious and political ideology. Furthermore, Moroccan officials have continuously suspected Hezbollah and Iran of proselytizing Shi’a Islam in various Moroccan circles, namely Moroccans living abroad.  Morocco, which is also considered a standard bearer of Sunni Islam across the African continent, has consistently had to battle against the unrelenting desire of Hezbollah to spread Shi’a Islam in various parts of the continent, especially in Francophone countries in sub-Saharan Africa known to host sizable numbers of Lebanese nationals. In mid-March 2018, for example, Morocco thwarted Hezbollah’s ideological maneuverings in Ivory Coast, where the militant group tried to convert Moroccans living in the West African country to Shi’a Islam. Moroccan officials said on the occasion that the group was engaged in a broader game of ruining Moroccan interests by undoing its diplomatic and economic advances in Ivory Coast and other countries in the region. Although the religious and ideological factors do have a great significance in the matter, some commentators have suggested that the (unspoken) reason  can be found elsewhere: the March 2017 arrest of Lebanese businessman Qassim Mohammed Taj al-Din, one of Hezbollah’s most significant financial suppliers regarding the group’s proselytizing mission in Africa. The Lebanese businessman, who was heading to Beirut from Conakry (Guinea), was blacklisted by the US Homeland Security, leading to his arrest by Moroccan officials on charges of terrorism. “Hezbollah has been taking revenge since his arrest,” Minister Nasser Bourita said on Tuesday, explaining that though the militant group’s anti-Moroccan sentiments are not new, Mr. al-Din’s arrest was a turning point, as the incident allegedly played an instrumental role in the exacerbation of Hezbollah’s hostility vis-à-vis Morocco. “Following this arrest, Hezbollah sent arms to Polisario, provided trainings on urban warfare… and delivered SAM9 and SAM11 missiles to the Polisario Front.” Arguing that Morocco’s security is non-negotiable, some officials have said that in spite of King Mohammed VI’s genuine belief in and commitment to improving bilateral ties with as many partners as possible, some countries’ documented and known hostility towards Morocco render rapprochement very difficult, if not outright impossible.

Rabat- Morocco has experienced a 0.1 percent increase in the price index of industrial production in March 2018, according to a report by the Moroccan Higher Planning Commission (HCP).  In its latest report, the HCP, in charge of economic, demographic, and social statistics, revealed that the industrial production index rose to 0.1 percent compared to February, with the exception of oil refining.  Progress throughout March is linked to the increase in production prices of metallurgy by 0.7 percent, pulp and paper industry by 1.0 percent, electrical equipment production by 1.1 percent, clothing and textile production, and woodwork and cork production each rose by 0.4 percent, respectively. Industrial production prices also saw some decrease in the same period, as metal fabrication decreased by 0.1 percent, although machinery equipment production remained unchanged. Meanwhile, prices of extractive industries and electric power and water distribution experienced no change and amounted to MAD 115.3 kWh for electricity prices, and MAD 119.0 Kl for water throughout the entire month since February.

Rabat – For the past ten consecutive days, Moroccans have been boycotting the products of three major companies that have been monopolizing the Moroccan market for decades.  The French-owned dairy company Centrale Danone, Les Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès, a bottled water company owned and operated by the renowned businesswoman Miriem Bensalah Chaqroun, and Afriquia Gaz, a gas and oil distribution company owned by the Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch. The companies own and operate some of the most popular brands in Morocco, including Centrale milk and yogurt products such as Raibi Jamila and dan’up; Sidi Ali, Oulmes, and Ain Atlas bottled waters. Afriquia Gaz also operates gas stations, attached to popular shopping centers like Marjane and at rest areas alongside Morocco’s highways. 

For ordinary Moroccans, these companies have failed their customers due to unjustified price increases and corporate policies aimed at benefiting owners and shareholders at the cost of consumers and vendors. 
Since its inception, the boycott has caused the concerned companies’ market shares to shift in their competitors’ favor. In the case of Central Danone, some small local companies and cooperatives have been reaping the benefits of their counterparts’ losses and increasing their market shares and their distribution outreach.

Moroccans have been posting and sharing several funny videos on social media to increase awareness of the issue, mock the poor response of the companies, and spread their message in the face of the defiance and ignorance they faced from upper company management.

While the length of the boycott was initially scheduled for one month, many are calling for a permanent boycott in order to break down the monopoly and improve the competitiveness of local companies. In the case of Central Danone, an extension of boycott would seriously damage the company’s revenue, as the holy month of Ramadan–the month with the highest dairy sales tied to fasting practices–is only two weeks away. While many have applauded the success of the boycott, the companies are still struggling to contain the crisis before they lose a grip on a market they took for granted for so long.  What is next for these three major companies in the Moroccan market: will they reconcile with their nationwide angry customers, or will this ban serve as an opportunity for other competitors to emerge as strong key players, filling the void left in the giants’ wake?

By Mohamed Bella Rabat – The biblical story of David and Goliath can be applied to many areas of everyday life. Whether it is in business, sports, or politics, this story teaches us how to face gigantic problems and impossible situations.  No one wanted to face the mighty Goliath. They were all scared to death of him, except for David, who decided to come forward and face the giant. Everybody said, “David, sit down! You are no match for Goliath.” They all saw how David had no shield, no armor, and no sword. On the other hand, Goliath had a sword, a javelin, and a spear. Everyone recognized how David wasn’t as well-equipped as Goliath. However, the young shepherd said, “I can do it! I believe in what I have, and I am able to bring down the giant.” The account of David facing Goliath applies to the 2026 FIFA World Cup bid. Morocco is entering the race as an underdog against a tripartite coalition of the USA, Canada, and Mexico. No one can deny that the North African country isn’t as fully-equipped as the three North American giants. Morocco’s infrastructure and economy are no match for those of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. However, as a developing country, Morocco believes in what it has to offer as host of the 48-team tournament. Moroccans believe they can beat the Canada–Mexico–United States 2026 FIFA World Cup bid, which has been branded United 2026. There can be no doubt that if the World Cup were to happen tomorrow, Morocco wouldn’t be ready to host it. In contrast, the United bid has the capacity, preparedness, and agility to stage the tournament not only tomorrow, but today. However, the 2026 FIFA World Cup is neither today nor tomorrow. It is a fact that Morocco’s infrastructure is far behind that of the United bid countries. However, just like Morocco’s bid shows certain disadvantages and advantages, the United bid does as well. In terms of safety and security, crime rates and gun issues continue to exist in North America. A report released on February of this year by the Center for American Progress stated that American guns were used in crimes in both Mexico and Canada. In 2016, Mexico had the second-highest rate of murders, second only to the war-torn Syria. By contrast, Morocco’s proposal to host the 2026 World Cup promises safety for visiting teams and fans. According to the Global Terrorism Index, Morocco is safer than Germany, Spain, the UK, and France, and far safer than the US, Canada, and Mexico. Regarding television broadcasting, a World Cup in North America means a loss in revenues within European and Middle Eastern television markets as most viewers can’t watch football games based in the North American time zone, which is 5 hours or more behind. Morocco’s Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and proximity to both European and Middle Eastern lucrative markets is a favorable feature that could elevate the value of the World Cup television ratings as well as generate a large portion of FIFA’s revenues. Morocco is on the same time zone as the UK; two hours behind Germany, Spain, Italy, and France; and three hours behind Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. FIFA World Cup corporate sponsors and partners are paramount pillars of the world’s most popular sports event. Morocco’s time zone and location are qualities that can attract European and Middle Eastern sponsors in order to improve the profitability of FIFA. Having said that, there is no doubt that the United bid, by and large, would be a monumental event, especially in the USA as Uncle Sam’s land has a great history and culture in traditional sporting events. Besides, FIFA is seeking to establish a market in North America as North American sponsors and partners will fill FIFA coffers along with the already existing partners such as the Russian, Qatari, and Chinese sponsors. In fact, the World Cup would be a sure-fire opportunity to take advantage of an underutilized resource like North America. What FIFA would lose in Europe and the Middle East would be a win within the North American market. FIFA always does what is best for its own business and politics, not what is best for football fans. While a World Cup in North America would bring loads of cash into FIFA’s treasure chest, it would, on the other hand, empty the fans’ pockets. The expense of traveling to and around three countries is high,and the majority of fans can’t afford it. Having the World Cup in Morocco would save the supporters from crossing an entire continent just to watch football matches. Speaking of fans, unlike its American and Canadian fellows, Morocco is a big fan of football. It is without a doubt a pivotal component of Morocco’s culture. On any day and in any place, football is part of Moroccan life. Case in point, the Chief Executive Officer of Morocco’s bid stated during a presentation in Marrakesh, “Football is in our DNA.” Football to Moroccans is like American football, basketball, or baseball is to Americans, or like Ice hockey or lacrosse to Canadians. To become the World Cup’s host nation, Morocco’s bid and the United bid both need to go through two phases. First, to get to the next stage, they need to obtain approval by FIFA’s Executive Committee that is under the control of the FIFA Board. The second and final phase is voting, which is conducted among all of FIFA’s 211 member federations. The polling is in the hands of nations and federations that will seek what is best for their own business, teams, supporters, and politics. In the long run, to host the World Cup is a business and political game as much as a sporting one. Politics and business will play a role in determining who hosts the 2026 World Cup. Clearly, Morocco still believes in its few pros to bring down the joint power of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Like David, Morocco enters the battle with only a slim chance of winning, but therein lies all the magic. There is a Moroccan proverb that says, “Thou shalt not underestimate the force of a thin wooden rod, because it can blind you.” Walking towards Goliath with confidence, David puts a stone in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly. It hits Goliath’s forehead and the giant falls face-down at David’s feet. Janet Maslin wrote in the New York Times, “We consistently get these kinds of conflicts wrong by failing to realize that giants have weaknesses and that underdogs can accomplish the unexpected.” At the end of the day, David’s unorthodox weapon proved to be an advantage that helped him win the duel against the powerful giant.

Rabat – Amid the ongoing boycott against the high prices of certain Moroccan-made products, dairy company Centrale Danone published a statement on Facebook on Wednesday, denying that it has increased the cost of its milk products over time. The denial arrives more than a week after the launch of the boycott targeting Sidi Ali bottled water, Central Danone dairy products, and the Afriquia gas stations. In the same press release, Centrale Danone apologizes for a statement by Purchasing Director for Centrale Danone, Adil Benkirane, that denounces the boycott and characterizes online protesters as betraying the country and its products. Centrale Danone confirmed that Benkirane’s statement “does not reflect the company’s official stance.”
 Furthermore, the company denied accusations of high prices: “Conscious of the value of milk and its health benefits, Centrale Danone has maintained the price of milk since July 2013, despite continuous rise of its production expenses. “Accompanied by erroneous information about an alleged price increase,” the campaign took the company’s staff by “surprise.” Centrale Danone concluded its statement, emphasizing that it will  continue to work “hard to satisfy consumers by serving 78,000 points of sale per day.” Centrale Danone is the first company to officially comment on the boycott following statements from officials, including Akhannouch, owner of the Afriquia gas company. Earlier this week, an employee at  Centrale Danone told MWN that the factory’s products have been rejected by grocery store owners around the region, emphasizing that the administrators haven’t yet decided to reduce prices, despite the major losses, estimated at 15 to 20 percent. Meetings at Centrale are set for the near future to discuss potential solutions.  On the sidelines of the annual International Agricultural Fair in Meknes (SIAM), Akhannouch condemned the boycott, asserting the ineffectiveness of an internet boycott against 470,000 employees in the dairy sector. Furthermore, he reprimanded citizens, saying they should be thankful for the fact that there are no milk shortages and the product is available throughout the year. Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid has also denounced the campaign, emphasizing that “We must encourage Moroccan companies and products, unlike some fools who call for a boycott of Moroccan companies.” The boycott remains ongoing throughout the country, though the Afriquia gas and Sidi Ali have not yet released any official response.

Rabat – After months of silence on America’s bid to host the World Cup, President Trump took the sporting world by surprise—well, as much as the bombastic Trump can—when he tweeted a threatening message last week, calling on countries supporting Morocco to reconsider their votes regarding the 2026 World Cup. Trump tweeted that it was a “shame” that countries to which America has lent its financial and strategic support in the past are now reported to be supporting a bid other than the “strong one put together” by the North American trio. “Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)” Trump asked in his tweet, suggesting that foreign policy under Trump is essentially—perhaps only—guided by a tit-for-tat philosophy. The “presidential tweet” received negative responses, with various FIFA spokespersons saying that the body’s regulations unequivocally condemn any political interference in the bidding procedures. Some American and foreign outlets even reported that Trump’s tweet is essentially counterproductive; resorting to extortion may have put the North American World Cup prospects in jeopardy. A person other than Trump would have considered softening the controversial sentiment that his message sent to countries mostly in Africa and the Arab world that might have felt specifically targeted by the veiled threat and Trump’s self-congratulatory tone. But despite the furor that followed his World Cup message, Trump appears convinced that extortion is an effective–if not the sole–means to gather support for America’s joint bid with Canada and Mexico. On the other hand, some commentators have suggested that Trump simply can’t stop being Trump. In glaring defiance of FIFA’s response to his provocative tweet, the president reaffirmed his previous statements on Monday, suggesting that he truly meant what he tweeted, and that no one (who do FIFA think they are?) can make him back-pedal on his very Trumpian tweet. What is more, Trump provided an answer to those who may have doubted doubting whether he had specific targets in mind at tweet time. Upon receiving Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari on a diplomatic visit, Trump pulled the World Cup card, calling on “countries in the continent” to support America’s World Cup bid.  Speaking in the Rose Garden, following his one-on-one meeting with President Buhari, Mr. Trump put the bilateral relations ostensibly at the heart of the visit on the backburner to issue yet another veiled threat against countries that may not be supporting the United 2026 World Cup dream. “We hope to be the economic partner of choice for nations across the continent and all around the world,” Trump said, adding that the US is “respected again” when it comes to trade and commercial relations. He further emphasized that he hopes that all African countries will support the North American trio in its World Cup adventure, promising that the US “will likewise support” [those who will vote for its bid]. Alas, the most Trumpian part of the speech was yet to come: “We will be watching very closely and any help they could give us in that bid we would appreciate.” Trump is convinced that the US can get away with coercion and corruption, in terms of commercial and strategic benefits, that would have crushed the chances of any other bidding country.  As the only contender facing the North American trio in what now seems to be a geopolitical struggle, Morocco 2026 says that it is counting on sports-related activities to convince voters of the quality and merits of Morocco’s candidacy on June 13, when national federations will convene in Moscow to determine the best strategy.

Rabat – Morocco’s decision to sever relations with Iran over the latter’s military support for the Polisario Front is purely bilateral. Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, denied any influence of regional or international developments. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, stressed that Hezbollah military officers have traveled to Tindouf camps in Algeria to train military leaders of the separatist Polisario Front to use SAM-9 and anti-aircraft missiles. Bourita said that cutting ties with Iran is not related to the situation in Syria or Middle East. “This decision was not taken under influence or pressure,” said Bourita during a meeting with representatives of the national and foreign press, recalling that “[Morocco] had resumed diplomatic relations with Iran in 2014, while it was a crisis with countries that have friendly relations with Morocco.” “When it comes to its territorial integrity, its national security and the security of its citizens, Morocco can only be firm and makes clear decisions,” said the Moroccan official. Bourita said that Morocco would close its embassy in Tehran and expel the Iranian ambassador from Rabat. The minister said in his announcement that Morocco “has evidence that the Teheran-backed Lebanese Shiite militant group, Hezbollah, is arming and training the separatist front through the Iranian embassy in Algiers.” “Morocco has strong [and indisputable] proof, including names and specific incidents, that indicate that Hezbollah is logistically and strategically supporting the Polisario Front,” the minister explained. “Hezbollah’s actions seek to undwermine Moroccan interests and constitute an attack on the country’s territorial integrity.” Bourita said that the Iran-backed Hezbollah sent military officials to Polisario, provided the front with weapons, and trained its troops on urban warfare. This is not the first time that Rabat has severed ties with Teheran. In 2009, Morocco severed ties with Iran after the latter challenged and threatened Bahrain territorial integrity. Although the two countries later resumed their bilateral relations 5 years after the first rift, in 2014, ties between them were never sturdy, in part because of Tehran rivalry with Saudi Arabia, Morocco’s utmost ally in the Arab world.

Rabat – Moroccan-Indian relations are getting stronger, as Morocco prepares to implement several measures to welcome more Indian tourists in 2019. After welcoming 21,850 Indian visitors in 2017, the North African country aims to double the number of Indian tourists in 2019, stated the Moroccan Ambassador in India, Mohamed Malki, on Monday, according to Maghreb Arab Press. To encourage Indian citizens to visit Morocco, Malki wants to put together a strategic plan that includes facilitating the process of obtaining visas to Morocco. In an interview with the Press Trust of India, Malki said that within a period of two to three months, a representative body from the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) will open in New Delhi in order to promote Morocco’s high potential on the Indian market. “The opening of a representative body of the ONMT will allow us to plan strategic promotion programs in order to benefit from the Indian market, which offers great opportunities,” said Mohamed Malki. To formalize his plan of welcoming more Indian tourists, the ambassador held a meeting with thirty travel agencies specializing in event tourism in the economic capital, Mumbai, with several Indian media representatives present. The event, organized in collaboration with the world’s oldest travel agency “Cox and Kings Global Services,” allowed the Moroccan diplomat to review the kingdom’s major tourist attractions and historical monuments. Last month, Morocco and India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in New Delhi, with aims of strengthening cooperation between the two countries in the fields of mining and geology. Moroccan-Indian relations strengthened after King Mohammed VI’s historic visit to New Delhi in October 2015, as part of the India-Africa Forum Summit.

Rabat – Morocco has decided to cut relations with Iran, due to its alliance with the Hezbollah movement, which militarily supports the “Polisario,” announced Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, in a press conference on Tuesday. Bourita made the announcement upon his return from Tehran, where he met with the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammad Javad Zari. The minister confirmed that Morocco has documented evidence of the connections between Polisario and Hezbollah, including names of supporters. Morocco’s Ambassdor to Iran, Hassan Hami, departed the country and returned to Morocco today. Nasser Bourita, said he will receive today the Chargé d’affaires of the Iranian embassy in Rabat to ask him to leave the Kingdom of Morocco “without delay.” “I have just returned from Tehran where I had a meeting with Iranian Foreign minister Jawad Darif. I informed him of the decision of the Kingdom of Morocco to break off diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Bourita said during a meeting with representatives of the national and foreign press in Rabat. Morocco’s ambassador in Tehran, Hassan Hami, left Iran today, Bourita, said.  “I will receive the chargé d’affaires of the Iranian embassy in 30 minutes to ask him to leave the Kingdom of Morocco without delay,” added the minister,” he added. “This decision is a reaction to the confirmed involvement of Iran through Hezbollah in an alliance with the ‘Polisario’ against national security and the higher interests of the Morocco,” Bourita told the press. Bourita said that “Morocco has irrefutable evidence, identified names and specific facts that corroborate this connivance between the ‘Polisario’ and Hezbollah against the higher interests of Morocco.” This is not the first time that Rabat has severed ties with Tehran. In 2009, Morocco severed all diplomatic ties with Iran, after Iran questioned Sunni rule in Shiite-majority Bahrain. Although the two countries resumed their bilateral relations in 2014, ties between the nations were never stable, due to the fact that Tehran historically supported Polisario, and Iran denounced Morocco’s relations with Saudi Arabia. More recently, in mid-March, Morocco thwarted Hezbollah’s ideological maneuvers in the Ivory Coast, specifically, a militant group attempting to convert Moroccans living in the West African country to Shi’a Islam. Moroccan officials said on the occasion that the group was engaged in a broader strategy of ruining Moroccan interests by undoing its diplomatic and economic advances in Ivory Coast and other countries in the region. In 2016, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, which collectively encompass Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, categorized Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Algeria were the only member-states to reject the categorization. Previously in 1981, Tehran cut ties with Rabat following King Hassan II’s decision to give asylum to the US-backed Shah, who had been forced into exile after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Today, although many nations, including the US and France, consider the entire Hezbollah organization a terrorist organization, other political bodies and nations, like the European Union and the UK, consider Hezbollah a political entity, condemning only the military wing of the group. In addition to Iran, the Assad regime in Syria, Cuba, and North Korea maintain close relations with Hezbollah.

Rabat – The five African national teams that qualified for the World Cup, including Morocco, will receive an estimated USD 2 million each, for their preparations for the Russian World Cup, according to CAF website. This decision follows negotiations initiated by the CAF President, Ahmad Ahmad, with the FIFA administration, which resulted in the exceptional agreement reached on April 12. It follows a decision by the CAF Emergency Committee, held on December 1, 2017 and approved by the CAF Executive Committee on January 10, 2018, to provide exceptional financial support to the five African representatives for their preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. “This agreement aims to allow the teams to have smooth preparations and to settle in advance the question of the bonuses due to the players, in order to avoid the renewal of internal conflicts, which [previously] seriously affected the image of the African football, with a significant impact on team performance,” said CAF President Ahmad. The five African qualified teams–Morocco, Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, and Nigeria–are invited to contact the FIFA financial division to finalize the process.

Rabat – Saad Lamjarred is coming back to Morocco to spend Ramadan with his family. “I will be spending the Ramadan in Morocco inchallah,” announced the singer of Ghazali to his 6.1 million followers on Instagram.  Ramadan fel maghrib inshllah ?#????_????_????? #saadlamjarred1 #love_my_fans_forever_and_ever @kamalaitphotography A post shared by  saadlamjarred (@saadlamjarred1) on Apr 30, 2018 at 3:31pm PDT  Lamjarred will be pushing his luck if he stays for the entire holy month, as he needs to return to France before June 4, to present himself at the Tribunal of Grande Instance in Paris. The singer missed his original court date–a civil complaint brought against him by his victim Laura Prioul– on April 9, allegedly because he was “celebrating” his birthday the previous night. Last month, Prioul’s lawyer requested a medical expert in Paris, aiming to establish a link between the rape she reportedly suffered in October 2016, and the deterioration of her state of health since. It’s not the first time that the pop star is returning to Morocco since he was released from jail on April 2017. The 32-year-old sensation was granted the right to travel to the kingdom last March, on a “temporary” visit to present his single “Ghazali.” Though singer’s electronic monitoring bracelet was removed in October 2017, Lamjarred is still technically prohibited from leaving French territory, pending the end of the investigation and the start of the trial. However, he was able to obtain a limited authorization to leave the French territory at the discretion of an investigating judge. French authorities arrested Lamjarred on October 26, 2016. He was released and put under surveillance on April 13, 2017. Lamjarred also faced sexual assault and rape charges in 2010, when an Albanian-American woman accused him of rape and violence in the US.

Rabat- Morocco’s government spokesperson and Minister Delegate for Relations with Parliament and Civil Society, Mustapha El Khalfi, announced on Monday in Rabat, that the number of hunger strikes observed by detainees in Moroccan prisons dropped by approximately 37 percent between 2014 and 2017. Answering an oral question on the matter from the Istiqlalian Group of Unity and Egalitarianism at the House of Representatives, El Khalfi said that in 2014, 2,700 cases of hunger striking were recorded, while in 2017, this number decreased by about 1,000 cases, demonstrating a continuous downward trend. The minister pointed out that once a hunger strike is registered, the participating detainees are summoned for inquiry as to the reasons for their actions, with the aim of urging reconsideration. He added that if the reason for the strike was related to the conditions of detention, the detainee petition will be satisfied according to the law. El Khalfi underlined that if the strike is conducted for other reasons, the demands of the inmates are transferred to the competent authorities. He emphasized that the inmates are regularly kept informed about the progress of their files in line with Article 131, related to the organization of penitentiary institutions. The inmate, in turn, is obliged to inform the judicial authorities, family, and the central administration of the reasons for the hunger strike.

Rabat- Moroccan citizens continue to rise together, boycotting the exorbitant prices of Sidi Ali (mineral water), Centrale Laitière (dairy products) and Afriquia (gasoline). The ongoing boycott campaign has already led to significant financial consequences for the companies, as confirmed by recent reports. Under the slogans “Say No to High Prices,” and “Let it Spoil” (referring to the milk boycott), young protesters first launched the boycott campaign on Twitter and Facebook on April 20. Since then, the boycott has come to embody unified Moroccan citizenship speaking out against rising commodity prices. Morocco World News spoke to shoppers, shopkeepers, and grocery store workers alike to hear their thoughts on ongoing boycott. Pointing to a row of Sidi Ali bottles, one Rabat shopkeeper stated: “This is all I have left of Sidi Ali bottles and they will remain here untouched…Everyone is boycotting and so am I,” he added. “We are all with the people.” Another shopkeeper, was eager to discuss the subject: “I’m boycotting the three of them [Sidi Ali, Centrale Laitière, Afriquia]. As you can see, there is not a bottle of Sidi Ali or Centrale Laitère in here…Yes, I have a car and I stopped frequenting Afriquia gas stations,” he said. “Now I can assure you that in just a few weeks time, 90 percent of Moroccans will have started to do the same.” One woman walking with bags of groceries told MWN, “It’s because we remained silent for so long–they took advantage of us.” After frowning in hesitation, a street vendor agreed with the previous statements: “Yes, I am boycotting because our situation has to change, we’ve had enough.” Though some citizens were more than willing to state their opinions on the campaign, others refused to participate or asked MWN to vacate the premises upon hearing the word “boycott.” While the boycott represents the Moroccan citizens’ fighting spirit against “monopoly,” as expressed by many Moroccans, including several celebrities, it also represents significant losses to the company owners. Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Alyaoum reported on Monday that Afriquia–a subsidiary of the Akwa Group owned by Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch–has lost a total of MAD 1.46 million (31 percent of all transactions) in its 38 gas stations across the country since the start of the campaign on April 20. The same source states that Afriquia stations in Nador recorded 47 percent losses; Al Hoceima, 25 percent; and Hay Hassani, Casablanca, 39 percent. Afriquia owner Akhannouch has been called “the most influential Minister in Morocco, a victim of the boycott,” the Spanish daily El País. Meanwhile, Centrale Laitère employee in Salé informed MWN that the factory’s products have been rejected by grocery store owners around the region, emphasizing that the administrators haven’t yet decided to reduce prices, despite the fact that they are suffering from major losses. Meetings at Centrale are set for the near future to discuss potential solutions. Last week at SIAM, Akhannouch commented on the boycott, stating that the current situation of Centrale Laitière does not bode well for the company. The minister explained that the Danone company alone employs “470,000 employees in the sector,” adding that production “will not be stopped by a virtual campaign.” Boycott Receives Official Support  Several officials have expressed their support for the campaign, including former ministers and current Moroccan political leaders, Nabil Benabdellah, Nizar Baraka, and Nabila Mounib. Secretary-General of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) Benabdellah linked the boycott with the Jerada protests for improved government support and social services, which erupted in the northeastern region of the country three years ago and have escalated since late 2017. As president of the Social, Economic, and Environmental Council, former Minister of Economy and Finance, and current head of the Istiqlal Party, Baraka also commented on the media protest, urging the government to listen to the people’s message conveyed by the boycott. Mounib, Secretary-General of the Unified Socialist Party, joined the list of Moroccan officials spoke out in protest against the high living cost, identifying the people behind the campaign as young people with a great political conscience. The boycott remains ongoing, as does the notable silence from the majority of government officials and the boycotted companies.

Rabat – A few weeks before the beginning of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Hervé Renard is letting the world know about his determination to take the Atlas Lions as far as possible in the competition. In an exclusive interview with France 24, the French coach commented on his team’s 2018 World Cup qualification, discussed his experience as a coach, and expressed his dream of seeing “an African team qualify for the semi-finals.” During the interview, Renard shared that he hopes to carry “the Moroccan flag as high as possible” as he praised the “magnificent” national team, especially Mehdi Benatia, who he qualified as “an admirable captain.” “We have an exceptional state of mind. There is something really solid here. The strength of this team is its collectivity,” he said, adding that he is very grateful to be surrounded by the “right people,” thanking the the Moroccan football federation (FRMF) for putting him in the “best conditions.” The former Ivory Coast coach remains concerned about the World Cup preparation that will take place in the last week of Ramadan. “Ramadan [last year] was the most catastrophic [training] period since I arrived in Morocco,” he stated, explaining that the team preparations were poorly managed. “We’ll have to be better this time,” he concluded. As the interview went on, Renard mentioned Ayoub El Kaabi, the rising star of the Atlas Lions, “has made a tremendous African Championship.”  “Today, he must cross a new path that is very high. We are putting pressure on him,” said the very determined coach, who has shared that he is very proud to be “representing Morocco.”   Renard concluded his interview with optimism: “Morocco can get the organization of the World 2026. It would be great for Moroccan football and I believe it!”  The tournament will begin on June 14. The Moroccan team will first play against Iran on June 15, while the second game will be against Portugal on June 20.

Rabat – Former Atlas Lion Abdeslam Ouaddou was definitely not impressed by the Adidas design for the special-edition Moroccan national 2018 FIFA World Cup jerseys. Presented Friday in Casablanca, the proposed jersey is white with red and green accents to represent the Moroccan flag and the Royal Football Federation (FRMF) emblem. On his Facebook account, Ouaddou didn’t hold back, saying that Adidas “made fun of Morocco” with their design.  “We [Moroccans] have waited 20 years to don a special outfit [for FIFA]; I have to admit that Adidas didn’t take us seriously as a World Cup contender. Designers are more imaginative in Derb Ghallef or Derb Omar [quarters in Casablanca]. Adidas needs to rethink their design while they still have time,” Ouaddou posted.  The former footballer isn’t the only angry with Adidas. Many Moroccans have voiced that the sportswear brand should have made a greater effort, especially when it comes to something as paramount as the World Cup.  
Some Moroccan social media users have gone so far as to pledge to boycott Adidas, drawing from the ongoing online boycott campaign protesting the exorbitant prices of the Morocco-based companies Sidi Ali (bottled water), Afriquia (gasoline), and Centrale Laitière (dairy products). 
Lionsdelatlas, a Moroccan sports media group, contacted Adidas on Twitter about the jersey. Adidas allegedly informed them that the President of FRMF, Fouzi Lekjaa, approved of and accepted the jersey design. 
Adidas replied to Lionsdeatlas, “Thank you for your contact; we have taken into account your complaint. We realize and develop our models with great care, and the federation of Morocco approved our design.”  
Adidas added, “If, however, the model does not suit you, you can always contact the Moroccan Federation to share your comments. We are, of course, at your disposal for any further questions.”

Rabat- Damning accounts against the Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan continue to pile up.  In a recent interview with the Belgian channel RTL-TVI, Majda Bernoussi, the Belgian-Moroccan woman who claims to have been Ramadan’s mistress for five years, recounts her psychological ordeal for the first time after three years of silence.  Bernoussi is the first women to denounce Ramadan’s misconduct towards women in a 2014 video, in which she described her relationship with the Islamologist as “destructive,” and referred to Ramadan as “a manipulator.”  At the time of the video’s release, she promised to lead a “real fight” against the Islamologist and claimed that he had “trapped” several women. In 2015, the woman created multiple online publications, questioning Ramadan’s actions towards women. She also posted many videos explaining her hardship  at the hands of the “intellectual” man.  An investigation between Mediapart and the Belgium website le Vife discovered earlier this month that Bernoussi was given a large sum of money– EUR 27,000–in exchange for her silence. In exchange, she pledged not to defame Ramadan on the internet or to send “insulting and/or threatening messages” to the Islamologist and his relatives. The 45-year-old woman has not yet filed a complaint. However, she decided to overcome her fear and recount publicly her relationship with Ramadan, which she describes as “toxic,” claiming she had been a victim of psychological abuse.  “Tariq Ramadan is an extremely unhealthy predator and manipulator,” Bernoussi says, adding that “in real life, he is a real barbarian, both intellectually and physically.” For Bernoussi, behind the camera lies a “pervert man who uses religion to manipulate and abuse women.”  “His ethics, his morals, his faith, he reserves them to the camera. Out of the public eye, he is just the opposite… He believes in nothing and even less in God. He talks about God only when it comes to manipulating us, apart from that, it’s never mentioned and he does exactly what he wants,” she added. The 55-year-old theologian has been detained since February for his alleged sexual misconduct in France, following two accounts of rape filed against him in 2017. Last month, a French woman of Moroccan origin also filed a rape claim against Ramadan.  Up until now, the Islamologist denied having any relations with the first two women who accused him of rape. When confronted with the third woman’s evidence, he admitted to having consensual sexual relations with her, denying any coercion.
