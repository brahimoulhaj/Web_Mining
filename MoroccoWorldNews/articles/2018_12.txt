Rabat – The Egyptian actor and opera legend Hassan Kamy (also spelled “Kami”) died on Friday at the age of 82, his family told the local media.

Kamy was best known for his six-year-long opera career. During this time he performed in 45 countries. He began his career at the Cairo Opera House in 1963. By 1974, he was the star of “Aida,” and appeared at various opera houses across the Soviet Union. Kamy ended his opera career in 2001, saying that he did so because he wanted his fans to remember him while he was still at his best.

Thousands of people attended his funeral, which took place at the Al Sayeda Nafeesah Mosque in Cairo.
 Kamy was born on November 2, 1936, and attended a Jesuit school in Cairo. He obtained a bachelor of laws from Cairo University and studied opera and music at the Conservatory Institute and the Academy of Arts.

He appeared in more than 100 films, including “Raafat Al Haggan,” “Al Arraf,” and “Zaky Chan.”

Rabat – A new motorway will connect Agadir’s Al Massira Airport, 20 kilometers southeast of Agadir to the road leading to the Taghazout area, north of the city. As part of Morocco’s growing infrastructure projects, the new motorway will facilitate traffic flow to the Agadir airport, its commercial port, and a number of tourist destinations, the Moroccan National Motorway Company (ADM) announced. ADM has carried out several investment projects worth a total of MAD 600 million. The projects are mainly set to modernize Morocco’s infrastructure and electronic tolls. In April, the company pledged MAD 3.4 billion in investment for several infrastructure projects, including widening the Casablanca-Berrechid road.  Some of the newest development projects in Agadir include the Pumped Power Transfer Station Project at the Abdelmoumen dam, 70 kilometers northeast of the city. The project, launched in October, will construct an upstream reservoir on the Tamraght plateau at approximately 1,300 meters altitude. The total cost of the project is MAD 3 billion. Construction is expected to last three years, and the total installed capacity will be 350 megawatts.

Rabat – Italian President Sergio Mattarella has honored Moroccan immigrants Mustapha El Aoudi with a merit award for his heroic act to save an Italian doctor from a murder attempt.  The migrant rescued the doctor on December 4 in the Italian city of Crotone as a 50-year-old man attacked and stabbed doctor Maria Carmela Calindro in front of the San Giovanni di Dio Hospital because he believed she was to blame the death of his mother. The Moroccan immigrant, who works as a street vendor, disarmed and disabled the aggressor. After saving the doctor’s life, Al Aoudi said that “I did what everyone would do.” “I heard the doctor scream and then I approached. I noticed that the man hit her with a screwdriver with the aim to kill her. I came closer and threw him down, then he ran away and I chased him to the trash can. I tripped him and he fell. At that point I disabled and held him until the police arrived,” El Aoudi said.

Rabat – From literature to science to technology, Moroccans young and old have shown the world their talents and skills in 2018. Nine-year-old Mariam Amjoun shined in the world of literature. Amjoun won the 2018 Arab Reading Challenge in Dubai on October 30, outperforming 10.5 million participants from 40 countries. At a young age, Amjoun developed a love for reading which made her the eloquent child she is. The young girl who goes to a public school has read 200 books and participated with 60 books in the reading challenge launched by the Emirati prince, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Amjoun, who had received a personal call from King Mohammed VI and met with Said Amzazi, the minister of education, has become an inspiration to many.  Crowds of Moroccans welcomed her at the airport when she returned from Dubai. “I advise Arab children to read because reading is the lighthouse of civilization,” Amjoun said.
 Another child prodigy has excelled in mental arithmetics. Eight-year-old Malak Belarbi won first place in a global mental arithmetic competition in Turkey, only a few days after Amjoun received the Arab Reading challenge award in October. By solving 160 problems in 7 minutes, Belarbi received the highest score in the competition. Among other Moroccan children, she competed with children from 30 countries for the prize. Belarbi, who is from Morocco’s port city of Essouira, also goes to a public primary school. Like Amjoun, Belarbi has also become the “pride” of Moroccans. Belarbi said: “I advise children to believe in themselves, and advise parents to encourage and support their children to accomplish their goals.” Idder Motii, an 11-year-old Moroccan, is a self-taught programming prodigy.  At such a young age, he is fluent in three programming languages: Python, C++, and SQL. Motii is also a self-taught English speaker who learned the language from watching movies. Motii became famous after his participation at a Google Developer Group (GDG) event in Agadir early in December. At the event, called DevFest Agadir 2018, Motii was the youngest speaker. He gave a presentation about Python, his favorite programming language. Zakaria Jaiathe, a senior software engineer who met Motii at the event, said that he was so amazed by Motii’s technical background and ability to discuss very advanced topics at such a young age. In the spiritual realm, a teenager has excelled in tajweed, Qur’an recitation. Abdeljalil Bouski, won the 16th annual International Competition for Holy Qur’an Memorization, Interpretation, and Recitation in Tunis in mid-December. Bouski outperformed 31 participants from 22 countries. Karim Touijer is a model for all Moroccan doctors. Touijer, a urologist at New York’s MSK Cancer Center and an oncology specialist for 26 years, was named the 2018 Top Doctor in New York by Top Doctor Awards in August. Dr Touijer’s dedication and expertise make him “a very worthy winner of a 2018 Top Doctor Award,” the award statement said. Touijer is known across New York as a specialist in the treatment of patients with genitourinary cancers, including cancers of the prostate, kidney, bladder, and adrenal glands.
 The renowned doctor told Morocco World News that he performs about four to six prostate cancer surgeries a week and about 150 to 200 each year. Charif Hamidi, 29, is a hardworking Moroccan teacher who strives to make school a better place for children to enjoy learning. The year 2019 may have more success in store for Hamidi because the British Varkey Foundation nominated him for the prestigious $1 million Global Teacher Prize 2019. The nomination acknowledges Hamidi’s efforts to promote education, build libraries, and improve standards for underprivileged children in Morocco. Hamidi is the founder of an ambitious and innovative project, Education 4.0, that aims to leverage fourth industrial revolution technologies across young populations to empower and develop their creativity. Another talented achiever, Mouad Boukioud, is a Moroccan religious singer who won the 11th annual Munshid Al Sharjah competition. Boukioud won the competition at the final ceremony on December 14.  The munshid (religious singer) outperformed 21 talented participants from various countries, including Algeria and Tunisia. Majidd El Bouazzaoui, is an outstanding inventor who won seven distinct awards in Canada and China in 2018. Bouazzaoui, the founder of the OFEED innovation association, won a gold medal at Taiwan’s International Innovation and Invention Competition (IIIC) in November with an “automatic guidance system of photovoltaic panels” which cleans solar panels without using drinking water. The young inventor has won more than 10 gold medals in China, Canada, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Poland, and South Korea. His OFEED association also won a Korean medal early in November at the international invention exhibition of BIXPO 2018 in Gwangju. Moroccan poet Mohammed Bennis won the 2018 Arab Creativity Award by the Lebanese Cultural Forum in France with only a few days left until 2019. The award recognizes Bennis’ valuable literary works. Born in 1948, the poet published his works in several newspapers all over the Arab world and won several awards throughout his career, including the el Premio Feronia International for literature. Among the Moroccan female achievers who shined in 2018 is Ihssane Elidrissi El Hassani who was shortlisted for the highest legal award in England and Wales. The London-based Law Society’s Excellence Awards nominated Elhassani in October for the “Woman Lawyer of the Year Category” award, along with 10 others, of more than 90,000 female lawyers in England and Wales. El Hassani, who came from a legal household, grew up in Marrakech and studied law at the Cadi Ayyad University.  In 2016, Elhassani became the first female Moroccan lawyer to open her own legal office in England.

El Hassani’s encouraging word to all is: ”If you put in the effort, talent and hard work, you will be recognised, regardless of your nationality, skin colour or religion,” she told MWN. A brave Moroccan adventurer is also deserving of a tribute. Moroccan mountaineer Bouchra Baibanou finished off 2018 with a life-changing adventure.  Bailbanou became the first Moroccan woman to climb the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest. She climbed the 8,848-meter mountain on December 17, sharing pictures on her Facebook.

Rabat – The members of the United Nations Security Council are expected to meet in  January 2019 to discuss the Western Sahara conflict, according to the Security Council Report. In its January 2019 Monthly Forecast, the report said the meeting will be in line with Resolution 2440, which requested UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “to brief the Council on a regular basis at any time he deems appropriate, including within three months of MINURSO’s renewal and again prior to the expiration of its mandate.” On October 31, the Security Council adopted Resolution 2440 which extended the mandate of the peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO, for six months. Minurso’s mandate is set to expire on March 31, 2019. To continue, MINURSO will require another vote from the 15 members of the Security Council on a new resolution to extend the mandate of the mission in Western Sahara. However, 2019 may bring some new developments, especially after US National Security Adviser John Bolton’s latest remarks on the conflict and MINURSO, particularly. At the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., on December 13, Bolton heavily criticized peacekeeping operations, picking the Western Sahara conflict as an example for how missions fail to end conflicts. “From now on, the United States will not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect, assistance without accountability, and relief without reform,” said Bolton, expressing “frustration” over the continuous conflict over Western Sahara. He added that although the UN has deployed forces in the region for 27 years since 1991, it has failed to end the dispute. “How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” he added as he was referring to the US contribution to the UN peacekeeping operations. The US is a top contributor to the UN budget, providing $10 billion in aid annually. Morocco has not responded to Bolton’s frustration officially. But, former Moroccan Minister of Economy Nizar Baraka said that Morocco is also frustrated because the country is still struggling to “complete the territorial integrity of our country to include our Sahara regions.”

Rabat – Moroccan law enforcement has confiscated thousands of kilograms of cocaine this year from South American cartels. Contacted by Spanish outlet El Pais, a specialist close to the unit combating drug trafficking in Morocco, who requested anonymity, explained that the increase in drug trafficking from South America to Morocco in 2018 is due to intensified security at the US-Mexico border since the election of Donald Trump. The specialist added that the US and European countries have sent increasing numbers of anti-narcotics specialists to Morocco. Another European researcher speaking anonymously stated that South American cartels have been using Africa as a transport point for many years to send drugs to Europe. He said the cartels have increased their activity in recent years, and Moroccan police have been specializing in fighting cocaine. To better manage distribution, the cartels have sought to facilitate the shipping of cocaine.  Drug dealers have used various methods in Morocco ranging from ingesting cocaine in capsules to using a farm for storage.  Cartels also planned to build a secret runway on the outskirts of Dakhla for airplanes, but Moroccan law enforcement intervened and arrested the individuals involved in the making of the runway. The cartels use “mules” to transport cocaine. Often, mules are economically disadvantaged people from developing nations in Africa, making it hard for investigators to eliminate the top figures in drug operations. The traffickers view Morocco’s proximity to Spain as a safe route to transport their drugs. The short trip across the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain allows drug dealers to quickly access European markets and is less watched than the US-Mexico border. In the past 12 months, Moroccan police arrested 15 cocaine dealers in Temara and seized 2.5 tons, and seven individuals with a truck loaded with 1 ton of cocaine, among others. In 2017, authorities seized a total of 2,588 kilograms of cocaine.

Rabat – A projected wave of Morocco-bound ISIS elements has alarmed Morocco’s security experts, and the country is preparing to counter and neutralize possible dangers from former Moroccan ISIS fighters.  In its December 31 edition, Casablanca-based Al Ahdath Al Maghribia newspaper said that the prospect of ISIS fighters returning is a central element of the mounting fear in Morocco.  Following heavy defeats earlier this year, the radicalized group has been forced out of its Iraqi and Syrian territories, and a number of its fighters are expected to return to their respective countries. Citing Moroccan officials, the newspaper indicated that the majority of Moroccans who joined ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and Libya are set to return.   Al Ahdath Al Maghribia’s warnings were borne out by a recent report from the European Counterterrorism Center (ECTC). The report highlights the security danger of former ISIS fighters upon return in their origin countries.  In addition to their own “enhanced capability to commit acts of terrorism,” returnees “also serve as role models and might be involved in radicalizing others,” the report noted. Speaking of the possible negative repercussions of ISIS’ recent defeat, ECTC’s report added: “As IS gets weaker, it has been urging its followers to carry out lone actor type attacks in their home countries, rather than guiding them to attempt to travel to the so-called caliphate.” While Morocco’s anti-terrorism authorities have been almost 100 percent effective in minimizing the threats posed by former ISIS returnees, the ECTC report estimates that the next wave of returnees will pose a more lethal danger to security both in Morocco and Europe.  Having lost its Syrian and Iraqi strongholds, its self-styled caliphate, ISIS is seeking less traditional ways of inflicting “defeat” on governments, according to the report. While not giving in to the frenzy surrounding the prospective return of former ISIS combatants, Moroccan authorities appeared to have heeded the warnings.  Speaking last week as Morocco arrested more suspects in the Imlil murders, Abdelhak El Khiame, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ), said, “Every ISIS returnee who sets foot in Morocco will be arrested, questioned, and sent to the courts.”  Appearing to reassure Moroccans by playing down returnees’ ability to strike the country, the BCIJ chief gave figures that reaffirmed his team’s success in similar operations in the past.   BCIJ operatives arrested 71 ISIS returnees between 2015 and 2016, El Khiame said. The majority of the 71 arrested returnees had come from combat zones in Syria and Iraq and were planning to strike a number of major Moroccan cities. He said 1,668 Moroccans are estimated to have joined ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, and Moroccan intelligence have detailed files on each one. Recently named among the world’s safest places, Morocco has traditionally been immune to the scourge of both domestic and foreign-organized terrorist strikes. Prior to the Imlil tragedy which claimed the lives of two Scandinavian tourists, Morocco’s last terrorist incident dated to 2011. While the country’s counter-terrorism system has won plaudits in security circles worldwide, the new threats elicit an updated approach, experts have warned.

Rabat – An Iraqi Sunni authority, Sheikh Mahdi Al Sumaidaie, said in his Friday prayer message in Baghdad that Muslims are forbidden from taking part in New Year’s celebrations.

“It is not permitted to celebrate the New Year or congratulate it or participate in it,” the sheik said on the official Facebook page of Dar Iraqi Iftaa, a Muslim religious authority in Iraq.  “Taking part in their celebrations is taking part in [disbelief],” he added. The Chaldean Catholic Church called Sumaidaie’s religious opinion, or fatwa, “false, malicious and far from the correct knowledge of religions.” The church’s statement added, “Sheikh Mahdi al-Sumaidaie oversees two Sunni brigades within the People’s Mobilization Force, which is composed of Shi’ite factions, some of whom are closely tied to Tehran.”

According to Al-Monitor, Sumaidaie quoted 14th-century scholar Ibn Qayyim Al Jawziyya in his speech, who said, “Congratulating Christians on their holidays is like congratulating them for prostrating unto their cross and believing that Jesus is the son of God.”

Rabat – The Office of the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) has announced that Morocco’s economic growth slowed in the third quarter of 2018 to 3 percent. HCP explained that the growth was “driven by domestic demand in the context of a still well-controlled rise in inflation and a sharp increase in the need for financing of the national economy.” HCP noted that the Morocco’s primary economic sectors,fisheries and agriculture, registered a marked slowdown in its growth rate from 13.4 percent in the third quarter of 2017 to 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2018. Explaining the statistics, HCP said the slowdown was caused by agricultural value added (VA) production growing by only 3.8 percent instead of 15 percent a year earlier, and fishing VA production growing byf 6.8 percent compared to a decrease of 3 percent. The the secondary economic sector, the industrial sector, had a 3 percent growth rate in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 3.2 percent n the same period a year earlier.  The statement added that improved electricity and water value added production (7.5 percent) and processing industries (2.9 percent) combined with a decline in the growth rate of the extractive industry at 4 percent and building and public works at 0.7 percent to create the decelerating growth rate. The third economic sector, which includes health, telecommunications, and education, registered an increase of 2.9 percent instead of 2.3 percent in the same quarter of 2017, owing to an improvement in trade activities, with a growth rate of 4.4 percent. The statement said that the sector, however, registered slower growth than last year in hotels and restaurants (5.8 percent), transport (2.9 percent), and services provided to households and businesses at (2.9 percent). HCP explained that value added agricultural activities had a growth rate of 3 percent compared to 2.5 percent in the same period last year. Morocco’s Gross Domestic Growth (GDP) grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2018, and the prices rose 1.3 percent instead of 0.2 percent in 2017.

Rabat – Moroccan author and poet Ali Squalli Houssaini, who died this year, deserves to be Morocco’s man of the year 2018 because of his great contribution to the Moroccan national identity by writing the national anthem’s Arabic lyrics. Squalli wrote the national anthem in 1969 under the reign of King Hassan II. Before independence in 1956, the anthem was used only as a melody. Even after independence, Morocco continued to use the anthem without lyrics until 1969. Squalli was born in Fez in 1932 and died on November 5 at the age of 86 from an incurable disease. Morocco’s Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan and Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in addition to a number of literary and media personalities attended Squalli’s funeral ceremony. “We have received, with pain, the sad news of the passing of the poet, Ali Squalli Houssaini, may his soul rest in peace,” King Mohammed VI wrote in a condolence letter to Squalli’s family. The King recalled Squalli’s “righteousness, patriotism, and respect and devotion to the Alaouite crown,” and prayed for patience for Squalli’s family. The idea of writing lyrics to the national anthem came after the Moroccan national football team qualified to participate in the World Cup for the first time for the 1970 games in Mexico.  Squalli received a bachelor’s degree in literature from Al-Quaraouiyine University in 1951 and later became a professor there. Squalli joined the Royal Cabinet in 1956, in which he was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He then became an associate professor at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities in Rabat in 1964.  The Moroccan author worked as an inspector general at the Ministry of Education beginning in 1971.   Squalli also wrote numerous books, especially children’s books. He had also been a member of the Union of Moroccan Writers since 1967. Throughout his career, Squalli achieved various awards for his literary works, including the Morocco Grand Prize in 1982 and the international prize of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia for children’s literature in 1992. King Mohammed VI described Squalli as one of the “pioneers of modern Arabic literature, the creator of the national anthem who enriched the national library.” Mourning Squalli’s death, El Othmani said the deceased author was known for his true patriotism. The national anthem that Squalli wrote represents “one of the national landmarks that we are proud of,” El Othmani added.  Abdelhak El Merini, a Moroccan historian and official spokesperson for the royal palace recommended paying attention to Squalli’s books and collection of poems dedicated to children.  They should be “distributed to national educational academies” to spread the messages Squalli wanted to convey children, El Merini stressed. Mustapha El Ktiri, the Moroccan high commissioner of former resistance fighters and members of the Army of Liberation, said that Squally was among the early participants in the Moroccan national movement.  El Ktiri continued, Squalli “was among the arrested people in the events of 1944 in the cities of Rabat, Sale, and Fez,” after King Mohammed V sent an official letter to the French colonial authorities demanding independence, known as the manifesto demanding independence.

Marrakesh – This non-binding document, which has recently been ratified by the UN General Assembly by a vast majority of nations, offers state and non-state actors a comprehensive framework and guidelines for collaborating and sharing responsibility on migration. There are approximately 258 million migrant people worldwide, about 3.4% of the world population  The text has polarized the criticisms of nationalists and anti-migration groups. Under the pressure of local political currents or of their opinions, thirty countries were not represented despite their previous commitment on this document. Its critics see it as an encouragement to an uncontrolled migratory flow. Populist political parties, especially in Europe, have mobilized their efforts against the adoption of this pact, which led to the implosion of the ruling coalition in Belgium with the resignation of Flemish nationalist ministers and of the Prime Minister Charles Michel. Because of somewhat tumultuous conditions of electoral majorities in a few countries, the Compact on migration has been instrumentalized or manipulated. European nationalists have mobilized against it, replenishing the political clashes, from East to West of Europe, on this hot issue which hampers the collaboration of the states. On December 16, thousands of demonstrators in Brussels marched against the UN compact, following the Flemish right-wing parties’ call for the march, amid fears that the pact could lead to an increase in immigration.  The United States, which had withdrawn from the drafting of the text in December 2017 by judging it contrary to the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, launched a new attack against the Compact and against any form of “global governance”.”Decisions on border security, on who is allowed to reside legally or to obtain citizenship, are among the most important sovereign decisions that a country can take,”  the US diplomatic mission hammered at the UN. At the beginning of December, a meeting in Brussels was held with Marine Le Pen, Head of the French far right, and Steve Bannon, former advisor to Donald Trump, to denounce the Compact; they brandished it as a scarecrow by populists across the EU in the approach of European elections next May. These reactions are taking place even as the Compact respects the states’ responsibility of guaranteeing their borders, that the migration policy is a prerogative of the national sovereignty, and that the countries together commit to control migratory flows, dismantle networks, and combat trafficking.   As was stated by Louise Arbor, the UN Special Representative for Migration Sunday evening during a press conference in Marrakesh, “the Compact does not create any right to migrate nor does it place any obligation on the States.”  The compact identifies major principles – protection of human rights, women and children, recognition of national sovereignty – and makes a list of proposals to help countries cope with migration – exchange information and expertise, and foster integration of migrants. It prohibits arbitrary detentions, allowing arrests only as a last resort. On the other hand, Human rights advocates find it insufficient, particularly on migrants’ access to humanitarian aid and basic services or the rights of migrant workers.  Today, there is concern regarding the increasing number of irregular migrants, and states commit to working together to minimize the adverse drivers that compel people to leave their countries of origin. If well managed, migration can favour economic growth and can help us face the growing imbalances in demographic trends and global warming across regions and continents. If left totally unregulated, it can lead to tensions, as we witness today. Thus, as I show in my book New Horizons of Muslim Diaspora in Europe and North America , migration is both a challenge and an opportunity. It should be addressed jointly and globally, through the promotion and strengthening of mechanisms of a multilateral nature, involving countries of origin, transit, and destination. Moving forward, as the UN has ratified this Compact and countries implement it, migration can be made safer for all people, particularly migrants in vulnerable situations, including women and girls who often fall victims to smuggling and human trafficking. This can be done by reducing risks, ensuring respect for human rights, and making regular migration more accessible than the dangerous, irregular routes often used. Migration should become an act of choice rather an act of despair pushed by civil wars, catastrophes, or climate change.  Migration is shared responsibility of sending, receiving, and transit countries. No one state can address it alone, nor should any leading state take the lead in saying what to be done for and about it. As the world celebrates today the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let us remember that when we protect all migrants and refugees and treat them with dignity and respect, we are setting a moral standard for the world. Moha Ennaji is President of the South North Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Migration Studies in Morocco and Professor of Linguistics and Migration Studies at the University of Fès.

Rabat – A group of Sudanese professional associations have called for a march on President Omar Al Bashir’s presidential palace in Khartoum, the latest event in ongoing protests. The march, scheduled for today, the eve of Sudan’s Independence Day, is set to proceed from Qandil Square to the presidential palace. Marchers have called for “Bashir’s immediate resignation.”  Amid fears of escalating protests, the Parliament earlier today passed its 2019 budget. The budget is set to reduce inflation rate and increase economic growth by 5.1 percent.  But given lack of trust in the regime and widespread support for protesters, it remains to be seen whether Parliament’s last-minute intervention will ease tensions. Sudan is in its 13th day of Arab Spring-like protests, with violent clashes between police and protesters and an estimate of 37 killed in the first days of the unrest. Organized by grassroots neighborhood associations and professional trade unions—especially teachers, doctors, and lawyers, the protests are calling for President Omar al-Bashir to step down.  Brutal crackdown Bashir has been in charge since October 1993 and is no stranger to repressive methods to maintain his grip on power. In 2010, the International Criminal Court charged the now 74-year old president with war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide and rape in relation to the February 2003 Darfur war.  As with the Arab Spring in 2011, spikes in the prices of bread and oil ignited an anti-government mood. And by Friday last week, what started off as a protest against rising food prices quickly became an intense outcry against the current regime. But while Bashir’s long-standing oppressive regime was a contributing factor to the current uprisings, the sudden rise in commodity prices in mid-December was the immediate causal factor of the protests. In the city of Atbara, where the protests broke out on December 19, protestors set fire to and burned down the headquarters of the ruling National Congress Party. “Our demands started with improving the situation – we’ve been facing a problem of shortages in cash flow, bread and oil for a while. But when they started killing, our demands converted to toppling the regime,” the Guardian quoted a protester as saying. While protesters are believed to have been marching with hands in the air and shouting “Peace, peace,” to indicate their peaceful intentions, the police crackdown has been heavy-handed and disproportionate, according to Amnesty International. The rights group estimated that the government crackdown killed as many as 37 protesters in just five days of clashes.  Determined protesters But the government’s violent response has not yet forced Al Bashir out.  More people turned up to protest over the weekend.  Shouting “Leave, Bashir,” protesters showed their dissatisfaction with a regime which they accuse of large scale corruption and mismanagement. “He cannot rule 40 million people who all hate him,” Amjid Farid, a leading Sudanese civil society member, said of the president. As more people joined the protest in defiance of the government’s heavy-handed response, the president appeared to change his strategy by late Sunday. In a meeting with police commanders, President Bashir called on security authorities to “use as little force as possible.” The president said: “Vandalism, destruction and theft only worsen the situation and will not fix things. Our duty is to not allow these acts of looting and violence. We want to maintain security and we want the police to do that by using less force.” However, Al Bashir also praised the police response to protests, saying they showed “model behavior” and “were conducting their duties with utmost professionalism,” according to CNN. He argued that the “ultimate goal” of the crackdown “is not to kill citizens,” but “to maintain the security and stability of civilians.”  Protesters have largely ignored the president’s call, which they perceived as meant to buy him more time to eventually quell the momentum the protests have garnered. “I have little faith in the government,” said Khartoum resident Ehsan Babiker.

Rabat – The government of Saad Eddine El Othmani has denied  that it will deduct 14 percent from the wages of public sector employees for their pensions starting January 2019. “The deduction is set at 1 percent of the emergency pension reform, with the state committing to a contribution of 1 percent as the operator,” read a statement from the government. Earlier this month, Moroccan news outlets reported that El Othmani’s government would deduct  14 percent from the wages of public sector employees for their pensions. The deduction was to come under Law No. 71.14 adopted by Abdelilah Benkirane’s government in 2016. The law also gradually extends the age of retirement from 60 to 63 years, starting in 2024. Since 2014, the Moroccan pension fund (CMR) has been facing a deficit, and will operate on a “technical” deficit starting in 2018 and a total deficit in 2027. According to a report on social protection by the Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CECE), CMR reserves will go bankrupt in 2044, and reforms are needed to ensure long-term financial balance. The decision angered public employees and labor unions who have been calling for a salary raise. Several labor unions and political parties called on the government to increase employees’ salaries and improve social dialogue unions and the government. The Al Istiqlal party presented recommendations to Parliament meeting in May, suggesting  protection of purchasing power and support for employment. The government has been calling for more social dialogue with citizens to minimize inequalities at the request of King Mohammed VI. In July, the King reiterated the need to reform Morocco’s development strategy. He also called the government to reinforce social dialogue, stating that it is “necessary and it should be an ongoing process.” Furthermore, he said, the cabinet should meet more frequently with labor unions, “regardless of the potential outcome of that dialogue.” Morocco’s public sector has approximately 700,000 employees. Over 580,000 work for the central government, 150,000 work in the urban communities, and 130,000 work in public institutions.

Rabat – Following the early December arrest of a raqi, an exorcist, in Berkane, northeast Morocco, for sexual assault of female “patients,” qualms about the nature of ruqyah and similar religious practices have resurfaced. Ruqyah is the act of reciting verses from the Qur’an or praying du’aa, a form of supplication, to exorcise a person from demon possession, the “ayn” evil eye, or magic. Raqis, the people who perform ruqyah, commonly recite surah Al Fatiha (1), surahs of Al-Falaq (113) and An-Nas (114). Rakis say the words over water which the “patient” then drinks. Muslims believe that ruqyah is from the sunnah, the sayings and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. According to hadiths, which are the accumulation of reports about the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammed (PBUH), the prophet used to recite Qur’anic verses over himself whenever he felt ill. “It was narrated that A’ishah said: ‘When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) was ill, he would recite [the surahs of Al-Falaq and An-Nas] over himself and spit dryly. When his pain grew intense, I recited over him and wiped him with his own hand, seeking its blessing,’” the hadith collector Al-Bukhari recorded. Raqis perform ablutions, the ritual of washing before prayer, and recite the Qur’an or pray du’aa over a cup of water before drinking it or offering it to someone to drink. Today, one click on Facebook’s search page can lead to dozens of people claiming to be raqis who ward off demonic possession and heal other supernatural illnesses. Some use ruqyah to swindle and exploit people financially or sexually. The phenomenon, known as “fake raqis,” can be found anywhere in the Muslim world. The Berkane raqi scandal began in recent weeks when a sexual video of the 50-something raqi and a young woman was posted online and widely shared on social media, causing widespread controversy in Morocco.  Police in Berkane, a city in northeast Morocco, arrested the raqi after they found other videos, saved on his computer, of him engaging in sexual acts with female ruqyah clients. If convicted, the raqi faces up to 20 years in prison on charges of charlatanism, adultery, and blackmail. According to authorities, the man calls himself an imam and has used ruqyah to exploit clients sexually, including married women.  After many commenters accused the woman of “willingly” engaging in sexual activities with the raqi in the video, she released her own video defending herself. She said that she was not aware of her actions because the raqi had drugged her. “When the raqi gives you water to drink, you can’t say no and you drink it believing that it’s ruqyah, you do not know what you are doing, or that you are drugged … I am a victim,” the woman said. The scandal reached Parliament in mid-December.  During a weekly session at the House of Representatives, Minister of Endowment and Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufiq and a member of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP), Hanane Rihab, debated how ruqyah has turned into a lucrative business. While Taoufiq emphasized that one should not generalize because not all people who practice ruqyah are frauds, he promised to intensify the crackdown on fake raqis. The minister stressed that the healthcare sector is the only authority responsible for health in the country rather than the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.  The case of the Berkane raqi is a drop in the ocean of religious swindles in Morocco. It is a case that has psychological, legal, and moral dimensions. “The so-called raqis,” for the MP Hanane Rihab, claim to provide psychological care and even healing from diseases such as cancer which indicates the extent of “ignorance” in society. “The role of the Ministry of Health is important” in raising awareness about the phenomenon, said Rihab. Reacting to “what ruqyah has become today,” Mohammed Saghiri, a Moroccan imam told Morocco World News that “ruqyah, which is a part of the Islamic tradition, is not a means to earn money.” Saghiri, who also used to perform ruqyah, said real “ruqyah is not how it is today, a way to use people, to lie to people, and to take their money or exploit them sexually.” Saghiri condemned the use of ruqyah for immoral motives or as a “profession.”  “There are those who call themselves raqis and charge people with money, either asking for MAD 50 or MAD 100, as if they were doctors. Ruqyah is done either on oneself after [ablutions] or voluntarily for other people for the sake of God.”

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani will fly to Brasilia to represent King Mohammed VI at the presidential inauguration ceremony of the new Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. El Othmani left Morocco on Sunday for the inauguration of the Brazilian president on January 1, 2019. Far right Congressman Bolsonaro won a runoff election in Brazil against leftist candidate ex-Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, claiming 55 percent of the vote, in October.   Election participation is compulsory in Brazil. Bolsonaro received criticism throughout the election campaign because of his views on minorities, the LGBT community, and women.  He once told a fellow congresswoman that she did not deserve to be raped because she was “very ugly.”  He also stirred controversy after he announced his intention to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem after he won the election. “As previously stated during our campaign, we intend to transfer the Brazilian Embassy from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem. Israel is a sovereign state and we shall duly respect that,” he said.

Rabat – Moroccan authorities arrested yesterday evening a man of dual Swiss and Spanish citizenship suspected to have strong connections to the terrorist squad which earlier this month perpetrated the death of two Scandinavian tourists.  While the Swiss-Spanish suspect was “not physically involved” in the murder that claimed the lives of the tourists, investigations have so far uncovered both his identity and his “terrorist past.”  Not of Moroccan descent Born Zoller G.K to a Swiss father and Spanish mother, the suspect converted to Islam in 2011 in Geneva’s Grand Mosque. After conversion, Zoller picked Abdellah as his Muslim name. The name remained his nom de guerre as his conversion to his new religion was quickly followed by radicalization. Prior to moving to Morocco in 2015, Abellah had already earned himself Geneva’s radicalized circles. In 2014, at the peak of his radicalization phase in Geneva, he even attacked jewelry to “finance his jihad and donate the rest of his war booty to ISIS,” a group to which he is believed to have pledged allegiance. According to Moroccan outlet Le 360, Abdellah was fully radicalized by 2014, a year before he moved to Morocco. A source from the Moroccan government confirmed the news to Morocco World News.  Terrorist pedigree By the time he established himself in Marrakech, his Moroccan “home,” Abdellah’ Islamist pedigree had experienced a slight growth: from a lone pro-ISIS jewelry shop attacker, he had established himself as a recruiter, luring a number of his relatives to join radicalized cells. Speaking to le 360, a source with briefing on the ongoing investigations confirmed the many suspicions Moroccan authorities’ yesterday press release had said about “Abdellah.”  Read Also: Imlil Murders: A Timeline of the Scandinavian Tourists’ Murders Investigators are yet sure of the exact extent of the man’s involvement in the death of Louisa Jespersen and Maren Ueland, le 360’s source said.  The article added, however, that elements at investigators’ disposal point to the evidence that Abdellah did communicate with and coordinated both the four-member death squad that killed the two tourists and the dozen others who were arrested afterwards. There is no doubt that Abdellah has terrorist and violent tendencies, the source noted, further confirming that the suspect trained the Imlil tragedy’s perpetrators to use advanced communication technologies. Addition to the Imlil incident suspects, Abdellah is also believed to have recruited a number of Swiss and English for ISIS-supporting groups. Further investigations are underway to unearth the full extent of Abdellah’s involvement in the Imlil tragedy as well as other similar actions he may have been planning prior to his arrest.

Rabat – On Saturday, police arrested a man suspected of decapitating a woman in Oued Ifrane in the Middle Atlas. The police arrested the suspect in Toufnit, a town in Midelt Province, Drâa-Tafilalet, Morocco. The suspect is a 38-year-old shepherd in the forests of the Atlas Mountains. He reportedly disappeared suddenly after the crime. His personal connection to the victim, if any, remains unclear. The body of the 24-year-old Moroccan woman was found on December 28. The woman was a divorcee, mother of a 7-year-old daughter. She was living with her parents. Authorities deployed a helicopter and sniffer dogs during the investigation. The Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie, auxiliary forces and members of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) chased the suspect.

Rabat – Moroccan actor Youssef Joundy strongly criticized the Moroccan health sector when his four-year-old son was a subject to a medical error. Joundi wrote on his Facebook on December 26 that his four-year-old son fell at school, so he took him to a hospital in Casablanca. He said the doctor who treated his son is “ignorant” and  the hospital he went to is a “ souq (market) for trafficking citizens’ health.” Even after multiple visits to the hospital, the doctors asserted that his son had no serious injury.  However, distrustful of the doctors and their diagnosis, he took his son to a specialist. After x-rays, doctors found out that his son had a broken elbow. “I told the doctor that they told me that my son does not have anything wrong. He told me everything is clear in the x-ray,” he added.  He said, “an ignorant doctor in a souq called a hospital, caused my son a surgery.” While the actor was thankful for the success of the surgery, he strongly criticized the health sector saying that there is no “healthcare in Morocco.” He added that some doctors are only after money. Many Moroccans have been criticizing the public health sector. In October, dozens of Moroccan doctors condemned the lack of equipment and health sector in Morocco generally. In its 2016-2017 annual report, made public on August 27, the Court of Auditors identified irregularities in many hospital centers across the country. The annual report condemned long delays for appointments in Moroccan hospitals, which can exceed 10 months.

Rabat – According to a statement from the general prosecutor, the 15 members involved in the double murder of Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian tourist Maren Ueland near Toubkal mount appeared before the investigating judge  at Rabat’s Court of Appeal today at 9 a.m. The public prosecutor called on the judge to investigate suspects for the terror acts they committed against the tourists, including the crimes of forming a gang to prepare acts of terror. The prosecutor also asked the judge to place the suspects in custody. The statement added that Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) is now investigating the case. Seven more suspects will appear before the judge in the coming days.  BCIJ arrested 22 suspects involved in the crime. BCIJ arrested the latest suspect, a Swiss national who also holds the Spanish citizenship, on Saturday in Marrakech. According to BCIJ,  the suspect was “radicalized” and has direct connections with the others suspects. BCIJ said that the Swiss-Spanish man “trained the other suspects to use state-of-the-art communication technologies.” He also taught them how to use arms. Authorities found the bodies of the victims on December 17 near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. Head of BCIJ Abdelhak Khiame confirmed that although four of the  suspects pledged allegiance to ISIS on video, the crime was carried out independant from  the terror group. Khiame also said that the suspects did not fit the profiles of terrorists because they were living normal lives. He confirmed that the victims were stabbed and decapitated. The suspects, according to Khiame, were influenced by the self-styled “emir” of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Through the name given to him by his extremist supporters,  al-Baghdadi is speculated to be styling himself after the first caliph of Muslims Abu Bakr.

Rabat – The stakes are high for Morocco’s development aspirations, and there has been a deluge of infrastructure and development projects. And yet, the abiding feeling that some things will not (easily) change remains deeply embedded in the national imaginary. High speed train accident raises questions The social media firestorm that erupted after the glaring miscommunication that followed the first accident of Morocco’s newly inaugurated high speed train reflected the doubt that some Moroccans and Morocco watchers had raised even before Rabat inaugurated Africa’s first high speed train: Can one big project do way with the country’s entrenched structural dysfunction? The mood was mainly festive on November 15 when King Mohammed VI and France’s Emmanuel Macron took the first ride on Al Boraq (Pegasus), the evocative name given to the new train connecting Casablanca to Tangier in just 2 hours. Al Boraq enthusiasts cheered on social media. Meanwhile, Stop TGV, the anti-Al Boraq coalition which questioned the project from the start, was largely silenced by the excitement that the inauguration generated on the continent. Sub-Saharan African students in Morocco marveled at the project, comparing Morocco’s infrastructure to those back home. “Let critics speak. But for me Morocco is a model for the continent in terms of infrastructure and construction projects,” said Ali, a Malian student in Rabat. A number of international media picked up the enthusiasm, with France’s Liberation newspaper singing the sharpest pro-Al Boraq hymn. The paper ran an article that consecrated Tangier’s metropolis status. Tangier, Liberation proposed, has undergone “spectacular changes” in the last decade. With its promise of speed and comfort, Al Boraq was the illustration that Tangier’s “forced metamorphosis” bore “a final royal touch.” But the enthusiasm has faded in one month. At the least, the enthusiasm has been largely sidelined by the country’s everyday issues, the ones that do not get headlines or prime time television. Two weeks ago, however, on December 14, social media experienced a renewal of enthusiasm about Al Boraq. This time, rather than being celebrated, Morocco’s national rail operator ONCF was being castigated. The company’s “unforgivable mistake,” angry social media users commented, was its seeming lack of concern for the life of a “fellow Moroccan” hit by the country’s celebrated bullet-shaped train. “On December 14 around 18h55, Al Boraq made an urgent stop between Sidi Lyamani and Aqouass Biech en route to Tangier after it hit and killed a man who threw himself in front of the train,” read an ONCF press release later on the same day. Noting that the situation was well managed and that things “returned to their normal state at 21:45,” the company added the backbone of the press release: “ONCF apologizes to customers for the discomfort.” Apparently only interested in the comfort of its customers, ONCF’s statement glaringly neglected to mention the slightest caring remark about the man the train had hit. The move ignited a firestorm, with many suggesting that the deceased’s family had the right to condolences, however symbolic. “No respect for human life!” one commenter exclaimed in disbelief. Another, more explicit, hit: “What is this text? ONCF has no civic sense! No humanity!” But while reactions shared the same pattern, indignation at an “irresponsible lack of communication,” the reasons for venting that frustration on ONCF’s Facebook post were different. The undertone of the social media protestations, as one exceedingly ONCF-pessimist explained, was that the accident and ONCF’s statement raised questions not only about the company’s horrible communication, but the country’s preparedness for a project as big as Al Boraq. Can one fast train be the answer to Morocco’s litany of issues linked to bad governance? Two Moroccos Mohammedia, a city located between Rabat and Casablanca, does not feature on Al Boraq’s itinerary. The train only stops in Rabat and Kenitra en route to Tangier. But that is no impediment for Hassan, an IT worker constantly travelling between Tangier and Mohammedia. Hassan is “professionally based in Tangier,” where he has a well-paid job, but his “sweetheart” is in Mohammedia. “I come here every weekend to see my girlfriend,” he said. He takes Al Boraq from Tangier to Casablanca and then uses a regular train to come to Mohammedia. Commenters and activists may have convinced the Tangier-Casablanca-Mohammedia trotter about the wildly high cost of the project. Two billion dollars is too much for one single project, Hassan said. “Those who say that it is all about prestige are right. But they are missing something important: Prestige counts for an emerging country that aspires to greatness, to big development plans.” Hassan’s pro-Al Boraq remarks are not meant for ONCF, however. He holds the company responsible for making him arrive late at a number of appointments in the past when he could only use the regular train. But with Al Boraq, he can enjoy his weekends in Mohammedia with his “sweetheart,” and still make it to Tangier on time for work. “No longer eight tiring hours on a train that never keeps its schedule,” he said. He spoke of his experience with regular trains like a prehistoric moment he harbors no nostalgia for. “This is Morocco,” he offered, now commenting on the sad Al Boraq incident. “It was a big mistake. People pointed it out and called out ONCF. I think the company will not make the same mistake again.” “This is Morocco” has been differently interpreted, depending on where each commenterr stands. For some, it is an admission of the country’s permanent duality in socio-economic relations. On the one hand, there is first-class Morocco, made up of the “makhzen” (the ruling elite) and the few in the prestigious educated class from engineering and business schools. And then there is forgotten and invisible Morocco, made up of “the rest,” the social residue. Al Boraq, critics recently told the Guardian, was meant to satisfy first-class Morocco’s obsession with the external gaze. Intent on appealing to the outside world but unmindful of the pervasive poverty in some quarters of the country, “visible Morocco” wanted to “notify the world—and the world’s foreign investors—that Morocco has arrived.” In a second line of analysis, “This is Morocco” is code that mediocrity, elite complacency, and lack of communication are embedded in the country’s socio-political DNA. It means some things will never really change in Morocco. When Moroccans use it among themselves, wrote columnist Karim Boukhari, they have reached the end of the conversation, the point where “there is nothing else to add.” It is a euphemism for corruption, bad government performance, and poor education levels, Boukhari explained. But what was Hassan’s meaning? Where did his “This is Morocco” stand in the ongoing conversation about the paradox of a high speed train and many unaddressed issues? “Moroccans like making big statements to flaunt their importance. That’s one reason we cheered the high-speed train project: To give the impression that Morocco may not have arrived yet, but it is already flying far above the skies of the African continent, boldly stressing its leadership ambitions. Even if it means being blind to some deeply rooted problems, that’s okay. It’s one step at a time.”

Rabat – Women headed 18 percent of Moroccan households in 2017 compared to 15 percent in 2012, reported the National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH).
 A higher percentage of households in urban areas are headed by women than in rural areas, ONDH said in a report titled “Human Development Indicators,” which reviewed data from 2012 to 2017 and was issued Thursday.  Urban female-headed households rose from 19 percent in 2012 to 21 percent in 2017, compared to a rise to 10 percent from 11 percent in rural areas.

The observatory also noted that declining fertility rates and significant aging will shape the demographic transition of Morocco in the coming years.  Mothers aged 15 to 49 who had given birth in a supervised setting jumped from 82 percent to 88 percent between 2012 and 2017. The average number of years of education attained by adults aged 25 years and over was 4.8 years in 2017, or 5.8 years for men and 3.8 years for women.

Rabat – Morocco’s anti-terrorism unit, BCIJ, has arrested a new suspect in the double murder of the two Scandinavian tourists whose bodies were found earlier this month.  The suspect, a Swiss national who also hold the Spanish citizenship, was arrested in Marrakech where he lived and is believed to have strong connections with some of the already arrested suspects, including the four who carried out the double murder. According to BCJI’s statement, the man was “radicalized” and had violent proclivities. He is suspected of providing technical and logistic assistance to the primary suspects. BCIJ’s statement noted that the Swiss-Spanish man “trained the other suspects to use state-of-the art communication technologies.” He also taught them how to use arms, the statement added. In addition to the training the primary suspects, the man spearheaded radicalization activities to lure Moroccan nationals and sub-Saharan migrants to join their radicalized cell. The double murder of Imlil took Morocco by shock as the country has been close to irreproachable in its anti-terrorism efforts. Prior to Imlil, Morocco’s experience with terrorism dated back to 2011. After the police discovered the slain bodies of the two Scandinavian in a camping spot near Mount Toubkal, Moroccans expressed frustration and sympathy. They apologized, sympathized in great number, and attended vigils in memoriam of the two murdered tourists. Since the Imlil incident, Moroccan authorities have made a series of arrests. With the arrest of the Swiss suspect, Moroccan security services have so far arrested 20 individuals linked to the Imlil murder.

Rabat – The Tangier Court of Appeals has sentenced a husband to two years in jail for raping his wife. The court also ordered the man to pay an MAD 2,000 fine and MAD 30,000 in compensation to the victim. The convicted 25-year-old husband from Larache, a town near Tangier, had violently forced his wife to engage in sexual intercouse, reported Al Ahdath al Maghribiya on Saturday. The woman suffers from severe depression. The court’s decision was based on Articles 485 and 400 of the penal code. Article 400 states: “Any act of violence or assault, even if it caused no disability or illness is punishable by imprisonment from one month to one year in addition to a fine of MAD 200 to 500.” The wife’s lawyer reported that her medical certificate verified serious indications of physical violence. The lawyer noted that the woman already suffers from depression, and the rape could induce her to become suicidal. Law 103-13 to eliminate violence against women, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination, which took effect in September, does not list marital rape as a punishable crime.

Rabat – Moroccan investigators have identified a shepherd as the primary suspect in the killing of a 24-year-old Moroccan woman in the Ifrane region, in central Morocco. On Friday morning, locals in the Oued Ifrane rural community in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains found the decapitated body of the woman in a deserted area. The woman was a Moroccan divorcee, mother of a 7-year-old daughter, living with her parents. The suspect, 38 years old, is a shepherd in the forests of the Atlas Mountains. He reportedly disappeared suddenly after the crime. Using a helicopter and sniffer dogs, the Moroccan royal gendarmerie and auxiliary forces are chasing the suspect, who is thought to have headed to his hometown Tounfit, in Midelt province, central Morocco. While rumors spread that the motive behind the murder was retaliation for “a failed love relationship between the victim and the suspect,” the victim’s father told Moroccan media that the crime could be linked to “a dispute over a piece of land.” The father, speaking sorrowfully, said that one of his daughters broke the news to him of the death of his youngest daughter. He said his daughter was the family’s breadwinner and had worked in the area’s olive and apple fields and cafes. Police transported the woman’s body to the Azrou Regional Hospital’s morgue for an autopsy. The gendarmerie and local authorities are still examining the crime scene to investigate the murder.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – Founded by Boubker Mazoz in 2007, the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center has become a beacon of opportunity for youth from Sidi Moumen in Casablanca. The center, run by the Idmaj Association, has finished building its third facility. The lack of opportunity, violence, illiteracy, and government policies within the Sidi Moumen community resulted in intense poverty. In the 2003 Casablanca bombings, all 12 bombers came from Sidi Moumen. Again, in the 2007 Casablanca attacks, the suicide bombers originated from Sidi Moumen. In 2003, King Mohammed VI introduced “Cities Without Slums,” a program aiming to eliminate all slums from the country by 2012. The project included building sufficient, affordable, and sanitary housing for families to relocate to during the demolishment of the old slums. Since its launch in 2004, the UN-Habitat supported program has reached one of the highest rates of reduction of slums at a global level. More than simply replacing the housing, helping the community rise beyond the hopelessness that had encompassed it for so long was a continuous battle. Seeing the challenges the community faced, Boubker Mazoz, a Moroccan who previously worked for the US State Department, founded the first center in 2007 with private funding. According to its website, the mission of Sidi Moumen is to “encourage at-risk children and vulnerable youth to stay in school and avoid delinquency, drug addiction, and extremism.” Through classes, activities and safe spaces, the center provides youth with the skills to become future leaders and upstanding citizens. The center offers courses in various languages, music, leadership, and art, among many other programs. Idmaj hosts exchange programs and conferences to encourage youth to take advantage of new opportunities and share their experiences with others. The Idmaj Association, which runs the centers, is an association of youth who are from the neighborhoods that they serve. The founder, Boubker Mazoz, aimed to train young people to become leaders and participate in the operation of the center. Now, over 90 percent of the staff are from the Sidi Moumen community, and most of them were originally students from the center. Salma Elmettichi, the deputy secretary general of Idmaj, started attending the center when she was nine years old. Thirteen years later, she attributes her accomplishments to attending the center as a child. Elmettichi received her bachelor’s degree earlier this month. “The center gave me the most important thing. The center gave me hope. I had a life without hope, I didn’t know what to do,” Elmettichi told Morocco World News. She continued, “The center showed me how to set my goals. It showed me that one day I could be an important person. The center gave back the trust that I lost when I was young.” Beyond engaging with the youth of the community, the centers capitalize on the opportunity to involve their families too. Expanding into cooking, embroidery, and recycling classes, the center incorporates the mothers of the youth as well. “The center has made families closer. For me and my family, before the center, my parents didn’t know who I was,” said Elmettichi. “When I came to the center at nine and did things that I loved to do, my parents, especially my mom, were able to see that I was talented. It helped the bond between me and my family grow.” Walking into the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center, there are security measures to ensure the safety of the youth. However, once inside the grounds, the center is colorfully decorated with murals surrounding the combined basketball and soccer court. An old school bus is converted into a classroom. Trailers painted with bright colors contain sewing machines and a group of mothers embroidering together. Fifteen young boys and girls bang their makeshift drums in unison as they sit for their drumming class. Inside the facility, students fill classrooms learning math, English, and leadership skills. Pictures cover the walls of the theater room, highlighting past productions and performances. There is a sense of hope that surrounds one when they enter the facility. Youth from all around the community are learning, engaging in conversation, and putting their passions into practice. “The center supports youth who came from hard social backgrounds, like myself and others who don’t have a lot of money. The center has helped us study so that in the future we can change our social situations,” said Elmettichi. The newest facility that has been constructed, but not yet inaugurated, is a four-story building, which holds classrooms filled with musical instruments, art supplies, libraries, technology labs, a stage, exercise equipment, sewing machines, and more. The center will be able to cater to more members of the community and encourage youth to engage in what they are passionate about. “With the third center, we wish to get the chance to help more kids succeed in their studies and succeed in their lives,” said Elmettichi. “Our lives were changed when we entered the center, so we hope to help others who need our help to change their lives too.”

Rabat – Trade unions have sounded an alarm bell, threatening to start 2019 with a “month of anger” of sustained protests and sit-in campaigns until the government reconsiders abandoning the “social dialogue.” The Moroccan Labor Union (UMT), the Democratic Labor Federation (CDT), and other advocacy groups have announced that January will be a month of protests. Should the government fail to review its position on improving working conditions, especially raising wages, workers will boycott their jobs and take to the streets, the groups said. In late November, a number of trade unions failed to reach consensus with the government on workers’ wage demands. UMT and CDT representatives slammed the negotiations, saying that Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani was insensitive to workers’ concerns. The groups now want to revive the “social dialogue,” saying that the first month of the coming year will be entirely devoted to bringing the government back to the negotiating table. Brandishing threats of “protests, strikes, sit-ins and regional and national marches,” the organizations, Assabah reported in its weekend edition, count on their mobilization ability to compel the government to relent. Earlier this week, UMT Secretary General Miloudi Moukharik said that workers’ anger has been spurred by the government’s perceived lack of political will and workers’ “constantly degrading conditions.” Moukharik’s statement highlighted job insecurity, “precarious working conditions,” the high unemployment rate, rising prices, and “the violation of pensioners’ rights and workers’ labor freedom” as the reasons behind the calls for general strikes. Offering a grim picture of Morocco’s economy, Moukharik said the government is the primary actor responsible for the situation. Meanwhile, CDT, the other “angry group of workers,” has released a specific protest schedule. Starting on January 11, the group will hold a march on the Tangier road. Their protest motives include the government’s withdrawal from the social dialogue, “lack of political will,” and the “systematic violation of labor freedom.” While UMT and CDT have been the most vocal critics of the government’s social policies, the month of anger has garnered support from other trade unions. Three teachers unions have joined the club of “angry workers.” Earlier this week, the national federation of teaching professionals, the free teachers’ federation, and the national teachers’ federation announced the dates of their protest movements. The groups have called for general strikes January 2-4. They will hold a sit-in in front of the education ministry headquarters on January 2 as well as a march on Parliament, they said.

Rabat – France Football has slated three Moroccan international players for its “Maghreb Player of the Year” shortlist. Ajax’s attacking midfielder, Hakim Ziyech; Juventus’ defender, Medhi Benatia; and Dortmund’s defender, Achraf Hakimi, have all made France Football magazine’s shortlist.  Benatia won last year’s award, ahead of Riyad Mahrez and  Ziyech. The magazine said that Benatia started well this year, profiting from defender Leonardo Bonucci’s 2017 departure from Juventus. But Bonucci’s return to Juventus in the summer cost Benatia his place among the starting 11 players. It added that Benatia’s good year could have ended better without his penalty foul on Real Madrid’s Lucas Vazquez in the Champions League quarter finals. According to France Football, Hakimi is a multi-talented player who plays on both left and right sides. He performed well during Real Madrid’s Champions League match against Atletico de Madrid. Just 19, Hakimi has proved his maturity in the three matches he has played with the Morrocan national football team. Ziyech is certainly one of the most talented players in Africa, wrote France Football. It added that he managed an outstanding performance in 2018 and was even voted best player of the 2017-2018 Netherlands Championship. The magazine selected nine players from the Maghreb, including three players from Algeria and three others from Tunisia. The names of the remaining players have yet to be announced.

Rabat – In 2018, Morocco said goodbye to a host of exceptional people, from artists, intellectuals, to footballers. There are those who left the world young, and who left the country their artistic heritage to look back on. This is a list of Moroccan celebrities who died in 2018. A football champion left us early this year. Hamid Hazzaz, former Moroccan goalkeeper, died at 72, on January 13 in his home-city, Fez. Hazzaz was a high-caliber goalkeeper who participated in the 1970’s World Cup with Morocco in Mexico and made history with his premier club, Maghreb de Fez (MAS). The football legend was part of the Moroccan national team that won African Cup of Nations in 1976, the only African trophy in Morocco’s history.  Hazzaz’ death saddened his fans who will long remember his achievements with clubs and national team.  The early death of Moroccan talk-show presenter, singer, and actress Wiam Dahmani shocked Moroccans. Dahmani died of a heart attack at the age of 34 on April 22 in Dubai. Born in Rabat, the artist appeared in several Pakistani movies, including Ishq Khuda, Hotal, and Hijrat. Dahmani was living in Dubai and working as a broadcaster for Dubai TV when death knocked on her young door.  Morocco lost another football legend, Mohammed Jarir better known as “Houmane.” Houmane died on May 19 in the US at the age of 74. Houmane is most known for his exceptional scoring skills. He played as a forward for the Moroccan national football team, the Atlas Lion, scoring the only goal against Germany at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.  Due to a knee injury, Houmane was not able to pursue his career as a footballer and became a coach at Raja Casablanca club in 1975. On June 5, the world of football mourned the death of a young, ambitious footballer, Lahcen Akhmiss at the age of 30. The midfielder who played at the RSB Berkane club died in a road accident as he was driving from Berkane to Al Hoceima to sign with the local club of the city, Chabab Rif Al Hoceima (CRA). On 19 September, a successful Moroccan businessman and politician ldied at the age of 99, after a life full of achievements. Mohamed Karim Lamrani who had never stepped a foot in school was a three-times head of government: from August 6, 1971 to November 2, 1972; from November 30, 1983, to September 30, 1986; and from August 11, 1992, to May 25,1994. Born in 1919 in Fez, Lamrani became a wealthy businessman in Morocco and served as an economic advisor to the Moroccan government.

In 1967, Lamrani was appointed general director of Morocco’s OCP Group, one of the world’s largest phosphate producers and exporters. Renowned actress Khadija Jamal died at the age of 83 in Algeria after a long battle with diabetes. Born in 1935 in Casablanca, the actress best known for her role in early 2000s sitcom Lalla Fatima, appeared in dozens of Moroccan theatres. Two other renowned celebrities passed away in the same month. Coach Mustapha Madih died on November 4 at the age of 62 after a long struggle with illness. Madih, former coach of Morocco’s national under-17 football team, also served as a coach for a number of  Moroccan football teams, including Olympique Khouribga (2006-2007), AS FAR (2007), and Hassania Agadir (2011).
 The football icon had a fulfilled career. He won several titles, including Throne Cup and Moroccan football championships. Mimoun El Oujdi, known by his stage name “Cheb Mimoun,” died on November 3 at the age of 68. Born in the city of Oujda, northeast of Morocco, near the Algerian border, El Oujdi was one of the pioneers of Rai, an Algerian folk music genre that dates back to the 1920s.  El Oujdi released 18 albums between 1982 and 2012. Some of his famous songs include Soulouh, Barman (1985), Sawlouh (2008). Many Moroccans mourned the death of the artist, sharing his photos and songs on social media. The iconic Moroccan singer Hamid Zahir, 81, died on December 10 in Marrakech, his birthplace after suffering a stroke and battling with renal insufficiency. Zahir discovered his love for music at a young age and began to perform in Marrakech’s famous square, Jemaa El Fna, between 1947 and 1951. Zahir met and became friends with legendary Egyptian singers Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez. The artist also held several musical parties at the royal palace.
 Zahir’s songs “Lalla Fatima” and “Lalla Souad” are among the best-known classical Moroccan songs.

Rabat – The Association for the Taxation of Transactions and Aid to Citizens in Morocco (ATTAC Maroc) issued a statement on December 26 concerning the costs of the most recent Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) that the International Monetary Fund granted to Morocco. The IMF’s executive board approved a PLL arrangement for Morocco on December 17 for $2.97 billion over two years. The PLL is Morocco’s fourth arrangement with the IMF in six years which the Moroccan government considers precautionary. The IMF approved Morocco’s first PLL arrangement in August 2012 for $6.2 billion, the second PLL for $5 billion in July 2014, and the third for $3.5 billion in July 2016. However, ATTAC Maroc, an association involved in the alter-globalization movement, has argued that Morocco has not used any of the lines but has incurred costs estimated at MAD 720 million. ATTAC Maroc fights the neo-liberal policies of international economic institutions, such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the World Trade Organization, as well as the world’s great powers. ATTAC Maroc also calls for creditors to cancel public debt, saying public debt is one of the main tools that deepens Morocco’s structural dependence. Introduced in 2001, the PLL aims to “help countries with sound economic fundamentals and strong records of policy implementation but with some remaining vulnerabilities” to meet their needs for liquidity more flexibly, the IMF asserts. Only two countries have used the PLL  so far: the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Morocco. IMF Deputy Managing Director Mitsuhiro Furusawa said the new PLL arrangement “will provide insurance against external shocks and support the authorities’ efforts to further strengthen the economy’s resilience and promote higher and more inclusive growth.” In contrast, ATTAC believes that the PLL “shows the structural dependence and fragility of the Moroccan economy.” Morocco, according to the association, “is likely to face an increase in oil price, which represents a significant part of its imports, a fall in the prices of its main exports on the international markets and more particularly in Europe (agricultural products, fisheries and mining products like phosphates), a drop in money transfers from Moroccans residing abroad, tourism receipts or foreign direct investment.” The government expects the PLL will facilitate Morocco’s access to new loans in the international financial market. In turn, the government hopes that will increase confidence in the stability of the Moroccan economy in order to receive foreign investment and secure the country’s loan repayment. For this reason, the line represents a foreign currency reserve that the country can use in the event of a serious deterioration of the balance of payments, according to ATTAC. Morocco started issuing bonds in the international financial market in 2007 when it received a €500 million loan, then €1 billion euros in 2010, $1.5 billion in 2012, $750 million in 2013, and €1 billion in 2014, ATTAC noted. The North African country plans to issue a new bond in 2019 of around €1 billion euros, according to Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun. The IMF’s conditions to obtain the PPL include reforming education, governance, the labor market, and taxation and improving the business climate, strengthening state-owned enterprises monitoring, and targeting social spending better. According to ATTAC’s statement, the IMF calls for “the acceleration of ongoing structural reforms to increase ‘free trade’, dismantle the customs system, create free zones, privatize public institutions and services, expand tax incentives to multinationals and large local capital, dismantle the subsidy system, reduce the budgets for social sectors (education, health and housing), and generalize fixed-term contracts in the public service.” At the end of 2017, Morocco had MAD 900 billion in public debt and MAD 149 billion in debt service, according to ATTAC’s statement. Meanwhile, the association objected to the small size of the government’s education and scientific research budget in 2017 at MAD 54 billion, that of the health sector at MAD 14 billion, and of public investment at MAD 64 billion. ATTAC stressed that the cost of the debt was “much higher than the social budgets and hinders any real social and human development.” The deficit makes the working classes and the employees, according to ATTAC, bear the burden of debt repayment through “the policies of austerity, poverty, wage freezes, unemployment, marginalization … imposed by institutions and a Parliament that do not represent the people’s will.” At the end of its statement, ATTAC ultimately objected to the PPL, saying it “mortgages the future of Morocco and its people by the IMF’s draconian conditionalities.” It also condemned the state’s austerity policies and structural reforms it says are imposed on the working classes and employees to “satisfy” foreign decision-making institutions. Established in 2000, ATTAC Maroc is a member of the Committee for the Abolition of Illegitimate Debt (CADTM), the CADTM Africa Network. Since May 2014, ATTAC Maroc and CADTM Belgium have been serving as the international secretariat of the international CADTM network.

Rabat – A roadside bomb hit a tourist bus on Friday in Greater Cairo, near the Giza Pyramids, killing three Vietnamese tourists and their Egyptian guide, Egypt’s Public Prosecutor Nabil Sadeq said in a statement. The explosion injured 10 other Vietnamese tourists and the Egyptian bus driver, according to Egypt’s State Information Service. The bomb exploded at 6:15 p.m. local time when the bus was travelling in the Marioutiyah area near the pyramids, the ministry said. The tourist bus was reported to be carrying up to 14 Vietnamese tourists. The tourists were heading to “a sound and light show at the pyramids,” which they had visited earlier in the day, said Lan Le, 41, who was also on the bus, according to Reuters. “We were going to the sound and light show and then suddenly we heard a bomb. It was terrible, people screaming,” Le told Reuters. “I don’t remember anything after.” The Vietnamese tourist was speaking at Al Haram Hospital, where the injured tourists were taken. Vietnam has called on Egypt to determine those responsible for the attack. “Vietnam is extremely angered by and strongly condemns this act of terrorism that killed and injured innocent Vietnamese people,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Le Thi Thu Hang, said in a statement. “Vietnam requests that Egypt promptly launch an investigation into the case and track down those responsible.” After the deadly attack, the interior ministry announced that security forces had killed 40 terrorists in a fire exchange in two separate operations on Saturday. The security forces carried out the operations as part of a crackdown on three terrorist hideouts in Giza, southwest of Cairo, and Sinai, northeastern Egypt, according to the ministry’s statement. The police killed 30 terrorists in two hideouts in Giza and killed 10 others in a third hideout in the El-Arish governorate in northern Sinai.  The police also arrested 11 suspects and seized a number of weapons and explosives at the hideouts, according to the statement. The terrorists were planning to commit terror attacks during celebrations of the New Year and Christmas, against state institutions, Christian places of worship, the Egyptian armed forces, and police sites.  Egypt’s Coptic Christians traditionally celebrate Christmas on January 7. The interior ministry did not state whether any of the killed or arrested terrorists were linked to the Friday attack on the tour bus.

Rabat – The National tourism sector was not affected by the double murder of Imlil (Al Haouz province), according to professionals in the sector, who did not report any booking cancellation or disruption, both nationwide and in the region of Marrakesh, Morocco’s top tourist destination. “According to tourism operators not only in the region of Marrakesh, but also nationally, no cancellation or disruption took place following this reprehensible act,” president of the National Federation of Travel Agencies in Morocco (FNAVM) Khalid Benazzouz was quoted by MAP as saying.  Noting that the region of Toubkal is a very popular and appreciated destination for tourists who love mountains, the president of the FNAVM stressed that the Moroccan destination is still very coveted and even recommended by the diplomatic representations of several countries, including Norway, Great Britain, and Denmark. 
Benazzouz called for the vigilance and mobilization of all sectors, especially travel agencies, to promote the values of tolerance and hospitality of Morocco, which is known for its political stability and security.

For his part, president of the Regional Association of Marrakech and Safi Travel Agencies (ARAVMS) Taoufik Madih, stressed that, “at this time of the year, all hotels and Riads are full and all Tourism actors are focused on the preparations for the celebrations of the new year.”

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy has rescued 367 irregular migrants from the Mediterranean, including women and children, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. The migrants were aboard several inflatable boats in trouble, according to a military source. The royal navy brought the migrants safely back to Morocco. The Moroccan navy rescued 202 irregular migrants aboard unsafe bots in the Mediterranean Sea on December 22 and 23. In November, Maghreb Arab Press  (MAP) said that Morocco has disrupted 76,000 undocumented migration attempts in 2018. Thousands of sub-Saharan Africans use Morocco as a transit country to reach Europe. Local youth in northern Morocco also seek migration due to unemployment in the country. Morocco, however, has also become a final destination for migrants, according to Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Bourita emphasized in a recent interview with BBC that migrants should not be treated as criminals. The official also said that “migration is a natural, universal phenomena.” Bourita said that there are an estimated 256 million migrants globally, both documented and undocumented. He said that out of the 256 million migrants, 36 million are African.

Rabat- Marrakech recorded over 2.4 million tourist arrivals in the period from January to November in addition to 2.6 million scheduled hotel stays through the end of 2018, according to Morocco’s Tourism Observatory. Overnight stays in Marrakech throughout the 11-month period reached 7.2 million. The observatory expects the number of overnight stays to rise to 8 million by the end of the year, especially with the New Year holiday.  Marrakech attracted increasing numbers of tourists from France, up 14 percent; Germany, up 25 percent; and Spain, up 52 percent. But Marrakech attracted even more dramatic increases in tourists from China and Eastern Europe, rising 100 to 300 percent. Chinese tourist arrivals increased overall in Morocco from just 10,000 in 2015 to nearly 200,000 people this year, according to Minister of Tourism Mohammed Sajid. In a statement to state-owned agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the president of the Regional Tourism Council (CRT), Abderrahim Bentbib, said that the rise in tourist arrivals in Marrakech this year can be owed to the addition of 22 flights from Germany, Switzerland, and France to the city. Tourists from countries such as Romania, Poland, and the Czech Republic are now flocking to Morocco.  The same statement foresees that 2019 will also be a promising year for tourism in the city and Morocco in general.  Marrakech is not the only city that enjoyed an increase in tourist arrivals.  Agadir, a popular Moroccan coastal city, recorded over 4.5 million overnight stays by tourists in the period between January and October 2018. The figure is up from 4 million overnights during the same period in 2017, increasing by 13 percent.

Rabat – The US Central Intelligence Agency has issued new “World Factbook” figures on global military expenditures. Morocco was ranked 26th in the ratio of military spending to GDP because it spent 3.28 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the military in 2016, just behind the US at 3.29 percent. Morocco’s GDP in 2016 was $103.35 billion, according to Statista.com. Algeria remains the top spender compared to GDP in Africa and the fifth in the world. Morocco’s eastern neighbor spent 6.55 percent of its GDP on the military in 2016.  Oman topped the list globally, spending 13.73 percent of its GDP on the military, while South Sudan spent 10.93 percent. Several countries in the Middle East spend a significant portion of their GDP on the military. Saudi Arabia ranked third globally at 9.85 percent, while the UAE came sixth with 5.66 percent. Kuwait and Lebanon ranked 9th and 10th. Tunisia was ranked 40th at 2.32 percent and Egypt came 63rd at 1.67 percent. In recent years, Morocco has been determined to upgrade its military by acquiring new military equipment from its biggest supplier: the US. Morocco has allocated MAD 35.1 billion for its military in 2019. The budget has slightly increased (2.3 percent) from the 2018 military budget of MAD 34.3 billion. The government seeks to reinforce its ability to  protect national sovereignty and to defend the territorial integrity and stability of the country. The Global Firepower (GFP) index ranked Morocco 55th among 136 countries in the 2018 military strength ranking. The GFP report said that “the Moroccan military uses a mix of old and new equipment while having several hundred thousand active and reserve personnel on call.” This week, the House of Representatives passed Law 44.18, reintroducing mandatory military service for young people aged 19 to 25. Starting in September 2019, the delegate minister of the National Defense Administration,  Abdelatif Loudiyi, expects that 10,000 new conscripts will join the military each year. The military has budgeted MAD 500 million to pay for the mandatory military service. GFP also stated Morocco owns 284 aircraft, including 56 fighters, 56 attack planes, and 130 helicopters. Algeria has 528, including 97 fighters, 107 attack planes, 280 helicopters, and 46 attack helicopters. Despite recent purchases and Morocco’s strategy to upgrade its military, Morocco country spends less on its defense that Algeria, which spends  $10.57 billion annually.

Rabat – Local inhabitants of the Oued Ifrane rural community in the Ifrane region in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains, found a decapitated woman’s body in a deserted area of the region, on Friday. The woman, aged 24, was a Moroccan divorcee with one daughter, according to Moroccan media. According to Moroccan television channel TéléMaroc, the woman’s head was found about six meters away from the body. The gendarmerie and local authorities rushed to the crime scene to investigate the brutal murder. The authorities transported the woman’s body to the morgue of Azrou Regional Hospital for an autopsy.  The motives for the murder are unknown, and police have not released any information about potential suspects.  The murder comes just 11 days after terrorists murdered two young Scandinavian women near Imlil, 90 kilometers south of Marrakech. Shocked and horrified by the act of terror, Moroccans condemned the murder and expressed sympathy for the victims’ families on social media, on the streets, and in front of the Norwegian and Danish embassies in Morocco.

Rabat – After discussing Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy and international cooperation, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, discussed again the importance of security cooperation between Morocco and Algeria. In his interview with Moroccan television channel 2M, Khiame said that security cooperation “would benefit the two countries because there are several risks in the region.” Referring to Algeria’s position on the Western Sahara conflict, Khiame said that he is addressing Algeria as a security official and not with “a political motive.” Khiame emphasized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, saying, “No one can ever convince me that the Sahara is not Moroccan.” Khiame continued to say that  Algeria’s security services do not respond when he tells them there are weapons coming from Algeria into Morocco, suggesting Algeria does not want to cooperate. He also condemned Algeria’s “ignorance” since Morocco has warned Algeria of the situation in the Sahel, where several terror organizations are active, including ISIS and Al Qaeda. Khiame added that cooperation between the countries would ensure stability and security for both peoples. He also called on Algeria to leave politics aside because security cooperation is necessary to deter the terror threat in the Sahel and in the whole region. Khiame added that Morocco will not spare any efforts to notify Algeria or any other country of terror threats. “We will surely not keep any secret regarding any issue that threatens the stability of any  country, including Algeria.” Khiame has brought up the lack of security cooperation between Morocco and Algeria in most of his recent interviews. In the Sahel, according to Khiame, many terror organizations have links to drug trafficking networks. Khiame said that trafficking circles clearly finance terrorism in the Sahel, which is a “fertile ground for terrorism, posing a threat in the entire region.” He discussed Morocco’s cooperation with several powers, including France and Spain, explaining that the North African country has put in place an “efficient” policy and security system to confront terrorism and drug trafficking.  The security apparatus has conducted “record seizures” of cocaine and dismantled several drug trafficking rings across Morocco, according to Khiame.

Rabat – Moroccan Atlas Lion Mehdi Benatia has published a motivating message on his Instagram account. “A lion never dies, he sleeps…” wrote Benatia. The message, dedicated for fans, illustrates Benatia’s determination to improve his skills and move forward in his career. This season, Benatia, who plays for Juventus, has spent all but five games on the bench. In reference to his disappointment over the situation, Benatia thanked his fans for their support in this “difficult period.” In 2016, Benatia moved to Juventus from Bayern Munich, initially on loan. He was later signed permanently by the club in the 2017-18 season. Benatia, the captain of the Moroccan national football team, appears in most of the Atlas Lions’ matches. He played in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, but was not called up for the last three qualifier games of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.

Rabat – Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas has chosen Marrakech as his destination for the New Year holiday. Navas posted pictures to his Instagram story of himself in Marrakech with his wife Andrea Salas, his 4-year-old son, Mateo, and a group of people. The goalkeeper joined Real Madrid in 2014 for €10 million following a transfer from Levante. The 32-year-old Costa Rican, previously an indispensable goalkeeper with three Champions League titles, now rarely plays. This season, Navas has become Thibaut Courtois’ replacement, playing only twice in La Liga’s 16 matches so far.

Rabat – Three weeks after the British oil and gas company Sound Energy started drilling the second, TE-10, well, the company announced encouraging initial results at the well in its Tendrara project in eastern Morocco. “The preliminary results of intermediate wireline logs at TE-10 indicate the presence of gas bearing sands in the TAGI,” Sound Energy said in a statement Thursday. “These positive initial results underscore our confidence in the exploration potential across the broader basin,” said James Parsons, Sound Energy’s CEO. “We will now finalise the logging, drill to [total depth] and then test the well to better understand the scale of the discovery and seek to confirm commercial flow rates.” Located 25 kilometers northeast of the anticipated production area in Tendrara, the TE-10 well, the second of three planned exploration wells, “will test the North East Lakbir prospect in the Company’s Greater Tendrara permit.” The British company estimated 30-40 days for the drilling program of the second well at a total measured depth of 2,200 meters. Up to now, the TE-10 well has been drilled to a depth of 2,098 meters, “penetrating the top of the TAGI sand sequence at a measured depth” of approximately 1,892 meters, according to Sound Energy’s statement. Last month, Sound Energy plugged and abandoned the TE-9 well, which it had drilled to a total depth of 2,925 meters, after the company failed to find producible gas at the well. The focused upstream gas company plans to perform a well test after it has completed drilling TE-10, “including possible mechanical stimulation.” Sound Energy “will also initiate seismic analysis to establish the Company’s internal estimated gas resources of the structural closure and the upside potential of the North East Lakbir stratigraphic trap.” The groundwork for drilling the third well in the exploration program, TE-11, is expected to kick off after testing the TE-10 well.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH) has issued a report titled “Human Development Monitoring Indicators.” The report analyzes data from 2012 to 2017. The report found the literacy rate among Moroccan young people aged 15-24 was 94 percent in 2017. The rate increased from from 88 percent in 2012. ONDH said that men have had higher literacy rates than women over the five-year period. The report, published by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), found that the literacy rate for men is 95.6 percent compared to 91.3 percent for women. The gap between women and men, however, has narrowed from 7.2 percentage points in 2012 to 4.3 points in 2017. Illiteracy higher in rural areas The report found a wide gap in education levels between rural and urban areas, noting that young people in rural areas have lower literacy rates  than those in urban areas, “although the gap has narrowed to almost 9 points..” The literacy rate increases with the standard of living quintile, rising from 79 percent to 86 percent for the poorest 20 percent  of the population and and from 94 percent to 98 percent for the wealthiest 20 percent. Moroccans aged 25 and older had received 4.7 years of education, on average, in 2017. Men had received 5.8 years and women 3.8 years. The average was 6.1 years in urban areas and 2.2 years in rural areas. Over the 2012-2017 period, the number of years of study increased by six months. 3.3% of children never went to school ONDH also mentioned compulsory schooling for children aged 6-15, saying that in 2017, 92 percent of school-age children were in school, while 5 percent of children had dropped out of school. Three percent of school-age children have never been to school.  “The progress between 2012 and 2017 shows that the proportion of children in school has increased by 2.3 percentage points while out-of-school and those who have never attended school have decreased by 1.8 and 0.4 points, respectively,” said the study. The net enrollment rate of 6-11 year olds at the primary level, according to ONDH, increased from 91 percent in 2012 to 93 percent in 2017.  For secondary school, the net enrollment rate for 12-14 year old pupils rose from 50 percent to 61 percent. Net enrollment for the third education level of 15-17-year-old students rose  from 29 percent to 37 percent. 8% more boys go to high school than girls Over the 2012-2017 period, enrollment rates for boys were higher than those of girls, concluded the report. ONDH’s study found that the gap increases with age. In 2017, the gap between boys and girls was 0.5 percent for ages 6-11, 4.5 percent for ages 12-14, and 8.1 percent for ages 15-17. Before the 2018-2019 academic year began, the Ministry of Education pledged reforms for the Moroccan education system to combat drop-out rates. Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that his ministry seeks to reduce the rate of school drop-outs from 6 percent in rural primary schools to 1 percent by 2024-2025. Amzazi pledged a decrease in the rate of dropouts in secondary schools from 12 percent to 3 percent, in both rural and urban areas, for the 2024-2025 school year. He also promised reforms in terms of training and youth employment in the education field, proposing the creation of a new generation of vocational training centers.

By Zakaria Oudghiri Rabat – A man in a Macy’s store in the Dallas area insulted two employees in the shop, saying they were not speaking English. He said they were speaking Arabic as they helped him with his purchase. The man was later dubbed #GiftBoxBobby on Twitter when a video of the interaction went viral.

The man stood at a counter in the store, wanting to buy a handbag. The clerk behind the counter told him he needed to go to another part of the store to get his gift wrapped. Angry, he demanded that the purse come with a box.  The staff did not have one. As the argument escalated, several other shoppers stood up for the staff. “Hey, I don’t speak Arabic,” the man said. “Hey, I’m in America. I want people to speak English to me,” he added. It has not been confirmed if the staff were speaking Arabic or not. Another customer intervened, asking why the women’s language bothered him. The man then called the crowd a “bunch of Democrats.” “All you Arabs. All you Arabs and Democrats, go back where you came from,” said the man in the video, after onlookers started to laugh when they learned that the argument started because the customer would not spend $1 to get his gift wrapped.  “I cannot see how many Arabs came out of the woodwork,” said the man, walking away slowly. “Dude, you’re the snowflake here,” the person behind the camera said. The customer replied with an offensive gesture and strong language, saying “Put me on YouTube.”
 According to Vice, a Twitter user called Ricky filmed the encounter and has now made his account private. The user had tweeted, “This man made two women cry after publicly humiliating them. Please help me find this awful guy’s information.”  The videos of the incident “continue the trend of white people using racial language to insult others or report them to the police,” the Independent wrote. Finnish linguist Tove Skutnabb-Kangas says that language often serves as a proxy for other forms of discrimination. A Macy’s spokesperson told Buzzfeed they were investigating the incident. The spokesperson said, “We believe our Macy’s employees and customers should be treated with dignity, respect, and kindness. We aim to create a welcoming environment and we apologize for what occurred in our store.”

Rabat – Responding to the Algerian prime minister, Ahmed Ouyahia, who implied Morocco wrongly takes credit for couscous, Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi stated, “Everyone knows the origins of couscous.”  At the press conference following the weekly government council on Thursday, El Khalfi stated “no one can deny” the origins of the dish, implying that couscous is Moroccan through and through.  Last week, during couscous-tasting tour at Algiers’ Pasta Production Fair, the Algerian prime minister said: “A neighboring country has taken credit for couscous.” Ouyahia continued: “We have to prove them wrong. We are not saying that couscous is Algerian but Maghrebi. We have to promote Algerian couscous though.” Couscous is integral to the cultural heritage of multiple Maghreb countries, especially Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria.  The couscous war, however, is not limited to Maghreb countries. Last February, things escalated when Palestinians and Israelis debated the origins of a couscous salad. It started when a Virgin Atlantic flight offered “Palestinian couscous salad” on their menu, displeasing one Israeli customer, who went as far as calling for a boycott against the airline. The airline described the dish called “maftoul” as: “Palestinian couscous salad inspired by the flavors of Palestine.” Ranting online, the Israeli passenger wrote: “I thought this was an Israeli salad…obviously [Virgin Group founder Richard] Branson showing his true colors…Israelis must boycott Virgin and Israel must ask for an explanation. When I complained the stewardess tried to take back the menu from me.” After the airline changed the name of the dish, omitting the word “Palestinian,” supporters of the Palestinian cause took to Twitter to express their displeasure. Couscous is a North African dish typically made with grains of crushed durum wheat, vegetables, and meat.  On Tuesday, Algeria announced that on behalf of the Maghreb countries, it will submit a proposal to list couscous in UNESCO’s World Intangible Heritage List next March.

Rabat – The government council approved a decree on Thursday maintaining the suspension of import duties on soft wheat and its derivatives for four months until April 2019. The government had decided earlier to apply a fixed customs duty of 30 percent on soft wheat starting January 2019, down from 135 percent. The duty would raise the domestic prices of soft wheat and flour, and therefore bread prices, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said at a press conference after the government council meeting. Through the decree, the government seeks to keep the price of flour stable at MAD 260 per quintal. Flour is also subsidized. If Morocco added the 30 percent import duty on wheat, El Khalfi said, the import cost of soft wheat would be between MAD 290 and MAD 300 per quintal. Thanks to good weather, Morocco expects to have a 70-million-hectare cereal crop in 2019, increasing domestic wheat production to 8.2 million tons this season, nearly 1 million tons more than last year. According to El Khalfi’s statistics, the national soft wheat stock at mills and storage centers is estimated at about 14.3 million quintals, covering three months and seven days of the country’s industrial mill needs. The government affirmed that the decree is one part of the kingdom’s social measures. Morocco also subsidizes butane gas to maintain its price at MAD 41 per 12-kilogram bottle. The state subsidizes each bottle by MAD 56. In the 2019 Finance Bill, the government allocated MAD 17.67 billion for the subsidy fund to subsidize butane gas, sugar, and flour. The figure is a significant increase of MAD 4.65 billion from the 2018 budget. In April 2017, the government decided to raise import duties for soft wheat from 30 to 135 percent. The former economy minister Mohamed Boussaid explained that the switch was made to stabilize prices and boost local soft wheat marketing. In October 2017, the government council adopted draft decree 2.17.633 to lower the import tax to 30 percent in December 2017 “to protect the national production and the purchasing power of the citizen by ensuring the supply of good quality wheat to the national market,” according to a statement by El Khalfi at the time. Morocco’s main wheat imports come from the EU (31 percent), Russia (18 percent), Ukraine (18 percent), and the US (16 percent).

Rabat – Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell has raised the possibility of taking the opportunity to “heal wounds” 100 years after the Rif War and the Battle of Annual, a fierce confrontation between Spain and Moroccan resistance fighters in 1921. This year marked the 97th anniversary of the Battle of Annual in which all Moroccans take pride. The battle was one of Morocco’s most famous accomplishments against colonial powers. After Spain’s defeat in the battle, the Spanish colonizers made an unprecedented decision to use poison gas to stifle the revolution in the Rif region under the instruction of King Alfonso XIII in 1923. The decision was a blatant violation of the Treaty of Versaille signed in 1919. The treaty prohibited the use of poison gas. On Wednesday, Borrell brought up the Rif War before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Spanish Parliament and the damage Spain inflicted and the reprehensible use of poison gas, reported Spanish news outlets, including Europa Press. Opening dialogue on Spain’s use of poison gas in the Rif War has been suggested before. In 2012, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, then serving as minister of foreign affairs, called on Spain to come to terms with its use of poison gas during the war. Several scholars have condemned Spain’s use of poison gas, pointing out that the Rif region has the highest rates of cancer in Morocco, ostensibly caused by the Spanish chemical weapon attacks. Spain’s mea culpa might be too little too late, but the Moroccan government is strongly hoping for Spain to admit using inhumane weapons in the region. Besides the government, several Moroccan and international NGOs are calling on Spain to take the accusations seriously. Morocco’s Center for Common Memory for Democracy urged former Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis to take into consideration Morocco’s requests. Quoted by AA, the NGO’s statement earlier this year said, “Priority must be given to the issue of chemical weapons use and the tragedies they have caused—including the spread of cancerous diseases—in areas that were bombed [by Spanish colonial forces].” A David and Goliath war Despite Spain’s later actions, the Battle of Annual and the Rif War represent the pride of Moroccans. Soldiers under the leadership of Abd El Krim El Khattabi fought for Morocco’s independence with limited resources. Spanish historians have called the battle “the disaster of Annual” because of the untold numbers of Spanish soldiers who died in the disastrous defeat. An alleged 13,000 Spanish soldiers died in the battle. El Khattabi’s guerilla tactics led Spain’s Manuel Fernandez Silvester and his soldiers to withdraw. El Khattabi and his forces also confronted the French army in 1925 in Fez. El Khattabi led around 2,5000 soldiers and 50,0000 tribesmen to seize Fez, killing about 6,000 French forces. After the defeats, Spain and France called for negotiations with the Moroccan National Liberation Movement, which received support and administration from many liberation movements across the world. El Khattabi agreed to end the Rif War, but refused to hand over the weapons his men had seized from fallen Spanish soldiers. Spain and France, however, stopped El Khattabi in September 1925, sending their troops into the Rif and the south and fighting several battles. Both Spain and France used chemical grenades and other weapons that had been used in World War I. The massive attack led the Riffian leader to hand himself over to the French occupiers for the first time on May 26, 1926. France then exiled El Khattabi with his family to the island of Reunion, a French territory in the Indian Ocean, where he lived for 20 years.

Rabat – Egyptian football star Mohamed Salah has reportedly threatened to leave Liverpool if the club recruits Israeli football player Moanes Dabour, according to the Jerusalem Post.
 Salah’s inner circle, however, have denied the report, saying Salah is focused on football and is not concerned by whoever Liverpool may be talking to ahead of the January transfer window.  Jerusalem Post later removed the story from its website. 
Dabour, 26, is currently playing for Red Bull Salzburg. The Israeli Arab scored 12 goals in the 2018 Europa League, making him the most prolific scorer this year. He follows Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi on the overall best scorers list.  Dabour plays for the Israeli national football team as a striker. His brother, Anas Dabour, is currently playing as a midfielder for Lod city’s local club, Hapoel Bnei Lod FC.

One of Salah’s family members, Mahmoud Fayez, who is also an assistant coach of the Uzbek football team, tweeted in defense of Mohamed Salah that Salah was above all “a professional player [who] should be left alone to play and shouldn’t be overburdened.” In 2014, Salah reportedly refused to shake hands with the footballers of the Maccabi Tel Aviv club in a game with Salah’s former team FC Basel.

Rabat – As migration continues to gather international fervor three weeks after world governments met in Marrakech to sign the Global Compact on Migration, Morocco’s thousands of sub-Saharan migrants continue to wait in line to reach their “European dream.” Braving Rabat’s capricious weather and the gazes of onlookers, a number of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco’s capital have found themselves a sort of refuge in Qamra, a popular neighborhood that houses the city’s bus station. While Morocco takes pride in a “responsible” and “Africa-centered” migration policy, Qamra shows a much blurrier picture. It is unclear at first sight whether the migrants in Qamra are facing a reluctant world that only perceives them in terms of cost and benefit analysis; whether their lives are eclipsed behind Morocco’s policy priorities, or whether their presence is no issue to locals, many of whom donate food and clothing to the migrants. Despite some degree of friendliness and tolerance, the complete picture of the increasing visibility of sub-Saharans in Morocco offers reasons for caution. Qamra calls for perspective and nuance, a number of migrants told Morocco World News. Moroccans are ‘better racists’ Under the bridge linking Qamra to the chic neighborhood of Al Irfane, seven Guinean migrants have established what they call “home.” They eat and sleep there, armed with a buoyant hope of fulfilling their “Boza” dream and royally oblivious to stares and prejudice. Negotiating the condescension, the indifference, and the generosity of onlookers, but also a number of racist observations on their “black bodies,” they continue to live and think of a day when they will live the “European dream.” Alpha Omar, the apparent leader of the group living under the bridge, spoke to Morocco World News about his daily hardships. As forthcoming as a Catholic unburdening himself to a priest during a confession ritual, the Guinean migrant spoke of his long itinerary through West African countries to reach Algeria before being expelled to the Morocco-Algeria border. “We left Guinea because there was no hope,” he says, laughing, his face wearing that unmistakable marker of gravity. His voice grave and sour, as if signifying that he was not exaggerating his story, Omar spoke of the “hell” he and some others went through in Algeria. “Work is abundant there. We could work there, but at the expense of our lives and security.” He suggests that it was impossible to survive Algeria’s daily patrols and security checks.
What does that make of Morocco? A better and friendlier place for migrants; a racism-free environment? It depends on what meaning one ascribes to “better,” Omar’s friends jumped in the discussion. There is racism in Morocco, they conceded, but not as harsh as in other Arab countries. “In Algeria, you can make money but you’re never safe. Here, jobs are scarce, almost non-existent. But you feel relatively safe, generally free of harm from authorities and Moroccans. Moroccans are better racists,” Omar explained. When asked about Morocco’s recent crackdown on irregular migrants in provinces whose proximity to Europe brought droves of migrants to Morocco in the first place, the Guinean seems conciliatory, saying that Morocco is acting in “defense of its interests.” But, he regrets, “they have made it hard, impossible for people to try ‘Boza.’” The unfading appeal of hope The “stubbornness of hope,” Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wrote in her celebrated “Americanah,” is that it makes you believe that you’re exceptional. The “being exceptional” part was particularly striking in how Omar and his friends approached their Moroccan “stay.” For all of them, Morocco is a necessary scene in a longer play: life in Europe. As they spoke, their voices, words, and elisions were rife with that gleeful aura of someone who not only hoped to make it to the end but was, in fact, convinced that the end will be happy, and worthy of the efforts and struggles. “Migration is the only hope left,” Souleymane, the youngest of the crew living under the bridge, said as he chimed in for the first time. Guinea’s political failures and deepening poverty, he elaborated, herald no prospects of success for “people like us, with no connections in high places in the country.” To leave the country then becomes the only way of helping families to emerge from the deep structural and institutionalized poverty befalling many postcolonial societies. But how can you even have the time to hope, to imagine a happy ending, when you barely have time to live, to reflect; when your surroundings, the squalor you call “home” elicit only a permanent urge to go, no matter where? Those questions were left unanswered, but the evasions were evocative, pregnant with meaning: to hope, it is enough to be alive; no luxury is required. “I have a BA in economics,” said Mamadou. “But in Guinea, there is no job. So the only hope resides in going, taking with you the prayers and good wishes of those you leave behind. To go is like sacrificing your own life and wellbeing so that others in the family can hope of a life without the same difficulties.” Mamadou, like the others living under the bridge, is from Guinea. But he doesn’t live with Omar’s group. “Who told you everyone has a home here?” he asked. “People here sleep wherever they can, wherever they find space they deem appropriate for the night.” He points at a number of people lying on the ground, sleeping on generous grass that has become a mattress for many. Morocco World News met Mamadou in what used to be Qamra’s park. Now occupied by hordes of migrants who sleep on the grass, play and cook in the vicinity, the once-park has become the closest thing to “home” or “our place” for Qamra’s pack of migrants. They call it “la foret” (the forest), perhaps a veiled reference to the migrants’ forest in Tangier. But while Tangier’s “forest” is actually a forest, with all the dangers that life in such a place entails, Qamra’s “forest” is mostly made up of grass, wooden benches, and a number of lone and small trees, visibly stubborn enough to convince their occupants that they are indeed in a forest, cut from the outside world. “You can’t bear all these tribulations and ordeal,” Mamadou continued, as he recalled his failed attempts—he didn’t say an exact number—to cross to Spain. “You can’t bear all of this is you’re not driven by something, some sort of positive feeling that you’ll make it, that somehow God has not allowed all this suffering for no reasons.” This romanticization of immigration, the deliberate choice to ignore the ordeal of irregular migration and focus rather on the financial returns and the possibility of social mobility is reminiscent of sociologist Abdelmalek Sayad’s interpretation of his Algerian informants’ quite naïve and emphatic idealization of reaching France. Omar and Mamadou are in some sense a perfect embodiment of neoliberalism’ gospel of the self-made man, the much-circulated belief that success can become a reality through resilience and a persevering spirit. “Just as some dream to succeed in life with their good education,” Omar said, “mine is to become rich by traveling, migrating to places that offer opportunities.” The teaching of this success gospel can be liberating. It may even be well-meaning to Qamra’s migrants and other disenfranchised groups in some other parts of the world, but it is willfully and blatantly oblivious to the effects of class and structural mechanisms of disenfranchisement. It whitewashes the significant extent to which seemingly impartial institutional and structural dispositions have great bearing on people’s economic outcomes. Perhaps that is the whole intended point, to take society out of the picture and put the entire burden on the individual. Qamra’s migrants, or the vast majority of them, seem to have bought into the idea: Hope and hard work, despite the uncertainty and the crushing precariousness of life as a migrant, will prevail. Does it not sound unnecessarily romantic and unrealistic to associate migrants’ lives with agency and responsibility when they are clearly acting within boundaries and rules that operate beyond their control, and do not take their lives into consideration? But Omar has no ears for such intellectual mumbo-jumbo. To him, his daily life is proof that he is “a man,” a conscious agent of his choices; and a “fighter.” “God willing,” he says, seeming to have been taken aback by the seriousness of his own words, “like my other friends who have already crossed to Spain, I, too, will one day make it.” Between victimhood and agency But that does not mean that Omar and his pack are complacent optimists. Ingrained in the belief that success can in some way right their countries’ failures to grant them decent living conditions, their present life is a constant game of fantasizing about a better future; they dream of changing their circumstances. They hate being called “illegal migrants.” Torn between sub-Saharan Africa, Morocco, and Europe, they have developed complex personal stories, convincing themselves that salvation will come from “Boza,” even if that means challenging the jaws of the Atlantic or Mediterranean, and sometimes dying in the process. What, then, can one say to adequately capture Omar and his friends’ lives? Where does one even draw the lines? Are they victims of neoliberal globalization or conscious agents of a battle for a better future? Are they innocent collateral damages of their origin countries’ political failures? Do they feel victims of marginalization and discrimination in their host society or rather beneficiaries (actual or imagined) of the many opportunities associated with migration? Omar and his friends seem to be many of these at the same time. Sometimes, they are even all of these. Migration is a universe of contradictions. For all that it is worth, Souleymane, the economics graduate, is adamant about his status. He is no victim, he continuously proclaimed, repeating words like “dignity,” “respect,” and “humanity” like a broken faucet. Their lives, he suggested, is a walking confusion, a sum of battling, scattered, and confounding selves. He argued that the narrative of victimhood takes away the complexities of migrants’ stories. Instead of passive victims ensnared in the grip of lives they did not choose, he urged others to think of him as someone trying his best to escape from the unintended consequences of a conscious choice. Ansoumane Mara, a sub-Saharan rights activist and blogger residing in Marrakech, agrees with Souleymane. Migration, Mara explained, is more complicated than people may think. Driven by the urge for nuanced analysis, Mara is more interested in “exposing the root causes” of migration. It doesn’t help to unendingly debate whether or not migrants are victims or have agency, or which Western country is pro or anti-migration. “Until we address the causal factors, we will keep on having the same debate,” he said. But who, then, is responsible? How does one even measure responsibility in such a multi-layered and multi-faceted phenomenon? “It is true that the West, especially France, has a lot to be blamed for. But while neocolonialism can help explain the lot of many African countries, I think African leaders are the primary culprit. African countries’ failure to devise working policies and their leaders’ lack of concern and love for the youth seem to me to be the prime factors. Did you listen to Macron’s speech in Burkina Faso? He clearly suggested that France does what it does in Africa thanks to its loyal and Francophile vassals who are leading Francophone Africa.” It is doubtful whether Omar and his bridge friends were listening to Mara, even though they may have agreed with him. As Mara bombarded them with questions about how they survive in Morocco (How long have they been in Morocco? What do they eat? How do they make money? Are they in touch with their parents? Do they need some clothes?), Omar replied, “We speak with our parents every now and then.” Sensing Mara’s next question, perhaps the point of their conversation, Omar hammered home: “When conditions are ripe for ‘Boza,’ we will try again. That is what we are here for.”

Rabat – Undoubtedly, 2018 has been a year full of unforgettable moments in football both in Morocco and around the world. It was a hard year for some and a fantastic year for others. Before 2018 ends, football fans should take a moment to reflect on the most unforgettable football moments of the year.  Atlas Lions’ games in the World Cup People from all over the world witnessed the level of Morocco’s performance in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The Atlas Lions played solidly in the World Cup and made two big European national teams, Spain and Portugal, fight to get out of the group stage. The two European neighbors both struggled to defeat their African rival. Many Moroccans believe if VAR was not used in favor of Portugal and Spain, Morocco would have made them pack their bags and leave the World Cup early. Casablanca’s Raja Athletic Club slogan Fans of Raja De Casablanca (RCA) repeatedly chanted a slogan in September during a game expressing their discontent over living conditions, discrimination, and oppression in Morocco. A video documenting the chant was widely shared on social media and received many comments. The video crossed the Moroccan borders to into other Arab communities, collecting about 4 million views on Youtube. The rise of CHAN champion Ayoub El Kaabi The Moroccan football team of players without international contracts delivered a world-class performance during the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN). The competition promoted the rise of a talented young player, Ayoub El Kaabi, who scored in every match. El Kaabi displayed pure talent throughout the entire tournament scoring 8 goals in 5 matches, making him the top goal scorer in the entire history of CHAN. The Atlas Lions won the title of the 5th CHAN on February 4. Zinedine Zidane’s departure from Real Madrid Since coach Zinedine Zidane’s departure from Real Madrid, the club has experienced the worst period in its recent history. When Zidane left his post managing the “merengues,” it was the first blow to the club’s continuous success in a long time. After 2.5 seasons, 3 Champions Leagues, and several attempts to convince Zidane to continue with the club, Zidane made up his mind on May 31. Zidane pointed out that the club needed change to evolve.  Mohamed Salah’s injury and recovery We all remember the UEFA Champions League final match when Mohamed Salah sustained a shoulder injury following a tackle from Sergio Ramos. It seemed he would have to abstain from participating in the World Cup. Many viewed the tackle as monstrous and heavily criticized Ramos.  Salah recovered faster than expected and participated in the World Cup with the Egyptian national team. Luka Modric’s World Cup performance Luka Modric, a Croatian midfielder, is certainly a symbol of a leader who brought joy to his country and impressed football fans with his outstanding performance in the 2018 World Cup. He led the Croatian national football team to defeat some of the strongest nations, like Argentina and England, all the way to the World Cup final before losing to France. The 33-year-old midfielder also ended a decade of Ronaldo’s and Messi’s reign over the Ballon d’Or. He was the first Croatian to ever win the renowned individual award in football. He has just been chosen Balkan athlete of the year, ahead of tennisman Novak Djokovic and tenniswoman Simona Halep.   Real Madrid’s 12th UEFA Champions League On June 26, Real Madrid made history when it won its third consecutive Champions League trophy in a match against Liverpool. Winning the Champions League final match for the third time in a row had never been accomplished by a club.  By claiming its 12th title, Real Madrid proved once again that it was the number one contender to win the UEFA Champions League trophy, despite its modest performance in La Liga. Cristiano Ronaldo’s transfer to Juventus  Cristiano Ronaldo’s announcement that he would leave Real Madrid right after winning the UEFA Champions League final match on June 26 left Real Madrid’s fans and players in a state of uncertainty. After nine seasons with “Los Blancos,” Ronaldo joined the “Old Lady,” Juventus, on July 10. The 33-year old forward signed for four seasons for €100 million with an estimated salary of €30 million. Suffering from both Zidane’s and Ronaldo’s departures, Real Madrid is now experiencing its worst performance in La Liga history with five defeats and two draws out of 16 matches.

Rabat – Referring to the murder of two young Scandinavian women in Imlil, Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that some isolated criminal or terrorist events do not have an impact on Morocco’s security and stability due to the efforts of various national security services. The security services dismantled about 20 terrorist networks this year, which demonstrates the security efforts to protect the country and avoid terrible outcomes, El Othmani stated at Thursday government council on December 27. Ensuring Morocco’s security, according to El Othmani, is “the responsibility of all citizens, civil society, intellectuals, media, government agencies. All Moroccan people have showed their rejection and condemnation of the terror attack, which reflects the Moroccan people’s solidarity and unity.” When it comes to facilitating communication between government institutions and the public, El Othmani commended the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) for sharing their annual review and achievements this year.  The prime minister urged other government bodies to strengthen communication and share information with the public and media for more transparency. Commenting on the government’s achievements for 2018, El Othmani said they were characterized by “great dynamism” and that his government launched many major projects and made “significant achievements, despite many challenges and problems.” El Othmani mentioned the success of the national contest to recruit 200 disabled people in public service jobs in 2019, which was organized for the first time in Morocco last week. The head of government also stressed the improvement of Morocco’s “overall economic indicators in a regional and international environment marked by many economic and social fluctuations and problems.” He added that Morocco will have received 41 percent more foreign investments this year than last year.

Rabat – Essebsi met with Latifa Akharbach at the end of her mission as Morocco’s ambassador to Tunisia on Tuesday. During the meeting, the Tunisian president commended King Mohammed VI’s efforts, saying that the monarch’s leadership and foresight “makes it possible to consolidate Morocco’s achievement in terms of economic development and political stability.” During the meeting, Essebsi also recalled the “great convergence between his country and Morocco, each with its own specific institutions and history, particularly in terms of adherence to democratic values and the choice of a model of an open and modern society.” He also conveyed his best wishes and regards to the King. Essebsi received Akharbach because she will leave the Moroccan mission in Tunisia after King Mohammed VI appointed her as the new president of the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) earlier this month. Morocco and Tunisia maintain good diplomatic ties. In November, Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs Khemaies Jhinaoui welcomed Morocco’s dialogue offer proposed by King Mohammed VI to Algeria.  He said that Morocco’s initiative is one of the proposals which may “contribute to the operationalization” of Maghreb relations at the bilateral and regional levels, “in order to turn the old page” of regional conflicts between Morocco and Algeria. On November 6, King Mohammed VI offered Algeria a dialogue initiative, condemning the “division” and lack of cooperation between the countries of the Maghreb.

Rabat – King Salman of Saudi Arabia ordered a government reshuffle on Thursday, dismissing and appointing replacements for several officials. In a decree, the Saudi King replaced foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir with Ibrahim al-Assaf.  According to Al Jazeera, the King appointed Turki Al Shabanah as minister of information. The Saudi King also replaced the chairman of the General Sports Authority, Turki Al Sheikh and gave him a post in entertainment. Al Sheikh has had an unfriendly history with Morocco since the bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Al Sheikh expressed anti-Moroccan sentiments several times throughout the campaign, complaining about Morocco’s neutral position on the Gulf crisis between Qatar and the Saudi-led coalition. Al-Sheikh tweeted, “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. In an interview with the Saudi-based sports news platform Arriyadiyah in March, Al-Sheikh said that putting friendship first has been “very detrimental to the Saudis.” He added that what really mattered to him was that “the 2026 World Cup needs to be hosted  in the best conditions.” Later this year, Al-Sheikh seemed to have made an about-face when he tweeted his full support for Morocco to host the Africa Cup of Nations next year. The Confederation of African Football announced that Cameroon, the original host, was not ready for the tournament and invited bids from other African countries. After the government reshuffle, Al Sheikh expressed gratitude to King Salman and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for their “confidence to appoint me as a president to General Authority for Entertainment,” he tweeted. أشكر مولاي خادم الحرمين وسيدي ومولاي ولي العهد على الثقة في تعييني رئيس لهيئة الترفية … تجربة جديدة يارب وفقني لخدمة ولاة امري واخواني وخواتي الشعب العظيم 👍🏻🇸🇦♥️ — تركي آل الشيخ (@Turki_alalshikh) December 27, 2018  Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal has replaced al-Sheikh. The Saudi King also appointed Abdullah bin Bandar bin Abdul Aziz as the minister of the national guard. King Salman also named Khaled Al-Harbi as head of the Public Security Directorate, replacing Saudin bin Abdul Aziz Hilal. The reshuffle of the Saudi cabinet comes at a time when Saudi Arabia is under international pressure after the murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.

Rabat – After deciding to close its base in Eindhoven, Ryanair offered its workers to move to bases as far away as in Morocco or Belarus, which many refused to do.

The Irish airline had filed for a mass dismissal of its workforce based in the Netherlands through the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency, the government authority that handles unemployment benefits. 

“The VNV is not surprised by this step from Ryanair. Earlier, the company already indicated that it wants to ‘phase out’ the personnel who oppose a forced transfer abroad,” the Dutch Pilots’ Union (VNV) said in a statement.

The airline previously stated that its employees could relocate to bases abroad but that it would “respect” if they chose to quit rather than to relocate.  Ryanair serves major cities in Morocco like Agadir, Fez, Marrakech, Nador, Oujda, Rabat, and Tangier.

Rabat – On Christmas Day, Madonna published a video on her social media accounts in which she can be heard delivering a speech about the state of women in a patriarchal society.  In her post, Madonna paid homage to late American singer Aretha Franklin and “tribute to all women everywhere.” The singer said: “Women are not really celebrated and honored the way that they should be and hopefully that will change. We’ve struggled through a lot over the centuries.” Madonna condemned the idea that women’s freedom is limited by stereotypes about their their sex and their age. “The way we’re raised to think that women have a lifespan and that at a certain age they have to go away. We must never be limited by age. We must never be limited by gender, by what society expects us to be,” she said. Madonna shared another video showing moments of her visit to Marrakech and dance performances by British-Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj. Next to the video she wrote: “Life Is A Dance ! Thanks to Megan Guwre, Amine Messaoudii, Daniele Sibilli, Marvin Gofin, Hassan Hajjaj Sadek El Bahjaoui.” An Excerpt from My Birthday Speech in Morocco 🙏🏼 The Day Aretha Franklin died…….A tribute to All Women Everywhere who will not be limited by the crumbs The Patriarchy has left for us.

Rabat – A documentary titled “Vie Cotoyant la Mort” (Life rubbing shoulders with death) won a prize on Sunday, December 23, at the closing ceremony of Laayoune’s fourth Festival of Sahrawi-Hassani Culture, History and Environment. The 90-minute film by Moroccan director Lahcen Majid follows the story of six Moroccans, five men and one woman, who recounted the suffering they experienced at the hands of Polisario separatists in the Tindouf camps in the Algerian desert, and how they managed to escape. The documentary is based on testimonies from the six former detainees who say they were constantly afraid and tortured.  Another film in the festival, titled “Bienvenue en enfer,” (Welcome to hell) by filmmaker Farid Regragui explores the dark struggles of Sahrawi and Moroccan detainees in the 1970s and 1980s. The Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps were reportedly forced to perform hard labor and deprived of basic human rights. Failing to escape the Polisario in Tindouf because of Algeria’s preventing them from returning, the Sahrawi population has been living in misery for decades.  The pain of the detainees also touches their families. Some Sahrawis have reported that their family members went missing or were “abducted.” The two films sought to expose Polisario’s abuses to the international community, to depict the victims’ suffering, and to “make their voices heard.” Omar Khammar, the president of the Association of Moroccan Critics, said that although filming in the Sahara is not conducive to creating a great movie, a good filmmaker is “a cultured one.”  Khammar invites “young artists who strive to make films about the culture and history of the Sahara to start small” and watch short films first about the Sahara.  The festival was organized by the Moroccan Cinema Center (CCM) in partnership with the prefecture of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region and the audio-visual and cinema center in Laayoune in Morocco’s southern provinces. Of 15 participating films, seven made it to the finals, including the grand prize winner. Other featured screenings were: “Tales of Water and Sand” by Ali Tahiri, “Handicrafts in Morocco” by Kouider Bennani, “Echoes of the Sahara” by Rachid Kasmi, “The Pleasure of the World is in its Misery” by Malika Maalainine, and “The Prehistoric Sahara Man” by Rachid Zaki.

Rabat – Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), asserted that the country’s macroeconomic risks are staying generally moderate. “In an uncertain international environment marked by persisting trade and geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism, Brexit concerns, and market volatility, macroeconomic risks remain generally moderate,” BAM said in a statement on Monday.  Macroeconomic risk, according to the Global Risk Institute, deals with “identifying trends, political influences and market volatility that may predict the impact these may have on financial markets and the economy.” BAM issued the statement after the eighth meeting of the Coordination and Systemic Risk Monitoring Committee (CSRMC), on Tuesday in Rabat. The committee, which analyzed the risk mapping of the Moroccan financial system, stated that the current account deficit regarding external accounts is expected to gradually shrink over the forecast horizon, after widening to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2018, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Morocco’s net international reserves, according to the BAM’s statement, would continue to provide more than five months’ worth of imports of goods and services. According to the Global Risk Institute, “There are a few different types of Macroeconomic Risk that affect the financial sector from economic risks that affect stocks, economic and political risks that affect governments including unemployment, inflation, prices, export/import, and market factors that can influence investment, assets and company evaluations.” The committee expects Morocco’s economic growth to have slowed down to 3.3 percent for 2018 compared to 4.1 percent in 2017. This is mainly due to the deceleration in agricultural value-added production and the slow recovery of non-agricultural activities, “which have not yet reached their pre-crisis growth levels.” Concerning public finances, the budget deficit is expected to have widened to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2018 and continue, according to BAM’s forecasts, to remain at that level in the medium term.

Rabat – Algeria hosted the first African Games of Sport and Work December 20-23 after Senegal withdrew from hosting the event. Some sportsmen of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) participated in the event. Pro-Polisario media covered the event, saying, “Sahrawi sportsmen made excellent and unprecedented results in the African games organized by the African Organization of Sports and Labor [OSTA].” The sportsmen “won medals and gold, silver, and bronze cups,” and ranked second after Algeria. In addition to Algeria, only six countries participated in the event: Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Senegal, Cameroon, Tunisia, the Congo, and Eritrea. While the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and other internationally-renowned sports organizations do not recognize the Polisario Front, some Sahrawi media claimed SADR has “entered African records for the first time in its history.” The statement referred to one player winning a medal gold in a table tennis tournament. OSTA was established in 2001 in Gambia and has its headquarters in Yaounde, Cameroon. OSTA’s main role is to organize and lead labor sport in Africa, while promoting the creation and entertainment of national labor federations and groups. Although Algeria has always denied supporting the Polisario Front, by hosting SADR in the sport event, Algeria confirms its support for the front. However, Algeria has declined to take a role in the UN-led  political process to find a mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria claims it is an observer to the conflict, while Morocco is firm that the Algerian government should negotiate as a main party to the conflict and not only as an observer or a neighboring country.  Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel represented Algerian President Bouteflika’s cabinet at the UN’s Geneva roundtable on Western Sahara earlier this month at the request of the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, who called on all parties to show willingness to finding a political solution to the conflict.

Rabat – Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba is expected to give a speech to the Gabonese nation on New Year’s Day from Rabat, AFP learned on Wednesday from a source close to Ali Bongo’s entourage.  Bongo has been in Rabat since November 29 recovering from a stroke. It will be Bongo’s first speech since he was hospitalized in Saudi Arabia on October 24 after a stroke.  Bongo spent a month in a hospital in Riyadh before transferring to Rabat. He was first cared for in Rabat’s military hospital, and then moved to a private residence where he is still recovering. Bongo’s extended absence has caused considerable uncertainty in Gabon. Three opposition parties called for Gabon to send an independent medical team to Rabat to determine whether Bongo can continue to perform his presidential duties. A presidential source told AFP that the 59-year-old president is following from Rabat “all the important files of the country.” King Mohammed VI visited Bongo while he was in Rabat’s military hospital and expressed his wishes for a speedy recovery. If Gabon determines Bongo does not have the physical and intellectual ability to perform his duties, the president of the Senate, Lucie Milebou Mboussou, would act as interim president until a presidential election which would be called within a maximum period of 60 days. The Gabonese vice president, Pierre Claver Maganga Moussavou, acknowledged in early December that Ali Bongo had suffered a stroke, according to AFP.

Rabat – The House of Representatives in Parliament passed  Law 44.18 on mandatory military service at a plenary session on Wednesday. The delegate minister in charge of the National Defense Administration, Abdellatif Loudiyi, introduced the bill, which aims to “promote the spirit of sacrifice and self denial,” according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The official welcomed the support of the members of the House’s Committee on Justice, Legislation, and Human Rights while it was reviewing the draft law. Loudiyi said that the amendments the commission presented enriched the law and ensured a consensus on the draft. Loudyi, however, did not give further details about the amendments.  On Monday, the justice and legislation committee examined the draft bill on compulsory military service. One amendment the committee proposed would make military service obligatory before getting a job in the public service. The amendments, introduced by the coalition and opposition parliamentary groups within the committee, propose that citizens wanting to get public service jobs must have a document certifying that they completed 12 months of military service, reported Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. However, the House of Representatives rejected the amendment. Conscripts have the right to apply for a public service job before completing the 12-month military service. Bill was drafted ‘constitutionally’ The reintroduction of mandatory military service, according to Loudiyi, comes under the King’s instructions and is in line with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution, which states that all citizens should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. The official added that the bill was drafted in accordance with constitutional principles, in the context of a correlation between the rights and duties of citizenship. According to Loudyi, the government will launch an information and communication campaign to explain the bill’s objectives. Both men and women aged 19 to 25 would be subject to a 12-month military service if Parliament passes the bill. However, people over the age of 25 who were eligible for an exemption can still be called up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant. The bill grants exemptions for illness and married individuals. Men who are supporting their families financially will also be exempted. Moroccans expressed concerns that the bill would not be equally applied when the government announced its intention to introduce the military service again in August. Some Moroccans said that all young people, including those of wealthy families, should be subject to the law. In November, Loudiyi reportedly said that compulsory military service would cost Morocco MAD 500 million. Loudiyi said that 10,000 young people are expected to begin service in the military each year beginning in September 2019.

Rabat – Three Guinean students have died in a car accident in Rabat, creating a climate of sadness in a community that was preparing to celebrate New Year’s eve together. The accident occurred Wednesday morning around 4 a.m. as the students returned from a concert where a Guinean pop music group was scheduled to perform, friends of the students told Morocco World News. According to friends and relatives, the car rolled, and the driver could not stabilize the vehicle. Bintou Toure, Souleymane Fofana, and Amadou Bah were all students in Rabat.  Aseguim, the organization of Guinean students in Morocco, and CESAM, the organization of sub-Saharan students, have paid tribute to the three students.  Friends described Toure as a “devout and reliable element of the community who will be greatly missed.” “Bintou Toure was a very active and sympathetic member of the community. She compelled friendship because she was so open and caring,” one close friend said. Toure had recently finished her undergraduate studies and was waiting for both her diploma and an acceptance letter from a Masters program for which she had applied. Fofana and Bah were both pursuing undergraduate studies. The president of Aseguim, Abdoulaye Barry, told Morocco World News that the tragic event comes as a terrible shock for the community of Guinean students. He explained there were five Guinean students involved in the car accident.  As the rear of the car was most impacted, the three who died were sitting in the back row, while the male in the driver’s seat and a female in the passenger seat survived the accident. The driver fled the scene for unknown reasons and has not been seen since, according to friends. People are searching for him. The Guinean embassy in Rabat has suggested that all three bodies be repatriated to Guinea, but no decision has been made.  “The girl’s body will be repatriated. But the boys have sizable family in Morocco and they have decided that the bodies will be buried here,” Barry said. The Guinean community is organizing a religious ceremony to pay tribute to the students’ memories. The ceremony will take place tomorrow after Friday prayers at the Guinean embassy in Rabat.

Bolton, who held an official public meeting involving dozens of diplomats, particularly from Africa, unveiled President Donald Trump’s strategy for Africa. The US official is uninformed about, or rather indifferent to, North African politics, except for what he reads in the reports of the secretary of the treasury, arms dealers, or oil and gas companies. The Western Sahara conflict matters to Moroccans. That is why we have to pay lobbyists, diplomats, and arms dealers.
 
First of all, there is a direct link between John Bolton and the Sahara: The United Nations Security Council experienced a decisive turning point a few days after his appointment as national security advisor in March.

The council decided in April to reduce MINURSO’s mandate from one year to six months. The fact that Trump chose Bolton for the job was significant, and reducing the mandate was not a tactical move. 

Besides the US’s strong position against Morocco’s and France’s proposal to renew MINURSO’s mandate for a full year, we followed the speech of the US representative at the Security Council in late October, where he promised that the US would closely follow the progress of the issue.

The US will focus on Africa to counter Chinese and Russian influence, moving beyond the traditional influence of its European allies.

Like many European missionaries who paved the way for the colonization of Africa more than two centuries ago, Bolton promised Africans prosperity, development, and “liberation” from the corruption and domination that China and Russia are “spreading.” We are practically looking at a new Marshall plan for Africa; the Europe plan has reached its full extent. Washington promises to end its absence from Africa and transform the continent into an open space in the liberal sense, ending political conflicts and imposing a minimum of democracy and freedoms—out of necessity, not virtue.

Does it mean we are in trouble?

Not quite. Despite the disadvantages that these changes can bring, Morocco’s long-established monarchy was smart. Morocco re-joined the African Union two years ago, taking back its place in the continent.

Morocco, despite all the disruptions and setbacks it has experienced in recent years, has resisted the wave of counter-revolutions in the Arab region. It kept prominent Islamists in their positions in the government and took a special stance on the Qatar Gulf crisis.

However, the situation is very serious. The US quick-fix approach in our region may not care much about our sovereign and historical rights. But there is a silver lining.

After years of setting the stage for new sources of growth and expansion for US companies in Africa, now South Africa, the Congo, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and ECOWAS countries are available platforms for the next Marshall plan.

The only exception is the Maghreb Arab Union (UMA). If international powers are forcing integration on the UMA, the union should not depend on foreign intervention to come together.

Morocco has a stable political system, and its people grew politically aware as it pushed for more freedom and moralization in recent years. This country is able to continue its regional and international rise, provided it breaks with statism, exclusion and monopoly in politics, the economy or the media.

Rabat – Spanish maritime services have rescued a Moroccan minor who was “hidden as a stowaway” in a hole on the side of the Miramar Express ferry for the mooring line. The ferry operates between Nador in northern Morocco and the Spanish town of Motril on the Mediterranean coast in the province of Granada. Authorities took the minor “ashore to carry out the legal procedures.” According to 20 Minutos, the Motril Civil Guard has rescued 524 migrants in December who were trying to reach the Spanish coast. Of those, 498 were sub-Saharan African migrants and 26 were from the Maghreb. To ease the pressure of migration on Spain, Morocco has dismantled a dozen irregular migration networks throughout 2018. More than 1,500 migrants had died in the Mediterranean in 2018 as of August while trying to reach Europe, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The number has undoubtedly increased in the past few months. In September, a video went viral of a young Moroccan trying to get to Spain by crossing the Mediterranean Sea on a tube. The minor was paddling just with his hands before he was saved by a Spanish fishing boat.

Rabat – Algeria has deported dozens of Syrian refugees to Niger, saying they entered the country irregularly, reported Syria TV on Wednesday. Quoting a source, Syria TV said Algeria deported about 50 Syrians, including women and children, to Niger. The source added that the migrants had been stranded for 85 days due to their irregular status before they were deported. The source also expressed fear that Niger might deport the migrants back to Syria, a conflict zone since 2011.  Several Syrian activists condemned Algeria’s move. The Syrian president of the Syrian Center of Studies and Legal Research, Anwar Al Bounni, wrote on his Facebook in November that dozens of fleeing Syrians “are stuck in an Arab country, Algeria.”  Al Bounni said that there was a “tendency to return them back to criminal,” referring to Syrian President Bashar Al Assad. He asserted that Algeria’s intention was a “violation of international humanitarian law as Syria is not safe.”  The president of the opposition group Syrian Negotiating Body, Nasr Al Hariri, wrote on his Twitter that his organization had communicated with the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Syrians, who are facing the “deportation danger to Syria.” “Their deportation means death or arrest and revenge,” Al Hariri argued. With the civil war, Syria also become an easy target for terrorist groups, including ISIS. Earlier this year, international NGOs accused Algeria of abandoning migrants in the Sahara desert. In June, the Globe and Mail reported that Algeria had abandoned 13,000 migrants in the previous 14 months, including women and children, without food and water. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump ordered troops to withdraw from Syria, saying that the US had defeated ISIS. “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” Trump tweeted. In contrast, the Moroccan government believes that ISIS still poses a threat to every country. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) head, Abdelhak Khiame, said, “No one should say that the ISIS threat has ended.”  He added that the war against ISIS will take a long time.

The concert will be open to all fans free of charge starting at 5 p.m. on Friday, December 28..  “Morocco is in my heart as a second home. I have always loved performing before Moroccan fans who have supported me incessantly,” Maitre Gims said in a communique. The rapper will sing some of his most successful hits from his 2018 album “Ceinture Noir” (Black Belt). “For the concert to be free of charge is a great initiative so that everybody have a great time. It’s something I can do over and over, be it here in Morocco or elsewhere,” the artist told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) last year.  The show will also feature the Marrakchi band Fnaire, Meknassi band H-Kayne, the Cravata band, and Manal. A limited number of VIP seats will be available with “cocktail access” for MAD 990. The concert was organized by the NB2 Events agency.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump has tweeted that Saudi Arabia “agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States.” “See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!,” Trump wrote on Monday without adding any more details. Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018  Responding to the tweet, an official at the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., told American news outlet CNBC that the kingdom had not made any new financial pledge to “rebuild Syria” since August. Saudi Arabia donates millions of dollars to support Syria. “The Kingdom is a major contributor to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, flying the second highest number of sorties against ISIS in Syria, as well as, donating millions of dollars for relief efforts there,” the official said. According to Syrian President Bashar Assad, Syria needs $250 billion to $400 billion to be rebuilt, said the Russian state-owned agency Tass News. Meanwhile, in an earlier controversial tweet, Trump had announced the withdrawal of 2,000 to 3,000 US troops from Syria, declaring that the US has defeated ISIS.

Rabat – Spain has once again denied citizenship to a Moroccan resident for “fundamental institutional and cultural ignorance,” and for only maintaining relationships with people from his own culture. The man was born in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta bordering northern Morocco and lived for 13 years in Spain. The Spanish Chamber for Contentions at the Spanish National Court reasoned that the Moroccan man, who lives with his wife and children, “does not have sufficient knowledge of the rights and duties of the Spanish people,” reported Spanish outlet El Faro de Ceuta on Tuesday. The appellant “is not sufficiently integrated into Spanish society, does not know with rigor the rights and duties of Spaniards and everything related to the essential structure of the Nation,” the court said, according to the outlet.  It is not the first time Spain has refused to grant citizenship to a Moroccan for similar reasons.  In August, the National Court’s Chamber said that it did not give citizenship to a Moroccan resident because he did not know the president of Catalonia or the typical dance of the region.

Rabat – An official source at the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed to Moroccan media that the woman who died in yesterday’s shooting and suicide bombing was a Libyan national.  On Tuesday morning, armed suicide attackers stormed the headquarters of the Libyan foreign ministry in Tripoli, killing three people and injuring ten others. ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, confirming the suspicions of Libyan authorities. The spokesman of the Libyan special forces, Tarak al-Dawass, had accused ISIS following the attack. The attackers used guns and bombs. According to Libyan authorities, a car bomb exploded near the building before two armed suicide bombers opened fire on people.  The ministry’s guards killed a third attacker. During a press conference on Tuesday after the attack, the special representative of the UN Secretary-General in Libya said: “Terrorism will not triumph over the Libyans’ decision to move forward towards building their state and renouncing violence. We will not accept any attack on a state institution, especially one committed by a terrorist group,” reported the Libyan Express. ISIS has been responsible for a series of attacks in the country which, since 2011, has been torn by power struggles and become prey to jihadists. The recent ISIS attacks include one on the Libyan National Oil Corporation headquarters in Tripoli in September.

Rabat – In addition to the Viktors Farmor Marketing and Spies travel agency, which confirmed that they will be sending more tourists to Morocco, another Danish travel agency has asserted that Morocco’s attractive destinations will remain a favorite for some Danish tourists. In an interview with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the director of operations at Marokko Eksperten Danish travel agency, Suzanne Bash, said that the “cursor is still in good shape in Marrakech.” Some people predicted that tourism, which plays an important role in Morocco’s GDP, will be negatively affected by the double murder of the Danish and Norwegian tourists near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. Danish news agencies, however, have reported that Danish tourists will not stop visiting Morocco after the murders. Bash told MAP, “Naturally, we were shaken like everyone else by the horrible murder of Imlil.” She said that once the shock is over, Marrakech will remain a favorite destination for tourists. The bodies of Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian tourist Maren Ueland were found on Monday, December 17. Bash said that for her and other colleagues, it was a “black Monday, especially since it was a peaceful place that my colleagues and I had visited on several occasions,” referring to Imlil, a tourism destination near Mount Toubkal. She said that “with our local partners, the trekking guides and the authorities, we managed to overcome the shock.” Created in 2014, the agency has two offices in Morocco. Bash explained that it is planning to open a third in the northern region. She added that Marokko Eksperten will maintain Marrakech as a “flagship destination, while opening in the northern region of the kingdom, including Tangier, Tetouan, and Chefchaouen.” The director said that after speaking with some of the agency’s departing customers, many of them decided to go to Imlil, “although some preferred to spend their nights elsewhere, not because of any concern for their safety, but rather because of the general emotion that prevails in the region after the abject crime.” She said that professionals in the sector have been “deeply touched by the marks of compassion and sympathy that Moroccans have shown throughout this hardship, especially on social networks.” The travel professional said that Morocco’s attractiveness has not stop growing over the last few decades with tourists, owing to the proximity and the beauty of the country and its climate. According to Bash, in Morocco tourists can experience “the vast expanses of desert, majestic mountains, sandy beaches stretching as far as the eye can see, or hikes through the winding alleys of the medinas and mountains and imperial cities.”

Rabat – Video footage taken by Spanish Civil Guard agents shows their dramatic chase of a go-fast boat with four alleged drug traffickers on board. Spanish law enforcement had to use a helicopter and two other boats to continue the pursuit, which came to an end in Costa Del Sol, southern Spain. Spanish authorities arrested two Moroccans and a Spaniard, all in their thirties. The driver of the boat, however, managed to escape. The four individuals are believed to be members of a drug trafficking network that smuggles cannabis from Morocco to Malaga.

Rabat –Borussia Dortmund’s Achraf Hakimi has responded to a young Moroccan boy who made himself an Achraf Hakimi jersey out of plastic in honor of his idol. On his official Facebook, the Atlas Lion called on the family of the boy to contact him. The Moroccan boy’s family shared a picture on Facebook and asked others to share it widely, hoping to reach Hakimi or Dortmund officials. The move imitated that of a young Afghan, named Murtaza, who became famous for making a plastic jersey of Argentina’s Lionel Messi. In 2016, a picture of Murtaza wearing his homemade creation put him in danger from the Taliban and forced his family to flee to Pakistan. On December 13, the young Murtaza had the chance to meet the Argentinian phenomenon, Lionel Messi. The meeting came before FC Barcelona’s friendly match against the Egyptian club, Al Ahly, in Doha.

Rabat – German immigration officers detained Moroccan MPs travelling to Poland to attend COP24.  The Frankfurt airport authorities said the MPs did not have a visa.

The airport officials detained Casablanca’s Mayor Abdelaziz El Omari and MPs Mohamed Moubdii (MP party), Mohamed Salem Benmassoud and Amal Maysara (PJD), Abdelilah El Mouhajiri and Ahmed Touiji (WFP), Ahmed Touimi (PI), and Noureddine Lazrak (RNI) for over five hours at Frankfurt airport.
 Morocco World News (MWN) contacted RNI’s communications officer Jawad Chahbaouy, who was aware of the incident. He gave MWN RNI member Lazrak’s phone number, but he was unreachable.  The Moroccan embassy in Germany called upon Morocco and Germany’s foreign ministries to get the MPs released. The German immigration officers took photographs of the Moroccan MPs before allowing them to leave the country.

A member of the delegation told a Moroccan news outlet that “the MPs “were not aware Germany does not recognize their official passports until German authorities denied access to the airport.”

Rabat – Just two days before Parliament’s final vote, the coalition and opposition parliamentary groups have proposed unexpected modifications to the compulsory military service bill. On Monday, the justice and legislation committee in the House of Representatives examined the draft bill on compulsory military service. The coalition and opposition parliamentary groups within the committee made several amendments to the compulsory military service bill, mainly making military service obligatory before joining the public service. The amendments propose that citizens wanting to get public service jobs must have a document certifying that they completed 12 months of military service, reported daily newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. Naturalized Moroccans who are eligible for military service will have to wait at least 5 years before having access to the obligatory military service, according to the new amendments. In addition, any employee dismissed from the public service is expected to be prevented from participating in military service. According to Moroccan Minister Delegate for the National Defence Administration Abdellatif Loudiyi, 10,000 young people are expected to begin service in the military each year beginning in September 2019. Loudiyi also said that women and Moroccans residing abroad (MREs) could be exempt from the draft. Public dialogue not taken into consideration While the coalition and opposition groups consider their proposals as “important” in complementing the shortcomings of the military service draft bill, they did not take into account disapproval from Moroccan youth. Many Moroccan youth and activists opposed “the legislative speed” which accelerated the ministerial council’s approval of Bill 44.18 “unlike other more important laws that have not been adopted yet.” Ahmed Assid, a well-known Moroccan activist, stressed the need for the government to open public dialogue to discuss all aspects surrounding the mandatory military service. The justice and legislation committee decided to put the bill under review by the Moroccan National Council for Human Rights and the Economic, Social, and Environmental Council as part of a public discussion on the bill. However, the House of Representatives objected to the committee’s decision without providing any explanation, according to Akhbar Al Yaoum. “The decision regarding the military service was taken in advance, and what we see [now] in Parliament are mere formalities that will not affect the essence of the decision,” Ahmed Elhaij, the president of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights, told the daily newspaper. The legislative speed “of the draft bill conveys the message that military issues must remain within” the powers of the head of state, Elhaij explained. Elhaij added that the bill is only being discussed in Parliament to lend it legitimacy. The Moroccan Association for Human Rights, along with other bodies, expressed its position on the bill and called for “its compatibility with international human rights instruments, especially the recognition of the right of citizens to refuse military service for reasons of conscience related to their human or religious convictions,” according to the newspaper. The government, represented by the minister delegate in charge of the National Defense Administration, will decide on the new amendments to be voted on today. On August 20, the Council of Ministers adopted the bill, which sets the age of compulsory military service from 19 to 25 years of age for 12 months.

Rabat – Canada updated its travel advisory for Morocco on December 20, three days after authorities found the bodies of two Scandinavian tourists near  Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains. Canada advised citizens to “exercise a high degree of caution in Morocco due to the threat of terrorism.” “There is a threat of terrorism in Morocco, and attacks have targeted foreigners,” wrote the Canadian government, referring to the case of  Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway. Until last week, Morocco had not been affected by terror attacks since 2011.  The 2018 Global Terrorism Index, published in November, listed Morocco among countries least impacted by terrorism. The Canadian government, however, warned citizens that “terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include government buildings, places of worship, schools, transportation hubs and public areas frequented by foreigners (such as tourist attractions), restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets and hotels (specifically coastal beach resorts).” Moroccan officials and the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, reacted to the murders, saying that every country faces the threat of terrorism. Speaking about Morocco’s international counterterrorism cooperation, Khiame said that every country has terror threats, and therefore, countries should exercise heightened caution. He added that Morocco has the necessary equipment to face terror threats. BCIJ is investigating the crime committed against two tourists as a terror attack. Some local and international news outlets reported that the double murder, which took  place 10 kilometers from Imlil, will affect tourism in Morocco. However, Danish travel agencies confirmed that tourists are still willing to come to Morocco despite the shock over the double murder.  According to the spokesman for the Danish Spies travel agency, Torben Andersen, his company has already sent over 500 travelers and will be sending 50 more Danish tourists to Agadir and Marrakech in the near future.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) issued its annual review of crime statistics and police achievements on Tuesday. Among the most striking differences from 2017 is activity among irregular migration networks. The police arrested 603 organizers of irregular migration networks this year, a sharp increase from 294 organizers in 2017. The operation dismantled 45 networks in 2018, compared to 38 in the previous year. The DGSN has improved the scientific and technical structures for criminal investigations, increasing police operations against crime by 6 percent over the previous year.  The number of people arrested red-handed or on the basis of a search warrant reached 554,202 individuals, while the number of criminal cases totaled 584,516. Police detained 91 percent of those arrested. Violent crimes make up 10 percent of all cases at 56,878 and have a detention rate of 73 percent. Murder and sexual assault cases fell by 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively. DGSN arrested 37,851 individuals this year in property damage cases and dismantled 495 criminal networks related to violent and armed robberies. Concerning cybercrime, the judicial police recorded 1,091 cases compared to 765 cases in 2017, up by 33 percent over the last year. One third of these cases were detected due to the judicial police’s surveillance system. Police recorded 435 victims of online sexual blackmail, including 125 foreigners, resulting in the arrest of 267 suspects. As for the fight against drugs, in collaboration with the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), police seized 1.65 tons of cocaine, over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills (up 43 percent over 2017), 52 tons of cannabis resin, and 693 kilograms of cannabis. Earlier this month, police arrested a truck driver attempting to smuggle 400 bags of hashish (cannabis resin), weighing a total of 10 tons. Police caught the driver in El Jadida, near Casablanca, based on intelligence provided by DGST. In November, Morocco’s DGSN and customs thwarted an attempt to traffic 493,700 ecstasy pills into Morocco through Tanger Med Port. In the field of international security cooperation, DGSN executed 80 international information requests, including 44 letters of request relating to cases of drug smuggling and money laundering. The National Central Bureau (Rabat Interpol) made public 55 international arrest warrants, issued by the Moroccan judicial authorities for wanted persons of various nationalities, resulting in the arrest of 49 individuals. As part of international cooperation to counter foreign terrorists using Mediterranean maritime routes between North Africa and southern Europe, Interpol officials supervised special trainings to help Moroccan officers secure Moroccan seaports against foreign terrorists. The counter-terrorism operation, codenamed “Neptune,” also addressed threats from firearms, drugs, and human traffickers. This year was also marked by Casablanca’s laboratory of the scientific police obtaining the ISO 17025 certification. The award acknowledged DGSN’s effort and motivation to develop scientific and technical police structures. The police technical services carried out 201 ballistic analyses, involving 108 firearms, 924 replicator weapons, and 2,748 rounds of ammunition. The technical services also analyzed 906 handwriting samples on 1,757 documents, such as bonds, bank checks, and identity documents. Police also scrutinized 2,502 bank notes, including 1,562 bills of foreign currency. The Central Laboratory for Digital Trace Analysis handled 584 cases involving the use of mobile phones and 124 computer-related cases. The judicial police laboratory of Casablanca, for its part, received 10,431 cases this year compared to 9,294 cases in the previous year, up 12 percent. Requests for DNA analysis accounted for 81 percent of the cases at 8,410 cases, including those related to fire and explosives (761 cases) and toxicology and drugs (977 cases). This year, DGSN adopted an information management system for the collection of road traffic offences and the rationalization of fixed fines collection. As a result, DGSN recorded over 1.8 million traffic offenses and began infringement proceedings on 573,557 vehicles. DGSN registered 66,343 traffic accidents with bodily injuries, compared to 61,686 accidents in 2017, up 7.5 percent. The recorded accidents caused 964 deaths, 3,748 serious injuries, and 84,048 minor injuries, exceeding the number of deaths and injuries recorded in 2017. As part of its strategy to bring security services closer to citizens and to cover expanding urban areas, the DGSN created 23 new security services, including police districts, police stations, and traffic accident services in some cities, such as Casablanca, Laayoune, Taounate, Sale, Fez, Tantan, Safi, and Rabat. In 2018, the DGSN established a new system of command and coordination rooms for the brigade rescue units in Rabat, Sale, Temara, and Marrakech. The system, which the DGSN aims to generalize in many cities, is still in the experimental stage in Fez and Tangier. The new command rooms received 127,770 calls, leading to 67,542 police interventions. The traditional command rooms using the telecommunication system received approximately 1.7 million telephone calls which led to 678,283 security interventions. In September, DGSN organized open days for the public under the theme “National Security, Citizen Police” in Marrakech. Units conducted 56 simulation exercises, involving cavalry, police dogs, biker brigades, a musical troop, the infantry brigade, and rapid reaction forces. DGSN wanted to be more transparent and to inform the public of the missions of its various security units and corps. The event also aimed to show the country’s advanced equipment While reviewing its activities, the DGSN reaffirms its determination to preserve public order, reinforce the feeling of security, and improve its quality of service.

Rabat – Bus 214 through Camden town is known to Londoners as “the happy bus,” driven by Ahmed Serhani. Serhani, of Moroccan origin, is an inspiring person who brightens his passengers’ day with his ready smile and amiable attitude. Joe Bloom, a painter and filmmaker from London, encountered Serhani’s friendliness at work and started to film the way he exchanged greetings with passengers and easily interacted with them. Bloom, who knew Serhani since he was a young boy, decided to make a six-minute film of the bus driver. Bloom told British media: “I was studying at the Glasgow School of Art when I decided Ahmed would make a great subject for a film. I would get on the bus a lot and always chat with him.” “I’d known him since I was a boy, and when I left university I decided it was time to make him the subject of a film and celebrate the way he brings smiles to the faces of everyone he meets,” he stated.  The six-minute film is named “Ahmed Serhani, A portrait.” It will premier at the London Transport Museum in 2019. In the film, Serhani talks about how much he loves his job. Serhani has worked as a bus driver in London for twelve years. To him, the people who ride with him are not just “customers” or “passengers,” but are his friends and family because they are part of his everyday life. Life is not all “hunky-dory” for Serhani who, like everyone else, has problems to deal with.  But Serhani says his philosophy of life starts with a “smile.” He said, “You have two options; smile and get on with your life, or cry. Whether you smile or cry, the problem is still there. So what option would I choose? Smile, of course.” When Bloom showed the film to Serhani’s family members who still live in Morocco, they were very proud of Ahmed. People who rode with Serhani posted comments on social media like: “He is the nicest person, every time I get on his bus, or see him in passing, I am greeted by his lovely smile; he really brings out the positive energy in everyone, so happy that Joe did this film.” Commenters also thanked Bloom for making the film: “Thank you so much for showing Ahmed the recognition he deserves. I’ve known him since I was little and our family has considered him a long time friend. He always made my day when I got on his bus.”

Rabat – On Christmas Eve, a 35-year-old Moroccan entered an Italian church in Lombardy and shouted “God,” in Arabic during the Gospel reading, causing panic among the church goers. Italian news outlet ANSA reported on Tuesday that the man said some additional sentences in Arabic. Church goers were afraid, according to the news outlet, because he kept a hand hidden behind his back. Church attendees thought the man was armed. ANSA said that people in the church “pushed him” out of the church with the help of the town’s mayor. According to the Italian news outlet, the man was “already known to the police.” Later, authorities took the man in for investigation. ANSA said that the man had left the Lombard village of Maclodio for six months to live in Travagliato, but returned to Maclodio Monday night to get to the church “where the Christmas Mass was being held.”

Rabat – The topic of whether it is “haram” (forbidden in Islam) to celebrate the Gregorian New Year and sell or buy New Year cakes, is now the subject of debates on social media after a photo of a bakery announcing that it will not sell New Year cakes went viral. Many social media users shared Rayhana Bakery’s sign which reads: “There are no New Year pastries.” Internet users criticized the owner of the bakery located in Ait Melloul, near Agadir, and called him an “extremist.” Adding to the controversy, Rayhana Bakery wrote a post on its Facebook page: “We do not celebrate the Christian holidays.”  The bakery’s choice not to sell Christmas and New Year cakes has prompted many Moroccans to shun the owner and call him “backward,” “intolerant,” and even describe him as an extremist who holds “ISIS” beliefs. Responding to the comments, the owner wrote on his Facebook page on Monday, “Due to the harsh attacks which followed my announcing that there will be no pastries at the end of the year, and given the serious accusations by people who called me an ISIS member and humiliated me, I have decided to file complaints against them.” The bakery shop owner pointed out that people who accused him of being an ISIS member have at the same time provoked a sensitive issue that concerns national security. In light of the controversy, many people brought up the subject of what is “haram” and what is not while also addressing the importance of coexistence between religions in Morocco. Some commenters seemed to agree that associating or “trading” with people from other religions, especially Christians and Jews, did not mean “celebrating their religious feasts,” referring to a Qur’anic passage. Commenters also pointed out that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) shared peaceful relations with people from other Abrahamic religions.  Muslims in Morocco have lived peacefully alongside Jews and Christians for years.

Rabat – Algeria, on behalf of the Maghreb countries, will submit a proposal to list couscous in UNESCO’s World Intangible Heritage List next March, said Algeria’s Minister of Culture Azzedine Mihoubi on Tuesday.

Algeria’s prime minister said on Thursday that Morocco was “taking credit for this Maghrebi dish.”  Mihoubi implied that he disagreed with the prime minister’s quibble. “It is unnecessary to say that couscous is a dish shared by all the Maghreb countries. We must protect our heritage, especially if it is shared with our neighbours,” Mihoubi said. 
”The application to list this thousand-year-old and very popular dish in the Maghreb is now being finalized,” said Farid Kherbouche, director of the National Center for Prehistoric, Anthropological, and Historical Research.

Algiers hosted the first International Couscous Festival, called Couscoussi, in May 2018. The festival brought together chefs from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia.

The next annual meeting of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee on the Protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage will take place December 2019 in Colombia. Morocco is taking part in a joint Arab proposal for the date palm and has made another proposal for Moroccan Gnaoua culture that the committee will review. Several Moroccan sites have already earned a place on the World Cultural Heritage List, including the archaeological site of Volubilis; the ksar (Berber castle) of Ait-Ben-Haddou; and the medinas (old cities) of Essaouira , Meknes, Fez, Marrakech, and Tetouan.

Rabat – Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg has urged people to stop downloading and sharing a graphic video that purportedly shows the double murder of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway. In an interview with Norwegian news outlet VG, Solberg said that she hopes that people “will show support and compassion for the victims and their relatives by abstaining from spreading” the video. She added that the video has been posted on her own Facebook page. “We had to remove the video several times from my Facebook page,” she said.  Axl Wilhelm Due, communication adviser at Norway’s criminal investigation service , said that families and friends of the victims have received the video that allegedly shows the murder of one of the women. While condemning the terror attack, Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said last week that people “know the law” and should not share the video. VG also quoted experts who said that sharing the video is “an obvious violation of the Penal Code.” The assistant attorney for Maren Ueland’s family, Ragnar Falck Paulsen said that he warned the family about the video. According to VG, the assistant said, “I told them they should not go on social media or watch television.” “I don’t understand that ordinary people can post such images on Facebook. It is unpleasant and completely incomprehensible.” Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has arrested 18 suspects in connection to the crime. BCIJ chief Abdelhak Khiame commented on the double murder in an interview with AFP, saying that the victims were stabbed, cut in the throat, and decapitated. Khiame added that the suspects did not fit the profiles of terrorists because they were living normal lives. He said that they have a low level of education and simple jobs, like informal small-business merchants. Khiame also acknowledged that the suspects were influenced by the self-styled “emir” of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. On Thursday, December 20, four of the arrested suspects appeared in a video posted online pledging allegiance to al-Baghdadi. Khiame, however, said that the suspects committed the crime without any coordination with ISIS.

Rabat – US Representative for UN Management and Reform Ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet expressed “disappointment” over other countries’ lack of financial contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping operations across the world. Chalet’s statement, published by the United States Mission to the UN on December 22, accused other countries of not caring how peacekeeping missions are financed. “Unfortunately in a deeply dissatisfying and disappointing turn of events, every country decided reform was good and right for the UN, but not for how it is financed,” she said. While the diplomat reaffirmed the US’s support for the UN, she said that the US will not pay more than 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget. “The lack of agreement on a 25 percent ceiling will cause the organization to continue to face a three percent shortfall in its peacekeeping budget as the United States will pay no more than 25 percent of peacekeeping expenses, again a less than ideal outcome,” Chalet said. She added that the US firmly believes no UN member country “should pay more than one-quarter of the organization’s budget.” The US is a key contributor to the UN budget, providing $10 billion annually, according to Bloomberg. The US ambassador said that it is unfair that many countries “receive extraordinary discounts on their peacekeeping assessments,” and called for more “equitable financial burden sharing.” Chalet’s critical statement followed similar comments by Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton, who said Western Sahara and the UN peacekeeping mission MINURSO is one of his “favorite” examples for how missions fail to end conflicts. “From now on, the United States will not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect, assistance without accountability, and relief without reform,” said Bolton at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., on December 13. “Unfortunately, all to often at the United Nations, establishing the peacekeeping force and deploying is the end of creative thinking,” he said, referring to MINURSO and peacekeeping operations. Expressing frustration over the continuous conflict over Western Sahara, Bolton said that although the UN deployed its forces in the region in 1991, it has failed to end the dispute. “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?”

Rabat – The minister of health has announced that the death of an infant at the Orangers Maternity Hospital in Rabat was not caused by “poor vaccine quality.” At the House of Representatives on Monday, Anas Doukkali denied speculations that a new vaccine caused the death of a newborn and sickness in five other babies at the hospital. Based on investigations surrounding the infant’s death, Doukkali confirmed that the maternity hospital uses the same vaccine as all other hospitals in Morocco which have not recorded any “complications.” Doukkali noted that the medical staff at the hospital were quick to react and immediately transfer the infants to the hospital’s intensive care unit. The infants reportedly experienced symptoms such as breathing problems. The health of the five infants is improving, and four have already been discharged, the minister said. The incident, which took place on December 19, has sparked angry reactions from Moroccans on social media who blamed the infant’s death on the “poor quality of the healthcare sector” in Morocco.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – Managers and employees at Danish travel agencies have said that they will continue sending more tourists to Morocco and will follow the instructions provided by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to Politiken, indicated that most Danish tourists have not faced any difficulties while in Morocco.  The Danish news outlet, however, said that the ministry advised travelers to exercise extra caution. The ministry also called on Danish tourists not to hike alone, recommending guides.  Politiken also cited managers of Danish travel agencies, who confirmed that they will keep sending tourists to Morocco. According to Viktors Farmor Marketing Director Esben Gynther, the travel agency offers a package tour for 20 people to Marrakech. The director of the agency, which specializes in cultural and nature travel, said that 19 tourists will join the first group on December 30. He added, “We will stick to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ guidelines and follow travel warnings to assure the safety of our travelers. Meanwhile we’ll keep on providing travel and holiday services to more tourists as usual.” Viktors Farmor aims to provide travel tours and holiday services for over 400 tourists in 2019.  Some of those 400 tourists will head to Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. According to the spokesman for the Danish Spies travel agency, Torben Andersen, his company has already sent over 500 travelers and will be sending 50 more Danish tourists to Agadir and Marrakech in the near future. “Our customers never complained and we will follow the foreign affairs ministry’s guidelines and warnings as we don’t have any guides in Morocco,” Torben Andersen added. Mikkel Hansen, the communication manager for TUI, a German leisure travel group, said that the company has provided travel services for approximately 30 Scandinavian travelers in Morocco, mainly in Agadir. Many people, both Moroccan and foreign, had surmised that the double murder of Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian tourist Maren Ueland would negatively impact future tourism in Morocco. The bodies of the victims were found on Monday, December 17, in an apparent terror attack. The Danish embassy in Rabat has received letters from many Moroccans who expressed solidarity and support for the families of the victims. Denmark’s Ambassador to Morocco Nikolaj Harris has thanked Moroccans for their empathy for Louisa’s and Maren’s families. Norway’s Ambassador to Morocco Merethe Nergaard also expressed gratitude after Moroccans showed solidarity with the victims’ families. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has arrested 18 suspects in the case.  Denmark suspects ISIS was behind the double murder.

Secretary General of Morocco’s Istiqlal Party Nizar Baraka has addressed a letter to  the US national security adviser, John Bolton who said in keynote speech at the Heritage Foundation on December 13 that he was concerned and “frustrated” that the territorial conflict in Western Sahara conflict has still not been resolved. Baraka, who also served as a minister of Finance and Economy, said that  that he shared the same “sense of frustration” expressed by Bolton, “but not for the same reasons.” “For Moroccans, our frustration is deeper as it extends for more than 62 years, because the independence granted to Morocco in March 1956 was a limited independence, so we continued to struggle to complete the territorial integrity of our country, to include our Sahara regions,” Baraka added. The former minister added that Morocco is frustrated to see that the “Moroccan Sahara issue is still stalling in the corridors of the United Nations, despite the historical facts that prove the spiritual, cultural, political and administrative ties that have always connected the inhabitants of the southern provinces to the kingdom of Morocco.” Baraka said that Morocco is “really frustrated” as the international community gives the Polisario Front more worth than deserved regarding the representation of the Sahrawi people. He added that censuses made under the auspices of the UN “confirmed that the vast majority of Sahrawis live in Morocco’s territories.” “The real representatives of the people of the Sahara are the elected [ Saharawis] in the local and regional councils and parliamentarians, who were democratically elected,” he said.  Commenting on Morocco’s autonomy plan, Baraka said that Moroccans are frustrated that the Moroccan initiative which presents a mutually acceptable political  solution has not seen the light 11 years after it was submitted to the United Nations. Baraka also condemned the living conditions in Tindouf camps in Algeria, where thousands of Sahrawis live in “unbearable conditions.” Baraka said that Sahrawis who live in “poverty” in the Tindouf camps are “deprived  of their right to freedom of movement, because despite the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council, UNHCR has not yet been able to conduct a census” of the Sahrawi population living there.  During his address at the Heritage Foundation, Bolton criticized the UN peacekeeping mission for have failing to fulfill their mandates, including the UN mission in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO. “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Bolton said.

Rabat – The Fez Court of Appeals postponed the  trial in front of a crowded room today. The first hearing will take place on February 12, 2019.  The reason given was to allow for the preparation of all the necessary documents for this high-profile trial.

Former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane was present at the Court of Appeals. The Hamieddine case took a new turn when three lawyers filed a complaint on December 20 with the Attorney General at the Court of Cassation against the Minister of State for Human Rights, Mustapha Ramid
 
The three lawyers criticized the minister’s reaction to the indictment of Hamieddine for “complicity in the murder” of student Mohamed “Benaissa” Ait El Jid in 1993.   In a Facebook post, the minister said he was “staggered” when learned about the new charge against Hamieddine.

Abdelali Hamieddine is being prosecuted for “complicity in the murder” under the provisions of articles 128, 392, 393, 393, 394, and 395 of the Criminal Code. Haddioui El Khammar, a friend of Benaissa, provided new evidence that had not been examined during the original trial, according to the investigating judge. Originally, Hamieddine was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment. According to the judge, the testimony justifies further prosecution since the charge is not the same as that of 26 years ago.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Navy rescued 202 irregular migrants, mostly sub-Saharans onboard unsafe boats, in the Mediterranean Sea on December 22 and 23. The migrants included women and children, a military source has said. The source added that five bodies were also found in these boats, adding that the rescued people received the necessary first aid as they were found in bad condition. The migrants were transported to the ports of Nador, Tangier, and Al Hoceima. Morocco has dismantled a dozen irregular migration networks throughout the year.  On December 21, police in Tangier disbanded a human trafficking network. Morocco has become not only a transit country for migrants but also sometimes a final destination. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, has said that Morocco wants African migrants in the country to enjoy civil rights and a good quality of life as much as it wishes for Moroccans abroad to do so. Bourita also emphasized, in the aftermath of the approval of the global compact on migration, that migrants should not be treated as criminals. Earlier this month, the European Union pledged an aid of  €148 million to financially assist Morocco on the migration front. A statement published the European Commission’s website announced that the European body will pledge a further €148 million to financially assist Morocco on the migration front. The statement added that “the additional funding adopted under the EU emergency Trust Fund for Africa will bring the overall migration-related assistance to Morocco to €148 million in 2018. It will help step up the fight against migrant smuggling and trafficking of human beings, including through reinforced integrated border management.”

Rabat – Morocco is considered Japan’s second largest business partner in Africa, after South Africa, with a total of 64 Japanese companies operating in Morocco, said the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Mitsuko Shino, at a press briefing Monday in Rabat. The number, which is five times larger than ten years ago, constitutes 64 percent of the total number of Japanese companies operating in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. The Japanese companies in Morocco are operating in different sectors, including “car industry, optic fiber, travel, medical equipment, and zippers”, and are employing about 40,000 people, according to Mitsuko. Morocco is also an important African destination for “quality infrastructure export.” Concerning tourism, the Japanese official said that the number of Japanese tourists coming to Morocco has increased since 2011, noting that between 32,000 and 35,000 Japanese have visited Morocco every year in the last 7 years. When asked by Morocco World News about whether the recent murder of the two Scandinavian women in Imlil could affect Japanese tourism in Morocco, Mitsuko denied that it would pose a problem. “The incident was quite shocking for Japan,” said Mitsuko. However, the Moroccan “government was successful to arrest the murderers, which is very important for security and makes Morocco different from other vulnerable countries. I think that will less affect tourism.” Morocco and Japan enjoy good trade relations. Morocco’s exports to Japan amounted to $304.7 million in 2017 while the North African country’s import from Japan totaled $248.5 million during the same year. Mitsuko gave the press briefing after Japan’s Foreign Minister Taro Kono met his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita on Monday, as part of an official visit to Morocco on December 24-25. This is the first visit to Morocco by a Japanese foreign minister in 31 years. During the meeting, Kono reaffirmed the positive relationship between Morocco and Japan, “based on political stability and reliability,” which is important for business activities, said Mitsuko. Both ministers agreed to provide a friendlier environment for the business sector, namely investment, and to avoid double taxation, stressing the need to work together more intensively to strengthen business ties. In addition to Morocco, the Japanese Minister will also visit Tunisia and Algeria as part of a trip to the Maghreb countries.  Japan and the three North African countries are developing cooperative relations based on south-south and tripartite cooperation, which seeks to support development on the African continent.

Rabat – In 2017, the financial and nonfinancial corporations contributed MAD 1063.3 billion to the gross domestic product (GDP), an increase by 4.9 percent compared to 2016. According to the High Commission for Planning (HCP), the companies created 43.4 percent of the national wealth, 14.5 percent to the gross national income, 52 percent to national savings. The sector contributed by 56 percent to investments (gross fixed capital formation). The contribution of households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) have generated 29.7 percent of the national wealth, contributed by 62.5 percent to the current gross national income, 29.3 percent of the national savings, and 25.6 percent in investments. The power of household purchasing has increased by 2.3 percent compared to 2017 when it deteriorated by 0.6 percent. The Gross National Income Available (GNI) has, for its part, increased by 4.7 percent  in 2017, reaching MAD 1124.8 billion. The improvement in GNI is due to an “increase in gross disposable income of 6.9 percent for general government, 4.2 percent for households and NPISHs, and 3.2 percent for corporations (financial and non-financial).”  The business sector, which includes financial and nonfinancial corporations, is the largest producer of the national wealth and has showed a slight improvement in terms of  contribution to the national output.  Its contributions improved from 43.1 percent in 2016 to 43.4 percent in 2017. The contribution of households and NPISHs, making up 29.7 percent of GDP,  was up by 0.4 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. Meanwhile, general government remained at 15.4 percent of GDP, decreasing slightly by 0.5 points compared to 2016. According to HCP, the decrease was due to the stagnant wages.   Morocco’s national savings, which currently stand at MAD 306.9 billion, improved by 6.7 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. The national savings stood at MAD 292.7 billion in 2016. Financial and nonfinancial corporations contributed 52 percent to national savings, followed by households and NPISHs with 29.3 percent, and public administrations with 18.7 percent. In the meantime, the country’s  gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) was MAD 302.12 billion in 2017, a decrease by 0.3 percent from 2016. “To cover financial requirements, nonfinancial corporations have always relied on bank loans. The net flow of loans granted to these corporations reached MAD 38.5 billion in 2017,” the report noted. For its part, the general government’s domestic debt has slightly declined with a net flow of MAD 24.4 billion. The nation’s financing requirement stood at MAD 39.6 billion in 2017 and represented 3.7 percent of GDP compared to 4.3 percent in 2016.  The decrease is mainly due to a reduction of  MAD 7.1 billion from the financing needs of the public administrations between 2016 and 2017, and an increase in household and NPISHs’ financing capacity by MAD 1.3 billion. The increase of financing capacity extended to financial corporations by MAD 474 million. Meanwhile, the nonfinancial corporations’ financing needs gew from MAD 53.3 billion in 2016 to MAD 58.5 billion dirhams in 2017.

Rabat – Abdelhak Khiame, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has spoken about his department’s counterterrorism strategy which has overthrown dozens of terror cells and investigated countless suspects since its creation in 2015. Since its creation, BCIJ has dismantled 59 terror cells, 51 of which had ties to ISIS, said El Khiame in an interview with Moroccan television channel 2M. Khiame added that since 2015, the number of terrorist cells in Morocco have decreased, owing to BCIJ’s counter-terrorism branch. Khiame said that his services dismantled 9 cells this year and 8 last year. The BCIJ chief said that 918 people were arrested for terror-related crimes, including 14 women and 29 minors. He noted that 98 percent of the people arrested in terror-related cases are Moroccans. He emphasized that very few women are involved in cases related to terrorism if “we exclude the female cell that was dismantled last year.” Speaking about terror suspects who fought in conflict zones, the official said that of the 183 cells dismantled since 2002, 62 terror cells have been dismantled since 2013. The 62 terror cells all had close links to terrorist groups operating in conflict zones, including ISIS. BCIJ’s head added that 1,666 Moroccan fighters joined the conflict zones in Syria and Iraq. About 929 of this number joined ISIS and about 225 others have a criminal record linked to terrorism. Khiame said that 239 have returned from conflict zones while 643 others were killed in conflict zones. The majority were killed in suicide attacks, including “ISIS wives” and children. He said that returness always impose a threat to the countries that receive them. “The Kingdom of Morocco knows that [returnees] will pose a threat to the security of citizens and its stability. That is why it put in place the counterterrorism strategy in 2015.” End of ISIS in conflict zones? Khiame said that the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East does not mean the end of the war against terrorism. He said that after the air strikes by the counterterrorism coalition in Syria and Iraq, ISIS has moved its terror projects to other places, including southern Libya, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Khiame said that “no one should say that the ISIS threat has ended.” He argued that the war against ISIS will take a long time. He said that social media helps terrorists to spread their ideologies easily.  “Many people adopted this ISIS ideology” and are waiting for an opportunity to wage terror attacks. He said that some of these people use ISIS’s lone wolf strategy, which has occured in several European countries, including Spain. ISIS started using the strategy as its territory in Iraq and Syria shrank. In recent years, ISIS has carried out attacks using knives and vehicle ramming—driving into people deliberately. He said that every country has terror threats, and therefore, countries should exercise heightened caution. He added that Morocco has the necessary equipment to face terror threats. BCIJ is now investigating a possible terror attack committed against two tourists, 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark and 28-year-old Maren Ueland from Norway. The bodies of the two tourists were found on Monday, December 17, near Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains. BCIJ has arrested 18 suspects in connection to the murders of the two Scandinavian tourists. In interview with AFP, Khiame said that the suspects did not fit the profiles of terrorists because they were living normal lives. He said that they have a low level of education and simple jobs, like informal small-business merchants. He added that people who know the suspects were shocked to discover that they were involved in the double murder. He said that the victims were stabbed, cut in throat, and decapitated. The suspects, according to Khiame, were influenced by the self-styled “emir” of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Four suspects appeared in a video posted online on Thursday pledging allegiance to al-Baghdadi. The four suspects were the first four to be arrested for the double murder. The suspects, said Khiame, did not have any specific target but were planning to attack security services or any foreign target in the area. Khiame noted that although they pledged allegiance to ISIS in the video, the four suspects committed the murder without coordination with ISIS. The suspects have no links with terrorists operating in Syria, Iraq, or Libya, he asserted.

Rabat – The story of Ayache Mahdjoubi, a young Algerian man who fell into a 30-meter well, began as a days-long attempt at rescue. Unsuccessful, Algerian civil protection members are now trying to retrieve Mahdjoubi’s body. On Tuesday, December 18, 26-year-old Mahdjoubi fell into a well in the village of Oum Cheml in M’sila province, Algeria. Algerian authorities spent nearly a week trying to save Mahdjoubi. On the sixth day, a civil protection official announced Mahdjoubi, who had stopped responding to rescuers on the fourth day, had died. Both locals and authorities tried to save Mahdjoubi by digging with heavy machinery to no avail. Reportedly, Algerian authorities are still trying to retrieve Mahdjoubi’s body. Algerian citizens have taken to social media to express anger, frustration, and sadness over the authorities’ “disregard” of the young man’s situation and failure save him. To many Algerians, Mahdjoubi’s death has uncovered “reality” in the country, especially because the governor of M’sila province did not react to the incident sooner. The people continue to criticize the governor as Mahdjoubi’s body awaits rescuers to be properly buried.

Rabat – Japan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Kono reiterated in Rabat today his country’s firm position on Western Sahara, saying that Japan does not recognize  the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as a “state.” Commenting on Polisario’s presence at a ministerial preparatory meeting for TICAD VII in October, Kono said that the incident “in no way means that Japan recognizes, implicitly or explicitly,” the group as a state. Kono is currently on an official visit to Morocco. The official made his remark on Japan’s position at a press briefing after his meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Bourita said that Morocco and Japan agreed to reinforce their bilateral ties and to avoid any damage that might  affect the Moroccan-Japanese bonds. Later on Monday, Morocco World News attended a press conference given by  the Spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry Mitsuko gave more clarifications on the country’s position.. She said that the presence of the so-called SADR “was a big problem” that Japan has overcome “to avoid embarrassment.” She added that her country has “ good intentions to settle this issue.” The Japanese official also emphasized the need to preserve the bilateral ties between the two countries from any “element that could weaken” the foundations on which  these ties are based. In October, a Moroccan delegation refused to take part in the 7th ministerial meeting of TICAD due to the presence of Polisario’s members. Commenting on Polisario’s presence in the meeting in October, Taro said that “Even if a group which claims itself as a state which Japan does not recognize was sitting in this room, this fact does not mean that Japan, in any way, implicitly or explicitly recognizes it as a state.”  Kono also  expressed “his deep regrets about the incident and the confusion during the opening session of TICAD ministerial meeting” during talks held with Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita following the controversial incident.

Rabat – Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit strongly denounced the murders of  Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland killed 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in the Atlas Mountains.  Answering questions from parliamentarians at the House of Representatives today, Laftit said that the crime is foreign to Moroccan values and traditions.  “Terrorism is an unacceptable act,” he said, adding that “terrorism has no homeland.” Laftit emphasized that the scourge of terrorism is a global threat that “does not spare any country.” Terrorist challenges, according to the official, are a constant and “ongoing danger” as long as there is an “extremist rhetoric “ that resonates with some people. The minister said that the first step in the counterterrorism fight is “to protect society from the dangers that result from the exploitation of religion for abject ends, far from its tolerance values.”  He also called on all groups and individuals to adopt “a clear discourse of principles and distance themselves from mercantile exploitation of values ​​and virtues.” Laftit said that the murders of the Scandinavian tourists is the outcome of an extremist rhetoric that is against “our culture and values, ​​which are inspired by our holy religion and based on the spirit of tolerance, openness and moderation”. Morocco’s security services arrested 13 suspects involved in the murders of the Scandinavian tourists, whose bodies were found on Monday, December 17. According to the public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeal, one of the suspects was part of a “radicalized” group. Although four arrested suspects appeared in video pledging allegiance to ISIS, security officials said that the suspects acted alone without coordination with ISIS. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) are still, however, investigating the case as a potential terror attack. The minister echoed a statement made by the spokesperson of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN)Boubker  Sabik, who said that the crime was not linked to a large terror organization. Laftit said that the suspects were ideologically motivated to commit the heinous murder on their own with “simple means inspired by the practice of terrorist organizations.” Laftit added that the suspects resorted to this method because of the  “success “ of the authorities to tighten their grip on terror groups and reduce their terrorist capacity.”

Rabat – In “Africa in 2019,” a special edition about what factors are likely to drive continental politics in the coming year, Jeune Afrique, arguably Francophone Africa’s most read and influential magazine, paid particular attention to King Mohammed VI of Morocco’s twenty years of reign. On July 30 of next year, King Mohammed VI will celebrate the 20th anniversary of his ascension to the throne. How has the King fared in his two decades in charge? How has Morocco changed under his auspices and what awaits the North African country in 2019 as it seems to be looking to the future with regional aspirations? There are still daily difficulties, especially a youth with fewer opportunities and seeking to leave the country at all costs, Jeune Afrique said of Morocco’s current social and political states. But for all the persisting difficulties, the article hastened to add, Morocco is now “incomparably more accessible, free, and open.” In what reads like a paean to the King’s policies, the newspaper discredited all the criticism that has come Mohammed VI’s way in recent years. According to Francois Soudan, the newspaper’s editor-in-chief who penned the editorial, the Morocco that critics often portray is starkly different from the Morocco that has emerged under Mohammed VI’s guidance. “None of the catastrophic predictions about Morocco held true,” Soudan wrote. And as Morocco continues to thrive despite some “stubborn” issues, “one is tempted to wonder about what really bothers” the kingdom’s “alarmist critics.” Maybe, the article answered its own wonder, “European commentators have a problem with how attached Moroccans are to the monarchy, as well as to a King who is seen as the commander of all believers.” While “Moroccans feared Hassan II,” they seem to “love his son” as people never protested against his legitimacy or doubted his devotion to the country’s well-being, “even in the hottest moments of recent upheavals.” “Of course there have been upheavals in the two decades. Terrorist strikes, the 20 February uprisings, the Hirak movement in the Rif. But every time, in complete rupture with his father’s style, Mohammed VI reacted at the right time.” In addition to the “professionalism of security forces” in the case of Hirak, Mohammed VI showed that he sympathized with popular demands by “immediately re-launching development and employment-generating projects” for historically marginalized regions. But the 20 years have been no bed of roses. Poor education quality and a deepening lack of employment prospects for young Moroccans are still some of the issues that Mohammed VI’s Morocco has not entirely come to terms with. “The way forward for Morocco’s youth is still long,” the article noted, citing risks of radicalization and related dangers connected to youth issues. But it quickly added a corrective note, saying that the country’s current poor performance on the educational front should not downplay King Mohammed VI’s “passionate efforts” to find a solution to Morocco’s education and youth issues. “One has to be either blind or ill-intentioned to pretend, as do some in Europe, that Morocco has not changed and the transition between the two reigns has not yet taken place. Morocco today is freer and more open than it ever was.”

Rabat – In the vigil held in Marrakech, three representatives of the Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, came together and posed for a hand in hand picture. The three representatives are the Jewish community president in Marrakech, an Imam of a mosque, and the representative of the Christian community in Marrakech. The hand in hand picture has been widely shared on social media, symbolizing coexistence between the three religions.  Moroccans also organized vigils in front of Denmark and Norway embassies on Saturday in Rabat. Participants denounced the ‘heinous’ crime committed against the two innocent Scandinavian tourists and carried banners displaying messages of solidarity.  The banners read “No to terrorism,” and “We are all Danish and Norwegian.” Moroccans from all walks of life denounced death of Maren Ueland and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, who were found dead inside their tent in an isolated mountainous area, 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested the four individuals involved in the murders.  DGSN spokesperson Boubker Sabik said in an interview with Moroccan television channel 2M on Sunday, that the individuals acted on their own without coordination with the terrorist group ISIS.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has emphasized the need to increase information technology or IT in schools across the country. El Othmani made his remarks during a meeting of the steering committee of the “Generalization of Information and Communication Technologies in Education” (GENIE) program. Launched in 2016, the GENIE program is in line with Morocco’s strategy to generalize Information Technology and Communication in Education (ICTE), according to the National Agency for the legalization of communications (ANRT). ANRT added that the program is based on four main components: “Infrastructure, teacher training, digital resources and development of uses.” El Othmani said that increasing IT in Moroccan schools will enable future generations to underpin technological changes, which is, according to El Othmani, a decisive factor in the development process of education. He said that increasing IT education in Moroccan schools requires the enhancement of students’ skills and pedagogical staff in the digital domain. Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), El Othmani emphasized the importance of integrating content and digital resources in education development and updating programs for the next academic year. He said that the government will ensure that all schools are equipped with IT materials by 2021. He recalled that Morocco had made notable steps in the field of new technologies and digitalization. But he acknowledged that the efforts remain insufficient in light of the decline of Morocco in the development index of e-government for the 2018 year. Having attended the meeting, Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that the education sector is inseparable from digilization. He added that in the digital age, Morocco needs to allow students to master digital tools. Amzazi said that the GENIE program enabled the creation and the equipment of some 3,000 computer rooms in schools across Morocco. He added that newly recruited professors will also benefit from IT training. Amzazi said that out of a total of 13,000 schools in Morocco’s rural areas, 7,000 schools connected to the electricity network will be equipped with computer equipment.

Rabat – Morocco is adopting “a multi-dimensional national strategy to fight illegal drugs and is determined to  place civil society in the forefront of this national strategy,” Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said on Saturday in Tetouan, near Tangier. El Khalfi was speaking at the second discussion on “Civil Society and the Drug Scourge: Reality and Stakes,” organized in partnership with the Tetouan Council, the Regional Council of Tetouan, and the University of Abdelmalek Saadi. The attendees of the discussion, which featured 280 associations of civil society and government actors, all recognized civil society’s efforts to fight drugs and addictions and that they should receive sufficient support. During the discussion, El Khalfi asserted that Morocco has international commitments to combat drugs and has been involved in multiple international conventions in the field. El Khalfi said that Morocco’s geographic location makes it the focus of dangerous networks which actively promote various types of drugs. He noted that “Moroccan authorities during a specific operation in the Mediterranean port managed to seize a huge quantity of 40 million psychotropic pills coming from Asia to Africa.” The official pointed out that “the danger of the phenomenon is increasing because these networks developed their methods to produce and promote new, dangerous and cheap pills which quickly destroy young people’s lives.”  The government’s spokesperson revealed some figures related to drug trafficking. According to the public prosecution, 107,000 people were prosecuted in 2017 drug cases, an increase from 36,000 persons per year during the previous decade.  About 25 percent of the prison population of 83,000 people were prosecuted in drug cases. The prison administration has been forced to adopt measures to combat addiction within prisons. El Khalfi said that a primary focus of “the national strategy to combat drugs and fight addiction” is to tighten security and surveillance. He noted that in the first nine months of this year, authorities seized 700 kilograms of hard drugs, 51 tons of cannabis resin, 90 tons of cannabis, and 600,000 psychotropic pills. The year 2017 was exceptional because police seized more than 2,500 kilograms of hard drugs.  The other focus of the national strategy is the Ministry of Health’s efforts to fight drug addiction. Morocco’s rehabilitation centers increased from five centers in 2015 to 12 centers this year. Within two years from now, the country aims to have 20 centers dedicated to rehabilitation, in addition to drug addiction departments in university medical centers, El Khalfi noted. The ministry also has a national program for 2018-2022 to prevent drug addiction.  The minister also said that King Mohammed VI attaches great importance to this program, because he personally inaugurated a number of the rehabilitation centers “in an expression of the collective will of Morocco to confront this phenomenon.” More than 25,000 people have used the centers, and over 6,000 addicts are currently being cured.  On the developmental level, the minister pointed out that satellite images showed that cultivated areas of cannabis decreased by 65 percent from 134,000 hectares in the last 10 years to 47,000 hectares currently. As an alternative to cannabis cultivation, the state allocated over MAD 1 billion for a four-year integrated program to carry out 400 projects for 95 communities in five provinces of the northern Rif region, in partnership with various associations. At the end of his speech, El Khalfi emphasized the need to achieve convergence between the relevant actors in the context of a holistic approach, to effectively fight the scourge of drugs.

Rabat – The French Development Agency (AFD) has granted Morocco a €50 million loan to extend and improve potable water in the northern provinces of Morocco. The National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) signed the agreement with AFD on Friday at a ceremony in the presence of ONEE Director General Abderrahim El Hafidi and AFD Director in Morocco, Mihoub Mezouaghi. The agreement hopes to increase access to safe drinking water in the rural areas of the provinces of Al-Hoceima, Driouch, Nador, and Taounate, ONEE said in a statement Monday. ONEE also hopes the loan will boost production in urban areas, increase storage autonomy in the four provinces, and improve the performance of the drinking water supply. The extension and improvement program will benefit a population of approximately 300,000 inhabitants, nearly half of them in rural areas. It also hopes to promote resilience to climate change mobilize additional  resources. ONEE noted that the new loan confirms the two parties’ will to strengthen their cooperative relationship. Including past loans, the French bank has loaned Morocco €275 million to increase access to drinking water and sanitation. In June, the head of ONEE in the Fez region, Mohammed Berkia, announced that ONEE is undertaking projects to solve the problem of potable water in the northern Rif region and provide supplementary water for laundry and other uses. To increase the water supply in rural areas of the Rif, Berkia said ONEE will invest MAD 330 million to build 13 new dam reservoirs. The projects also include treating seawater and preserving it in a 2,000-cubic-meter tank.

Rabat – A Scottish woman named Alice Morrison who lives in Imlil, 200 meters away from where the murder of Louisa and Maren took place, has delivered a heartfelt speech about Morocco and Moroccans.  Morrison spoke through a microphone in front of many tourists and locals on Saturday, December 22, both in Darija (Moroccan Arabic) and English. “As a foreigner and as a guest among you, I found kind, loyal, and generous people. I found love. I am thankful to be with you, thank you so much,” Morrison started in Darija, before she continued in English. “As everybody else in this community, I was horrified to hear of the death of the two young women, and I am disgusted by the people who perpetrated it,” she stated. “I would like to say as somebody who lives here and who’s met with such kindness and such beauty in this wonderful country, this does not represent in anyway, Morocco or Moroccans.” Morrison described Moroccans as “wonderful people,” saying: They’re peaceful, they’re kind, they’re honorable, and they are so hospitable…. I would like to reiterate that with the Moroccans I am so proud to live here and to find such a wonderful community to be part of.” Morrison shares the same view as many who condemned the heinous murder and said that the criminals do not represent Morocco or Moroccans: “The people who did these kind of crimes have done them also in my country in Britain, in France and in Brussels. It’s the same thing.” Expressing condolences on behalf of all Moroccans, she said: “When this crime happens it happens to the whole community. Our thoughts are with the families of those women and with the women themselves.” Morrison concluded warmly: “On behalf of all those who don’t speak English to those who do, I am so sorry for what’s happened to these girls and to their families. And I hope that in the future we could all live together in peace and in harmony.”   The sit-in in Imlil is one of the many forms of solidarity by Moroccans who condemned the murder. On the same day, crowds of Moroccans, men and women, gathered in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Rabat, carrying banners with messages of solidarity. The banners read “No to terrorism,” and “We are all Danish and Norwegian.” Moroccans placed flowers and lit candles in front of the two Scandinavian embassies. Both Norwegian and Danish ambassadors thanked Moroccans for their support. Ever since the news of the murder emerged on Monday, December 17, Moroccans have displayed various gestures of sympathy with the victims and their families. Many signed a petition calling for the death penalty for the first four arrested suspects. Moroccan security services found the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, by their tent in an isolated area near Imlil. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) arrested 13 suspects involved in the murder. The first four arrested suspects had pledged their allegiance to ISIS.

Rabat – Security authorities at the Ceuta border seized 47,250 psychotropic pills concealed inside a car registered in Spain. According to customs, the driver was a Moroccan national who lives in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. Police took the driver to the Tetouan judicial police to complete an investigation under the supervision of the public prosecutor’s office. In a discussion on Saturday in Tetouan, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi discussed Morocco’s strategy against drugs. El Khalfi said that in 2017, security services seized more than 2,500 kilograms of hard drugs. He added that police seized more than 600,000 psychotropic pills during the first nine months of 2018. El Khalfi also discussed Morocco’s strategy to fight addiction, saying that before 2015, Morocco had only five centers for drug rehabilitation. He said that Morocco now has 12 centers for rehabilitation. He added that Morocco aims to have 20 centers two years from now. The spokesperson explained that Morocco’s geographical location attracts dangerous networks distributing various types of drugs. El Khalfi added that the phenomena has become more serious because drug trafficking networks have developed methods to distribute drugs across the country in schools, using the internet and other means. El Khalfi also shared prosecution statistics, saying the number of drug suspects increased from 36,000 persons per year during the previous decade to 107,000 in 2017.  He said that of Morocco’s 83,000 people in prison, 20 percent are serving drug-related sentences.

Rabat – Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame, the current chair of the African Union, has suggested that Europe’s failed policies and its suspicious engagement with Africa are the drivers of the pile of crises hitting the continent. President Kagame, who recently attended the Euro-Africa summit in Vienna, spoke to Austrian outlet Die Presse on a wide range of Africa-Europe topics.  In the interview, the AU chairperson put particular stress on the need for Europe to engage with Africa on a different level than it currently does.  Until Europe reviews how it engages with and perceives the African continent, the Rwandan president told the Austrian newspaper, European crises, especially the waves of Europe-bound African migrants, will continue to increase. “It is not only a question of population size. It’s about the context in which the population grows,” Kagame said when asked whether Africa’s rapidly growing population is a factor in African youths increasing tendency toward emigration.  Kagame explained: “China has 1.3 billion inhabitants. However, legions of Chinese have not migrated illegally to other countries. Even if the population of Africa didn’t grow, in many places the deprivation would still be so great that people would look for alternatives. Europe has invested billions upon billions of dollars in Africa. Something must have gone wrong.” What has gone wrong, he offered, is that Europe’s investments in Africa have not created any substantive opportunities for the continent. The billions that European companies and governments have invested in Africa in the past have had “a return ticket.” The money left “nothing on the ground in Africa … because it was invested in the wrong place.” But “wrong investments” in Africa is not Europe’s only problem. According to President Kagame, another European problem is the continent’s “stunning hypocrisy” in its dealings with Africa and other “third world” countries. Europe wants to shape the world in its image but hardly practices the values it proposes to the world, he said. Europe is inviting migrants “Europe has a migration problem because it failed to address the issue early. Instead of helping Africa, it further impoverished the continent. Don’t misunderstand me: I am not blaming Europe for the problem of migration. It is a shared problem.  “Africans must ask themselves why there is this chaos with people continuing to flee their homelands. Europe can’t be held responsible for that. But Europeans want to shape others in their own image. They constantly whine that Africa is full of dictators. Which is a way of saying: ‘We are free, Europe is paradise, come!’ That is how Europe has been inviting Africans up to today.” President Kagame is not alone in claiming a European responsibility for the migration crisis. In fact, such a line of reasoning is becoming an established trend in a number of European and African political circles. Many panellists and country delegates at the recent Marrakech-held Global Forum on Migration and Development, as well as at the intergovernmental conference on the Global Compact for Migration, held similar views.* Highlighting Europe’s colonial past with Africa and the perceived neocolonialism prevailing in Euro-African exchanges, many observers and politicians are increasingly proposing a new Euro-Africa partnership to weather the tide of political crises hitting both continents. Andre Flahaut, Belgium’s budget minister, told Morocco World News in November that Europe’s survival will depend on “listening to the south.” Flahaut said that only sincere North-South cooperation and an effective Euro-Africa partnership can help mitigate the crises befalling Europe.  Germany’s Angela Merkel has similarly pleaded with German multinationals to open a new chapter with African countries. Merkel called on German companies to intensify investments in Africa, arguing that the new Euro-African partnership should create employment opportunities and other incentives to decrease the locals’ urge to migrate to Europe.

Rabat – The US Department of State issued a warning in a tweet posted on December 23. The department advised Spain to “exercise heightened caution around areas of vehicle movement, including busses, in the Las Ramblas area of Barcelona during Christmas and New Year’s.” The department noted, “Terrorists attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, and other public areas.” Las Ramblas was targeted by two vehicle-ramming attacks in August 2017. The attack killed 13 people and injured at least 100. #Spain: Exercise heightened caution around areas of vehicle movement, including buses, in the Las Ramblas area of Barcelona during Christmas and New Year’s. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, and other public areas. pic.twitter.com/MPGiZwMwxq — Travel – State Dept (@TravelGov) December 23, 2018  After the US warning, El Pais said that Spanish security services are currently looking for a Moroccan terrorist suspect from Casablanca. The news outlet added that the 30-year-old is “in possession of a bus driver’s license and he had a police record in Spain for insulting a member of the Civil Guard at Malaga airport in 2006.” Prior to the warning, Spanish news outlets, including EFE, reported on the collaboration between Morocco’s security services and Spanish police in the arrest of a Moroccan terror suspect. EFE quoted Spain’s Ministry of the Interior, saying that police arrested a Moroccan suspected of terrorism in Mataro in the province of Barcelona on Friday, December 21. Moroccan authorities, according to the Spanish news outlet, described the 33-year old terror suspect as a “dangerous terrorist who fought in foreign territory.” The statement added that the suspect left Morocco in 2014 to join ISIS. The international community considers Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy a powerful mechanism to combat ISIS fighters.  Morocco was listed among the countries least impacted by terrorism by the 2018 Global Terrorism Index. Morocco ranked 132nd out of 163 in the report, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. Although Morocco had not had a terror attack since April 2011 in Marrakech, its security services are now investigating the murders of two Scandinavian tourists in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains as a possible act of terror. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) made 13 arrests for the crime. The bodies of the tourists were found on Monday, December 17.

Rabat – A survey of sexual preferences revealed that culture, socio-economic status, and religion still carry heavy weight when it comes to dating in Paris. The study, conducted by Cam 4, a dating website, and Ifop, a polling institute, revealed that a majority of Parisians are still reluctant to enter into interracial marriages, despite their overwhelming perception of themselves as open to cultural diversity.  The majority of Parisians prefer to only get sexually involved with people of the same perceived cultural and social background. And while neighborhoods and socio-economic reasons factor in Parisians’ reluctance to go out of their comfort zones in terms of sexual preference, race and religion are the essential markers of Paris’s “sexual ostracism,” according to the study. Interviewing a sample of 2,000 participants aged 18 and above about their preference in terms of both short- and long-term romantic relationships, the study “shed light on the forms of geographic endogamy that affect the formation of couples in Paris.” The study found “that ethnocentrism in Paris’ romantic life gets more poignant when victims are foreigners or of foreign descent.” Women are more sensitive to the social and cultural baggage of their prospective partner, the study found. Among white Parisian women, 57 percent of those surveyed were reluctant to form a relationship with a person from the Maghreb or the broader Orient.  The figure is 44 percent for men. Comparing across genders, the study still found that racial differences carry weight. On average, 51 percent of Parisians are not open to the idea of an “eastern” partner, with differences in religion and culture being the principal obstacles. Of foreigners, people from Southeast Asia gained the most nods from Parisians. But even then, there is still a significant level of reluctance: Only 44 percent said they were okay with having a Southeast Asian partner.  People of sub-Saharan African descent are the least welcome of “foreigners,” the study found. Overall, 57 percent of Parisians said they would not welcome the prospect of a romantic partner from sub-Saharan Africa. The figure again gets higher when gender factors in. Sixty-two percent of female Parisians said they would not go out with a sub-Saharan man. Other significant factors in “the desirability deficit” of minorities included places of residence (chic neighborhoods vs. banlieues), education level, perceived monthly income, and political affiliations. Right-leaning participants were much more reluctant to enter into interracial relationships. But still, said François Kraus, an Ifop analyst who led the study, race, religion, and culture get the upper hand when it comes to deciding on long-term relationships. There is a “socio-cultural consensus” component to the reticence that minorities face in terms of sexual preferences, he argued.  People may perceive themselves as open to diversity, but when it comes to choosing their children’s school or getting into a relationship, they begin to think in terms of “a shared vision of life and society.” As minorities are thought to be from supposedly “inferior cultures,” they bear the brunt of the “social endogamy” that pervades Paris’s dating life. “We identified a number of reasons. First, there is the stark cultural difference between French culture and Maghrebi and sub-Saharan ones…. This shows that religion and culture still play a determining role when it comes to choosing a spouse,” Kraus said.

Rabat – Morocco’s OCP Group has plans to triple its production of fertilizer for other African countries. OCP created an African fertilizer production unit, the“Africa Fertilizer Complex,” to extend its activities beyond Morocco, said Abderrahmane Igourzal, the general manager at OCP’s site in Jorf Lasfar, 120 kilometers south of Casablanca, the Senegalese News Agency (APS) reported. Igourzal was speaking on Saturday at a press conference at the 21st Khouribga African Film Festival, in Khouribga, 110 kilometers southeast of Casablanca. The Africa Fertilizer Complex “produces nearly one million tons [of fertilizer] a year for Africa. But since the demand is higher than supply, other facilities will be created to fill the gap so that we can produce three million tons each year” for African countries, Igourzal asserted. The fertilizer company was launched in 2016 in the Jorf Lasfar industrial zone, employing 380 associates to help develop the continent’s agricultural sector. The Africa Fertilizer Complex has an integrated 62-megawatt thermoelectric plant which helps reduce CO2 emission by over 70 percent, according to OCP. For Igourzal, the new fertilizer production unit does not have only commercial purposes. “The OCP considers that it has the responsibility to share its wealth … for the good of humanity, to help feed the planet” through distributing its fertilizer. Fertilizer is ”essential for boosting agricultural productivity.” According to Igourzal, OCP Group “holds 75 percent of the world’s phosphate reserves. The OCP’s current reserves are so large that it would take 700 years to use them up.” Igourzal continued, “For phosphate, we have almost 50 percent of the world’s market share. For phosphoric acid, we have 47 percent of the market share.” The general manager added that the company produces an estimated 22 percent of the world’s fertilizer by volume. OCP Group is one of the leading exporters and producers of raw phosphate, phosphate-based fertilizers, and phosphoric acid in the world. The company develops precision agriculture techniques to help farmers improve the quality and yield of their crops. The Moroccan company, according to Igourzal, wants to increase its share of the global fertilizer market from 22 to 40 percent by 2028.

Rabat – The spokesperson of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), Boubker Sabik, has commented on the heinous crime committed against two tourists near Mount Toubkal. In a television broadcast, Sabik described the murders of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland as unusual because of the manner of the killings. He added that only one suspect of the first four people arrested has a history of extremism. He was arrested in 2013 for his alleged role in recruiting youth for an extremist organization. Sabik said that the suspects, who did not have formal jobs, all “have a low level of education.”  Moroccan analysts have called on the government to reform the education system for the “marginalized” people in Moroccan society. Although the four suspects appeared pledging allegiance to ISIS Sabik said that the suspects acted alone without coordination with ISIS. Sabik emphasized that when the bodies of Louisa and Maren were found on December 17, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) identified the first suspect through “security information” and data collected at the crime scene within 24 hours. He added that Morocco’s security services were quick to arrest the first suspects to avoid any potential risks for citizens. Morocco arrested the first suspect on Tuesday, December 18. The public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeals said that the suspect was a member of a “radicalized” group. The police arrested three more suspects on December 20. Video still under investigation Sabik also commented on the video which allegedly shows the murder of one of the tourists. The video was posted online two days after the bodies of the two tourists were found 10 kilometers from Imlil, a village in the Atlas Mountains. While Norwegian police said that they had no evidence that the video was not real, Sabik said that Moroccan authorities are still analyzing it. He said that the footage was submitted to a laboratory for analysis.  He said that the video’s “authentication is not an easy thing” to determine. Technicians are still reviewing the video under the supervision of the prosecutor. He emphasized that authorities will reveal the outcome of the investigation on the video. Moroccan fighters with links to ISIS have challenged Morocco’s security branches. The official said that 1,692 Moroccans fought with ISIS. Morocco arrested 242 fighters on their return to Morocco. Returnees typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. In the last three years, Morocco’s BCIJ has dismantled a number of terror cells and helped several countries to arrest suspects with ties to terrorism. Morocco’s strategy makes the North African country safer than many powerful countries, including the US and France.  Morocco ranked 132nd out of 163 in the 2018 terrorism index, which showed the North African country was among the nations least affected by terrorism. Morocco gained nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd.

Rabat – More than 100 undocumented migrants landed in southern Spain by boats from Morocco on Sunday, December 23, except for two babies who were thrown into the sea after they died during the journey. Spanish news agency EFE reported yesterday that a Spanish rescue team rescued 138 migrants who arrived on four boats to the Mediterranean coast of southern Spain from Morocco on Sunday morning. Among the migrants were 23 people were from Maghreb countries, including Morocco. Some 69 migrants, including four women, were aboard the boat on which the babies died. When questioned, the migrants said that no other people had died but the two babies. By November, as many as 631 African migrants had died this year while trying to cross to Spain, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). About 120 migrants from Africa arrived in Spain daily in the same month. IOM has reported that 2,075 people from Africa and the Middle East have drowned in the sea in 2018, whereas 104,506 migrants have arrived by sea in Europe as of November. In the first nine months of 2018, 13 percent of the undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe tried to cross the Mediterranean or Atlantic from Morocco. In the same period, 7,100 Moroccans attempted to cross to Spain, according to official Spanish sources.

Rabat – Morocco has invested significant efforts in both the security and religious fields in order to build its reputation as a peaceful, welcoming, and tolerant country in the otherwise turbulent region of North Africa and the Middle East. Those efforts were consistent and serious, leading ultimately to very positive effects worldwide. According to the Global Peace Index 2018, Morocco ranks among the most peaceful countries in the region, together with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. However, the atrocious act of terror perpetrated a few days ago against two female Scandinavian tourists in the High Atlas Mountains was an unexpected shock that profoundly shook Moroccan and international public opinion. What makes this heinous crime so serious is the way in which it was committed. All terrorist attacks that have hit Morocco in the last two decades were either bombings or suicidal attacks targeting public places, such as hotels and restaurants. The recent brutal murder of the two Scandinavian tourists holds the mark of ISIS and reminds us of the grisly ISIS methods of killing and slaughtering in Syria, Iraq, and Libya. The proactive measures taken by Morocco’s intelligence and security services have made the country impenetrable ever since the inception of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or so it seemed. Does this crime indicate that Morocco has finally been penetrated? Is this terrorist act an indication of more terrorist activity taking place in our country in the coming days? Were the security and religious approaches implemented by the government to fight religious extremism really enough? What measures can be taken next to spare the country from other harsh incidents? The above questions are pressing and should be thoroughly contemplated and addressed before any strategic move in the fight against religious extremism is made in the future. The religious and security approaches that Morocco has relied upon so far were very instrumental and should not be underestimated or belittled. The strategic national policy initiated by King Mohammed VI in the aftermath of the 2003 Casablanca attacks to monitor and manage the religious field through the control of mosques, the training of moderate religious scholars and preachers, and the control of fatwas by appointing the Supreme Scientific Council were all very successful. Moroccan intelligence and security services have also managed, since 2002, to dismantle more than 183 terrorist cells across the country, according to the Central Bureau of Judiciary Investigations (BCIJ). The recent murder of two Scandinavian tourists, however, has raised concerns about Morocco’s counterterrorism approach, which had previously inspired many countries at the regional and international levels. The dismantling of dozens of terrorist cells every year should have been seen as an indicator of the strong existence of the terrorist ideology in Morocco. The successful and decisive intervention of Morocco’s intelligence services before those terrorist cells could translate their ideology into brutality and bloodshed does not change the fact that the mechanisms by which that ideology works and spreads are still operating. Therefore, terrorists and religious extremists could even be around us anywhere on any day, in private and public places, waiting for the right time and the right place to put their radical beliefs into action.  The claim made by one of the arrested suspects in a video declaring his allegiance to ISIS prior to the murder of the Scandinavian tourists should be taken seriously. He said, addressing the leader of ISIS Abu-Bakar Al-Baghdadi: “You should know that only God knows of the exact number of the followers you have in Morocco.”  How can we track down and prevent those followers? What about those who firmly hold the ideology but do not belong to organized terrorist cells? We need to understand that religious extremism is an ideology and the fight against it should be at the intellectual and educational levels first and foremost. Morocco, despite the efforts that have been made, was remarkably lenient with the discourses of hate, intolerance, and bigotry which surface in schools, the media, and public spaces. We have repeatedly seen videos circulating on social media by prominent Wahhabi leaders in Morocco demonizing and threatening intellectuals such as Ahmed Assid, Rachid Aylal, and others by accusing them of heresy. Somehow, those people were never arrested or tried. Perhaps the pressures by Islamic forces (Islamic parties, Islamic groups, conservative civil society, etc.) in the country put the state in a difficult and complicated position. Those conservative forces have always fiercely objected to reforms interpreting them as secular and anti-Islam, starting from the Modawana (family code) in 2003 to the Islamic education school curriculum reform in 2018. The recent terrorist attack near the tranquil and peaceful village of Imlil in the High Atlas Mountains awakens us to the bitter truth that terrorism is a constantly looming threat for Morocco. Thus, a more drastic and comprehensive approach should be implemented with zero tolerance to bigots, extremists, and the advocates of hate and terror in the name of religion. Morocco should address the conditions conducive to the emergence and spread of terrorism by fighting poverty and social disparity in the country. Moreover, strengthening the educational system and building students’ cultural awareness, promoting the culture of peace and coexistence through educational programs and curricula, ensuring humans rights and the rule of law, and promoting the universal values of peace, justice, co-existence, integrity, love, and cross-cultural dialogue would be a few steps in the right direction. May the souls of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland rest in peace, and may peace, love, and prosperity prevail in the world.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested five suspects with alleged ties to terrorism on Monday in several neighborhoods in Tangier, including Al Aouama, Ashande, El Merse, and Al Warda. The suspects are currently in custody for further investigation into their ties with other possible terror suspects. The arrests followed similar operations in several Moroccan cities on Friday.   Friday’s arrests were linked to the murders of the two Scandinavian tourists, killed near Mount Toubkal on Monday. BCIJ made the arrests in several cities across Morocco, including Essaouira; Sidi Bennour, near Casablanca; Marrakech; Tangier; and Chtouka Ait Baha, near Agadir.

By Mohammed Hikal Rabat – The four suspects involved in the murder of the Scandinavian tourists, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland, near Mount Toubkal acted as lone wolves. They had not coordinated with ISIS but were searching for potential targets, as Boubker Sabik, spokesperson of the General Directorate of National Security and Territorial Surveillance (DGSN) told a 2M channel journalist during the “Confidences de Presse” program. One of the suspects, who has a criminal record and has been known to police for his extremist views since 2013, instilled violent jihadist beliefs into the three other suspects, Sabik said. According to the DGSN spokesperson, the suspects had allegedly agreed to commit the crime on December 12. They then went to Imlil in the Atlas Mountains, where they killed Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark and Maren Ueland from Norway on December 17. They had never met the two victims before. The suspects shot the video where they pledged allegiance to ISIS where they were staying, with no prior coordination with any foreign party. Their terror attack could be described as a “lone wolves” job, Sabik indicated. An analysis of the video showing the brutal killing of one of the tourists is underway to determine the authenticity of its content, he said. Boubker Sabik dismissed the news reported earlier this week that two street vendors helped the police locate the suspects and arrest them. He said that the arrest was the result of coordination between the police and intelligence services. Moroccan police found the bodies of Louisa Maren in an isolated area near Imlil, in the Atlas Mountains, on Monday. On Wednesday, Moroccan authorities hinted that the murder of the two Scandinavian women was potentially linked to terrorism. Police arrested the first four suspects in the murder on Tuesday and Thursday. Police later arrested another nine suspects with possible connections to the case. Millions of Moroccans expressed their condemnation of the barbaric act in a country known for its tolerance, hospitality, and openness.

Rabat – Security services at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca have arrested a sub-Saharan passenger with nearly 2 kilograms of cocaine inside her stomach. The passenger was arrested on December 17 when she arrived on board a flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The passenger had 131 capsules of cocaine concealed inside her stomach, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). Police transported the passenger to a hospital to remove the cocaine from her stomach. She is now in custody for further investigation under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office. Earlier this week, Morocco’s BCIJ seized a boat loaded with cocaine in El Jadida, near Casablanca. On December 15, the BCIJ also found a farm in Boujdour, a city in the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, used by a drug network for cocaine trafficking and storage. The operation followed the arrest of seven individuals in possession of one ton of cocaine earlier this month. The criminal network attempted to smuggle cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe.

Rabat – In 2014, Moroccans launched a movement called “Mashi Besmyti” (Not in my name). The campaign, which originated in the UK, aimed to condemn terrorism and ISIS for abusing the name of Islam to justify their acts of terrorism. A video from the Moroccan campaign showed Moroccans speaking in Tamazight, Darija (Moroccan Arabic), English, and French. In the video, participants carry banners which read “Not in my name” in English, Darija, and in Tamazight. One campaigner says, “In Islam, there is honesty, but terrorism has no religion.” Moroccans have shared the video widely on Facebook after the murders of two Scandinavian tourists, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland, killed near Mount Toubkal. Authorities found the tourists’ bodies on Monday with knife wounds to the necks. The government and Moroccan citizens have strongly condemned the act of terror, emphasizing that terrorism has no religion. On Saturday, dozens of Moroccans gathered in front of the embassies of Denmark and Norway in Rabat to condemn the terror attack. The participants of the humanitarian demonstration surrounded the embassies with flowers and candles in memory of Louisa and Maren. In Imlil, people also gathered to condemn the terror attack. Expressing shock and sympathy towards the victims’ families, one local said in fluent English that the incident was unprecedented in a region where tourists come from across the world to “hike by themselves without a guide.” “We are actually disappointed and we feel very sorry for what happened because originally it was not expected. Nobody was expecting that,” the local said about the crime. He also spoke about the hospitality of people in the region. He said that locals ”sometimes invite” tourists to their home to offer them tea and food, without asking them for money.  After the murder “people were shocked and lost,” he said.  Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) are investigating the case as  a terror attack. BCIJ has arrested 13 suspects in connection to the crime. Moroccan officials returned Louisa’s and Maren’s bodies on Friday to diplomats from their home countries.

Rabat – Police in Tangier disrupted a human trafficking network on Friday evening. The network was organizing irregular migration. Police arrested four suspects between the ages of 24 and 44. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the police arrested three Moroccans and a fourth suspect of an unspecified nationality. Police also arrested 22 irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Police placed the defendants in custody while  further investigation is underway. With the supervision of the public prosecutor, possible links with other criminal networks in Morocco and abroad are under investigation. Morocco has dismantled a dozen irregular migration networks throughout the year. The European Union has provided Morocco financial aid while the North African country tries to curb migration to Spain. Morocco has become not only a transit country for migrants but also sometimes a final destination, according to Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Bourita said there are five million Moroccans living abroad, and Morocco wants African migrants in the country to enjoy rights and good quality of life as much as it wishes for Moroccans abroad to do so. Morocco also supported the global compact for migration signed by more than 160 countries in Marrakech earlier in December. The compact promises to ease the pressure on countries that welcome and host refugees. The compact also aims to address humanitarian concerns, human rights issues, and the developmental aspects of international migration. It also seeks to protect the dignity of all migrants, regardless of their status.

Rabat – Spanish news outlets reported on Saturday that the Spanish interior ministry announced the arrest of a Moroccan terror suspect in Mataro, in the province of Barcelona, on Friday. Quoting the ministry’s statement, EFE said that the arrest was carried out through an international arrest warrant and extradition request issued by Morocco. Moroccan authorities described the 33-year-old terror suspect as a “dangerous terrorist who fought in foreign territory.” The statement added that the suspect is an alleged member of ISIS. He left Morocco in 2014 to join ISIS. The statement added that he “would have conducted military practices for the group in order to plan the development of a long-range missile base in Syria.” He entered Spain irregularly in June 2018. The suspect lived in Barcelona. Morocco has several international cooperation agreements with international security services, including the US, Spain, and France. Morocco introduced a new anti-terrorism strategy and the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) in 2015. These initiatives received applause from several international powers, including the US. Morocco was listed among the countries least impacted by terrorism, according to the 2018 Global Terrorism Index. Morocco ranked 132nd out of 163 in the report, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. Morocco had not experienced a terror attack since April 2011 in Marrakech until this week.  However, the BCIJ is now investigating the murders of two Scandinavian tourists in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains as a potential act of terror. The BCIJ initially arrested four suspects for the crime, who appeared pledging allegiance to ISIS in a video posted online on Thursday. The bodies of the tourists were found on Monday, December 17.

Rabat – Morocco’s flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) received its first Boeing 737 Max-8 on Saturday. The delivery of the first 737 Max comes only a week after the company received its first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. The company will receive three more 737 Max 8s and three more 787-9s over the coming months. Quoted by several international media outlets, the CEO and chairman of RAM, Abdelhamid Addou, said, “We are pleased to receive our airline’s first 737 MAX, which will soon be joined by three other airliners from the same family.” Addou said the planes will help expand the company’s “medium-haul portfolio, which forms the backbone of Royal Air Maroc’s fleet.” He added that the company’s “choice of this airplane is in line with our strategy of continuously expanding and modernizing our fleet, and comes just a few days after the announcement of Royal Air Maroc’s invitation to join the most prestigious Oneworld Alliance.” According to Addou, the planes will improve RAM’s position on the continent. The 737 Max is “the latest and more efficient version of the 737 airplane,” according to Boeing. The plane is designed to offer “more direct routes” for passengers, according to Boeing. “The unmatched reliability of the MAX means more 737 flights depart on time with fewer delays. And technological advances plus powerful LEAP-1B engines are helping to redefine the future of efficient and environmentally friendly air travel,” said Boeing. The company added that its Max is the ”fastest-selling airplane in Boeing history,” accumulating nearly “4,700 orders from more than 100 customers worldwide.” The giant airplane company has a joint venture with Morocco Aero-Technical Interconnect Systems (MATIS Aerospace) in Casablanca.

Rabat – The 2018 Gallup Generosity report gave Morocco a score of 26 out of 100, based on data from the Civic Engagement Index of 2017. The report showed Moroccans are some of the least likely to donate to charity in the Middle East and North Africa. Morocco comes behind Tunisia and Mauritania but ahead of Yemen. Only 5 percent of the interviewed people said that they are likely to donate money to charity, putting Morocco among the bottom third of generous countries. The 2018 World’s Most Generous Countries Report shows people who are “most likely to lend a helping hand, whether through volunteerism, charitable donations or kindness to strangers.” The report assessed 146 countries. Topping the list of generous donors, 90 percent of people in Myanmar are likely to be donors. Indonesia and Australia follow Myanmar in generosity. In 2016, Morocco was ranked 123rd most generous out of 140 countries, with a low score of 22 percent, according to Charities Aid Foundation World Giving Index. Morocco has multiple charities, NGOs, and associations. One of them is Care, which was created in 2007 as part of the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), an initiative of King Mohammed VI. INDH seeks to “fight poverty and social exclusion” through training, capacity building, and other projects. King Mohammed VI has been calling on the government to create projects to curb social disparities.  In his last message to the 8th Africities Summit in November, the King said, “Morocco is unfortunately not immune to the problem of homeless children. Failure to recognize this challenge would be tantamount to willful blindness; moreover, it would be unreasonable to underestimate the phenomenon.” The King then said that the time “has come to put issues relating to children at the heart of the public agenda.” In 2017, the World Happiness report said that Morocco is the 84th happiest country in the world. The report made its ranking according to the country’s gross domestic product, life expectancy, health, freedom, generosity, welfare, and perceptions of corruption in government or business.

Rabat – Thomas Reilly, Britain’s ambassador to Morocco, is the latest to join the wave of calls for international solidarity that have followed the heinous murder of two Scandinavian tourists in Morocco. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, from Denmark, and her friend Maren Ueland, from Norway, were found dead Monday by their tent outside of Imlil, a village near Mount Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak and a popular tourist destination. News of the double murder shocked Morocco, a country that has recently been named among the safest travel destinations worldwide. But the shock quickly morphed into fear and anger when investigations discovered that the double murder was politically motivated and terrorism-linked. Taking to Twitter to weigh in on security implications of the Imlil tragedy, Reilly said that while terrorism should be opposed, over-reaction is not an appropriate response. According to the British ambassador, an isolated incident should not serve to lump in terrorists with the majority of “generous and warm” Moroccans. “Murder video authenticated,” the British ambassador tweeted, referring to a video that was widely shared on social media and which Danish and Norwegian intelligence believe to be footage of the Imlil murder. He added: “Terrorism is irreligious. No religion or other excuse justifies it. We will never give into terrorism. We must also not over-react. This appalling act doesn’t change the beauty of Morocco and the warmth kindness and generosity of its people.” The embassies of Norway and Denmark have issued similar messages, highlighting international solidarity as the way forward in combating the threat of terrorism. “I was deeply touched by the warm reactions of Moroccans,” Norway’s ambassador Merethe Nergaard said earlier today in a statement. Nergaard was thanking Moroccans who went in great number to the Norwegian embassy in Rabat armed with candles and flowers to mourn Louisa and Maren. “I am convinced that the friendship between our two nations will survive. The solidarity you have showed us these last days is proof of that.”

Rabat – Three years before she was murdered in Imlil, Norwegian Maren Ueland shared a pro-Muslim video on her Facebook page. The video shows a seemingly Western woman looking suspiciously at a bearded man in an Islamic outfit carrying a bag.  The frightened lady tries to protect her child while looking at the man from across the street, when a couple of police officers are seen rushing out of their car behind the bearded man. Surprisingly, the last scene shows the police apprehending another man, while the bearded guy was giving a hand to a child, to the astonishment and shock of the terrified lady. “Never judge people by their appearance. Dear All Must Share It,” an accompanying comment reads next to the post, which goes back to January 2015. Maren Ueland shared the video on her Facebook account.  Maren’s post has ironically reflected how a peaceful young woman who loved life and defended Islam died at the hands of ruthless criminals who pledged allegiance to ISIS, which claims to be inspired by the teachings of Islam. Moroccan police found the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway in an isolated area near Imlil, in the Atlas Mountains, on Monday, December 17. On Wednesday, Moroccan authorities hinted that the murder of the two Scandinavian women was potentially linked to terrorism. Police arrested four suspects in the murder on Tuesday and Thursday. Shocked by the sad news, millions of Moroccans condemned the murder of the two Scandinavian women and expressed their condolences to and solidarity with the families of the victim. Moroccans’ strong condemnation of the murder and their outpouring of solidarity with the families of the victims elicited the gratitude of the Danish and the Norwegian ambassadors to Morocco. Both expressed their deep gratitude to the Moroccan people for standing up against terrorism and showing empathy to the victims and their families.

Rabat – Holding pictures of the two murdered women, Louisa and Maren, the village’s civil society, tourists, and representatives of the local guides’ office said in chorus that they wanted to pay tribute to the memories of the women and condemn the terror attack that claimed their lives. The people at the sit-in firmly condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to Louisa and Maren’s families and loved ones. Louisa, from Denmark, and Maren, from Norway, were both students at the University of South-Eastern Norway, where they pursued bachelors in outdoor life, culture, and eco-philosophy. They came to Morocco on December 9 for a month-long stay. On December 12, they arrived in Imlil, a village near Mount Toubkal, to make the most of the region’s scenic views. Investigations into the women’s murders have revealed terrorist links. Police have arrested four suspects believed to have committed the killing. On Thursday and Friday, police arrested nine more suspects believed to have links to the four primary perpetrators. Since news emerged of the murder, Moroccans have in great number condemned the crime and express their sympathy. While tourists and locals gathered in Imlil to salute Louisa’s and Maren’s memory, people in Rabat gathered in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies to condemn the heinous terrorist attack.

Rabat – In the wake of the murder of two Scandinavian tourists, Norwegian Ambassador to Rabat, Merethe Nergaard, called on everyone to stick together and not “give in to fear” emphasizing that Morocco and Norway will remain united in fighting extremism and terrorism. In a statement to Morocco’s state-owned agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Saturday, Negaard said that Morocco and Norway worked together following the heinous murder that took the lives of two innocent women. The ambassador recalled the two countries’ collaboration in investigating the murder, expressing gratitude on behalf of her country to Morocco’s security services who were “quick” to arrest the suspects. “We have full confidence in the ability of the Moroccan authorities to complete the investigation, and we highly appreciate their assistance.” Strongly condemning the murders, Nergaard thanked the Moroccan people’s support for and sympathy with the families of the “young, innocent girls who loved to hike in this beautiful country.” “The letters, flowers and messages of condolences and sympathy have deeply touched us. They are a demonstration of the rich values, openness, and hospitality of Moroccan people,” Nergaard said. Nergaard’s words of gratitude followed those of the Danish ambassador to Morocco, Nikolaj Harris, who also thanked Moroccans for their empathy toward the victims’ families and acknowledged the efforts of Moroccan authorities. “Many people put candles and roses in front of the Danish embassy, and I want to personally express how delighted I am by the various kinds of solidarity toward the Danish people during this tough week,” he noted in a statement on Friday. Today, crowds of Moroccans gathered in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies holding banners saying “No to terrorism,” and displaying more solidarity with the victims’ families and friends. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway’s bodies were found with knife wounds 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in the Atlas Mountains on Monday.

Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has since arrested 13 suspects. Denmark suspected ISIS was behind the murder of the Danish and Norwegian women. A video posted on Twitter on Thursday documented four of the suspects pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Morocco’s public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeals said that BCIJ is investigating the case as a terror attack.

 Rabat – Just like many of my fellow citizens, I have experienced real pain in recent days. When I saw the photos and videos of the two young women, who were very lively individuals, I was, like many Moroccans, heartbroken.  For a very short moment, I felt like I knew Maren Ueland and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, so far from me, so far from us, yet so close that a Muslim nation came together to mourn the loss of two foreigners whose blood has been shed on our soil. As I was scrolling down a social network’s news feed, I came across the odious portraits of these cowards—these traitors to our religion, these Grim Reapers, these lowlifes—who attacked their easy prey, alone and half their number, at night. The contrast between the two victims’ photos and those of their attackers is, of course, striking. The images of Maren and Louisa portray happiness, optimism, and life.  The photos of the criminals, from the same generation as their victims, evoke hatred, darkness, and death. Two opposite yet parallel life trajectories unfortunately crossed paths for a macabre meeting in a remote and isolated place in the Atlas Mountains. Terrorism has no identity. It has no face, no color, no smell, no nationality, no religion. It is the most vicious manifestation of human cowardice.  Terrorism is rooted in economic and social exclusion. The cult of ignorance is its catalyst, as opposed to our religion, which fosters knowledge and Ijtihad (studiousness). The seed of terror grows in the fertile soil of frustration and poor education.

In Morocco, perhaps more than in any other Muslim country, hate speech, “othering”, and religious fanaticism are not part of our identity. Since the 1980s, we have been exposed to a rigid discourse, with which a tiny minority of Moroccans has chosen to identify.  It is true that the authors of the Imlil tragedy are Moroccans, but their modus operandi is not, and neither is their value system. Their “allegiance” to ISIS is the evidence. We should not reduce this double murder to a simple story of four amateur terrorists who had an opportunity, probably coincidental, to live their “big moment.” The atrocity of this crime and the intense emotions it has provoked—in Morocco and elsewhere—are exceptional. Also, we should not accept simplistic suggestions that Morocco has become more radical, that Wahhabism has prevailed, and that many Moroccans are future terrorists in the making. That is absurd. Although a latent yet non-violent conservatism is on the rise in Moroccan society today, alongside a real desire for emancipation, we are still very far from the “retrogressive” reality that prevails in many other Muslim countries. The century-old tolerance and the deep-seated tradition of openness in the Kingdom are what ISIS wants to bring down. This heinous act is, still, isolated. Moroccans, from all social groups, reacted genuinely and unanimously by rejecting terrorism in the clearest possible way.  Morocco is, and will always be, a safe country. This is largely due to the preventive measures to counter violent radicalism being deployed in our country, including the management of religious activities, unlike in many neighboring countries, and use of a vigilant, expert, and knowledgeable security service, of which we can be very proud.

For the past 48 hours, I have seen the words “Sorry” and “Pardon” sent on social networks to Denmark, Norway, and the two victims’ loved ones. Morocco has been overwhelmed with strong emotions and relentless rejections of the terror act.

However, even though many of us had the urge to expel our emotions, making apologies is uncalled for. Apologize for what, exactly? Being Moroccan? Being Muslim, when these barbaric criminals are smearing Islam? Not being able to protect Maren and Louisa? Why apologize when there is no such thing as “zero risk” in the war on terror? The risk is present in Morocco and elsewhere, because today no country can claim to be immune to this global threat. In ten years, the Kingdom has experienced only two terrorist acts that have resulted in 19 fatalities. Meanwhile, in France there were 14 attacks—mainly perpetrated by French citizens who were born in France and having always lived in France—and more than 230 deaths. Why, then, should we apologize, when our counter-radicalization and security strategy should inspire several Western and Muslim countries? Could it be a sort of guilt trip to avoid being confused in the West with these obscurantist black sheep? Perhaps we should apologize to ourselves first. We have been so busy sharing hashtags and “I am” sympathy slogans with other countries that have had attacks in recent years that we forgot this could happen to us.  Perhaps some of us, intimidated into a spiral of silence over the reality that our religion is being misrepresented by an insignificant minority, should apologize for focusing too much on complex conspiracy theories when Islamist terrorism has just hit us in its most basic and barbaric form. Like many Moroccans, I was hurt after this unspeakable tragedy. The Imlil event is a wake-up call. It must make us all more determined to fight all forms of hatred and extremism, without complacency, exceptions, concessions, or attenuating circumstances.  “Our misfortune is that we live with people who think that God has guided no one but them.” — Ibn Sina (Avicenna) ماتخسرش_ليا_بلادي# (“Don’t ruin my country”)  Brahim Fassi Fihri is Founding President of the Amadeus Institute Translated by Zakaria Ouadghiri

Rabat – Crowds of Moroccans, men and women, gathered Saturday morning in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Rabat, carrying banners with messages of solidarity. The banners read “No to terrorism,” and “We are all Danish and Norwegian.” Moroccans placed flowers and lit candles in front of the two Scandinavian embassies today in memory of the two murdered Scandinavian tourists. A group of Moroccan women who stood near the embassy of Denmark spoke out: “We as Moroccans are against terrorism; Our country is one of peace and security, and it will always be so in the face of extremism that wants to shake its foundations.” Other demonstrators declared: “We as Moroccans abhor these criminals who committed the crime, they do not represent Morocco or Islam,” and “Islam is a religion of peace, tolerance, and coexistence.” Moroccans of different ages held red colored banners with green stars representing the Moroccan flag with the Arabic inscription: “No to terrorism.” Since the news of the murder emerged on Monday, Moroccans have displayed various gestures of sympathy with the victims and their families. One Moroccan stood in front of the Danish embassy in Rabat earlier this week, holding a banner saying “SORRY.” Many Moroccans also signed a petition calling for the death penalty for the first four arrested suspects. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) arrested the first suspect on Tuesday, one day after they discovered the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway. The BCIJ arrested another three suspects Thursday on a bus in Marrakech as they were trying to escape. The four suspects had pledged their allegiance to the ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a video one week before the murder. Later Thursday and Friday, BCIJ arrested another nine suspects they believe to have a connection to the crime. Louisa and Maren were found dead by their tent in an isolated mountainous area 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. Moroccan officials returned Louisa and Maren’s bodies on Friday to diplomats from their home countries.

Rabat – Prince Hicham El Alaoui, known as “the outcast prince,” is an established critic of Morocco’s monarchy, which he has maintained should be more democratic and more reflective of popular will. A cousin of King Mohammed VI, El Alaoui is fourth in line to the throne. Speaking to France 24 El Alaoui said he has other priorities than the order of royal succession. “I have said in the past that I am not part of the Moroccan monarchy and I’m not fourth in the succession order…. Let me be more explicit than I have been before. Three years ago, I sent the king a letter in which I requested that my ties with the monarchy be cut,” he said. El Alaoui explained that he made two requests in his letter to the King. First, he asked to be buried in a “place that has no connection with the monarchy.” His second request was to be relieved of his princely title and privileges. Asked why it was so important to him to sever all ties with the monarchy, he responded: “Because I wanted to end the incongruence between my real activities and the princely title, but also because I want to live life fully. I want to feel free.” Despite El Alaoui’s letter and his insistence that “he has nothing to do with the monarchy,” King Mohammed VI has not yet answered his request, he revealed. But, he added, “I believe I will receive an answer as soon as possible…. I understand why it would take the king so long to attend to my request. I know he has a lot on his plate and the concerns of Moroccans are far more important than the comfort of one citizen.” El Alaoui did not only speak about his tense relationship with the Moroccan monarchy. Commenting on Saudi Arabia’s internal and external troubles since news emerged of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, El Alaoui said that the Arab world is sitting on a time bomb, and the people will react sooner or later. There are repressive and authoritarian regimes in the Arab world, he said, and Saudi Arabia is trying to “export its failed model.”
He said the Khashoggi affair has shed light on the Arab world’s political failure to deal with popular demands. If nothing changes, he predicted, there will be more upheavals to come from the region. While Morocco avoided the Arab Spring in 2011, El Alaoui argued that the country will also go through periods of upheavals and violent protests if the monarchy and the ruling elite do not attend to the demands of the people.

Rabat – Tendayi Achiume, the UN special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance has urged Morocco to “adopt a comprehensive anti-racial discrimination legislative framework.” Achiume concluded her exploratory mission in Morocco on Friday. While Achiume applauded Morocco’s constitutional provisions that prohibit all forms of discrimination, promote equality, guarantee the rights of non-citizens, and recognize Tamazight (Berber), she noted the lack of implementation of some of the provisions. The rapporteur expressed special concern that Morocco has not yet adopted legislation to implement the constitutional provisions on Tamazight, noting the “absence of adequate Amazigh language facilities, including sworn, certified interpreters,” which hinders equal access to justice for Tamazight speakers. “Morocco must adopt and implement the necessary domestic law to achieve full official status to Amazigh language as a matter of urgency,” she stated. In 2016, Morocco presented draft laws 26.16 and 04.16, relating to the integration of Tamazight into national education and administrative institutions as well as the protection and development of both Arabic and Tamazight. The draft laws aim to boost the status and usage of Tamazight in public administrations and services and in all “priority areas of public life,” including documents such as ID cards, passports, driving licenses, and banknotes. According to a July statement from the speaker of the House of Representatives, Habib El Malki, the government does not want to rush the law being implemented, fearing the “complications” it may pose in the future, such as division or conflict in the Moroccan identity. Achiume reported about “the marginalization” and “discrimination” that Amazigh (Berber) communities endure, especially the Amazigh people who move into cities. The marginalization of the groups is seen in regions with limited infrastructure and state support for basic needs, including “water, sanitation, and adequate healthcare facilities.” The rapporteur praised Morocco’s human rights-based approach to migration. She gave the example of the Moroccan Constitution which states that “foreigners under Moroccan jurisdiction are entitled to enjoy the same fundamental freedoms granted to Moroccan citizens.” Achiume welcomed Morocco’s recent decision to reject the European Union’s attempts to “locate offshore asylum processing or ‘regional disembarkation’ centres in the country.” She also pointed out Morocco’s rejection of violating human rights by the “warehousing of migrants in immigration detention facilities.” Noting the pressure to prevent migration from Africa to Europe, Achiume emphasized the “severe restrictions on freedom of movement, and serious human rights violations against regular and irregular migrants, especially black, sub-Saharan Africans.” According to Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita, there is somewhat of an “exaggeration” concerning African migration. In an interview with BBC following the migration conference in Marrakech on December 10, Bourita clarified misconceptions about African migrants, providing statistics. “There are an estimated 256 million migrants globally, both documented and undocumented. From the 256 million migrants, 13 percent, or 36 million, are Africans. “From those 36 million, 80 percent or 30 million people immigrate within Africa,” Bourita said. “African irregular migrants represent only 0.1 percent of world migrants in the US, Arab countries, and Europe,” he concluded. Achiume concluded her report by commending Morocco’s efforts to ensure the rights of Jews in the country. “I commend Morocco for the remarkable steps it has taken to ensure that Moroccan Jews have the full means to enjoy their rights to freedom of belief and association and other human rights. Similar rights and protection should be given to other religious minorities who report facing public restrictions on their rights to freedom of belief and association,” she said. During her visit, which started on December 13, Achiume met with several Moroccan government officials, local NGOs, and victims of racism as part of her fact-finding mission.

Rabat – Between January and November this year, 20.6 million passengers flew through Moroccan airports, according to the National Office of Airports (ONDA). The number is a 10 percent increase over the same period in 2017. Morocco’s busiest airport continues to be Casablanca’s Mohamed V International Airport, with 8.9 million passengers. However, with only 4 percent more passengers than last year, Casablanca’s passenger numbers rose moderately compared to other increasingly popular airports in Morocco. Between January and November, Marrakech’s Menara International Airport steadily increased its traffic, recording a 21 percent increase over last year with 4.8 million passengers. The number accounts for 23 percent of all Moroccan airport traffic. Essaouira’s Mogador Airport recorded the largest increase in passenger traffic at 51 percent. The Dakhla airport in the southern provinces also increased its traffic substantially, by 40 percent. Other airports with notable increases in traffic are Tangier’s Ibn Batouta Airport and Rabat-Sale Airport at 21 percent, Fez’s Saiss Airport at 20 percent, and Agadir’s Massira Airport at 14 percent. According to ONDA’s latest monthly statistics, 1.8 million passengers flew through Moroccan airports in November 2018, up from 1.6 million in November 2017, a 12 percent increase.

Rabat – The Argentinian under-secretary of agricultural markets, Jesus Silveyra, has signed an agreement with Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) to introduce frozen Argentinian cow semen to the Moroccan market. Quoted by Argentina’s Mundo Agro, Minister of Agro-Industry Nation Luis Miguel Etchevehere emphasized “the importance of opening new markets in an increasingly demanding world of quality products, because it verifies the role of our country as a reliable provider of both food as innovation and agro-industrial development.” The agreement was part of an official visit of a delegation from Buenos Aires to Morocco last week. Silveyra’s delegation was accompanied by Argentinian Ambassador to Morocco Maria Fernanda Canas. According to Mundo Agro, the Argentinian officials “detected commercial opportunities for the sale of bag silo, corn gluten, burlanda, vitamin additives, sunflower expellers, chickpeas, lentils, whole white hake, prawns, and beef tallow.” The Argentinian delegation also agreed to exchange information with Moroccan agricultural markets under a Memorandum of Understanding. Morocco has opened its market to international agriculture products, including US beef and poultry. Earlier this month, the US Trade Representative (USTR) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that the Moroccan government approved the entry of US beef into the Moroccan market. “New access to the Moroccan market for beef and beef products is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports of U.S. agricultural products,” said Robert Lighthizer, the USTR. On December 12, Kyiv Post reported that Morocco also agreed to open its market to Ukrainian poultry products, including eggs. “The State Service on Food Safety and Consumer Protection of Ukraine and the competent authority of the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to a veterinary certificate for the export of meat and poultry products from Ukraine to Morocco,” the outlet reported.

Rabat – Denmark’s Ambassador to Morocco Nikolaj Harris has thanked Moroccans for their empathy for the families of the murdered Scandinavian tourists. In a statement, Harris wrote that Denmark’s mission in Rabat has received letters from many Moroccans who expressed solidarity and support for the families of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland and the people of Denmark. “Many people put candles and roses in front of the Danish embassy, and I want to personally express how delighted I am by the various kind of solidarity toward the Danish people during this tough week,” he noted. The ambassador condemned the Imlil tragedy and acknowledged the efforts of the Moroccan authorities. He concluded by highlighting the humanitarian principles that ground the mutual relations between the Moroccan and Danish people. Louisa’s and Maren’s bodies were found with knife wounds 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in the Atlas Mountains on Monday. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has since arrested 13 suspects.  Denmark suspected ISIS was behind the murder of the Danish and Norwegian women.

Rabat – While walking up a bus aisle selling peanuts and water on Thursday, Sliman E-Chin and Said El Assoul were surprised to see a knife butt sticking out of a bag. The bag belonged to one of three passengers sitting in the back row of the bus headed to Agadir from Marrakech, local outlet Kech 24 reported. Seeing a knife puzzled the two vendors, who ultimately decided to inform the police officer by the bus station gate. The police officer discretely asked the bus driver to pull up without attracting the suspects’ attention. Soon other local police and officers from the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) came to make the arrest. Police had been searching for the three men in connection to the murders of two Scandinavian tourists on Monday: Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway. After catching the first suspect on Tuesday, the BCIJ determined he was part of a radicalized group and began searching for the three suspects. The BCIJ later confirmed it was investigating the murders as a terror attack. Police arrested another nine suspects later Thursday and Friday.   After hearing the vendors’ story, social media users hailed E-Chin and El Assoul as heroes who thwarted possible further terror attacks in the future. The police in Marrakech seized the suspects’ weapons, which included multiple knives and a slingshot. Louisa and Maren were found dead with knife wounds to their necks.

Rabat – Morocco’s intelligence services have warned Germany of a potential terror attack at Stuttgart airport. Moroccan intelligence intercepted suspicious phone calls between two individuals about a future attack and immediately informed their German counterparts of their suspicions and the suspects’ names. The German television channel SWR reported that the two suspects were heard planning an attack while surveying Stuttgart airport. According to the suspects’ phone calls, their motive was revenge against Western policies. “They are waging war against Islam; my brothers and I are here to fight them,” said one suspect over the phone. “Will I be alone?” asked a suspect. “No, we are many,” the second responded.  German authorities confirmed that surveillance cameras filmed two individuals taking pictures of Stuttgart airport. The men were driving a white Mercedes Sprinter. After identifying the van’s owner, a resident of the North Rhine-Westphalia state in western Germany, police began searching for the man and his son.  The two suspects, allegedly ISIS members, were also spotted taking pictures of the Paris CDG airport two days after the attack on the Strasbourg Christmas market on December 12. Authorities also saw two other suspects photographing the airport. Germany has put several airports on alert and mobilized police to protect passengers from the terror threat.

Washington D.C – Moroccans have come out in droves to condemn this murder which is contrary to the tolerant, peaceful and hospitable nature of Morocco and to express empathy towards the families of the two innocent Scandinavian victims.  Vigils will be staged in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Rabat this Saturday. At the same time, Moroccans feel powerless and angry to see that this horrifying and inhuman murder will tarnish the reputation of Morocco and its people, in addition to the harm done to its economy. While the terror attack might affect the country’s reputation as a safe destination for tourists, Morocco remains in fact one of the safest countries. This fact must be emphasized to minimize the damage that this crime could inflict on the country’s image and tourism sector. Moroccans should express empathy to the families of the victims and demonstrate once again that they are peace-loving people, their country has always been and will remain a welcoming and hospitable country, and they can by no means accept the perpetration of this kind of monstrous crime.  That being said, Moroccans should not engage in self-loathing and blame what happened on religion again. Nor should Moroccans issue a collective apology to the Danish and Norwegian people for what happened. In the same way as Norwegian people were not supposed to apologize for the 2011 attack perpetrated by a right-wing extremist who killed 85 innocent people, the Moroccan people are not to blame for the Imlil murder and should not apologize for it.  Like every people on earth, Moroccans’ main concern is to lead a decent life; live in peace, stability, and security; have access to quality education and health care; and offer good prospects to their children.  Yes, the suspects have allegedly committed an act of terrorism and have pledged allegiance to ISIS. But their act is not the result of a religious journey or an in-depth knowledge of Islam. Neither is it motivated to advance the interests of their community. They are blinded by hate and resentment and determined to wreak havoc on their society. They are part of a small minority with radical ideology that must be combated with all possible means to eradicate it and counter its narrative.  The problem has rather economic and social causes, and using allegiance to ISIS or religious texts has become just a pretext and rallying cry for millions of people who are left behind in their societies without prospects for a decent life or to meet their basic needs. Since the 2003 Casablanca bombings, the Moroccan government has adopted a multi-tiered approach to nip terrorism in the bud. In the past 15 years, by tightening its security apparatus, increasing control of its borders, asserting authority over the religious sphere, and launching projects to fight poverty, Morocco has done a tremendous job in preventing terrorist attacks. These efforts have turned Morocco into one of the world leaders in the fight against terrorism and allowed it to rank among the safest countries worldwide. However, the government’s strategies have fallen short of improving the lives of people in remote areas and in shanty towns and of immunizing Moroccans to indoctrination by extremist groups. While the efforts of the government are laudable, they have tended to focus on specific regions of the country at the expense of others. It appears that Moroccan officials are still guided by the dialectic of the “useful” versus “non-useful” Morocco inherited from the colonial era when France tended to favor some regions and neglected others.  Some people tend to believe that as long as big cities are being developed and billions of dirhams are being invested in major structural projects, the country is safe, secure, and prosperous.  What they seem to have forgotten is that Morocco is not limited to big urban areas, such as Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakech, or Tangier, and rural areas must also be given greater attention. While some Moroccans are benefitting from the large-scale projects Morocco has launched in the past two decades, many millions do not benefit from them and feel that their government has left them behind.  In addition, Morocco is now paying the price of years of the government’s failure to provide a quality education to those who live on the fringe of our society. Reforms upon reforms have been implemented and hundreds of billions of dirhams have been squandered, but Morocco’s education system ranks near the bottom globally and in the Arab world. No country can build a sound society without investing in human capital, without investing in education. We can build the best glittering projects, state-of-the-art movie theaters, stadiums, or the highest skyscraper in Africa, but if we do not invest in the human capital, if we don’t promote acceptance of others, it will just be a matter of time before things fall apart. Without investing in human capital, without providing equal opportunities to all Moroccans regardless of their regions and family affiliations, we will just be buying time until the time-bomb that is waiting to explode on the fringe of society explodes again and reminds us of the shortcoming and short sightedness of government strategies.  Education is the key in every society. When there is no education to give people hope for a better future and tools to be masters of their destinies and productive members of society, people tend to radicalize.  Without education, millions of disadvantaged individuals are left with nothing but despair, illiteracy, and ignorance, the ingredients for extremism. Any individual—whether Muslim or from another religious persuasion—who has no prospects for a decent and productive life or who feels that his society has left him behind is a person that can be indoctrinated by anybody. Most importantly the government should redouble its efforts to fight the Wahhabi ideology that has permeated our culture and public discourse in the past three decades. Millions of Moroccans have witnessed how this ideology, promoted by Saudi petrodollars, has upended and affected the century-long culture of tolerance and openness to the world that has made Moroccans proud of their country. Our parents no longer recognize the society in which we live. Because of their exposure to Saudi-promoted television and radio channels, millions of Moroccans have become less tolerant of others and adopted views and positions that are foreign to the Moroccan culture. It is this narrow-minded and extremist reading of the religion promoted by Wahhabism that provides radicalized criminals the pretexts to commit their terror attacks in the name of Islam. Providing equal opportunities to all Moroccans, ensuring a fairer distribution of the country’s wealth, engaging in real reform of the education system, and fighting Wahhabism will help Morocco to prevent terrorist attacks and build a society guided by the values of tolerance, openness, and acceptance of others regardless of their cultures or religious persuasions.

Rabat – Ten thousand young people are to begin service in the military each year beginning in September 2019, Moroccan Minister Delegate for National Defence Administration Abdellatif Loudiyi told the Commission on Justice, Legislation, and Human Rights. The commission was examining Bill 44.18 on mandatory military service. Loudiyi also said that women and Moroccans residing abroad (MREs) could be exempt from draft. The bill, which has not yet been passed in Parliament, provides for temporary or permanent exemptions such as physical or mental incapacity, needing to support family, or pursuing studies. The Council of Ministers adopted the bill on August 20, quickly triggering public concern and comments on social media. The bill sets the age of compulsory military service from 19 to 25 years of age. The mandatory military service will significantly increase Morocco’s spending over the medium term, according to a Fitch Group report.

Rabat – Here is a recap of all the events in the murders of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland, two Scandinavians tourists, near Mount Toubkal, from the day their bodies were found to the arrest of thirteen suspects. Monday: A shocking discovery On Monday morning, authorities found the bodies of two tourists from Denmark and Norway 10 kilometers from Imlil, a village in the High Atlas Mountains known for hiking and other outdoor activities among local and international tourists.  The news was widely shared on social media, but no further details were released about the identities of the victims or any possible suspects or motives. After the murder, Moroccan police swarmed to the region to investigate and find evidence. A statement from authorities revealed after the bodies were found that the Scandinavians were murdered because their bodies had evidence of violence with knife wounds. Shockwaves and fear spread across the country and speculations ran wild, leaving people anxious to know more about the suspects and the victims. Tuesday: The first suspect is caught Until Tuesday morning, Morocco’s security services had not issued any updates since the initial news about the murder. On Tuesday morning, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested one suspect in the case. The statement from the BCIJ released the first findings of the preliminary investigation, stating that the suspect was put in custody for further investigation into other possible suspects.  While some people speculated that robbery or rape was the motive, others predicted the murderer would turn out to be a mentally ill person. International journalists started questioning whether the murder could be related to terrorism because BCIJ is known in the international community for being specifically tasked to handle terror-related crimes. Still on Tuesday, a local from the village of Imlil revealed to Morocco World News that robbery was not the motive because none of the victims’ belongings were missing. The source, however, did not exclude sexual assault as a possible motive. After the arrest of the first suspect, the identities of the murdered Scandinavians were revealed. Louisa Veterager Jespersen was a 24-year-old tourist who came from Denmark to hike the highest mountain in North Africa, Mount Toubkal. Her mother said in an interview that she pleaded with her daughter to avoid Morocco “because of the chaotic situation.” Louisa was studying to become a travel guide in Norway. The other victim, Maren Ueland, was a 28-year-old from Norway. She came to Morocco from Norway with Louisa. Maren’s mother announced in an interview that both girls were studying together at the University of South-Eastern Norway.  They left Norway on December 9 to spend their holiday backpacking in Morocco. Wednesday: Potential link to terrorism Authorities discovered more information on Wednesday. The public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeals announced in a statement that the suspect in custody was part of a “radicalized” group.  The statement hinted that the crime might be a potential terror crime On Wednesday evening, Moroccan Facebook users began talking about a horrific a video allegedly of the murder. In the video, a man beheads a blonde woman as she screams and cries for help. While the first man was committing the crime, another man filmed the terrible deed. The men spoke to each other in Darija (Moroccan Arabic) as well as in standard Arabic, saying they were acting to avenge Hajin, a city in eastern Syria recently retaken from ISIS. The nightmarish video left some hoping that it was not related to the crime due to its graphic content. The public prosecutor, however, said that security services were investigating whether the video truly belonged to the incident. Wednesday ended after a source told Morocco World News that three more suspects were involved in the murder. Thursday: Escape attempt and more arrests After the graphic video was widely shared among internet users, BCIJ arrested three more suspects involved in the crime Thursday morning. They were arrested while on a bus leaving Marrakech for Agadir. Another video of the arrested suspects shook Morocco on Thursday. The four arrested suspects appeared in the new video pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In the video, posted on Twitter by an anonymous user, one of the men quotes part of a Qur’annic verse (9:29), “Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger.” After Morocco’s weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi denounced the murder, describing it as a terror act. El Khalfi, however, did not comment on the veracity of the video circulating on social media. He said that investigations were still underway to determine whether the video was related to the crime. Friday: 9 more suspects arrested After the arrest of four suspects, BCIJ arrested nine more suspects for alleged involvement in the murders of the Scandinavian tourists. The arrest took place on Thursday and Friday across the country, including Tangier, Marrakech, and Casablanca.  Commenting on the alleged video of the murder, police in Norway said that there is no evidence that the graphic footage was unreal. Moroccans also launched a petition on Change.org to call the Moroccan government to give the death penalty to the suspects. Some Moroccans agreed to gather in front of the embassies of Norway and Denmark in Rabat to honor the victims at 5 p.m. on Saturday.

Rabat – Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and Morocco signed a new declaration Wednesday, to lift barriers, especially regulatory and physical, to renewable electricity exchange. According to a press release from the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), the declaration aims to facilitate cross-border exchange between renewable electricity producers and electricity-consuming companies.  The five countries have reached a “milestone” with the declaration to gradually integrate their renewable electricity markets, said Masen. MASEN President Mustapha Bakkoury announced his commitment to create the conditions for an integrated electricity market between Morocco and the four countries. The countries will launch a consultation exercise in 2019 with potential producers and buyers of renewable electricity in the five countries. The exercise’s purpose is to highlight opportunities for investment and cost reduction to achievement each country’s climate change goals in line with the Paris Agreement.

Rabat – The French Ministry of Education decided to close an Islamic preschool in Marseille for not complying with France’s academic rules.  In an interview with the French channel RMC Minister of Education Jean Jacques Bourdin said that the school, which relies on fundamentalist Salafi teachings based on physical jihadism, was closed on Monday, December 17. #ENSEIGNEMENT ▶▶ @jmblanquer : “Nous avons les outils juridiques pour pouvoir fermer une école qui n’est pas dans les normes, et notamment celles liées à l’Islamisme fondamentaliste salafiste.”#RMC #BourdinDirect
📻📻 https://t.co/biXKaaL4mK pic.twitter.com/uiVgbUOlHC — RMC (@RMCinfo) 18 December 2018 The minister said that the school, not corresponding with France’s educational “norms” had “lied” about the situation of its students. “Every morning, [the schoolchildren] would be accompanied to a place that looks nothing like a school,” the minister stated, as reported by French daily Le Figaro. The minister indicated that a law passed in July gives the ministry the right to shut down schools that do not follow the country’s norms, especially those which adopt notions of fundamentalist Islam, for fear that the institutions would “indoctrinate” the children. Bourdin announced that authorities will instead enroll the Islamic school students in traditional public schools. The school had only 43 students aged 2 to 6 years old. French authorities are reportedly investigating the types of courses the school gave to the students and whether the courses bore any characteristics of “extremism.” It is not the first time that France has closed an Islamist school. In 2016 the country closed an Islamic primary school in Toulouse, southwest France, that made children attend for more hours than the national curriculum’s regulations.  The Toulouse court gave the school’s headteacher a four-month jail sentence.

Rabat – A study published yesterday in the medical journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows a 16 percent decline in leprosy cases every year since 2012.  The study was conducted by Morocco’s Ministry of Health, in collaboration with scientists at the Mohammed V University in Rabat. Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease, was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1991 to no longer be a public health crisis in Morocco with less than one case per 10,000 habitants. According to the study, the global number of leprosy cases has decreased from 5.4 million in the early 1980s to 210,758 in 2015. The study credits “rifampicin chemoprophylaxis,” a preventative single dose antibiotic implemented in 2012, for greatly aiding the further decline of leprosy in recent years. The study shows that following the introduction of this antibiotic for those exposed to sufferers of leprosy, the detection rate decreased by 16 percent annually, a dramatic trend change. Between 2000 and 2012, leprosy cases decreased 4 percent annually. However, the author summary in the study says, “Despite the decline in case detection of leprosy, incidence reduction to zero and suppression of infection source is still not possible.” The summary elaborates that “addressed strategies to high-risk groups–contacts of leprosy cases” are needed to eliminate the disease at a global level.

Rabat – On Monday this week, Moroccan police discovered the bodies of two Scandinavian tourists. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway arrived in Morocco on December 9 for a month-long holiday, according to a local in Imlil, one of Morocco’s scenic Atlas Mountain areas. Louisa and Maren were friends from the University of South-Eastern Norway, where they both pursued bachelors in outdoor life, culture, and ecophilosophy.  “The two girls arrived on December 12 and got in touch with the local guides’ office on the same day. But they declined our requests to be accompanied by one of our guides,” a local official said after news emerged of the killings. First reactions The first few hours following news of the murders on Monday, December 17, abounded in speculations as the Moroccan authorities and their Danish counterparts tried to find leads and investigate the circumstances of the murder. The cooperation proved effective, as Morocco arrested one suspect just a day after the murder. For Imlil residents, the “barbarous and heinous” act was not reflective of their village’s reputation for “serenity,” “tolerance,” and “peaceful cohabitation.”  Tourists who have visited Imlil agreed en masse on social media. There were scores of testimonies that the people of Imlil are “peace-loving” and “open-minded.” But the murder also sparked anger and frustration.  “We advised her [not] to go down because it’s such a chaotic place, and you’ve heard of people who have been killed down there,” Helle Jespersen, Louisa’s mother, said in the first interview she gave to Danish outlets after learning about her daughter’s death. She added, speaking of Moroccan authorities: “I really want them to catch the guilty people, but I just think the chances are very small in such a country.” Many Moroccans replied that they, too, felt greatly affected by the unfortunate occurrence; the tragedy had shaken them at their core as well. “This has nothing to do with who we are or what we stand for,” Imlil residents said en masse, according to Medias 24’s on-site coverage.  The sentiment found resounding echoes among tourists who are familiar with the region, having holidayed there. “This won’t tarnish my love for Morocco…. It could have happened in Norway,” a former visitor told Morocco World News. ‘Sorry’ Moroccans express sympathy Moroccans felt compelled to not only empathize and sympathize with the victims’ families, but they also offered their “heartfelt” and “sincerest condolences” on behalf of “our country.”  Shaken in their sense of country, which has a reputation of being based on “tolerant Islam,” generosity, and hospitality, Moroccans abroad, particularly in Denmark, and those in the country took to social media to say they were “sorry.” Thousands commented on Louisa’s final Facebook post in which she announced her scheduled trip to Morocco and asked for recommendations about Mount Toubkal.  “Rest in peace. We are sorry,” hordes of Moroccans commented on the post in a particular outpouring of condolences and reassurance for prospective tourists.  Images of a bespectacled young Moroccan man holding a banner reading “Sorry” in front of the Danish embassy in Rabat summed up how unmistakably affected the country felt. There are talks of a sit-in scheduled for Saturday, December 22, in front of the Danish embassy in Rabat. Islamist resurgence sparks fear of economic woe Tourism accounts for 10 percent of Morocco’s national income. And for Imlil, which annually receives as many as 20,000 tourists, the sector is the undisputed lifeblood of the local economy.  “This incident was like a stabbing in the back,” a local resident said, hinting at the fear locals felt when coordinated investigations into the murder later revealed terrorist links. “Terrorism is something new here. We are not used to it. This is the first time,” he asserted. Although BCIJ, Morocco’s elite police, arrested the remaining three suspects Thursday as they tried to flee Marrakech by bus to Agadir, another tourism hub, fear has spread as a country that has kept terrorism at bay since 2011 is hit in the most unexpected manner.  Morocco is being targeted because of its impeccable success in fighting terrorism, Moroccan security analysts and scholars repeated in chorus as Moroccan and Danish intelligence services authenticated a graphic video that had grabbed headlines in international media. The video of suspects pledging allegiance to ISIS, which was later revealed by authorities to have been filmed a week prior to the incident, shattered the doubts of those who may have been thinking that terrorism was not the motive behind the murders.  Targeting Morocco is a ‘symbolic victory,’ international solidarity For years, Morocco has worn its unique anti-terrorism success story like a badge of honor. Morocco’s BCIJ has grabbed international headlines on many occasions as the MENA region’s grand outlier in terms of security. Some witty reporters described Abdellatif Hammouchi, the mastermind of Morocco’s anti-terrorism system, as “the super agent who never sleeps.”  But news of a brutal terrorist attack perpetrated by four ISIS-linked men on two female tourists hit Morocco’s reputation for security.  “If the Islamic State is able to strike within the borders of a state whose defense is viewed to be exceptional, such an attack may carry significant symbolic value—and such symbolism could have dangerous ripple effects,” a 2017 study had warned. It stressed ISIS’s insistence on targeting Morocco despite its repeated failures.  Norwegian police have said that they have no reason not to believe that a decapitation video was not of the murders. In the video, one man is heard saying, “This is revenge for our brothers in Hajin,” a reference to a village in eastern Syria, a former ISIS stronghold which the US-led coalition recently assaulted.  An earlier video, shot last week and posted online on Thursday, is believed to show the four suspects pledging allegiance to ISIS.  News of an ISIS-linked crime could damage one of Moroccan tourism’s biggest selling-points: Security. By finding a crack in Morocco’s hitherto impenetrable anti-terrorism citadel, extremists will take pride in this hugely “symbolic victory,” discouraging some prospective tourists from coming to Morocco. As authorities revealed more and more information on December 20, the government condemned the killings and promised to be far more vigilant in the future. Alert and shaken, Morocco’s government spokesman, Mustapha El Khalfi described the double murder as a “criminal and terrorist act,” promising that the country would double its security measures to prevent a repeat. Meanwhile, authorities in Oslo and Copenhagen chimed in. The two governments issued statements condemning terrorism and promising to stand by Rabat to combat extremism. Denmark’s Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, said: “There are still dark forces that want to fight our values.” But, he added, “We must not give in.” While the Imlil tragedy dealt a blow to Morocco’s reputation for security, it seems—judging from the avalanche of sympathetic comments on social media—to have awakened people to our shared humanity and the spirit of resilience when facing an act as criminal and as indefensible as the Imlil killings.  As fears of terrorism mount, international solidarity seems to be prevailing. On December 19, Glen Martin, the former boyfriend of Louisa, took to his Facebook account to call for peace, love, and positive energy.  “I want to finish off with a request to us left behind. Love will bring us through this, not hate; hate gives us nothing but anger. Love Louisa and her memory … I want everybody that reads this post to call or text someone close to you and tell them how much they mean for you.”

Rabat – The prime minister of Algeria, , accused Morocco of “taking credit for this Maghrebi dish,” referring to couscous. The minister was on a couscous-tasting tour on Thursday at Algiers’ Pasta Production Fair.
  “A neighboring country has taken credit for couscous. We have to prove them wrong. We are not saying that couscous is Algerian but Maghrebi. We have to promote Algerian couscous though,” he said.

Ouyahia also said that the fair had proved that “exports are now part of the Algerian entrepreneurial culture, both public and private.”

As of 2016, the top exporters of couscous were, respectively, France, Italy, Morocco, Israel, and Tunisia and the top importers were France, the UK, the US, Belgium–Luxembourg, and Germany, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Outside the Arab region, the North African couscous is also found in Sicily and Brazil.  In January, food experts from Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia discussed making a joint proposal to add couscous to UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage List.  
Algeria and Morocco also dispute the origin of Rai folk music.

Rabat – The vigil will be an opportunity for Moroccans to express their condemnation of the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists and show solidarity with the families and friends of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway. The vigil will take place from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday, December 22. Moroccans have displayed many gestures of sympathy toward the murdered Scandinavian tourists. Moroccans started by sharing the hashtag “#sorry” and commenting on a statement that went viral. It reads: “As a Moroccan, I’m deeply shocked about the Incident &amp; truly #sorry for what happened in Morocco hope the suspects get what they deserve, we do not tolerate such actions like this in our country #Rest_in_Peace We are so sorry.” Moroccans also made a petition to call for the death penalty for the four arrested suspects who had pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. One Moroccan stood in front of the Danish embassy in Rabat, holding a banner saying “SORRY.” Louisa and Maren were found dead by their tent in an isolated mountainous area 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. Moroccan officials returned Louisa and Maren’s bodies today to diplomats from their home countries.

Rabat- The Central Bureau of Judicial Research (BCIJ) arrested nine more men suspected of belonging to ISIS and being involved in Monday’s terror attack yesterday and today.  BCIJ made the arrests in several cities across Morocco, including Essaouira; Sidi Bennour, near Casablanca; Marrakech; Tangier; and Chtouka Ait Baha, near Agadir. The arrest of the nine suspects is part of the investigation of their potential connection to the terror attack. As part of the investigation, security forces seized electronic equipment, an unlicensed hunting rifle, knives, flashlights, binoculars, a military vest, laboratory glasses, and a quantity of potentially explosive materials. According to the BCIJ report, the persons were taken into custody under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office at the Rabat Court of Appeals. Yesterday, Morocco’s Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said Morocco has dismantled around 20 cells accused of terrorism since last year. “All Moroccans denounce and reject this criminal terrorist act.”

Rabat – The Marrakech-Safi Office of the National Anti-Bribery and Public Funds Observatory is calling on authorities to change the name of Imlil’s “Chamharouch” resort to “Louisa and Maren Resort,” after the murdered Scandinavian tourists.  The office director, Mohamed El Harouali, told Morocco World News that he wants people to know that changing the name of the resort in memory of the victims would signify that such brutalities are rare in Morocco.  Matching the statements of a tour guide who informed MWN that the atmosphere in the Atlas Mountain region where the murder took place is currently peaceful, El Harouali said that when he visited the area shortly after the murder there was only one case of panic. El Harouali said that an elderly French woman at a nearby hotel was panicking since her daughter was also somewhere near the area, “which was only natural after hearing such news,” he added. El Harouali confirmed that the atmosphere in the region is generally ordinary. He noted the “quick” reaction of the Moroccan security services who caught the suspects less than three days after finding the tourists’ bodies on Monday. “Changing the name of the resort into Louisa &amp; Maren is the least thing we can do to honor the souls of the victims, respond to the [murderers’] sick minds and show that there is no place for hate between us,” El Harouali wrote in a press release. Moroccans took to social media networks to condemn the murder and express solidarity with families and friends of the victims.  A young Moroccan man stood in front of the embassy of Denmark in Rabat and held a banner reading “SORRY.” Many Moroccans on social media are also calling on authorities to give the four arrested suspects the death penalty. Moroccans also plan to organize a sit-in at 5 p.m. on Saturday, December 22, in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Rabat, to pay tribute to the victims and express condolences to their countries of origin. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested the first suspect on Tuesday and the three other suspects yesterday. The same suspects pledged allegiance to ISIS in a video a week before the murder. The victims are Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway.

Rabat – Some Moroccans have created a petition on Change.org, calling on Morocco’s Ministry of Justice to give  the murderers of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal the death penalty. According to those who signed the petition, “The death penalty is undoubtedly the right solution to this horrible crime.” The man who launched the petition, Ilyas El Koraichi, wrote, “As a Moroccan, I request the application of Articles 393, 399 of the Moroccan Penal Code.” Articles 392 and 393 deal with intentional and premeditated killing. Although Morocco has not abolished capital punishment, no executions have taken place since 1993. Between 1956 and 1993, Morocco reportedly sentenced 198 people to death. Egypt is the only North African country which still executes people in criminal cases. Capital punishment is declining globally, and numerous international NGOs strongly advocate against the death penalty. Human rights activists in Morocco urged the Moroccan government just two weeks ago to join an international agreement ending the death penalty. At the time of writing, the petition calling for Morocco to give the death penalty to the suspects has 233 signatories, with a goal of 500. A graphic video, allegedly of the murder, began circulating on social media Wednesday night. The video shows Moroccan men decapitating one of the victims. The alleged murderers pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a video taken last week and posted on Twitter on Thursday. Police arrested the first suspect on Tuesday and the three remaining suspects yesterday. Authorities found the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway on Monday. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) is now investigating the crime as an act of terrorism. The government strongly denounced the act,  and he House of Representatives expressed its “deep condolences to the families of the two victims.”

Rabat – Merethe Nergaard, the ambassador of Norway to Morocco, and Ana Fonseca, the head of mission of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Morocco, signed an agreement for Norway to provide a grant of about €400,000 to IOM.  The grant will go to the RAISE program (Voluntary Return and Reintegration for Stranded Migrants in Morocco), a voluntary return and reintegration project for migrants in distress in Morocco.

“We are pleased to continue our support to RAISE, contributing to IOM and Morocco’s efforts to assist stranded migrants who wish to return to their home country,” said Marianne Hagen, state secretary at Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hagen headed the Norwegian delegation to the conference on the Global Compact on Migration. 

Since 2005, IOM Morocco has assisted in the voluntary return of more than 6,800 people to 36 countries. More than 1.3 million migrants have received assistance since 1979. The organization seeks to provide a dignified return for distressed migrants through administrative, logistical, and financial support. 
On December 14, the European Commission announced it will pledge €148 million to financially assist Morocco with migration issues.

Rabat – In an emotional message posted on Facebook, Glen Martin, the boyfriend of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, one of the murdered Scandinavian tourists, said that the best way to mourn his girlfriend is to hold on to positive energy despite the horror and pain of the loss. Writing on Facebook yesterday as investigators found terrorist links into the murder of Louisa and her friend Maren Ueland, Martin exhorted his friends and loved ones to hold onto love and always remember their sweetest memories with Louisa. “Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle. You were that single candle Louisa,” began Martin’s post. Twenty-four-year-old Louisa from Denmark, and 28-year-old Maren from Norway, who became friends at university in Norway, came to Morocco in early December for a month-long holiday. They hoped to make the most of their stay by exploring the country’s natural beauty, according to their latest social media posts.  On Monday, December 17, however, police discovered their bodies at their camping site near Imlil, a village close to Mount Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak and a popular hiking destination. As details of the two women’s brutal murder emerge on social media and on both Moroccan and international news outlets, thousands are expressing their sympathy for the victims’ families. Martin’s post acknowledged the love, sympathy, and support he has so far received, calling for the positivity to continue as friends and acquaintances mourn Louisa. “I want to finish off with a request to us left behind. Love will bring us through this, not tourits hate, hate gives us nothing but anger. Love Louisa and her memory … I want everybody that reads this post to call or text someone close to you and tell them how much they mean for you. I would give anything to tell Louisa one last time what a beautiful human being she was and how much she meant to me.” Moroccan authorities, who are working to shed further light on the Imlil tragedy, echoed the same message of love and commitment to “our shared values and humanity” in the face of divisive forces. On Facebook, Martin’s heartbreaking message elicited even more emotional responses. Friends stressed Louise “sweetness,” easy-going nature, and readiness to “always help.”  “You put this together with such love and emotion Glen,” one friend said, proceeding to explain that his last memory of Louisa was during a music festival, barely a month ago.  “I just remember her saying ‘ah Luke, you’re so sweet.’ I don’t remember the context but every time I hear it it is in her voice,” he added. Another recounted a hiking trip when Louisa helped a group of friends find their way. She wrote: “My friends and I missed the path on the Camino de Santiago and, Louisa, who was climbing up the true path, looked back and noticed us. She ran down the mountain and along the road to show us the way.” Others shared photographs of fun moments and activities they shared with Louisa, relying on the power of pictures to express feelings that words cannot adequately capture.  One reminisced on his “good experience teaching Louisa.” He said he knew from those moments spent teaching her that “she was the kind of person who would not only have the heart to care about others but also the courage to actually help people in need.” He concluded with heart-rending brevity, “I will remember your positive energy and I know we will meet again.”

Rabat – Norwegian police have issued a statement about the video that shows the murder of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal, a Norwegian source told Morocco World News. In the statement, police said that “they have no reason to believe the video of the killing is not real.” Police also concluded that four men who appeared in a second video pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi are the same men  who have been arrested as suspects in the murder. Police also revealed that the video was shot last week. Authorities arrested four suspects for their alleged involvement in killing two women from Denmark and Norway who were camping 10 kilometers from Imlil, a village in the Atlas Mountains widely known for hiking and camping. The first suspect was arrested on Tuesday, December 18, and three more arrests followed on Thursday, December 20. According to Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ), the three suspects arrested on Thursday were trying to escape Marrakech, the nearest large city to Imlil, by bus. Stories on the arrest have been going viral. Some internet users claimed that someone who was selling water near a bus station in Marrakech encountered the suspects when one bought a water bottle. The seller saw a knife in the suspect’s suitcase and immediately called the police. Authorities released photos of the three suspects when they were caught on a bus to Agadir. The three suspects appear, along with one other individual, in the video pledging allegiance to ISIS. The video shows a blonde girl screaming as a man starts slicing her neck. While the armed attacker decapitates the woman, another man filming the crime stops the victim from moving with his foot. In the 72-second video, one of the men was heard saying “This is revenge for our brothers in Hajin.” The suspect was referring to a small town in eastern Syria that was ISIS’ last holdout. On Thursday, after the arrest of the four suspects, an anonymous Twitter user posted videos of the four suspects pledging allegiance to ISIS’ leader. BCIJ is still investigating the videos’ authenticity.

Rabat – A young Moroccan man was photographed holding a banner reading “SORRY” standing in front of the embassy of Denmark in Rabat.
 The picture went viral on social media and received praise from millions of Moroccans who want to show empathy towards the families of the two Scandinavian tourists who were murdered on Monday. Millions of Moroccans took to social media, especially Facebook and Twitter, to express their condemnation and rejection of the heinous crime committed against Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway who were murdered in the village of Imlil near Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains. Moroccans also plan to stage a sit-in on Saturday, December 22, in front of the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Rabat to pay tribute to the two Scandinavian tourists and express condolences to the Danish and Norwegian peoples. Police in Marrakech have arrested four suspects linked to ISIS as documented in a video in which they give their loyalty to ISIS’ leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The public prosecutor at the Court of Appeals in Rabat has just issued a statement announcing that the video was actually recorded last week, before the murder.

By Zakaria Ouadghiri Rabat – Claudia Wiedey, EU ambassador to Morocco, expressed her solidarity with Morocco in the wake of the murder of two Scandinavian hikers near Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. “We express our solidarity with Moroccans in this ordeal, which should not affect the image of this country and its hospitable people,” Wiedey wrote in Arabic on Facebook. “On behalf of my Moroccan and European colleagues and on my own behalf, we would like to express our sincere condolences and deep sympathy to the family and friends of the two girls who were tragically killed in the Imlil region,” she added. The ambassador lamented that several EU countries have suffered from such horrific acts and the consequences that follow. Authorities found the bodies of the two tourists, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, on Monday. The women were found 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil, a destination well known for hiking and camping near Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa. According to the Moroccan embassy in Norway and Iceland, the Moroccan Plural Association in Casablanca dedicated a seminar called “Salam, Shalom, Salut” yesterday to the memory of Louisa and Maren.

“May they rest in peace, may their families find here the expression of our compassion and solidarity,” reads the association’s statement.

The embassy also said the Moroccan Socialist Women’s organization called for a gathering of solidarity with the victims’ families on Saturday near the embassies of Norway and Denmark in Rabat. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested the first suspect on Tuesday, and three more suspects on Thursday in Marrakech. Moroccan security services are investigating the case as a potential  terror attack.  In a press conference today in Rabat, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said that the government condemned the murder of the tourists. El Khalfi said that Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani described the crime as “a “stab in our back.”

Rabat – Moroccans, and people all around the world are mourning the deaths of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway who were murdered in Morocco’s Imlil near Mount Toubkal. Many Moroccans on social media are calling on authorities to give the four suspects in the case the death penalty. Moroccans are also commenting “#sorry” and “#RIP” hashtags on the public Facebook posts of the Danish victim Louisa Vesterager Jespersen. One statement made by a Moroccan on the incident is also going viral: “As a Moroccan, I’m deeply shocked about the Incident &amp; truly #sorry for what happened in Morocco hope the suspects get what they deserve, we do not tolerate such actions like this in our country #Rest_in_Peace We are so sorry.” Louisa had written her final public Facebook post about visiting Mount Toubkal.  Louisa and Maren’s bodies were found on Monday, December 17. The two women had been sharing a tent in an isolated area in the High Atlas Mountains. The women were found near their tent with knife wounds to their necks. Some sources reported that the women were hiking without a guide and had been stalked. Police arrested three murder suspects on Thursday in addition to the first suspect who was arrested on Tuesday. While Moroccan security services have announced that the murder was a potential terror attack, they have not confirmed whether it was ISIS-related. Responding to international commenters who began to express doubt about security in Morocco, several Norwegian nationals said that their “love” for Morocco would not stop them from visiting the country. One Norwegian wrote to MWN:  “This won’t tarnish my love still for Morocco, InshaAllah I return sooner than later I live in Norway, people here love Morocco this won’t stop them from visiting it. They look at it as homicide that could have happened in Norway.” When some speculated that Morocco’s tourism will suffer following the tragic deaths of the tourists, an anonymous diplomatic source told Morocco World News that “Morocco is generally perceived as a safe country.”  A tour guide in Imlil where the murder took place condemned the murder and confirmed to Morocco World News that tourists are still visiting the region and hiking there.  Denying speculations that fearful tourists have left the area, the tour guide said that tourists are still checking into nearby hotels. The guide stated that the tourists and visitors were saddened by the incident, but that the atmosphere is currently peaceful. The area is known for its hospitable, friendly people and scenic views. A graphic video, allegedly of the murder, began circulating social media Wednesday night.  The video shows Moroccan men slicing the throat of one of the victims. The footage records two voices of the killers, speaking in Darija (Moroccan Arabic). One said: “This is a revenge for our brothers in Hajin,” referring to a small town in eastern Syria that was ISIS’ last holdout. After international news outlets, including the Guardian and AFP, reported that Denmark confirmed the authenticity of the footage today, Danish security services announced in a statement that they did not authenticate the video. Danish and Moroccan authorities are currently investigating the authenticity of the footage.

Rabat – Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, Omar Hilale, visited UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York on Wednesday to give him the official gavel from the Marrakech conference on migration. Hilale said the gavel is a “pure Moroccan handicraft product,” the state-owned Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) wrote. The gavel was made specifically for the Marrakech Conference, to bring “a traditional touch of our country” to the international meeting. The gavel will stay in the United Nations Museum. “This is the gavel that was used throughout the historic Conference that adopted the Marrakech Compact on Migration,” said Ambassador Hilale. The conference, attended by more than 100 countries, adopted the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration on December 10. Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita said at the conference, “Morocco played an active role in the writing of the compact. Its ideas, its philosophy; Morocco’s logic is already integrated into the compact. It’s not a legal document that we have to translate into our legal texts.” Hilale gave the gavel to Guterres to add it to the UN archives as a souvenir of the Compact on Migration. Guterres thanked Morocco for the historic gift, MAP said, and congratulated Morocco for successfully hosting the international event.  Guterres also asked Hilale to thank King Mohammed VI for his warm welcome and for receiving Guterres during his visit to Morocco. The special representative of the Secretary-General for international migration, Louise Arbour, also attended Hilale’s meeting with Guterres.

Speaking to Mauritanian outlet Anbaa on December 15, Blah Ould Mekia, Mauritania’s ambassador to Rabat said that his country’s position is more in line with Algeria’s than Morocco’s.  A known Polisario Front supporter, Algeria  is pushing for self-determination in Western Sahara, in defiance of Morocco’s position that calls for local autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. While Mauritania has traditionally dubbed itself a “neutral observer,” Ambassador Mekia said that Algiers and Nouakchott “share similar opinions when it comes to the Western Sahara conflict.” The Mauritanian diplomat explained that his country feels closer to Algeria on various other security issues on the regional and continental stages.  On August 19, Algiers and Nouakchott  opened the land border between them. Referring to the move in the warmest terms, Mekia said that the event is the start of the countries’ ambition to establish a bilateral platform to face regional challenges. He said: “The two countries have a similar vision for several regional and international issues, especially when it comes to the Western Sahara conflict brought under the auspices of the United Nations, as well as issues related to the fight against terrorism and transnational organized crime.” In addition to security, Algeria and Mauritania are collaborating to “strengthen cooperation at all levels” and further their common regional agenda. The reason for the change, the ambassador argued, is because “Algeria is aware of the Maghreb region’s challenges.” Mekia’s statements are likely to shock Morocco’s diplomatic circles. Rabat expected closer ties with Nouakchott to allow for more diplomatic overtures in the Western Sahara settlement discussions. In early November, Morocco’s foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita traveled to Mauritania to extend to President Ould Abdelaziz “a special message” from King Mohammed VI. The visit sought to “open a new chapter” in the two countries’ relations and probably to get Mauritania onboard with Morocco at the December 5-6 Geneva meeting. “Nothing will be like before,” an optimistic Bourita said after meeting with the Mauritanian president.  “There is sincere political will on both sides to impart a new dynamic to bilateral relations in all domains,” the Moroccan minister said of his expectations based on his “warm and candid” discussion with Mauritanian officials. At the time, Morocco’s optimism seemed to echo in Mauritania.  Shortly before Bourita’s state visit to Mauritania, Sidi Mohamed Ould Maham, Mauritania’s communications minister and government spokesperson said, “If Morocco takes one step forward towards Mauritania, you should rest assured that Mauritania will take ten steps forward.” Two weeks after the first Geneva meeting, however, the expected diplomatic overtures seem more distant than first thought.

Rabat – A new video is going viral allegedly showing the four suspects that have been arrested in the murder of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal in Morocco’s High Atlas Mountains. The video shows the suspects pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In the video posted on Twitter by an anonymous user, one of the men quotes part of a Qur’annic verse (9:29), “Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger.”
 The suspect continued, saying al-Baghdadi has  “soldiers in Morocco” to support ISIS. “Answering the call of the emir of the faithful, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and in support of our brothers everywhere, especially those in Hajin, we tell our caliph, ‘You have ​soldiers ​in Morocco​ ​only God knows about​.’​” He added, “Our message to the supporters of the caliphate on the social media, may God bless them and acknowledge their endeavor; you have conveyed justice and truth to many of God’s people. May God bless you for that. However, this does not release you from the obligation of fighting [jihad] for God.” The man addressed the audience, saying that the suspects have been “always supporting the fighters in the battlefields, yet we could not abstain [from jihad]. Speaking on the behalf of the other suspects, he added “We could not live in a land where the law of God (sharia) is not observed. How could we enjoy living when we are the first ones who watch the trail of destruction left by the aircraft of the crusader coalition?” After authorities found the bodies of the victims on Monday, a video was widely shared on social media Wednesday evening, allegedly showing the murder of the two women tourists. In the video, one of the alleged murderers said, “This is a revenge for our brothers in Hajin.” The man was referring to a small town in eastern Syria that was ISIS’ last holdout. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway had been camping 10 kilometers from Imlil, a scenic village in the Atlas Mountains.

Rabat – The province of Essaouira launched its Territorial Innovation Lab on Wednesday, the first open innovation initiative in Morocco. The innovation lab is an open, though non-physical, “third place” for public and private entities, local authorities, university labs, and associations to work on the region’s development issues.

“The recent developments of our province and Essaouira city are the result of a joint action. We are happy and proud that this nation-wide first has found its natural space in Essaouira,” said Essaouira-born Andre Azoulay, an advisor to King Mohammed VI on the initiative. 
“Joint problem-solving for the common good could become a more effective model of action in response to increasing societal needs,” said Kholoud Kahime, a researcher at the Capacity Building Centre of the Essaouira Higher School of Technology and spokesperson for the lab. While closed innovation companies innovate using only internal resources, an organization’s boundaries become permeable once it adopts open innovation. This allows the company’s resources to be combined with external cooperators. The founding members of the lab include Cadi Ayyad University, Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, IBM, and Dupont OCP Operations Consulting, among others.

Rabat – Law enforcement in Marrakech seized weapons, most likely used in the murders of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal in Morocco’s High Atlas Mountains. After arresting three suspects in the case who were on a bus to Agadir this morning, police found three large knives, one regular-size knife, three phones, and a slingshot. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were found dead in Imlil, a village in Morocco near Mount Toubkal, on Monday, December 17. The bus driver stated that police arrested the suspects Thursday morning, near Bab Doukkala station in Marrakech, at around 8:45 a.m. The driver said that plainclothes police on the bus approached him and instructed him to lock the doors near “Aswak Assalam,” a supermarket. The three suspects, according to the driver, were sitting in the back and did not resist arrest. He added that they looked like normal passengers and not fugitives. Police arrested the first suspect on Tuesday and soon began to believe the murders may have been terrorism-related.

Rabat – The government’s spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, gave a press conference today on the murders of two tourists from Norway and Denmark on Monday, December 17. According to El Khalfi, the weekly cabinet meeting was opened to address the “sad event of the death of two foreign tourists in the region of Imlil.” El Khalfi’s comments on the murder are the first official statement from the government. El Khalfi said that Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that “all Moroccans denounce and reject this criminal terrorist act” and that “it is strange to Moroccan values and traditions, especially the traditions in that region.” The murder, discovered when the bodies of two women tourists were found on Monday, is unprecedented in the region, a popular site for hiking and camping.  El Othmani, according to El Khalfi, said that such “terrorist acts” are a “stab in our back.” The government also commended “authorities, security and gendarmeries, auxiliaries forces and all institutions that monitor the security and stability of the country.” El Khalfi referenced Morocco’s involvement in counterterrorism with a comprehensive approach led by King Mohammed VI. El Khalfi said Morocco has dismantled around 20 cells accused of terrorism since last year. He said that it is not “an easy job.” He added that there is no “development, stability, reform or progress without security.” El Khalfi said that security services were quick to arrest the four suspects involved in the murders, 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested the first suspect on Tuesday, a day after authorities found the bodies of the tourists. BCIJ arrested three more suspects Thursday morning. El Khalfi confirmed that one of the suspects is from a “radicalized” group, but has not shared further information on whether the suspects have ties with ISIS or any terrorism group. Danish intelligence suspect the murder was inspired by ISIS after a video went viral on social media Wednesday night, showing a man murdering a foreign tourist. The video records two voices speaking in Darija (Moroccan Arabic). One of the men was saying, “ This is a revenge for our brothers in Hajin.” The man was referring to a small town in eastern Syria that was ISIS’ last holdout. Danish security services deemed the video authentic, according to the Guardian. Morocco World News asked El Khalfi about the government’s official position on the video, but he said that it is still under investigation to determine its authenticity. El Khalfi warned Moroccans not to share the video on social media. “You know the law,” he said. Local media reported that investigators from Norway are contributing to the investigation. El Khalfi, however, did not confirm it. Tourism not yet affected After the murder, local news outlets speculated that tourism will be affected negatively. El Khalfi denied the concerns, saying that there are lots of tourists coming to  Morocco, and the government has not received any statistics about tourists’ cancellation requests. Guides in the area confirmed to Morocco World News that they have not received any cancellation requests from international tourists since the murder. “It will be hard for tourists to find an available hotel room in hotels in Marrakech and in the region, especially because many tourists have already booked places to spend their Christmas holiday,” one tourism worker told MWN.

Rabat –Danish security services announced in a statement on Thursday that they did not authenticate a viral graphic video supposedly of the Scandinavian tourists’ murders. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET), however, sent a press release saying, “The police and the intelligence agency are still analyzing the video. So we cannot at this time say anything about the authenticity of the video.” Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were killed in Imlil, a village in Morocco near Mount Toubkal on Monday, December 17. The video, which circulated social media networks Wednesday evening, shows Moroccan men slicing the throat of one of the victims. The footage records two voices of the killers. One said: “This is a revenge for our brothers in Hajin,” referring to a small town in eastern Syria that was ISIS’ last holdout. Prime Minister Rasmussen commented today on the murders, condemning the killing and asserting that it “could be politically motivated and thus a terrorist act.”  Moroccan security services have not yet announced whether the video was related to the murder of the tourists. Danish authorities believe the murder was ISIS-related. Morocco’s security services also believe the murder was an act of terror, saying that the first suspect they arrested on Tuesday was part of a radicalized group. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) gave the names of three additional suspects arrested today. All of the suspects, according to local media, live in “marginal neighborhoods” around Marrakech. Police arrested Rachid Aftati, born in 1986, an alleged small businessman, in connection to the crime. Aftati lives in Al Kayed, in a rural area called Harbil, 30 kilometers from Marrakech. The second suspect, Azid Youness, is a 27-year-old carpenter who lives in Al Azzouzia, Marrakech. The third suspect, Abdelsamad Ijoud, is a 25-year-old who lives in the Zeroual neighborhood in Marrakech.

Rabat – A graphic video went viral on December 19 showing what some believe to be the killing of one of the Scandinavian tourists near Imlil, a village in the Atlas Mountains near Mount Toubkal in Morocco. The two young women were found dead on December 17 with wounds to the neck. Four suspects have since been taken into custody. Authorities identified the victims as 28-year-old Maren Ueland from Norway and 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark. Before being removed from Facebook, the video was shared on several pages, including on Louisa’s remembrance page. The 72-second video shows a blonde woman struggling and screaming, just inches from a tent, as a man begins to cut her neck. A second man, while filming, attempts to stop the victim moving by applying pressure with his foot.  One of the men is heard, speaking in Darija (Moroccan Arabic), “This is a revenge for our brothers in Hajin,” referring to a small town in eastern Syria that was ISIS’ last holdout.
 After several seconds, the armed attacker is seen decapitating the woman. He then raises her head, before throwing it on the ground and leaving her body by the tent. Although the video seems to match the circumstances of the crime, its authenticity has not yet been confirmed. Rabat’s Court of Appeals is still investigating.  In a press conference today, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen commented on the video, saying, “There is a video going around on social media, but its authenticity is still not verified.”

Rabat – The Spanish government delegate in Ceuta, Salvadora Mateos, has urged domestic workers to “regulate their situation” in order to cross the Morocco-Spain border at Ceuta. In a statement to the press on Tuesday, Mateos stated that new restrictions, which require locals to provide proof of work or residence do not violate the Schengen visa agreement which allows domestic workers and Moroccans who live less than 40 kilometers from Ceuta to enter the city without restriction. Spanish media reported, however, that Mateos is concerned for domestic workers and nearby residents, who can now be asked for proof of work or residence when entering Ceuta. But she explained that the move is aimed to end undocumented migration, because many cross the border with Moroccan passports and many Moroccans and Algerians enter Spain as unaccompanied foreign minors. Mateos said that the “Smart Border,” to be installed within three months, will better manage entries and exits. With high numbers of people crossing the border, police have not been able to efficiently process them. The Development Society of Ceuta (Procesa) estimated that 20,000 Moroccans enter the Spanish enclave every day. Only 1,314 people are registered under social security as domestic employees. Many of them made their work status regular in just the last two years. In 2017, 197 domestic workers regularized their status, and in the first 11 months of 2018, 286 did.

Rabat – Although ISIS has not claimed credit for the murder of two tourists from Norway and Denmark in Morocco, Danish officials said that the motive for the murders may have been terrorism, inspired by ISIS. The bodies of 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark and 28-year-old Maren Ueland from Norway were recovered on Monday, December 17, in an isolated, mountainous area. On Thursday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a press conference, “Much now indicates that the killings could be politically motivated and thus a terrorist act.”  ‘We must never give in’ Rasmussen added, “There are still dark forces out there who will try to fight our values with violence, threaten our society, and the way we live our lives.” Expressing frustration, the prime minister said, “It makes me angry but also more firm that we never must give in or give way.” Rasmussen also commented on a video that has gone  viral on social media showing Moroccan men slicing the throat of a foreign woman. The video records two voices. One of the men in the video was crying: “This is a revenge for our brothers in Hajin,” referring to a small town in eastern Syria that was ISIS’ last holdout. “There is a video going around on social media, but its authenticity is still not verified,” Rasmussen said. Locals have said that the video is not related to the murder, but the public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeal said that Moroccan security services are still checking its authenticity. ISIS has been shifting its strategy from explosive bombings to stabbing and vehicle-ramming attacks. The strategy is defined as “ISIS’ lone-wolf.” ISIS started using the strategy as its territory in Iraq and Syria shrank. In recent years, ISIS has been carrying several attacks, using knives and vehicles to run over people deliberately. A statement from a public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeals confirmed that the first suspect, arrested Tuesday, belongs to a “radicalized” group. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) announced the arrest of three more suspects on Thursday morning. Danish journalist Stine Delfs told Morocco World News that Danish security services are now investigating the murder as an act of terror. She added that police informed the victims’ relatives of the new development. Norwegian Ambassador to Morocco Merethe Nergaard arrived in Marrakech yesterday to follow the case closely. In an interview with VG, the ambassador described the crime as “dramatic.”  “It is a very tragic case,” she said. An experienced Norwegian policeman working in Norway’s embassy in Rabat traveled to Marrakech to investigate the case. The diplomat, however, denied that there are Norwegian investigators contributing to the investigation. “This is an investigation carried out by the Moroccan authorities,” she said. She added that the mission of the Norwegian embassy is to provide consular assistance to the relatives of the victims. Morocco World News attempted to reach both embassies for further details, but their hotlines were unreachable. The murders came as a shock because Morocco is considered a safe travel destination for local and international tourists, according to the recent 2019 Travel Risk Map.

Rabat – Three suspects in the murder of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal were trying to escape when police arrested them this morning. Police intercepted the murder suspects in Marrakech while they were riding a bus, trying to evade authorities. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway were found dead in Imlil, a village in Morocco near Mount Toubkal on Monday, December 17. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) had arrested the first suspect on Tuesday. Photos, allegedly of the three suspects arrested today, have been widely shared by social media users who condemned the killing. One suspect, named as Rachid Aftati, is a small-businessman born in 1986, and lives in Al Kayed, in a rural area called Harbil, 30 kilometers from Marrakech. The second suspect, Azid Youness, is a 27-year-old carpenter who lives in Al Azzouzia, Marrakech.  The third suspect, Abdelsamad Ijoud, is a 25-year-old who lives in the Zeroual neighborhood in Marrakech. Within 24 hours of the first arrest, Morocco’s security services began to believe the murder was an act of terror. The public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeals said the first suspect is part of a “radicalized” group.

Rabat – In 2019, Morocco will deduct 14 percent from the wages of public sector employees for their pensions. The deduction comes under Law No. 71.14 adopted by the previous government led by Abdelilah Benkirane in 2016. The law also gradually extends the age of retirement from 60 to 63 years, starting from 2024. The deduction and older retirement age are part of the government’s plan to reform the Moroccan pension fund under crisis in recent years. Since 2014, the Moroccan pension fund (CMR) has been facing a deficit, and will operate on a “technical” deficit starting in 2018 and a total deficit in 2027. According to a report on social protection by the Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CECE), CMR reserves will go bankrupt in 2044, and reforms are needed to ensure long-term financial balance. Previously, the government deducted 10 percent from salaries for pensions. Now, in the fourth year since the adoption of the reform, the government will begin deducting 14 percent. The trade unions of public employees considered the reform a blow to the purchasing power of the middle class. Moroccans have organized several protests to overthrow the reform and have called for an increase in salaries and no more deductions. The possibility of giving up the fourth deduction from salaries came up during the last round of “social dialogue.” Due to the suspension of social dialogue meetings earlier this year, it is only a matter of days before the government will implement the proposed law of raising salaries for employees between grades 6 and 10 by MAD 200 monthly in 2019, and by MAD 100 monthly in 2020 and 2021.  The government, however, has not yet reached an agreement with the unions, which called for an MAD 600 monthly raise. Morocco has about 700,000 public sector employees. Over 580,000 work for the central government, 150,000 work in the urban communities, and 130,000 work in public institutions.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI launched the first aircraft from the new generation of Royal Air Maroc (RAM) aircraft, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, on Wednesday at the Rabat-Sale airport.

Longer than the Boeing 787-8, the 787-9 can carry 302 passengers, 28 more than the 787-8, for up to 14,140 kilometers.

The added capacity will allow RAM to expand its reach and make its flights more profitable. RAM will officially join Oneworld, an airline alliance, in mid-2020. 
The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is built with composite materials, which significantly reduces the airplane’s weight, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions by as much as 25 percent compared to other long-haul aircraft.

The King also laid the foundation stone for a new terminal at Rabat-Sale airport.

The project will increase the airport’s annual capacity to 4 million passengers instead of the current 1.5 million and is part of the tourism program “Rabat, City of Lights and Capital of Culture.” The airport currently hosts 10-20 flights per day.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed a message to participants at the third parliamentary session of regions on Wednesday, calling on all stakeholders, especially elected officials and councils, to carry out tasks and projects with “consistency” and in a “complementary” manner. King Mohammed VI wrote, in a letter read by his advisor Abdellatif Menouni, that the session should be an opportunity “to deepen the constructive debate and find appropriate, creative and practical solutions to enable advanced regionalization to play a pivotal role in the production of tangible and intangible wealth.”  The King emphasized the need to create employment opportunities for young people, ensure the integration of individuals from all backgrounds, and encourage cultural diversity in the country. Addressing all Moroccan stakeholders and elected officials, the King was firm in stating they must show commitment and responsibility in their actions. He added that prefectural and provincial councils must prioritize social development in urban and rural areas equally. The monarch mentioned his policy dedicated to ensuring the success of the regional development agenda. The policy “is aimed at providing the conditions for the success of the regional development agenda, increasing the pace of its implementation and enabling regions to acquire the skills needed to exercise their powers in an optimal way.” The King’s recently-launched projects within his agenda are concerned with Morocco’s vocational training system, devolved administrative powers, reform of social services, and reassessment of regional investment centers’ legal and regulatory framework. ‘No postponement can be tolerated’ King Mohammed VI criticized the lack of action and commitment to finding solutions for the problems of young people in Morocco, especially in terms of youth integration which is of great “priority” to the monarch. In his message the King wrote, “I invited elected officials to devise appropriate solutions to the problems young people are facing in their respective regions … I have noted, however, that the initiatives undertaken by regions in this regard have fallen short of my ambition.” The King reiterated his request that all concerned entities must “adopt a participatory approach to develop regional plans and programs for the integration of young people,” stressing the “need to be consistent with the national strategy for the integration of young people and with regional development programs.” “Moroccans do not want regional institutions to be mere ink on paper,” the king stated, calling for more effective action by developing a methodical and time-based approach. State resources are limited Given the state’s limited financial resources, the King invites local authorities to initiate and develop plans and programs to overstep the financial constraints. “They should, in particular, ensure efficient and effective management of financial resources, and invest them in productive activities that create jobs and respond to the actual, pressing needs of the population,” said the King. The third Parliamentary session, under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, reflects the monarch’s “keenness to ensure the success of the large-scale, structural reform project regarding advanced regionalization.” The Parliamentary forum seeks to modernize institutions in Morocco, promote solidarity, dignity, social justice, and inter-regional equality, as well as integrated, sustainable development “for the benefit of all citizens.” Regardless, the King lauded the House of Counselors and its institutional partners, the Economic, Social and Environmental Council, the National Human Rights Council and the Moroccan associations of regions and local governments’ “approach that involves making proposals and engaging in reflection on a regular basis.”

Rabat – Morocco World News has received a statement confirming that Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested three more suspects in Marrakech involved in murdering two Scandinavian tourists 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in the Atlas mountains. BCIJ had arrested the first suspect on Tuesday, a day after the bodies of the two young female hikers from Norway and Denmark were found. Confirming his arrest on Wednesday night, Morocco’s public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeals said that the first suspect is a part of a “radicalized” group.  An official source also told Morocco World News that authorities are investigating the murders as a potential terrorist act. The statement  from BCIJ added that investigations are underway to determine the circumstances of the incident, as well as to verify the potential terror motives behind the crime. Who are the suspects? Photos of three suspects have been widely shared by social media users, who strongly condemned the “hideous” crime committed against the tourists from Norway and Denmark. The names of the three suspects arrested were also revealed. All of the suspects, according to local media, live in “marginal neighborhoods” around Marrakech.  Police arrested Rachid Aftati, born in 1986, an alleged small businessman, in connection to the crime. Aftati lives in Al Kayed, in a rural area called Harbil, 30 kilometers from Marrakech. The second suspect, Azid Youness, is a 27-year-old carpenter who lives in Al Azzouzia, Marrakech. The third suspect, Abdelsamad Ijoud, is a 25-year-old who lives in the Zeroual neighborhood in Marrakech.

Rabat – Some 7,092 police officers of different corps and ranks received merit-based promotions for the 2018 financial year, announced the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) on Tuesday. They represent 44 percent of the overall officers registered for the promotion.

This includes 5,208 uniformed and 1,820 plainclothes officials, as well as 64 managers and inter-ministerial officials, said the DGSN. The Promotion Committee has worked to increase the number of recipients in the lower ranks and echelons, from peacekeepers to senior officers, totalling 6,406 civil servants and accounting for over 90 percent of the recipients.

Unlike other ways of being promoted such as competition or examination, those who receive promotions based on merit are selected by the administration. The choice is based on the need to recognize competent public officials who could not pursue further education or take part in competitions and examinations. Around 8,644 police officers from different corps and grades were promoted last year and 6,067 in 2016.

Rabat – As fear and speculation that the tragic deaths of two Scandinavian tourists in Morocco’s Imlil village will have long standing negative repercussions on Moroccan tourism, diplomatic sources are confident in the country’s ability to shed light in the murder and reassure hesitant tourists. “Morocco is generally perceived as a safe country,” an anonymous diplomatic source told Morocco World News, suggesting that Rabat is collaborating with Copenhagen and Oslo to investigate the murders of two Danish and Norwegian tourists. Following the murders, both Denmark and Norway warned their citizens from hiking and visiting the area alone without local guides. “The vast majority of trips to Morocco are free of any problems, but precautions must be taken,” Norway foreign ministry said in a statement. Earlier this week, Moroccans and Morocco-loving tourists woke up to the news of two murders in Imil near Mount Toubkal, one of Morocco’s most prized tourist destinations.  Like millions of tourists who visit Morocco yearly, 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, from Denmark, and 28-year-old Maren Ueland, from Norway, visited the region in in  hopes of exploring its stunning natural beauty. “Dear friends, [I am] going to Morocco in December. Any of you guys who’s around by then or any mountain friends who knows something about Mount Toubkal?” read one of Jespersen’s most recent Facebook posts, making it clear that the 24-year-old looked forward to making the most of her Moroccan stay. Monday, however, the two tourists were found dead in the area where they had been seen camping.  Fear and apprehension quickly soared as major news outlets reported on the unfortunate incident. Danish and Norwegian outlets even reported that the two young women had defied their loved ones’ warnings about their planned trip to Morocco. The families reportedly had doubts about security in Morocco and did not want them to travel there. Although other tourists have since spoken of Morocco as a safe holiday destination country, the harm has been done and fear appeared to have taken deep roots.  For all the fear surrounding the incident, the Moroccan diplomatic source told Morocco World News that Rabat has received guarantees from representatives of the two Scandinavian countries about their readiness to cooperate on the dossier.  He said authorities from the two concerned countries reiterated their faith in Morocco’s security. “Danish diplomats have reassured us that they believe Morocco is a safe country and that no Danish national has experienced problems while in Morocco” prior to this week’s tragic incident. Moroccans and foreign nationals have been equally appalled by the murder, and police have, so far, arrested three suspects. Further investigations are being conducted to shed more light on the murders, the source said.

Rabat – An official source told Morocco World News (MWN) that four suspects are involved in the murder of the two girls from Norway and Denmark. The source also confirmed to MWN that the tragedy was an act of terrorism. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) confirmed the arrest of one of the suspects, who is still under custody for investigation.  Morocco’s public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of Appeal has announced in a statement that authorities are investigating whether the video truly belongs to the incident. According to the statement, the arrested suspect is part of a “radicalized” group. The prosecutor’s office added that the other suspects were identified. The BCIJ is now looking for three other suspects. The counterterrorism bureau said that all the Moroccan security services will spare no efforts to arrest all suspects involved in the cell involved in the crime committed against the two European citizens. Photos of three of the suspects are going viral on social media. The suspects appear to be in their thirties. A graphic video, allegedly related to the murder, has also circulated social media, eliciting shocked reactions.  The bodies of 24-year-old, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, from Denmark and 28-year-old, Maren Ueland, from Norway were recovered on Monday, December 17 in the unsupervised, mountainous area.

Rabat – An official source told Morocco World News that the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists was, in fact, a potential  terrorist act. Twenty four hours following the arrest of the first crime suspect, authorities concluded that the killing bore the characteristics of terrorism. Local police are currently tracking down the three other suspects. The terrorists filmed the murder of the two tourists. A video circulating on social media shows a man armed with a knife slicing the head of one of the two tourists. The video sparked outrage among Moroccans. Some internet users who watched the footage on Facebook advised people to not watch it if they received it, due to the graphic content. Morocco World News could not verify the accuracy of the video. No terror organization claimed the act yet. Pending further details from law enforcement, photos of three suspects are going viral on social media. The incident is unprecedented in the region, causing shockwaves among its inhabitants, as well as throughout Morocco.  On Monday, the bodies of two foreign tourists, one Norwegian and the other Danish, with signs of stabbing at the neck, were found in the mountainous and unsupervised area, 10 kilometres away from the Imlil centre, towards the summit of Mount Toubkal. According to a MWN source, the suspects were camping in the area when the murder took place. The victims are 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark and 28-year-old Maren Ueland from Norway. According to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Moroccan authorities are now investigating a possible link to terrorism in the case of the murders of the two Scandinavian women. The arrest of a suspect who has ties to an extremist group and a video circulating on social media which can possibly have a connection to the killings make the likelihood of a terrorist act more plausible, according to the same source. Stine Delfs, journalist at the Danish Broadcasting Corporation told Morocco World News that the “Danish Intelligence Agency is now analyzing and evaluating the video and the possible link to terrorism.” “The police have informed the relatives of the victims of this new development in the case,” she added. Based on information received from Moroccan authorities, the Danish Intelligence Agency says that the killings might have ties to Islamic State terrorist group.

Rabat – After widespread controversy over a truncated Moroccan map on an advertisement video, Moroccan transport company CTM has published a statement that denies its involvement with the controversial video.  CTM shared a statement with Morocco World News on Monday, denying that it excluded the southern provinces from the Moroccan map in an advertisement. The video advertisement’s map caused uproar among Moroccan news outlets that described CTM’s act as a “crime” against Morocco’s territorial integrity. It was not until Moroccan news outlets denounced the map that CTM reacted. The advertisement, which was displayed for nine months on social media in French, offers a presentation from CTM’s CEO, Ezzoubeir Errhaimini, who spoke about the company’s achievements since its creation in 1919. The company’s denial questioned the purpose of “the misleading advertisement and its source at this particular time.” The statement added that the page that featured the contentious video is a “fake page.”  The company also explained how it is keen to play a “key role in connecting Morocco’s regions to the southern provinces.” The transport company concluded its statement by reiterating its commitment and readiness  to provide its services to Moroccans.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – After Trump declared that the US had “defeated ISIS in Syria” in a tweet Wednesday morning, administration officials expect the US president will announce, as early as today, the complete withdrawal of American troops from Syria. The move marks an abrupt reversal of US policy and military strategy in the Middle East.  We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018  Currently, the United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, focused on training local Kurdish forces to fight ISIS. Thanks to a recent string of successes, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are close to capturing the final major town held by ISIS east of the Euphrates. Nonetheless, according to the Department of Defense inspector general’s report, the number of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria could be as high as 30,000. Ever since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to launch a new offensive against American-backed Kurdish troops, Trump has reportedly been eager to pull out American troops. Trump argued the Turkish offensive could threaten US forces in Syria and reportedly prefers a rapid removal of all US forces, despite the warnings of senior security officers. President Trump has long desired to remove American troops from Syria, a promise of his presidential campaign. Pentagon officials reportedly argued the move would betray Kurdish allies who could soon be threatened by a Turkish military offensive. Officials also argued the US would cede its influence in Syria to Russia and Iran, diminishing US influence in the region.  Pentagon officials asserted that abandoning Kurdish allies could inhibit future efforts to regain the trust of local fighters, such as those in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen.  Details of the administration’s debate on Syria were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. “At this time, we continue to work by, with and through our partners in the region,” Colonel Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said Wednesday morning. The US will keep over 5,000 troops in Iraq, capable of launching strikes into Syria. In the past couple of weeks, the US has carried out air and artillery strikes from Iraq targeting ISIS in Syria. One Department of Defense official suggested Trump wants to divert attention from a series of legal challenges over the past week. The move has the potential to act as a distraction from the Russian investigation conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the sentencing of Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.

Spain remains Morocco’s primary export destination. Moroccan exports to its European neighbor increased by 6.2 percent in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.  Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) quoted data reportedly from the Statistics Office of the European Union (Eurostat) that Morocco exported nearly €5 billion worth of products to Spain in the nine months. Morocco’s imports of Spanish goods increased by 2.8 percent during the same period, reaching an overall worth of over €6 billion. MAP said that Spain imports “electrical equipment and clothing” from Morocco. Meanwhile, Morocco imports “fuels and lubricants, and mechanical components” from Spain. Spain is Morocco’s leading source of imports, with Spanish exports accounting for 36 percent of all EU exports to Morocco. Spain is followed by France, which accounts for 18.7 percent, and Germany at 9 percent. The Spanish Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Exporters (FEPEX) reported on December 4 that  Morocco is Spain’s largest non-EU fresh fruit and vegetables supplier with a total volume of 321,189 tons, worth €507 million. Up to September, Spain’s fresh fruits and vegetables imports from Morocco this year totaled 321,189 tons, an increase of 7 percent from January to September compared to the same period last year, added the same report. Morocco’s fresh fruit and vegetables exports to Spain, in the January-September period of each year, have grown 109 percent over the past five years. Both countries agreed to boost their bilateral cooperation after the first official visit of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco in November.

Rabat – A fire broke out on Tuesday evening near the Oulad Ziane bus station in Casablanca, where a migrant camp stands. According to a person at the scene, firefighters responded an hour after the fire started. A similar fire occurred a few months ago. The fire started in the migrants’ tents, destroying all their belongings. In July, a fire broke out in the camp when several gas tanks exploded, hours after another migrant camp in Fez caught fire. The majority of the migrants at the camp, several hundred, resettled on the same site after the first fire. One eyewitness said, “In my opinion, the first time it was a Moroccan who did it. The second time, it was another Moroccan, and the third time—it’s not something we [sub-Saharan] Africans would have done.” Another one said such incidents can happen in all “slums.”

Most migrants at the camp hail from the West African countries of Guinea, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Niger. Since 2014, Morocco has regularized thousands of undocumented migrants residing in the coun

Rabat – The unprecedented murder of two women tourists in Morocco’s High Atlas Mountains has shocked tourists and Moroccans alike, causing some local residents to say it will negatively affect tourism in all of Morocco. The tourists, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen from Denmark and Maren Ueland from Norway, were camping 10 kilometers from Imlil when they were found dead. The village of Imlil is known for its stunning views and as a base camp for hikers heading to Mount Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak. Are Moroccans worried that tourists will cancel their trips to the region? However, an employee at Bureau Des Guides Imlil, which offers guided tours in the mountains, told Morocco World News, “We have received no cancellation requests from tourists.” The employee did acknowledge the incident created “frustration” among locals. People “have been scared that the unprecedented incident would affect tourism in the region negatively,” said another Moroccan working in Imlil’s tourism industry. Despite the incident, he said that up until now, no tourist has canceled a reservation, and he had received two booking confirmations just this morning. Another person working in tourism in Marrakech, the nearest large city to Imlil, was unconcerned about his livelihood. He told MWN that “it will be hard for tourists to find an available hotel room in hotels in Marrakech and in the region, especially because many tourists have already booked places to spend their Christmas holiday.” In contrast, a riad manager in Fez was concerned about the long-term impact of the murders. Of course, he said, during the high season of Christmas, hotels will not experience many cancellations because tourists do not have many other options with holidays already booked. But he worried that because major international news sites, such as the BBC, the Guardian, and Al Jazeera, reported on the murder, potential future tourists may be put off. ‘There will always be good and bad’ In an informal Facebook poll created by Morocco World News, 54 percent of nearly 1,500 voters speculated the incident would negatively impact Moroccan tourism because it was “scary.” Forty-six percent thought Moroccan tourism would not be affected, believing it is generally safe to visit Morocco. Some of MWN’s international readers commented on the poll, saying that they feel “safer in Morocco” than in their homeland. “I feel safer in Morocco than I do in the UK and will continue to visit! … It happens everywhere,” wrote one commenter. In her view, the murders were an unfortunate one off incident that shouldn’t prevent people from “visiting such a beautiful country with wonderful people!” A Filipina national said she feels safe in Morocco, where she has been living for five years. “Anywhere we go there will always be good and bad. I love Morocco,” she said. Morocco is considered a low risk country according to the 2019 Travel Risk Map from the international risk expert International SOS. The map shows Morocco as safe as most European countries, the US, and Canada. Imlil is a popular region for local and international tourists who love outdoor activities. Hotels and riads near Imlil generally have 4 or 5 stars out of 5 on the American travel website Tripadvisor.  In a review posted this year, a tourist from London raved about Imlil’s “stunning scenery” after staying at a three-star bed and breakfast called Dar Imlil. Official statements: A rare crime Morocco’s embassy in Oslo has issued a statement expressing their condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims of the “terrible tragedy.” The embassy commented that all Moroccans are shocked by the “atrocity of the crime and its uniqueness in the region.” On Tuesday morning, the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) announced the arrest of a first suspect involved in the murder. The suspect was arrested in Marrakech. On the same day, a local told MWN that authorities arrested three suspects for the murder. The source added the suspects were camping in the same area where the women were murdered. The Norwegian ambassador to Morocco is “on her way to Marrakech” today, according to Norwegian outlet Aftenposten. Moroccan authorities, the news outlet said, have not requested any help in the investigation. However, “a very experienced policeman working at the embassy in Rabat” is investigating the crime. Morocco World News contacted the Norwegian embassy in Rabat to learn whether the government sent investigators to the crime scene. The embassy’s hotline was unreachable.

Rabat – On December 16, activists from the Environmental Justice Otepoti organized “a low-key gathering as a show of solidarity for the Sahrawi people” to protest the arrival of the “Triton Valk” carrier on Sunday. The NGO published a statement claiming that the bulk carrier is “carrying tonnes of phosphates stolen from Western Sahara.” A few members of the organization held banners, saying, “Caught red handed, stop stealing and stop buying blood phosphate.” It is not the first time a pro-Polisario NGO has protested phosphate shipments from Morocco, which Polisario objects to.  In 2017, Polisario filed a complaint against OCP, which exports Morocco’s phosphates, over a cargo shipment in Panama. A Panama court, however, denied Polisario’s claims of ownership on grounds of “insufficient evidence” and released the cargo. In May 2017, South Africa, known for its support for the Polisario Front, detained a phosphate shipment headed for New Zealand via Port Elizabeth after Polisario claimed the cargo was illegally taken from Western Sahara. The court decided that “phosphate ownership has never been legally held by the Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) and/or Phosphates de Boucreaa SA.” The court deemed the cargo illegally obtained in Western Sahara. OCP denounced the court’s decision because it prevented the group from selling the cargo to Ballance Agri Nutrients Limited of New Zealand. The group managed to retrieve the shipment from South Africa after the court failed to sell the cargo in an auction in March 2018.

Rabat – Morocco’s BCIJ has seized a boat loaded with cocaine in El Jadida, near Casablanca. Following the arrest of seven individuals linked to a Colombian criminal network that specializes in smuggling cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) has found the same network trying to store cocaine in the southern Dakhla and Boujdour region and make it their base for trafficking. The BCIJ discovered that the cocaine trafficking ring was attempting to airlift cocaine using small planes between Morocco’s southern region of Dakhla, Latin America, and Europe. The preliminary investigation revealed one of the suspects received aviation training. The organized crime group tried to establish friendships with royal gendarmes and navy officials to cover up their crimes, reported the daily Assabah. BCIJ seized materials used to power the aircraft used for cocaine trafficking, including over three tons of kerosene fuel, three large fuel pumps, two engines, and five generators. BCIJ also seized 46 barrels containing 2,700 liters of gasoline. Last Saturday, December 15, BCIJ located a farm in Boujdour, a city in the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region, used by the network for cocaine trafficking and storage.  Saturday’s operation followed the arrest of seven individuals working with the network in El Jadida. The police seized one ton of cocaine in their possession earlier this month.1111 The criminal network smuggled cocaine by sea on a merchant vessel from Latin America to Morocco, then transported the cocaine to El Jadida, near Casablanca, using a fishing vessel.

Rabat – Morocco’s Dakhla in Western Sahara will house a two-day vocational training forum, the first of its kind in the region. The will take place on December 21-22. The Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research will organize the forum, which will take place under the theme “the Governance of vocational training systems for employability and competitiveness in Africa.” The forum is in line with King Mohammed VI’s strategy to increase South-South cooperation. The event will serve as a platform for vocational training from various countries professionals to exchange expertise. It aims to create a model of partnership between African countries in order to promote access to vocational training for youth, according to the ministry. The forum will also be an opportunity to examine the issues and common challenges related to the governance of vocational training in Africa. King Mohammed VI  believes  that vocational training will  help curb the unemployment crisis in Morocco. Throughout the year, the King called on Morocco’s government to set up measures to meet youths employment demands. This follows changes in Morocco due to direct investment from abroad, particularly in renewable energies, the automotive industry and many other opportunities offered in the labor market. In October, the monarch instructed the government to create a committee in charge of suggesting specific solutions to curb youth unemployment. He also called for the government to put in place new vocational training programs, new training centers, and to reinforce youth entrepreneurship programs. The unemployment rate remains high among young people aged 15-24, representing 27.5 percent. Earlier this month, the secretary of state for higher education, Khalid Samadi, said that people who have degrees from vocational training schools are most likely to find jobs. He said that a field study by the Ministry of Education found that 63 percent of students with vocational training find jobs within nine months of graduation.

Rabat – Morocco has seen its libel complaints rejected by the French Cassation Court, the country’s highest judicial body.  The court is adamant that states are not entitled to the same rights as persons. In a plenary meeting on Friday, the court’s judges delivered rulings on three “priority matters of constitutionality” (QPC), which were mainly concerned with the defamation icomplaints that Morocco had lodged with French authorities. According to AFP, Morocco seized French judicial authorities to denounce what it perceived as an organized defamation campaign to tarnish the North African country’s image, especially in terms of human rights and democratic overtures. “Morocco’s complaints notably targeted [a number of] French journalists and Zakaria Moumni,” the newspaper noted. While Rabat is suing the French journalists for their perceived unfair, biased, and “libelous” coverage of Moroccan affairs, the kingdom targeted Moumni, a Rabat-born former kickboxing champion, for “falsely” accusing Moroccan security services of resorting to torture and abuse in detention centers. Moumni, who maintains he was “repeatedly tortured and raped” by Moroccan operatives between September 2010 and February 2012 when he visited his native country, has since been an avowed critic of the Moroccan security system.  Morocco has repeatedly sued the boxer for libel since 2015, but French judicial authorities have maintained that the case is “ineligible.” In the court’s latest decision after the Friday meeting, judges concluded that as far as libel law is concerned, “No state, French or foreign, can sue individuals.” It added: “The 29 July 1881 law [on freedom of speech] only condemns public defamation directed at individuals.” But Morocco, unsatisfied, rejected the Cassation Court’s ruling. The kingdom’s legal representatives argued that people should not hide behind the law to make slanderous remarks of an entire country. The court has scheduled a new hearing for April 12, 2019, giving Rabat the opportunity to appeal the latest decision. Given the Cassation Court’s history with complainant states on matters of defamation, a legal victory for Rabat seems unlikely.

Washington D.C – The non-binding global pact that was formally approved in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 11, ignores labor shortages in Europe, ducks the subject of orderly legal immigration, fuels existing fears of “brown” migrants invading “white” Europe, and would not protect the lives and rights of refugees. To the contrary, “Marrakech” has become, and will remain,  a call to arms for right wing, anti-immigrants and nationalist groups across Europe to mobilize their supporters and sympathizers. Rightwing populists are already inflaming  voters by claiming that the new pact gives the United Nation influence over Europe’s immigration policy and weakens individual European nations’ sovereign authority. This non-binding pact is more of a feel-good gesture and less of an effective policy. It is not worth the risk of creating an electoral marketing literature and a propaganda tool for the far-right to use as rallying cry to garner votes for every upcoming elections in Europe. The agreement that was signed by 164 nations will likely by exploited by some political groups to spread misinformation and push local anti-immigrant agendas, which may in turn concede national and regional electoral victories for the Right all across Europe. It is hard to see how this document tackles the status of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants currently living in legal limbo in countries that are signatory to the pacts. What about the fate of thousands of immigrants stuck in Libya and Morocco? Furthermore, the Pact gives false hope to future migrants and suggests that the passage to the European shores is easier and safer now. Similarly, it offers anti-immigrants groups a proof that the U.E. and the U.N. do not care about European citizens. Marrakech is the best thing that recently happened to the right wing establishment in Europe at a time when immigration is a hot issue in several key races across the continent.  It will play well with some domestic audiences that are not necessary xenophobe but rather economically weary. The Far-right in Austria, France, Italy, Spain and many Est-European nations will greatly benefits from this debate. The Pact may in fact provoke the fall of some coalition governments, as it happened in Belgium, and escalates existing political tensions in countries that ratified it. Since any nation can withdraw from the Pact at any time for any reason, it was politically reckless of the signatory members to include language vis-à-vis opening up legal migration. Such actions elevate anti-immigrant rhetoric, when in fact there is no real chance in the current political climate for any agreement that would ensure that people attempting cross-border journeys could do it in a legal and safe manner. The Unites State is a prime example on how a government turnover can lead to a change in position. The U.S. under President Barack Obama supported the 2016 draft declaration but the Trump administration rejected the final version and took the lead in encouraging others to snub Marrakech. With Marrakech looming large in the background, countries will continue bickering over how to manage migration giving the right a political advantage as the recent notable win  of the anti-immigrant  Vox party in Spain’s regional elections clearly demonstrate. It is true that to no one country can manage the migration flow around the world; however, a bureaucratic document with no legal teeth is not the answer at this specific time.*

Rabat – Moroccan-American woman, Iman Oubou has become the first Moroccan woman to ever be part of the Miss Universe selection committee during the 2018 Miss Universe beauty pageant held on December 17 December in Bangkok, Thailand.
Oubou who was Miss New York 2015, is a self-made entrepreneur, published scientist, and founder of women’s online platform “SWAAY.” Oubou is a holder of Master’s degree in science and Biomedical Engineering from University of Colorado at Denver, US. Speaking to Vogue magazine about the competition and her role as a jury member, Oubou explained that this year’s 67th Miss Universe pageant did not mean top “exclude” men’s voices by selecting an all-women jury. “It was never about “omitting” men’s voices or intentionally removing them but rather about showcasing a panel that reflects the organization’s commitment to improving opportunities for women personally and professionally,” she stated. Oubou named Miss Philippines Catriona Gray as Miss Universe 2018. Addressing the belief that beauty pageants are “shallow,” Oubou said that the competitions are no longer merely focused on beauty but have “evolved to become more about social change, leadership, community service, and being a voice for the voiceless.” The other female jury members next  Obou were Monique Lhullier, a Filipino-American fashion designer, Bui Simon, who was Miss Universe 1988 from Thailand, Janaye Ingram, Miss New Jersey of 2004, and Michelle McLean, Miss Universe 1992 from Namibia.

Rabat – An acrimonious disagreement between a Saudi and Moroccan members of parliament ignited a series of defiant exchanges at the recent gathering of Arab parliamentarians in Cairo, Egypt. Speaking to Moroccan outlet le 360, the ruling Justice and Development Party MP Abdellatif Benyacoub said that the fierce dialogue started because of his vehement objection to the introduction by the Saudi MP of four proposals in the final communiqué  without consulting other MPs. According to Benyacoub, Mishaal ben Fahm al Salami, the Saudi MP who is the current chair of the Arab parliament, condemned the French government’s handling of the Yellow Vests protests in one of his proposals. The clause pointed to France’s “state violence” and “human rights abuse.”   While angered by the fact that the Saudi MP made the additions without asking for other MPs’ opinions, Benyacoub told le 360 he could not stand the “vindictive” language Al-Salami used in condemning France. He suggested he felt that the condemnation was biased, uncalled for, and politically motivated. “I expressed to the Saudi president of the Arab parliament my reservations about the resolutions and requested the clause that condemned France be cancelled,” the Moroccan MP said. “I told him that his denunciation of France was unfounded and inappropriate.” But why would a Moroccan MP mount a fierce objection to draft proposals made in the Arab parliament to condemn a European country? Apparently aware that his statements are bound to be interpreted as a pro-France stance, Benyacoub said that he simply felt that the Cairo gathering had no legal right to interfere in political developments in France.  Not only was the Arab parliament interfering in France’s internal affairs, but democracy and human rights in France are more “robustly respected than they are in many Arab countries.” “I said that France’s democracy is solid and exemplary… unlike many Arab countries where human rights are not respected.” To the Moroccan’s pile of reservations and objections, however, the Saudi MP is believed to have answered that “the Arab parliament has the right to have opinions on any matter.” Was it all a pretext? But what if MPs’ disagreements on France’s handling of the Yellow Vests hide something much deeper? Did the strained bilateral ties between Morocco and Saudi Arabia play a role in the two MPS’ war of words? Morocco may have brought the point of order to the floor, but the North African country’s delegation was not alone is its opposition to the Saudi’s proposals. MPs representing Iraq and Qatar were among Morocco’s main supporters.  Delegates who shared the Moroccan MP’s position are said to have pointed out that the “vindictive” Saudi MP had no genuine interest in France’s police’s handling of the Yellow Vests protests. Instead, they argued, Al-Salami wanted to “use the platform of the Arab parliament to denounce Paris in revenge for France’s condemnation of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.” At the G20 summit earlier this month, France’s Emmanuel Macron was seen telling Saudi Arabia’s MBS off for supposedly “not listening” to the French president. “You never listen,” Macron told the Saudi prince, according a widely circulated footage of the pair’s brief conversation. However, a more important factor of the MPs’ swiping at each other may be the increasingly cold relations between Rabat and Riyadh.  This month alone, a number of developments have brought to light the possibility of an impending rift in what used to be a “strategic,” “natural,” and “important” alliance.  King Mohammed VI snubbed MBS’s request for an audience, eliciting rapturous comments from Moroccans who thanked the King en masse for his move. Most recently, the website of the Saudi football federation featured Morocco’s map without Western Sahara, sparking rage and resentment in Morocco. That was months after Saudi Arabia lobbied against Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Whether these series of head-on collisions between Saudi and Moroccan positions are deliberate and connected is debatable.  What seems certain, though, is that a lot of what has been happening of late between Rabat and Riyadh suggest that the rift between the two allies may take time to come about, but it will come—at least if Rabat reaches a point where it can’t stand Riyadh’s continued provocations.

Rabat – The number of Chinese tourists in Morocco rose from 10,000 in 2015 to nearly 200,000 people this year, according to the minister of tourism Mohammed Sajid. He met with the Chinese deputy minister of culture and tourism, Li Jinzao, on Sunday in Marrakech.

Sajid said the two countries will sign an agreement this week to organize a cultural and tourism year of Morocco in China and another event in honor of China in Morocco in 2020.

”This clear progress in bilateral relations came after King Mohammed VI visited China in 2016,” the minister said. ”The number of Chinese tourists in Morocco surged after it removed visas for Chinese nationals,” added Sajid. 

The Chinese deputy minister is making an official four-day visit to the Kingdom. He said that relations between the two countries are undergoing sustained development and announced a Chinese cultural center in Rabat is due to open soon. In September, Sajid met the Civil Aviation Administration of China administrator to discuss a new deal to open a direct flight between the countries and remove airspace restrictions.

Washington D.C. – Less than a week after the roundtable held under the supervision of the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton announced the Trump administration’s plan to confront the threat that China and Russia pose to U.S. interests. Bolton said that the Trump administration wants to stop funding long-term UN peacekeeping operations that have failed to achieve their goals, including the UN peacekeeping mission to the Western Sahara, known as MINURSO. The U.S. official spent more than five minutes discussing the Western Sahara conflict and the failure of the MINURSO mission to reach its objective. Bolton stated that he was disappointed with MINURSO and the Security Council’s inability to resolve the conflict. He used the same language he had used in his memoir “Surrender is Not an Option”, published 10 years ago, in which he sharply criticized the UN’s failure to find a formula that could enable the parties to end the conflict. In his speech at an event hosted at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., Bolton said that the Trump administration would break with the UN’s reluctance to end the conflicts on the agenda of the Security Council. Presenting MINURSO as his “favorite” example of UN missions that have failed to accomplish their end goals, he said that the Security Council has lacked the strong political will needed to introduce a new approach and find a definitive solution to the conflict. According to Bolton, the U.S. emphasized last April the need to renew MINURSO’s mandate for just six months, in order to send a clear message to the parties involved in the conflict and to the Security Council: The U.S. will not allow the UN to continue to handle the conflict without setting clear objectives. Bolton’s tone and the attention he gave to the Western Sahara issue in his speech suggest that he will monitor the issue in the coming months and make sure he leaves his personal imprint on it. There is no doubt that that the United States will put more pressure on the Security Council and the parties to in the conflict to show genuine willingness and readiness to work in a spirit of compromise to reach a mutually acceptable political solution. Moroccan diplomacy should be mobilized more vigorously than ever and should work proactively to prevent any developments that might undermine the efforts Morocco has made in recent years to create a new dynamic that is oriented toward Moroccan interests. John Bolton will undoubtedly seek to accomplish what he failed to do when he was assistant to former UN envoy James Baker and when he served as U.S. ambassador to the UN from 2005 to 2006. In his memoir and on many other occasions, Bolton has made it clear that he was dissatisfied with the U.S. State Department’s bureaucracy, which prevented him from pressuring the parties to the conflict to find a final solution. As the national security adviser working closely with the president in his everyday work, Bolton now has the power and authority he had never before enjoyed to affect U.S. foreign policy orientations in ways that align with his own positions and principles. Bolton is known for having strong and opinionated positions and for his keenness to translate them into real action. Algeria knew that when it hired the public relations firm Keene Consulting owned by David Keene, who is close to Bolton. It was Bolton who drew Keene’s interest to Algeria and the Western Sahara issue 20 years ago. Because John Bolton and David Keene agree on the Western Sahara conflict, one can argue that Keene’s influence, ever since he engaged with Algeria on November 1, is paying off and has been apparent in Bolton’s overtone at the Heritage Foundation. It was striking that Bolton mentioned the referendum in his keynote address, while the Security Council has progressively put this option on the back burner since the beginning of the political process in 2007. This mirrors Algeria and Polisario’s attempt to bring the political process back to the beginning, and push the Security Council once again to recognize that self-determination, as understood by Algeria and Polisario, remains among the options on the table to end the conflict. Consequently, Morocco should act urgently to prevent Algeria from undermining the political process and distancing itself from any involvement in the conflict. Morocco should also reconsider the public relations firms it has hired in recent years and examine their ability to communicate the Moroccan position to U.S. officials. After Algeria made a deal with a close associate of the national security adviser, Morocco should consider hiring a company close to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Bolton has significant influence within the administration, but Pompeo is also one of the executive’s most trusted cabinet members. Linking with the U.S. secretary of state would bring some balance within the Trump administration regarding Morocco. Pompeo could ensure that no decisions are made that could affect relations with Morocco. At this stage, Morocco does not need people who give compliments or repeat the timeworn fact that Morocco was the first country that recognized the independence of the United States. Morocco needs people who have influence within the Washington D.C. political establishment and who can convince the Trump administration to support Morocco’s political efforts and the concessions it has made since 2007 to pave the way towards a mutually acceptable political solution. Morocco needs to get closer to the U.S. Congress, in particular to the Senate where he has long been unable to convince American legislators of its position on the conflict. The months ahead will likely see unprecedented competition between Morocco and Algeria to garner the support of U.S. foreign policy establishment. How deftly and effectively each of the two countries seek to convince the U.S. government will play a determining role in defining the American position on the conflict next April when MINURSO’s mandate comes up for renewal.

Rabat – US attorney general of Idaho Lawrence Wasden and Utah’s attorney general Sean Reyes have co-written a opinion piece, emphasizing the role of Morocco as a leading counter-terrorism country. Published on December 14 by Salt Lake Tribune, the opinion piece points out Morocco’s steady support for the US’s security efforts in the MENA region.  The opinion piece analyzes Morocco’s efforts in fighting cyber terrorism and criminal crimes, such as human trafficking. Both officials were tasked to visit Morocco and learn about its “efforts to counter human trafficking, cyber terrorism, and transnational organized crimes.” Referring to their trip to Morocco, Wasden and Reyes said that they found Morocco to be “a country that cares deeply about security and rule of law, in a region hostile to both.” The officials also spoke about their meeting with the governor of the Dakhla province in Western Sahara. They highlighted that the region has “witnessed a variety of development projects” in recent years, hinting at Morocco’s increasing efforts to improve living standards and employment prospects for the region’s locals. Ryes and Wasden emphasized the credibility of Morocco’s autonomy plan introduced in 2007 to the United Nations. Both Attorneys general recognized that the autonomy plan received “large bipartisan support in the US Congress” as it represents a “win-win compromise solution” to the conflict. Arguing that Morocco is the US’s most reliable ally in the region, the American officials warned Trump’s administration against losing their North African ally. The US should intensify its support to Moroccan positions as no other countries in the region are as committed as Morocco to the values and interests that the US shares with allies, they said of the conflict in Western Sahara. Morocco’s efforts in countering terrorism and radicalization, “underscore the need for continued US support to help Morocco resolve the Western Sahara conflict,” the noted.  “Although this dispute remains a frozen conflict with seemingly little relevance amidst a variety of hotspots in different parts of the world, it remains nevertheless pertinent today as it threatens to undermine a vital U.S. ally in North Africa.” For all the pro-Morocco sentiment in the opinion piece-and increasingly in conservative circles in the US-it is still unclear what they direction the Trump administration will take regarding the conflict. Last week, Bolton expressed frustration over the continuity of the conflict, criticizing the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO.  “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Bolton wondered with frustration. Morocco-US alliance on counterterrorism The officials also touted Morocco’s counterterrorism and the fight against radicalization as key assets that the US should take into account.   According to them, the cooperation will deepen cooperation in both “military and security” between the two countries. Morocco’s strategy to fight against terrorism has attracted interests among counter-terrorism experts worldwide. The North African country cooperates with a host of international security services, including in the US, Spain, and France. In October, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said that the US allies itself with Morocco in the fight against terrorism and in maintaining security.” Ros-Lehtinen indicated that Morocco is a strong country with which the US shares “the same problems.” The opinion piece also recalled Morocco’s decision to cut ties with Iran over Hezbollah’s support for the Polisario Front.    “This should not come as a surprise given that Iran has been seeking to destabilize a number of states, in an effort to weaken the U.S. allies in the Middle East and North Africa, and in so doing, creates a security risk to our friends and our nation,” the commentary added. They emphasized that the US “must” back Morocco as the country leads the way in terms of “reforms and as an exporter of peace while at the same time addressing the challenges brought by regional instability, rising extremism and external threats from Iran,” the officials concluded

Rabat – The study warns that the number of individuals living with dementia will continue to increase in the coming years, which will put pressure on the country’s economy. Although the country does not provide official statistics on the prevalence of dementia or Alzheimer’s, the study estimated that the rate of Alzheimer’s disease is not as high as other countries.  According to the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) report, deaths caused by Alzheimer’s or dementia reached 9,847 in the same year, representing 5.60 percent of total deaths in the country, ranking Morocco 16th globally. Worldwide, about 50 million people are living with dementia, which causes “deterioration in memory, thinking, behavior and the ability to perform everyday activities.” Nearly 10 million new cases of dementia are registered every year around the world, according to WHO. While dementia mainly affects elderly people, WHO states that it is “not a normal part of aging.” Meanwhile, Alzheimer’s disease, a type of dementia, is a disease that degenerates brain cells, resulting in the patient’s gradual loss of memory, speech, movement, and the ability to think clearly. The total estimated cost of dementia worldwide is $818 billion according to 2015 statistics by the international nonprofit organization, Alzheimer Disease International. The cost represents 1.09 percent of global GDP in 2015, and mayl reach more than $1 trillion by 2018. In Morocco, there is insufficient diagnosis equipment for dementia.

Rabat – Spanish national police officers arrested an Algerian man on Monday for allegedly being a member of ISIS, in Vitoria (northern Spain), according to the Spanish Ministry of the Interior.

The arrested Algerian also sought to promote the return of terrorist fighters to Europe and to collaborate with terrorists in Syria’s conflict zones, the statement added. 
The Algerian national who is president of a cultural association was arrested in the city of Vitoria, northern Spain, during a police operation with the support of the Spanish intelligence services and Europol. He planned to set up a school for indoctrinating children into terrorism, according to the same source.

The man was receiving unemployment benefits and resources from a business, says the statement, adding that the investigation revealed that he intended to use his income for people he indoctrinated. According to ABC, he had a history of violence, having assaulted two police officers, which he was arrested for initially.

Rabat – Plans were announced to celebrate the Taskiwine dance this Saturday. The celebration will take place in Taroudant, a small city in Southern Morocco between Agadir and Ouarzazate. The name originates from “Tiskt,” the powder horn each dancer wears on their left shoulder.  Dancers primarily move their shoulders to the rhythm of flutes and tambourines, while retelling old stories of heroism and bravery.    Taskiwine, a traditional Amazigh martial art dance, was declared a part of the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage last year. The list was made to highlight cultural practices around the world that were potentially in danger of being lost due to globalization, according to UNESCO. Thankfully in recent years, “there has been a growing collective awareness within communities…to safeguard the practice,” says UNESCO. In addition to Saturday, organizers are also planning another festival in August of next year. Although the tradition is still only practiced by a small number of tribes in the far Western Atlas mountains, efforts are coming in from all over Morocco due to the UNESCO designation, which instructs “communities, state institutions, civil society and all relevant actors to work together to revitalize, safeguard and promote this ancestral dance,” according to sources.

Rabat – Financial Times has made a list on the reasons why people should live in Casablanca.  Describing Casablanca as Africa’s ‘financial powerhouse,” the magazine recalled the Global Financial Centres Index, which listed Morocco as Africa’s leading financial center. According to the magazine Casablannca’s success “can be attributed in part” to Casablanca Finance City (CFC) being created in 2010. CFC is a Moroccan business hub, which has several partnerships with financial centers in Singapore, London, Paris, Montreal, and Busan. Its role is to attract and encourage international investors to expand in Africa by offering an integrated ecosystem. Managed by the Casablanca Finance City Authority (CFCA), the leading investment received the Economic Francophone Award in Brussels, as a Moroccan financial center with Pan-African vocation. Besides the business assets of the city, Casablanca’s architecture is one reason why people should choose it as a place of residence, according to Financial Times. The newspaper said that the city’s architecture and culture reflect the Casablanca’s rich history,  because it “has been governed by the Roman empire, the British, the Spanish and, more recently, the French, who left when Morocco gained independence in 1956.” Adorned by large white buildings, the city has a “mixture of art deco and Moorish styles, wrote the Financial Times. The publication also mentioned the beautifully situated Hassan II mosque, which is the second largest in Africa. Culinary diversity is another reason to fall for the city, according to the magazine. “From fresh seafood and French cooking at the celebrated Taverne du Dauphin to traditional Moroccan cuisine at Le Cuisto Traditionnel and even the famous camel meat sandwiches at Ibil Snack on Rue Jura in the city’s Maarif district, you never need eat the same thing twice.” Cost of living in the city of Casablanca is also seductive. According to the magazine, the cost of living in Casablanca is 60 percent lower than in London. Last but not least, Casablanca is heaven for surfers. “With its warm summers, mild winters and long Atlantic coastline, Casablanca is a surfers’ paradise — so much so that Stab, a surfing magazine, named Casablanca one of the world’s top 10 cities for surfers,” according to the Financial Times.

Rabat – Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has explained Morocco’s approach to migration, terrorism, South-South cooperation in Africa, and returning ISIS jihadists. In an interview with BBC journalist Said Shehata following the migration conference in Marrakech on December 10, Bourita clarified misconceptions about African migrants and migration in general. The minister said that “migration is a natural, universal phenomena” and treating migrants as criminals is “wrong” because they are victims of circumstances or human trafficking networks. Bourita considered that one of the forms of misinformation or “exaggerations” about African migrants is the belief that “migration is a raid from the south toward the north, or that Africa is the primary source of irregular migrants.” There are an estimated 256 million migrants globally, both documented and undocumented. From the 256 million migrants, 13 percent, or 36 million, are Africans. “From those 36 million, 80 percent or 30 million people immigrate within Africa,” Bourita said. Bourita added that from the remaining 6 million migrants, many immigrate to different parts of the world, but 80 percent of them are documented. Only the remaining 0.1 percent are irregular African migrants who leave Africa. “African irregular migrants represent only 0.1 percent of world migrants in the US, Arab countries, and Europe.” During the discussion about Morocco’s campaign to improve the situation of African migrants in the country, Bourita reported that “in 2016-2017, Morocco approved 50,000 (90 percent) of 60,000 requests from migrants wishing to improve their situations, especially in the case of women, children, and people with special needs.” Today Morocco is “no longer just a transit country,” for migrants seeking European countries. “Morocco is also a migrant destination.” Morocco wants to improve the lives of African migrants and give vulnerable, irregular migrants the opportunity to live in the country legally. Regularized migrants are now able to go to schools and access health care and the job market. Bourita asserted that there are five million Moroccans who live abroad, and Morocco wants African migrants in the country to enjoy rights and good quality of life as much as it wishes for Moroccans abroad to do so. “Morocco is an African country with African roots and history,” stated Bourita. He added that Morocco’s relationship with the continent is that of solidarity and a sense of belonging rather than one built on “benefits.” Morocco wants to invest in Africa “because Morocco believes in Africa’s future and in South-South cooperation” said Bourita, quoting King Mohammed VI’s saying that “Africa must first believe in Africa.” “South-South cooperation is an important part of any development strategy in Africa, and it is not about small projects.” Bourita added: “Morocco and Africa now cooperate on military training and security to counter crime and terrorism.” While many reckon that “Africa is a hopeless continent with nothing but problems,” King Mohammed VI has emphasized Morocco’s relationship with African countries in terms of economic, political, and security cooperation ever since he ascended to the throne. Bourita noted that “King Mohammed VI is perhaps the only leader who made 50 visits to Africa, to more than 30 countries.” “Morocco also shares a spiritual relationship with eastern Africa, in terms of spreading a moderate Islam.” When it comes to cooperation on education, Bourita said that every year, 10,000 African students arrive in Morocco to study on scholarships. Bourita said Morocco wants the world to know that Africa today is “an opportunity and not a problem as it is now on the brink of evolution.” “Africa shoulders its responsibility and does not want to become a burden to the world. Africa is a chance for the world. Morocco’s approach to Africa is like no other because it is built on trust and a sense of belonging. It is complete in all sides including political, spiritual, economic and humanitarian ones,” Bourita told BBC. Morocco invested MAD 3 billion in Africa in 2015. Compared to other countries investing in the continent how does Morocco compete? “We are not in a competition with anyone,” Bourita said. The official explained that Morocco “belongs” in the continent and does not “compete” with it. “Other countries investing in Africa are from outside the continent, while Morocco’s relationship with Africa has a direct influence on the country.” Yet, Morocco’s strategic relations are diversified and do not stop at the continent. It is proved through visits and partnerships with other Arab countries, China, Russia, South America, and the UK. Morocco is also no longer only reliant on exports because it is developing in the domain of communication. Bourita gave the example of Morocco’s growing telecommunication company, Maroc Telecom, and the national airline company, Royal Air Maroc, which makes 30 trips to Africa. Bourita added that “Moroccan banks also became open to other countries in the continent.” According to Bourita, the efforts of the Moroccan security forces, and Morocco’s spreading of a moderate Islam have played a role in curbing terrorism in the country. “Fighting poverty has also played a big role in making Morocco a leader in fighting terrorism since 5 years ago.” He also spoke about Moroccan “control” of social media. “There are countries that are stronger than us technologically, but curbing terrorism is not about control only. We use social media to spread moderate Islam against ISIS,” Bourita explained. The 2018 Global Terrorism Index listed Morocco among the countries least impacted by terrorism. Morocco now ranks 132nd out of 163 in the 2018 terrorism index, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. Around 1,200 Moroccan jihadists came back or want to come back to Morocco from Iraq and Syria, according to Bourita. Morocco monitors how they get travel documents, where they depart from, who receives them, and where they get training. Morocco also believes in reintegrating women fighters, the wives of jihadists, and their children.

Rabat – The deficit increase is due to a larger rise of imports over exports, up MAD 35.36 billion, and MAD 22.08 billion, respectively. Morocco’s debt-service coverage ratio was 57.2 percent in the period, compared with 56.7 percent in the previous year. The Foreign Exchange Office (FEO) reported the figures in its monthly foreign trade indicators for November 2018. Morocco’s increase in imports was mainly driven by the purchases of energy products, up 18.4 percent to MAD 18.4 billion; purchases of processing goods, up 7.8 percent to MAD 7.8 billion; and finished consumer products, up 7.1 percent to MAD 6.5 billion. The three import categories represent 73.3 percent of the total increase in imports. Exports also increased by 9.7 percent to MAD 249.04 billion in the first 11 months of 2018. The rise can be attributed to increased exports in all sectors, but particularly that of automotive, up by MAD 5.73 billion, phosphates and derivatives, up MAD 5.3 billion; and agriculture and food, up MAD 3.06 billion. The FEO pointed out that the three export categories represent 63.8 percent of the total increase in exports, noting that the aviation, textile and leather sectors, recorded an increase of 1.46 percent and 1.36 percent, respectively. Morocco’s Foreign Direct Investments reached MAD 31,82 billion in 2018, up 36.7 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. This performance is attributed to an incline of revenues to reach MAD 11.48 billion, and expenditures increasing by 2.93 percent, said the Foreign Exchange Office which has published its preliminary indicators. Remittance from Moroccans living abroad decreased by 1.7 percent, reaching MAD 59.65 billion at the end of November 2018. The travel balance recorded a decrease of 1.8 percent, reaching MAD 49.7 billion between January and November 2018, compared to MAD 50.62 billion during the same period of 2017.

By Zakaria Ouadghiri Rabat – The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Monday a two-year agreement for Morocco under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) for an amount of $2.97 billion. This is the fourth PLL agreement since 2012.

According to the statement by Mitsuhiro Furusawa, IMF Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair of the Board, Morocco has made considerable progress in reducing its domestic vulnerability in recent years.

“Growth has been robust in 2018 and is expected to accelerate gradually over the medium term, assuming we see an improvement in external conditions and sustained progress in implementing reforms,” Furusawa added.

Introduced in 2011, the PLL responds to the liquidity needs of member countries that have a strong record of economic policy execution, but remain vulnerable in some respects. 

The PLL builds on the Precautionary Credit Line, designed to meet the needs of countries that have some remaining vulnerabilities that preclude them from using the Flexible Credit Line (FCL). The FCL was designed for crisis-prevention and crisis-mitigation lending for countries with very strong policy frameworks and track records in economic performance.

To date, only two countries, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Morocco, have used the PLL.

The IMF approved the third PLL, worth $3.42 billion, in July 2016, which expired last July. Morocco signed the first agreement in August 2012, for an amount of $6.21 billion, while the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves were under significant pressure at the time. July 2014 saw the approval of the second 24-month agreement for $5 billion.

Rabat – Algerian authorities are sounding the alarm bell for the energy-rich nation, saying that the country may lose its gas exporter status as early as 2022. Mustapha Guitouni, Algeria’s energy minister, made the announcement in a speech yesterday. Guitouni said that Algeria may not be able to meet the requirements of the international market if exportation continues at its current pace.  If nothing changes now, the country’s gas depletion ratio will reach “irreversible” proportions by 2022, the minister announced. The minister, who said he is “worried about the future” of the country’s gas reserves, said that the worrying developments are mainly due to excessive national consumption. The country must strike a balance between moderately satisfying its internal energy needs and keeping its stature as a leading gas exporter, Guitouni offered. “If we continue to consume [gas] as this rate, by 2022 we will not able to export to foreign markets; we will only have enough for our internal needs…. Algeria produces 130 billion cubic meters of gas and half is consumed on the national market,” he said. Meanwhile, he added that of the total volume of gas that the country produces, “30 percent have to be kept in the wells to keep the system active.” In addition, the state “heavily subsidizes” gas consumed by Algerians, putting a great financial burden on the state. And bearing in mind that gas consumption on the national level has risen by 10 percent annually in the past five years, the government is spending enormous sums to maintain the consumption level of Algerian households at its current level, Guitouni suggested. Last year, Algeria produced 100 million cubic meters of gas on a daily basis. Nearly half of that number, 45 million, was used by Algerian households. The minister worried that consumption level is rising more rapidly than production level, and the government will not be able to sustain the current configuration of Algerian gas market. But what will Algiers do to both satisfy the consumption demands of its population and maintain its exporter status? The minister suggested one option is to introduce new tax measures on gas consumption.  The objective is to either curb national consumption level or decrease the state’s subsidy burden. But the measure will unlikely be fully implemented, given Algeria’s “rentier regime” whose survival mainly depends on state largesse and generous tax cuts. Guitouni’s alarming predictions come a month after the publication of an equally grim study on Algeria’s economic prospects.  But the report’s predictions are even more sinister than the minister’s, as the findings indicated that deep economic crises would hit the North African country as early as 2019 if bold and radical changes are not implemented.

Rabat – A local from the village of lmlil told Morocco World News that law enforcement arrested three suspects involved in the killing of two women from Norway and Denmark near Mount Toubkal. Authorities are now bringing the suspects to demonstrate how they perpetrated the crime in Imlil, a village in the High Atlas Mountains, said the source. The source said that the three arrested males are from Marrakech. “The suspects were camping in the same area that the murder took place,” he said, adding that “witnesses saw the group at night as they were heading to the camp area.” The source added that the police identified the suspects through surveillance cameras placed in local shops in the village. One of the suspects, according to the source, also left his identity card behind at the camp where he and his friends were staying. Earlier today, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation arrested the first suspect in Marrakech. Tourists in the area found the bodies of the murder victims. “A local guide met the tourists crying and they told him what they saw.” The guide called the Royal Gendarmerie to report the crime. The source told MWN that authorities are still getting the guide’s full statement. The source excluded robbery as the motive of the crime, as none of the victims’ belongings were missing. However, he said, “sexual assault may have been the motive for the crime.” One of the women, 24 year old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, came from Denmark to Morocco against her family’s wishes. In an interview with Danish news sources, Jespersen’s mother said that they pleaded with her to avoid Morocco “because of the chaotic situation.”  Information from Jespersen’s Facebook account showed she studied to become a travel guide in Norway prior to traveling to Morocco. The last post on her Facebook was excitedly announcing her trip. The status reads “Dear friends, [I am] going to Morocco in december. Any of you guys whos around by then or any mountain friends who knows something about Mount Toubkal?” The other victim, 28 years old Maren Ueland, traveled from Norway with Jespersen, according to Norwegian media.  Ueland’s mother said in an interview that both girls were studying together at the University of South-Eastern Norway. They left Norway on December 9th to spend their holiday backpacking in Morocco.  The women were found in their tent, located about six miles from Imlil, with “signs of violence on their necks,” according to the Interior Ministry Authorities, who proceeded to close down the entire area. Morocco is statistically one of the safest African countries, leaving locals noticeably shocked by the murder of the two women.

Rabat – Feeling their complaints about the 2019 Finance Bill were ignored, Morocco’s butane gas distributors have promised to stop delivering gas bottles to shops across Morocco beginning January 1. The gas distributors sent a message to the head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, expressing disagreement and complaints about the 2019 Finance Bill which enforces monetary fines on gas distributors who do not secure bills from customers. Those who do not collect bills from customers will not benefit from the Value Added Tax (VAT). The distributors complained to the government that some customers may refuse to give the receipts to distributors who will have to pay fines unjustly.  Although the gas suppliers decided not to deliver gas bottles until the government finds a solution, they said they will keep their factories open for customers looking to buy. The 2019 Finance Bill aims to achieve a growth rate of 3.2 percent in GDP, based on an estimated average price of $560 per ton of butane gas and an assumption of a 70-million-hectare cereal crop. The government allocated MAD 17.67 billion to subsidize butane gas, sugar, and flour. The figure is a significant increase of MAD 4.65 billion from the 2018 budget. Drawing from the country’s major boycott campaign in April against high prices of Afriquia gasoline, Sidi Ali (mineral water), and Centrale Danone (dairy products), could the strikes lead to a brand new boycott by the gas distributors? Butagaz, marketed by the downstream petroleum company Vivo Energy, is the main butane gas supplier in Morocco. The company provides butane gas bottles of 3 kilograms and 13 kilograms. Founded in 2011, Vivo Energy Maroc has 330 service stations and 600 employees.

Rabat – Moroccans account for 7 percent of the real estate transactions in Spain. British and French buyers acquire 14 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The volume of transactions by Moroccans increased significantly in the first six months of 2018, up by 28 percent compared to the same period in 2017, making it the largest increase observed among foreigners, according to statistics from the General Council of the Spanish Notary. The average real estate price acquired by Moroccans in Spain amounts to €693 per square meter for residents and to €1,606 per square meter for non-residents. Foreigners made 18 percent of the total number of real estate transactions recorded in Spain between June 2017 and June 2018. Other EU citizens made two-thirds of the foreign transactions.  Moroccans made 7 percent of the total transactions, Chinese 4 percent, and Russians 3 percent. The region of Aragon saw the largest increase in real estate purchases, up by 31 percent. Other regions also saw large increases, including Extremadura (27 percent), Murcia (21 percent), and Castilla La Mancha (20 percent). However, the largest decreases were found in the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, both down by about 11 percent. The General Council of the Spanish Notary explained that Spain’s low-interest rates and the low prices in most parts of Spain attract foreigners to buy real estate.

Rabat – Morocco’s BCIJ arrested a suspect on Tuesday morning involved in the killing of two women from Denmark and Norway, who have not yet been named. The suspect was arrested in Marrakech. The preliminary investigation led to the suspect being identified. He is now in custody for further investigation into other possible suspects. The murder took place in an isolated area, 10 kilometers from the village of Imlil in the Atlas Mountains. On Monday, Moroccan authorities found the bodies of the two tourists, who came to the area to camp. A local said that the tourists arrived in Imlil on Wednesday, December 12. The source said that the tourists did not have a guide, which is generally recommended.  “The victims were killed in the same place where they spent their first night,” he added. The local said that the women had returned to the place where they spent their first night, planning to leave the following day. A statement from the Ministry of the Interior said today that the victims’ necks showed evidence of knife wounds. After the incident, a tourist told Morocco World News that the victims were camping “near the Club Alpin Francais (CAF) refuge at the base of Toubkal.” Several Moroccan news outlets alleged that the victims were raped, although the investigation is still underway and nothing is known definitively. The motive remains unknown. The incident is unprecedented as no reported murders have been committed against tourists before. Mount Toubkal, as the highest mountain in North Africa is a popular destination globally for hiking and camping. The 2019 Travel Risk listed Morocco among the safest countries for tourists. The Travel Risk Map said that Morocco is as safe as most European countries, the US, and Canada, having a low-risk level. According to the map, all Moroccan cities are low risk, except some southern provinces in Western Sahara, which are designated as medium risk. Morocco, according to the map, is the only country with a low-risk level in North Africa. Are women safe to travel alone in Morocco? Morocco receives thousands of tourists from across the world annually. According to the 2018 Travel Trends report, a google search for “solo female travel” returns more than 2.45 million search results on google.    The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), which operates in cooperation with the US Department of State, shared statistics from the Moroccan government on criminal cases, saying that “the government of Morocco’s 2017 crime statistics record 559,035 reported cases, and 583,344 cases sent to courts.”  The report added that the most common crimes are robberies, purse snatching, and harassment of women. The crimes are commonly “perpetrated by criminals who primarily operate in high-traffic and high-density areas.”  However, in an overview of the Crime and Safety report on Morocco, OSAC said that crime in the country is only “a moderate concern, particularly in major cities and tourist areas.”

Rabat – Spanish news outlet Diarodesvilla shared statistics from the Spanish Ministry of Interior, saying that by the end of October, 10,060 irregular Moroccan migrants had arrived in Spain so far this year, up from 1,310 in the same period in 2016. The news outlet reported that 90 percent of the migrants arrived in Spain by sea to Andalusia and the rest to the Canary Islands. The news outlet added that some of the irregular migrants returned to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta and Melilla, where they asked for asylum. Moroccan migration might increase in the coming years as a new Gallup survey has estimated that Morocco would lose 19 percent of its adult population and 29 percent of its 15 to 29-year-olds if migration were completely possible. To help ease the pressure of migration on Morocco, the European Union said that it will grant financial aid to Morocco to help combat irregular migration. The EU will give Morocco €148 million in the coming days, according to a statement from the EU Commission. The statement, issued on December 14, said that the EU is currently “stepping up its assistance to Morocco to combat irregular migration in a context of increased migratory pressures along the western Mediterranean route.” According to El Pais, Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE) said that Moroccan immigration “peaked 10 years ago as there were 70,000 arrivals of migrants.” In 2017 39,000 migrants arrived in Spain from Morocco. Spanish and Moroccan news outlets reported today that Spain has dismantled a Moroccan human trafficking network operating between Spain and Morocco. The suspects involved in the network, all of which were Moroccans, were arrested. EFE reported that network has been labeling itself as a “travel agency” based in Larache, a city near Tangier in northern Morocco. The suspects charged the irregular migrants a minimum of €2,500 per passenger.

Rabat – Spain has dismantled a Moroccan network that trafficked 600 irregular migrants from Morocco to Spain in 2018. EFE reported that Spain arrested seven Moroccans for their alleged ties with the criminal network. The news outlet said that the network had been labeling itself as a “travel agency” based in Larache, a city near Tangier in northern Morocco. The suspects charged the irregular migrants a minimum price of €2,500 per passenger. According to the Spanish news outlet, one of the seven Moroccan suspects is a woman. Four suspects have had their residency status regularized in Spain. According to Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE)  Moroccan immigration “peaked 10 years ago, as there were 70,000 arrivals of migrants. In 2017, 39,000 migrants arrived in Spain from Morocco.” Migration has led to strengthened cooperation between Moroccan and Spanish security services.  Following his first official visit to Rabat on November 19, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez attended the global migration conference in Marrakech in December and discussed the issue of irregular migration. The two prime ministers reaffirmed their shared goals: To promote regular over  irregular migration and to integrate migrants into each of their host countries. During his first visit to Morocco, Sanchez announced his country’s intention to strengthen and modernize the border with Morocco in order to combat irregular migration.

Rabat –The government of Qatar has reached an agreement with UNHCR to rehabilitate thousands of displaced Yemeni refugees who have fled the civil war plaguing their country since 2014. Under the agreement, Qatar will provide shelter to 26,000 displaced refugees from “one of the poorest countries in the Middle East,” according to UNHCR. The UNHCR, which has called the war in Yemen “a humanitarian catastrophe,” reports that nearly 200,000 Yemenis have fled to neighboring countries. Over 22 million are in dire need of humanitarian assistance while 2 million others are “deprived of basic needs.” The UN body noted that the despair and squalor that have resulted from the war in Yemen have made millions “lose hope” as civilians continue to “bear the brunt of the crisis.” More surprisingly perhaps, the war-torn Middle Eastern country is home to 280,000 “desperate” refugee and asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa. The Qatar-UNHCR deal amounts to $3 billion in financial terms and may mitigate the dire consequences of the humanitarian crisis that has paralyzed Yemen. The deal was struck yesterday at the Doha Economic Forum. UNHCR and two Qatari organizations, Qatar Development Fund and Qatar Charity, signed the agreement. Sixty thousand Yemenis have been killed since the war erupted in 2014, and a further eight million have been hit by famine and malnutrition.  In recent months, both the UN and individual countries, including the US and the UK (whose popular opinion is divided over their arms sales to Saudi Arabia, one of the main parties to the conflict in Yemen) have called on conflicting parties to agree to a cease-fire and end the plight of innocent civilians. While the newly signed deal will not end Yemen’s war, “it is crucial in helping [the UN] respond to humanitarian needs,” said Kelly T. Clements, the deputy high commissioner for refugees. Henrietta Fore, UNICEF’s executive director, said, “This generous contribution from the QFFD will help us reach children who are in the greatest need and at the greatest risk.” The deal entails shelters being constructed under the supervision of UNHCR. In addition to the project’s humanitarian aspect, Qatar says it wants to use the opportunity to intensify its cooperation with the UN “to support countries in their national development priorities.” “Qatar strongly believes in the power of multilateralism to advance  agenda [sic] that serves all of humanity without discrimination against any sect. The UN through its incredible work embodies that multilateralism, and we are proud to be contributing to its success,” said Lolwah Al Khater, the spokesperson for the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Doha has made headlines over the past months as a donor for a number of issues mainly concerning Muslim countries. In August, Doha pledged a $15 billion bailout to a paralyzed Turkish economy. Most recently, in mid-November, the energy resources-rich Gulf country stepped in for Gaza when it helped Hamas pay the salaries of thousands of Palestinian civil servants. Despite raising eyebrows from some quarters in both instances, Qatar maintained that although it cares about its geostrategic interests, the moves were mainly a manifestation of its commitment to “Muslim solidarity.”

Rabat – Canada is looking for a way to avoid fulfilling a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Sunday, after he received criticism from the opposition and human rights activists. Trudeau said it was “extremely difficult” to cancel the contract “without having to pay exorbitant penalties.” Financial penalties would exceed CAD 1 billion (MAD 7 billion), Trudeau said in October. The previous conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper signed the CAD 15 billion (MAD 107 billion) arms deal.  
“The murder of a journalist is absolutely unacceptable and that’s why Canada from the very beginning had been demanding answers and solutions on that,” Trudeau told CTV on Sunday. “We are engaged with the export permits to try and see if there is a way of no longer exporting these vehicles to Saudi Arabia,” he added. 
The order, concluded in 2014, originally covered 928 light armored vehicles, but was reduced to 742 at the beginning of the year. The order is the largest sale of Canadian weapons in history and was to be conducted by General Dynamics Land Systems, a US-based manufacturer of military vehicles.

Canada had already expressed concerns in 2017 about the possible use of the light armored vehicles in law enforcement operations in eastern Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Relations between Canada and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have been in crisis in recent months. Saudi Arabia announced in August the expulsion of the Canadian ambassador and froze new trade and investment with Canada which had condemned the arrest of Saudi human rights activists.

Rabat – On Saturday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced his country’s decision to relocate the Australian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Several countries, including Malaysia, condemned the decision. On Sunday, December 16, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad denounced Australia’s move, saying that it had no right to do so. The Malaysian official told Reuters, “Jerusalem should remain as it is now and not the capital of Israel.”  “Jerusalem has always been under Palestine, so why are they taking the initiative to divide Jerusalem not belonging to them, but to divide the Arabs and the Jews? They have no rights,” Mohamad said. The Australian move followed Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the American embassy there. Guatemala and Paraguay also announced they would move their embassies to Jerusalem. However, the new president of Paraguay reversed the decision and decided to stay in Tel Aviv three months after the initial announcement to follow Trump’s move.  Paraguay’s decision caused uproar among Israelis. Trump’s move stirred tension in the Arab world, as international leaders, including King Mohammed VI, condemned the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The King warned in December that “the city of Al-Quds [Jerusalem] must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all.” The monarch added that “the city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism.”

Rabat – CTM broadcasted a nine-month advertisement to promote the company’s transport services which excluded Morocco’s southern provinces in Western Sahara. The advertisement, which was displayed in French, included a presentation from CTM’s CEO, Ezzoubeir Errhaimini, who spoke about the company’s achievements since its creation in 1919. The advertisement also included details about trips offered by the company from Casablanca to Agadir, clients’ statements, and the services provided to them. The advertisement says that the company “respects all international standards adopted in the field of urban transportation, whether about safety or respect for the environment.”  Moroccan media referred to CTM’s decision to exclude Western Sahara as a “crime” against Morocco’s territorial integrity, considering it “a negligence that requires accountability and prosecution.”  They also called on authorities to take legal action against the company.  Morocco World News contacted CTM hoping to hear their side of the story from Sahar El Guetbaoui, the marketing manager. However, El Guetbaoui has not yet responded.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) told Morocco World News today that it has sent a message to the Secretariat General of the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) to alert the body of the mistake in the map. FRMF told MWN that UAFA said posting a divided Moroccan map was an “unintentional mistake.” FRMF added that the Arab federation “responded to Morocco’s demand immediately by deleting the map” from its official Twitter account. The map showed the football clubs that qualified for the eighth round of the Zayed Champions Cup. Morocco’s Raja Casablanca, also known as RCA, qualified for the competition. The map, however, angered Moroccans because it divided Morocco into three sections: The first part showed northern and central Morocco and part of the southern provinces, the second part showed Western Sahara, and the third section showed the regions east of Morocco’s defense wall claimed as “liberated zones” by the Polisario Front. It is the first time that UAFA, chaired by Saudi sports official Turki Al Sheikh, has used the map, which is commonly used by the UN and international NGOs.

Rabat – America’s first female secretary of state, Madeline Albright, has singled out Africa’s upbeat developments in a world witnessing many crises, both between and within counties. Albright, who led America’s diplomatic corps 1997-2001 during Bill Clinton’s presidency, was one of the leading guest speakers at the 7th Atlantic Dialogues, a geopolitical event in Marrakech December 13-15. Organized by the Center for the New South, formerly known as OCP Policy Center, the three-day event continued its tradition of inviting leading voices on diplomacy and global affairs to speak on some of the trends in international relations. In a speech that echoed this year’s Atlantic Dialogues’ theme, “Atlantic Dynamics: Overcoming the Choke Points,” the American diplomat copiously spoke of the growing friction between countries brought about by a politics of resentment and “rage.” Arguing that isolationism and rivalry are replacing international dialogue, Albright regretted the “dangerous rise of nationalism in the world, notably in Europe.” She particularly lambasted the West for the plight of migrants and refugees and called out Europe and the US for their increasingly security-oriented migration policies. President Trump, she said, is America’s “least democratic president.”  “No one seems to understand how the system really works,” she said of the rise of post-truth, fake news, and conspiracy theories used by far-right parties to demonize migrants and push for nationalistic policies. She said nationalism is on the rampage while conspiracy theories threaten the order of the post-World War II world. ‘Remarkable’ changes in Africa When asked at the end of the question and answer session to make a few remarks on important topics she felt were sidelined or not brought up at all in her speech and the questions that ensued, Albright was full of praise for Morocco and Africa. Referring to the Benguerir-based King Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, which she visited prior to speaking in Marrakech, Albright said she was “blown away” by both the design of the campus and the aspiration of the university.  “It was fantastic,” she said, explaining that Morocco and the African continent need such higher learning institutions to accompany and foster the optimistic dynamics that the continent has witnessed of late. “I think that what we should be asking ourselves is what is really happening in Africa, and I think it is remarkable in terms of a rising Africa and a new Africa.” Staying clear of some of the pejorative and stereotyped descriptions of Africa, Albright spoke of a continent full of potential with a bright future.  She elaborated, “One of the things I think we need to talk about is the potential of Africa with a very young population that is now being educated and is in fact ready to play their role.” For her, despite some persisting social issues on the continent, African countries should be granted the space to “play their roles both as nation-states and within the context of globalization.” Rather than patronizing the continent, especially for the rising number of young Africans choosing to migrate, the West should take Africa’s concerns seriously and welcome it as “part of the solution to some of the issues.”

Rabat – The bodies of two female tourists of Norwegian and Danish nationalities were found Monday in the province of Al Haouz in the Marrakech-Safi region, 10 kilometers from Imlil in the Atlas Mountains, according to a statement received by Morocco World News. The victims’ bodies had evidence of violence with knife wounds. Police opened an investigation under the supervision of the public prosecutor’s office, added the statement. Morocco World News contacted the Danish and Norwegian embassies to ask for more information about the victims. Both embassies were unreachable. A tourist who spoke with Morocco World News on the condition of anonymity said that the Toubkal Park was closed due to the incident. “Our own guide has confirmed that he will need to check the status with the park authorities tomorrow morning, as we were due to trek in from Imlil tomorrow.” The tourist said that the victims allegedly had no guide and that they were camping “somewhere near the Club Alpin Français (CAF) refuge at the base of Toubkal.” The victims, he said, “allegedly were found decapitated, but I have no way of verifying the information.” The crime scene was swarmed by security officials, who rushed to the crime scene to identify the possible suspects.  Mount Toubkal is the highest peak in North Africa and the Arab World, with a height of 4,167 meters. Toubkal is a popular destination for hiking and trekking.

Rabat – FIFA Chairman Gianni Infantino will visit Morocco in January to take part in the first session of FIFA’s executive committee. During the symposium, Infantino will review the possible World Cup bid of Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. Spain proposed the bid during the visit of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco in November. In a press conference with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, Sanchez said that the bid would unite the peoples from two continents. “We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it,” said Sanchez. Morocco, however, has not officially decided whether it will submit a solo or a joint bid with the European countries. According to Spanish sports news outlet AS, the FIFA committee will discuss the “so-called continental rotation law to boost the Ibero-Moroccan candidacy to [host] the 2030 World Cup.” The committee will also discuss the expansion of the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams in Qatar. Infantino already announced that he prefers joint bids for the World Cup after the North American United 2026 World Cup bid defeated Morocco’s bid in June. While Spain is hoping for a joint bid with Morocco and its Iberian neighbor, Portugal said it has not received an official proposal from Spain. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said that the proposal is “an uncertain idea that has never been officially put to us, and when it is we naturally have to study it.” A World Cup held on two different continents is also not a preference for the president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), Aleksander Ceferin. Earlier this month, Ceferin said he is not “in favor of cross-confederation bids.” “Someone should say once to the politicians it’s not up to them to speak if they will be hosts of the Euros or the World Cup or not,” said UEFA president. Numerous countries have shown an interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including four Balkan countries, England, and three South American countries: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay, in a joint bid.

Rabat – The Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA), chaired by Saudi sports official Turki Al Sheikh, has divided the Moroccan map into three parts, excluding Western Sahara from Morocco. The map, which has since been deleted from Twitter, showed the football clubs that qualified for the eighth round of the Zayed Champions Cup. The union had not divided the Moroccan map into two parts, but into three sections. The first part showed northern and central Morocco and part of the southern provinces. The second part showed Western Sahara, and the third section showed the regions east of Morocco’s defense wall claimed as “liberated zones” by the Polisario Front. Although the map is used by the United Nations and international NGOs, it is the first time UAFA used the map. Moroccan news outlets have been speculating how the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) will respond to the map. UAFA deleted the post from their official Twitter account this morning. Intentional move? After Saudi Arabia’ provocative move to lobby against Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid, analysts have viewed Saudi moves as unfavorable to Morocco’s interests. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia surprised Morocco when it lobbied for its economic ally, the US, to win the hosting rights, against Morocco. Morocco has an unfriendly history with Al Sheikh, the head of Saudi Arabia’s football federation, who expressed anti-Moroccan sentiments several times throughout the World Cup bid. Al Sheikh complained of Morocco’s neutral position on the Gulf crisis between Qatar and the Saudi-led coalition. Since the bid, Moroccan-Saudi relations have continued to be characterized by tension. King Mohammed VI’s neutrality in the Jamal Khashoggi case also angered Saudi Arabia. Several Arab countries used the slogan “Saudi Arabia is a red line,” when the international community suspected the involvement of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Morocco has remained neutral and has not stated any position on the case. King Mohammed VI, a government source told Morocco World News, also declined to personally receive bin Salman in Morocco when he was on a world tour in late November. The King refused to receive bin Salman due to his “busy agenda” and suggested his brother, Prince Moulay Rachid, receive bin Salman instead. The crown prince then did not visit Morocco. The King’s decision might have flared the tension between the two countries. Bin Salman, who also visited Algeria, was surprised by a last minute decision from Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, whose office announced a change in his agenda at the last minute. Bouteflika’s office said that the president could not meet bin Salman due to “flu,” resulting in speculations that the Algerian president also refused to personally meet bin Salman.

Rabat – A group of Czech girls impressed Moroccans with their flawless performance of the Amazigh (Berber) ahidous dance.  Ahidous dances involve both male and female singers and dancers either forming a circle or forming lines facing each other. Men and women sing Amazigh poetry to the music of the bendir, a traditional wooden-framed drum.   Standing shoulder to shoulder on stage, the girls wore white traditional Amazigh gowns or white djellabas and yellow slippers known as “balgha” to represent male dancers. Deeply rooted in Amazigh culture, the Berber folklore performance is found in Morocco’s Atlas region and Algeria. In the past, ahidous was a primary form of entertainment for Amazigh tribes. One of the pioneers of the Moroccan ahidous performance is the late Mouha Oulhoussein Achiban who made ahidous known internationally. Achiban performed ahidous with his troupe in Africa, Europe, and the US, and was given the title of “maestro” by the 40th US president, Ronald Reagan.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia has firmly condemned what it calls the US’s “blatant interferences” in Riyadh’s internal affairs, signaling a possible shift in the strategic relationship between the two partners. In an unparalleled move on Thursday, the US Senate called for a reconsideration of Washington’s position toward Saudi Arabia. The Senate passed a bipartisan resolution that called for “appropriate accountability” in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The move has since been perceived as denouncing the House of Saud, especially Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been implicated in the Khashoggi affair.   As well as pointing condemnatory fingers at Mohammed bin Salman, US senators called for American aid for Saudi Arabia’s military engagement in Yemen to end. Senator Bernie Sanders, who has been vocal in calling on the US to stop collaborating with what he calls Saudi Arabia’s war crimes in Yemen, called the resolution “a historic moment.”  He asserted, “Today we declare we will not long participate in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen which has caused the worst humanitarian crisis on earth, with 85,000 children starving to death. Today we tell the despotic regime in Saudi Arabia that we will no longer be part of their military adventurism.” Saudi Arabia’s response came earlier today, with the kingdom adopting, for the first time, somewhat undiplomatic and disapproving language toward its staunch American ally. In a long rebuttal of the Senate’s “unsubstantiated” accusations, the Saudi foreign affairs ministry said that the Senate’s bipartisan resolution “contained blatant interferences” in Saudi internal affairs. As well as blemishing the kingdom’s reputation and undermining its leadership role in the region, the resolution is “based on unsubstantiated claims and allegations,” the statement asserted. “The kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership … and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature.”  Riyadh needs to overcome Anti-MBS mood in America But Riyadh sugar-coated its harsh statement because a bluntly undiplomatic response may further divide US popular opinion on Saudi Arabia.  Describing the Senate as “an esteemed legislative body of an allied and friendly government,” the statement “reaffirmed” Riyadh’s devotion to its strategic relations with the US. In Saudi Arabia’s reckoning, the Senate’s latest position appeared to have caved in to “all those who want to cause a rift in Saudi-US relationship.” The statement concluded that the Saudi kingdom “hopes to avoid any ramifications on the ties between the two countries that could have significant negative impacts on this important strategic relationship.” The response stood out for unapologetically standing up to the US’s criticism of Saudi policies. While Riyadh has lately responded belligerently to countries—Sweden and Canada are the latest victims of Riyadh’s wrath—that have voiced concerns over Saudi Arabia’s poor human rights record, the US has not been subjected to the same abrasive rhetoric. Even when American media reported on the kingdom’s dubious human rights record or when some American voices accused Riyadh of having links to militant Islamism (especially in the wake of 9/11), the kingdom used to respond in the traditional diplomatic rhetoric that “firmly denied” or asked for proof of “incorrect allegations” or “baseless accusations.” However, since the murder of Khashoggi, the US resident Saudi journalist who died at the hands of Saudi security officers in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate, a number of top American policymakers have made their disapproval of Saudi Arabia and its de facto leader clear. In the American media, meanwhile, there has been a downpour of op-ed and investigative pieces directly linking Crown Prince MBS to Khashoggi’s death. Even the CIA recently concluded that MBS was aware of, and may have sponsored, the Saudi operation that claimed Khashoggi’s life on October 2. As Saudi Arabia and its powerful young crown prince continue to fall out of grace in America’s high places, President Trump has remained a steady partner for the Saudis.  While evidence has led the US president to considerably change his unrepentant support for MBS’s innocence at the start of the Khashoggi saga, Trump has remained the linchpin of the US relationship with Saudi Arabia.  For Trump and a sizable number of conservative Americans, Saudi Arabia remains a necessary counter-balance to Iran’s regional aspirations. But Trump has also said that the US cannot afford to lose the vast financial assets that it gets from arms sales to Saudi Arabia. But as the US Senate is pushing for a radical revision of America’s stance with Saudi Arabia and the whole Mideast dynamics, some have suggested it is a matter of time before Washington replaces Riyadh with a more “reliable” regional ally.

Rabat – Anass Yakine first made national headlines when he walked across Morocco. Travelling from Dakhla to Tangier on foot, including many zig-zags on the route, he covered over 5,000 kilometers during his 2-year adventure. Driven by curiosity and wonder, people from around the world began following his journey, including dozens who actually joined his daily marches through rural Morocco. It was like a scene from Forrest Gump – Anass leading his band of followers to experience simple, slow-paced travel. One of the frequent visitors during his long walk across Morocco was a young student from Rabat named Amal, who walked over 700 kilometers with him in various segments. They married in 2015 and have since expanded their adventurous vision to global proportions. This year the Yakines completed the world’s longest train journey: 17,000 kilometers from Portugal to Vietnam—travelling through a dozen countries in a span of five months. They spent time in Europe, watched Morocco compete at the World Cup in Russia, spent 54 hours straight on the train across Siberia, climbed the Great Wall of China, and enjoyed exploring their favourite country—Mongolia! How do they afford to do all this? The Yakines are not a rich family, and they do not work “normal jobs” to save a large sum of money before embarking on their adventures. Instead, they are digital nomads: Creating content like photos, blogs, and videos which companies can use for their social media and branding efforts. They also live simply. They spend less than MAD 100 per night for accommodation and often stay with their fans and followers. They prepare most of their own food, and they only spent MAD 15,000 dirhams in total for the train tickets.  Is it just a phase before facing reality? 
The Yakines often face negative comments and criticism about their chosen lifestyle. Many Moroccans cannot understand how and why they are travelling full-time and expect that they will soon quit and become part of “normal” society. The Yakines completely disagree.   Rather than settling down, the Yakines have big plans to continue their globe-trotting ways. Next on their list? Travelling across all of Africa by bicycle!  Even if they have children, they plan to continue their adventurous lifestyle and home-school the kids, believing, “Travel is the best school.” They recognize that the nomadic life is not for everyone, but they do spread the message that “everyone should be doing what they love.”  The Yakines are more focused on their emotional stability than their physical stability. Travelling makes them happy, and they are willing to sacrifice the comforts of a stable salary and a permanent home to make it happen. They are also quick to point out that this is also a career. Though it is not easy to earn a living as a digital nomad from Morocco it is possible, and they are blazing a trail for a new generation that looks up to them, and admires their passion for adventure. With over 230,000 followers on Facebook and a new YouTube series ready to be released soon, surely more Moroccans will follow in their (many) footsteps around the globe.

Rabat – The Ultras Black Army ‘06, fans of the ASFAR football club, have worn yellow vests to protest corruption among the club’s board of directors.   ASFAR supporters gathered Saturday at the Maamoura Sports Center displaying a banner reading, “Legal Corruption, IT’S NO,” to say no to the legal corruption that they believe the club’s administration is pursuing. The purpose of the fans’ protest is to make their voices to heard and to hold accountable and sack every corrupt official in the administration, posted the Ultras on their official Facebook page. The group was inspired by France’s yellow vest protesters and swore to enter this war and emerge victorious no matter the consequences. The Ultras have also called ASFAR fans to attend a derby match against Fath Union Sport (FUS) en masse and to engage in a sit-in after the match. ASFAR is now under the command of the interim coach Mohcine Bouhlal after sacking Mohamed Fakhir and his technical staff. It cost MAD 1.8 million for ASFAR to break its contract with Fakhir. In the rankings, ASFAR is at the bottom with 9 points, acquired through two wins, three ties, and 5 defeats. FUS ranks 8th with 13 points.

Rabat – Saudi fans of the Al Nasr football team in Saudi Arabia are using a viral hashtag to express gratitude to Morocco’s Atlas Lion Nordin Amrabat. The fans have found a creative way to honor the international footballer who also received applause for his performance with Morocco’s national team during the 2018 World Cup. Nicknamed the gladiator among Saudi fans, Amrabat is honored by his fans on social media through a hashtag #why_be_afraid_since_we_have_Amrabat. One of his fans wrote on Twitter, “He is really a lion.” #علاش_نخاف_وعندنا_امرابط
فعلا هذا اسد يقود حصانية pic.twitter.com/V2XaG4LgCG — ريم العسيري (@UFRTdli3fzmOy5i) 15 décembre 2018  Amrabat signed a 3-year contract with Al Nasr in July for a €3 million salary per year. Some fans speculated that signing with a Saudi football club would end his career because he had a chance to sign with European football clubs. As it turns out, Amrabat is having a strong impact on the Saudi league. However, in the first few weeks after he signed with Al Nasr, the footballer was frustrated for being benched in several games. “I came to participate in the clubs’ tournament, not to serve as a substitute. This is the second time the coach has made this choice and I have to see what he will decide for the next matches,” he said at the time.  Several other Moroccan football players chose to join Saudi clubs over the summer transfer season, including Karim El Ahmadi, who signed a two-year contract with Al Ittihad Jeddah in July.

Rabat – In October, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said in response to a World Health Organization (WHO) call that virginity tests are not legally required in Morocco. However, Spanish outlet EFE raised the issue of virginity tests in Morocco, saying that the government has ignored the WHO‘s call to “prohibit virginity tests.”  The Spanish news agency noted that virginity tests are still common “every time there is a report of rape” and before marriage. In October, WHO called for a ban of virginity testing for women and girls worldwide, including in Morocco. “There is no examination that can prove a girl or woman has had sex—and the appearance of girl’s or woman’s hymen cannot prove whether they have had sexual intercourse, or are sexually active or not,” WHO said. According to EFE, El Khalfi repeated his statement that virginity tests are “not obligatory.”  The Spanish news outlet also quoted WHO representative in Morocco Maryam Bigdeli, who said that pre-marriage virginity tests are not imposed as an obligation. According to Morocco’s family code, a bride and groom are asked for a medical certificate as a required document before marriage but not a virginity test. The medical certificate is to prove the health status of a couple before marriage, as well as to check for any infectious diseases that may need treatment before marriage. Virginity has been under debate for years. Activists and associations have called on the Ministry of Health to exempt medical doctors from giving virginity certificates. In February, the Moroccan Association of Sexology said that the test violates both doctors’ oaths of medical confidentiality and the right to privacy of women and girls.

Rabat – After busting an international cocaine trafficking ring, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Intelligence (BCIJ) has located a farm allegedly used for cocaine trafficking and storage on Saturday. A statement from BCIJ said that the farm was found after investigating a Colombian suspect involved in a criminal ring. The statement added that BCIJ seized materials used to power jet engines of aircraft allegedly used for cocaine trafficking, including over three tons of kerosene fuel, three large fuel pumps, two engines, and five generators. BCIJ also seized 46 barrels containing 2,700 liters of gasoline. The preliminary investigation revealed that the Colombian suspect received aviation training.  The statement added that the suspected arrived in Morocco illegally to help prepare a secret runway on the outskirts of Dakhla for airplanes. The airplanes would be used to traffick cocaine from Latin America, through Morocco, and eventually to Europe. Saturday’s operation followed the seizure of one ton of cocaine last weekend by the BCIJ. The security agency arrested seven people with links to criminal networks that traffick cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. The seizure of the cocaine followed a similar operation carried out in October in 2017. During the 2017 operation, authorities arrested 10 people for their ties to an international cocaine trafficking network. BCIJ also seized 2,588 kilograms of cocaine from various locations.

Rabat – Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi, a 20-year old defender, is making a solid impact in the Bundesliga with his team now in first in the German league. Loaned from Real Madrid, Hakimi has won a second of Bundesliga’s Rookie of the Month awards, according to the BBC. Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press, Deutsche Welle Television channel said that Hakimi is a key element of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund signed a 2-year loan for the Atlas Lion with Real Madrid in July. The German television channel recalled that the managing director of Borussia Dortmund, Hans Joachim Watzke wanted to convert Hakimi’s loan contract to a permanent agreement after convincing Real Madrid. After securing a permanent deal with Paco Alcacer, Watzke said, “Dear Paco Alcacer, welcome to Borussia Dortmund … We hope to do the same thing with Achraf Hakimi, but it will too be easy.” Real Madrid seeks to improve the performance of the youngster by sending him to Dortmund. Real Madrid may need much convincing from Borussia to secure a permanent deal. Earlier this month, the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) ranked Borussia Dortmund’s star Achraf Hakimi as the top fullback in the European leagues in the last three months. Hakimi outperformed several renowned fullbacks with a score of 85.3. In February, CIES Football Observatory ranked the international footballer among Europe’s “50 most promising under-20 footballers.” Hakimi is also featured in CAF Awards 2018 shortlist as “African Youth Player of the Year.”

Rabat – The minister in charge of public affairs and governance, Lahcen Daoudi, announced yesterday that fuel would go down this weekend by at least MAD 0.30 per liter of gasoline and MAD 0.40 per liter of diesel. In a statement to Moroccan media, the minister stressed Moroccans are supposed to “punish” the companies which will not cut fuel prices on Saturday. Following the minister’s statement, Afriquia, one of the leading fuel companies in Morocco, decided to reduce its fuel price by almost half a dirham per liter. Afriquia said it will cut fuel prices this weekend by MAD 0.49 per liter of diesel and MAD 0.39 per liter of gasoline. It is the fourth time in a month that the company has reduced fuel prices, having reduced prices by MAD 1.5 per liter of gasoline and MAD 1.7 per liter of diesel. Afriquia was one of the three major companies to be hit by a five-month long boycott campaign in which  many Moroccans spoke out against rising commodity prices. Daoudi’s Friday announcement comes two days after his ministry decided to implement fuel price cap regulations because a number of companies refused to reduce fuel prices following the drop in oil prices in the international market. The decision is pending the approval of the Competition Council which is examining the implementation of a fuel price cap. The price cap could last for a period of 6 months according to the law, Daoudi noted on Sunday in a meeting of the ruling Justice and Development Party in El Kelaa des Sraghna, in central Morocco. “After the liberalization of hydrocarbon prices in 2015, some companies have been earning MAD 2.13 per liter,” the minister regretted.  He said Moroccan oil companies’ profit margins exceed the threshold set by the state, which is supposed to be MAD 0.70 per liter of diesel and MAD 0.60 per liter of gasoline. New foreign companies will soon open gas stations in Morocco as part of the country’s strategy to  increase competition among fuel companies. One of the investing companies is Spain’s Cepsa which signed a partnership with Morocco’s Derhem Holding this month to expand its oil business in Morocco. Cepsa will build 100 service stations in 5 years in Morocco.

Rabat – Dismissing the government’s request to suspend protests following Tuesday’s Strasbourg shooting, the yellow vest protesters have yet again rallied in Paris and other cities. Today marks the fifth Saturday since the start of the demonstrations in mid-November.  French authorities report that, so far, nearly 3,000 protesters have gathered at the Champs-Elysees in Paris and other areas in the city. Police are stopping and interrogating dozens of protesters. About 69,000 are currently on duty across France to prevent more violence from erupting as in the previous weeks. As of Friday, December 14, seven people have died in the yellow vest protests. Last Saturday, police used tear gas for the first time to disperse protesters. In the wake of the terrorist attack on Strasbourg’s Christmas market, which killed three and injured many, French ministers called on the protesters to halt the protests. The French minister of justice, Nicole Belloubet, told French media that the yellow vest protests should come to a stop. “There has been a dramatic event in Strasbourg and the president has responded,” she stated, referring to Macron’s promise to raise the country’s minimum wage and cut taxes, effective in January 2019.  During his speech on December 10, Macron promised violent protesters would “face justice.” The yellow vests, however, were not impressed by Macron’s speech and promised in turn to continue their demonstrations. While anger at the president’s perceived pro-rich policies sparked the yellow vest demonstrations, protesters are now increasingly calling for Macron to step down as president.

Rabat – Just days after world governments met in Marrakech to sign a “landmark” agreement on an international framework to come to terms with irregular migration, Brussels has reaffirmed its commitment to the success of Rabat’s migration-related efforts.  A statement published yesterday by the European Commission’s website announced that the European body will pledge a further €148 million to financially assist Morocco on the migration front. “The EU is intensifying its support to Morocco to address irregular migration in response to increased migratory pressure along the Western Mediterranean Route,” read part of the announcement. The statement continued: “The additional funding adopted under the EU emergency Trust Fund for Africa will bring the overall migration-related assistance to Morocco to €148 million in 2018. It will help step up the fight against migrant smuggling and trafficking of human beings, including through reinforced integrated border management.” As part of the Brussels-Rabat strategic collaboration on a host of issues, especially border management and the monitoring of migratory routes, the allocated funds will not only be used to combat human trafficking and smugglers’ networks.  According to EU parliamentarians, the body’s latest financial assistance will also entail providing improved living conditions to “vulnerable migrants.”  Part of the funds will help create programs to strengthen migration-related civil society in Morocco and “create new opportunities for job creation and sustainable development.” Johannes Hahn, the EU Commissioner for European Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, asserted that “Morocco is a key partner” in Europe’s bid to devise a working migration policy. For Hahn, Brussels and Rabat need a collaborative framework to “tackle the current challenge.” He explained: “Together we can fight smugglers, save lives, and support people in need. But our cooperation goes far beyond migration: we are working to strengthen our partnership via socio-economic development, decentralization and integration of the youth – to the benefit of the people in Morocco and in Europe.” For his part, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, highlighted the increasing pressure Morocco is facing as more and more migrants resort to using the western Mediterranean route to cross to Europe. But in addition to helping Morocco mitigate the consequences of the waves of migrants using its territory and sea coasts, Avramopoulos noted, the EU-Morocco migration cooperation also entails improving living conditions in Morocco and [possibly] migrants’ countries of origin to reduce the number of irregular migration attempts. Europe’s commitment to its partnership with Rabat echoes Morocco’s position.  Despite receiving harsh criticism for supposedly bowing to European pressure in its recent toughening of controls on irregular migration, Morocco has steadily said that it will not let its coastal cities fall prey to smuggling and human trafficking networks. While adamant about its sovereignty, Rabat has also acknowledged the importance of its partnership with Europe. “Our relationship with the EU is a global one. It’s not based on one issue. We are neighbors. Morocco is the closest African country to Europe. It’s a relation of geography; it’s a relation of history. For 50 years we are engaged in agreements with the EU. We have 4 million Moroccans living in Europe. We have security cooperation. We have economic cooperation,” foreign affairs minister Nasser Bourita said in a recent interview. Morocco will receive the newly pledged fund by the end of this year.

Rabat – A new motorway will connect Agadir’s Al Massira Airport, 20 kilometers southeast of Agadir to the road leading to the Taghazout area, north of the city. As part of Morocco’s growing infrastructure projects, the new motorway will facilitate traffic flow to the Agadir airport, its commercial port, and a number of tourist destinations, the Moroccan National Motorway Company (ADM) announced. ADM has carried out several investment projects worth a total of MAD 600 million. The projects are mainly set to modernize Morocco’s infrastructure and electronic tolls. In April, the company pledged MAD 3.4 billion in investment for several infrastructure projects, including widening the Casablanca-Berrechid road.  Some of the newest development projects in Agadir include the Pumped Power Transfer Station Project at the Abdelmoumen dam, 70 kilometers northeast of the city. The project, launched in October, will construct an upstream reservoir on the Tamraght plateau at approximately 1,300 meters altitude. The total cost of the project is MAD 3 billion. Construction is expected to last three years, and the total installed capacity will be 350 megawatts.

Rabat – Morocco is among the countries that have made significant progress in limiting the effects of global warming, according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT). CAT listed Morocco as having invested “impressive” efforts to curb the damaging effects of climate change. The Institute of Climate Analysis, Ecofys Consultancy, and NewClimate Institute issued the CAT’s Warming Projections Global Update for December 2018 at the 24th World Climate Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland. “For this year’s update the CAT has examined how emissions projections have shifted since the Paris agreement,” a December 11 CAT statement read. The Paris agreement set out a global action plan in 2015 to put the world on track to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030. The CAT analysis identified “real movement on the ground, with Argentina, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, the EU, India and Morocco taking significant steps in the right direction, and with other countries also taking action.” The analysis, which assessed 32 countries, gave Morocco a “clear progress” indicator, thanks to the country’s “impressive progress in recent years.” Clear progress means, according to the analysis, a “clear decrease in projected 2030 emissions level due to actual policy development.” “We are seeing a stirring of new climate policies in the real world: if this were extended and scaled up, these combined efforts could actually begin to bend the emissions curve,” said Yvonne Deng of Ecofys, a navigant company. The analysis gave some countries, such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, the UAE, and the US, a “no progress indicator,” indicating that the countries are not on track for emission reduction. The countries, according to the CAT, are delaying global progress and are “beginning to see the reality of climate change impacts.” Countries like China, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Switzerland received a “minor progress” indicator of projected 2030 emissions levels since 2015. Morocco also made great achievements in climate change performance and became the second-best performing country in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) for the year 2019, behind Sweden. Morocco ranks “high” in all CCPI categories, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, renewable energy, energy use, and climate policy. The index, which evaluates and compares the climate protection performance of 56 countries and the EU, also looked at Morocco’s progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and climate policies. The index stated that Morocco’s renewable energy projects and goals, including the world’s largest solar plant, the “Noor Solar Project,” resulted in a high rating in the climate change ranking.  The Noor Solar Project consists of four solar plants: Noor I, Noor II, Noor III, and Noor IV. The Noor I plant “is expected to offset 240,000 [tons] a year of CO2 emissions,” while “the Noor II and Noor III plants combined will help offset 533,000 [tons] of CO2 emissions a year,” according to Power Technology.

Rabat – Morocco’s high-speed-train (LGV), which runs more than 320 kilometers per hour, made an emergency stop on Friday evening in Sidi Lyamani near Tangier after it had hit and killed a man.  The man died at approximately 6:55 p.m. after he threw himself at the high speed train, announced the National Railway Office (ONCF). In a statement, ONCF apologized to passengers for the delays that affected LGV lines following the incident. The company’s apology over the delays has angered some Moroccan commentators who accused it of “disrespecting” the deceased man.

King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the high speed train, the first in Africa, on November 15. The train is named “Al Boraq, ” and connects Tangier to Casablanca with stops in Rabat and Kenitra. The project cost €2 billion. According to BFMTV, the French government financed 51 percent of the project through various loans, including a €220 million grant by the French Development Agency (AFD).  In October 2017, AFD granted Morocco a loan of €80 million to fund the last segment of the Tangier-Casablanca high speed train project. This followed the French agency’s initial grant of €220 million in 2011 to start the project.

Rabat – Speaking at a press conference in Casablanca, the Hassania Association of Magistrates and the Magistrates Club of Morocco unanimously condemned the position of Mustapha Ramid, Morocco’s human rights minister. Commenting on Abdelali Hamieddine’s prosecution, Ramid recalled that “no one can be prosecuted or punished because of an offense for which he has already been acquitted or condemned by a final judgment in accordance with the law and the criminal procedure of each country.” Ramid was referring to the decision of the investigating judge at the Fez Court of Appeals to re-prosecute Hamieddine for “voluntary homicide.” The murder took place on February 25, 1993, at Dhar El Mehraz University in Fez, during clashes between leftist students and Islamist militants, which resulted in the killing of Mohammed Ait Ljid Benaissa.  In response to Ramid’s remarks, the president of the Hassania Association, Abdelhak El Aiassi, said that the case came in the wake of the Justice and Development Party’s (PJD) pressure and confusion it sustained after hearing the news. He argued that the PJD has led them to “cross the red lines” by looking at the judiciary as not independent and saying that “it would lose people’s faith.” He also said that the case was reopened after new information was submitted to the investigating judge. Defending his client, Hamieddine’s lawyer, Abdessamad El Idrissi, who is also a member of the PJD, echoed Ramid’s statement. He immediately condemned the case on his Facebook page, calling it “political” and contrary to “the internally recognized principles of justice.”  “There are some people who seek to destroy confidence in any possibility to have an independent judiciary based on law and conscience,” Idrissi wrote. During the press conference, a question from a journalist created great confusion in the conference room. The questioner wondered such press conferences have not been held to ensure fair trials in many national cases, such as the Hirak Rif and Hirak Jerada case, as well as the recent prosecution of two journalists, Hamid El Mahdaoui and Taoufik Bouachrine. The panelists preferred not to answer the question, arguing that it was not the subject of the conference.

Rabat – Isabelle Smith, a 14-year-old photographer from Collierville, a small town in Tennessee, has shown the beauty of two vibrant colors: that of the delicious-looking oranges and the blue hues of Chefchaouen. Another photo by Smith captures the spontaneity of childhood, the captivating shades of blue, and a glimpse of oranges. Named winner of “Young Travel Photographer of the Year,” among other photographers from 142 countries around the world, Smith’s Chefchaouen photos were picked from the world’s best travel photography list. The TPOTY describes Smith’s photographs, writing: “Isabella has made four images which sing with colour and provide glimpses of the lives of the people here, even including movement and tranquillity.” Throughout her life, Smith has had trouble focusing on all subjects at school and was later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Smith, however, does much better telling stories through photos. The teenager’s  love for photography brought her to Chefchaouen, where she resolved to craft stories about the city and share them with the world.

Rabat – As a testament to the strong political and economic relations between Morocco and France, the French Development Agency (AFD) announced that Morocco receives the bulk of the agency’s funding in Africa, with €2.9 billion as of  October 15, 2018.

Rabat – Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy has attracted increasing interests among international security services. The efficiency of the strategy led the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) to note that the Australian government does not yet cooperate with Morocco on counterterrorism. ASPI said that Morocco “portrays the fight against Islamist extremism as a war of ideas that can be won by preaching a tolerant, moderate and non-violent form of Islam.” The institute also recalled that Morocco, which “lies in an unstable region” due to the presence of “Islamist terrorism, ” has not been affected by any terror attack since April 2011 in Marrakech. The institute said that although Australia takes part in international counterterrorism forums along with Morocco, the two countries have “no bilateral counterterrorism” ties “nor do we have any official counter-terrorism involvement in the Maghreb.” While no counterterrorism ties have been made yet the Australian Ambassador to Rabat, Berenice Owen-Jones, told Morocco World News that “With the opening of the embassy in Rabat in 2017, Australia and Morocco are set to increase their cooperation on counterterrorism matters, including in global forums.” Although there is currently no bilateral counterterrorism relation with Australia, Morocco has several international cooperation with several international security services, including the US, Spain, and France. With Morocco introducing the anti-terrorism strategy and the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) in 2015, the North African country received applause and appreciation from several international powers, including the US. In its 2018 Country Report on Terrorism, the State Department said, “Following the August attacks in Barcelona, Morocco assisted the Spanish investigation and promised to expand cooperation to track terrorists of Moroccan origin radicalized abroad.” ASPI mentioned Morocco’s counterterrorism cooperation with European countries, saying that “European countries have also worked closely with Morocco, providing counterterrorism training and equipment, and conducting joint operations with Moroccan security forces.” Morocco was also listed among the least impacted countries by terrorism, according to the 2018 Global Terrorism Index. Morocco ranked 132nd out of 163 in the report, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. The ranking makes Morocco safer than the US, France, and Algeria.

Rabat –Morocco’s government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi spoke about Geneva’s Western Sahara roundtable, which convened the four parties to the conflict on December 6-7. On Thursday after the weekly cabinet meeting, El Khalfi said in a press conference that the roundtable on the Western Sahara conflict marked “significant changes” as it brought together the four stakeholders. He reiterated Morocco’s long-held and “unwavering” position that Algeria is a “leading player” in the Western Sahara conflict, a position that King Mohammed VI reaffirmed in his message to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last March. El Khalfi went on to say that through this participation, Morocco showed its commitment to aiding the efforts of the Secretary General’s personal Envoy Horst Kohler in finding a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict. The Moroccan official pointed out that Morocco has long proposed the idea of finding a realistic solution through its autonomy plan. He added that the Maghreb region must be a player in the peace, stability, and development of the five countries, and that the aim “is not only to find a solution to the regional conflict but also to lay the foundations for effective regional integration.” “It is impossible to determine the future of the Sahara without the involvement of its inhabitants,” he said. El Khalfi said that UN Security Council Resolution 2440 adopted on October 31, brushed aside the Polisario’s claims that the area east of Morocco’s defense wall belongs to its “liberated territories.” Recalling the resolutions of the Security Council, El Khalfi said that the UN has been clear as it urged Polisario to refrain from transferring some of its “administrative facilities,” to the buffer zone and east Morocco’s defense wall. He also reiterated that the Western Sahara conflict should only be solved within the auspices of the United Nations.

Rabat – The historic election of two Muslim women to the US Congress caused waves of celebration in the Muslim World. But while Muslim voices within and without the US congratulated the newly elected congresswomen, Riyadh begged to disagree.  Still failing to leave behind the apparently unyielding shadow of Jamal Khashoggi, Riyadh is now facing another accusation: the kingdom does not relish the prospect of Muslim Americans whose voice matters in America’s highest places. According to a damning article published by Foreign Policy on December 11, Saudi Arabia is using conservative American outlets and a host of Saudi-funded media to discredit Somali-American Ilhan Omar, one of the now famous minority politicians who made history in the recent US midterm elections. While US-based Riyadh-affiliated media accuse Omar of turning the American Congress into an “Islamic republic,” pro-Riyadh Mideast-based outlets suspect her of being a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer. The “organized attacks,” the “fake news” and “conspiracy theories” aiming to discredit Omar and a number of rising Muslim politicians come “specifically from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” according to the Foreign Policy article. It continued: “Academics, media outlets, and commentators close to Persian Gulf us senatesgovernments have repeatedly accused Omar, Rashida Tlaib (another newly elected Muslim congresswoman), and Abdul El-Sayed (who made a failed bid to become governor of Michigan) of being secret members of the Muslim Brotherhood who are hostile to the governments of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.” Using the “Anti-Trump” card, the reported accusations from UAE and Saudi Arabia-affiliated corporations seek to convince the Trump administration and conservative Americans that the newly elected Muslim American congresswomen are dangerous for the US. The congresswomen stand accused of conspiring with the Democratic Party, which they represent, to introduce political Islam in the US. But why would Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two predominantly Muslim countries, conspire against and defame America’s rising Muslim politicians? According to Foreign Policy, there are mainly two reasons why the rise of America’s “history-making” Muslim congresswomen irked the two Gulf States. One reason is that the politicians in question have been critical of a number of Saudi policies and positions on both Muslim and global affairs. Their past criticism of a number of Riyadh’s deeds and policies was construed as hostility to the oil-rich Arabian  Gulf kingdoms. Just hours within Omar’s election, Faisal al-Shammeri, a cultural advisor at the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission to the US, said to Foreign Affairs: “She will be hostile to the Gulf and a supporter of the political Islam represented in the Brotherhood in the Middle East.” Another reason Saudi Arabia and its allies feel threatened by prominent US Muslim politicians is that their stories are a source of inspiration for the Middle East’s democracy-hungry youth. By defying the odds of the congressional election, their rise to prominence is a symbolic but telling rebuttal of the argument that Muslim nations are not ready for “Western-style democracy.” While elites in the Persian Gulf and other predominantly Muslim countries continue to hide behind “Muslim tradition” to shun any prospect of democratic reforms that give space to youth and status-quo-questioning voices, politicians such as Omar uproot the “democracy is not for Arabs” narrative.  “People would not have access to power in their countries but they would if they leave; this destroys the argument by Sisi or bin Salman,” El Sayed, an Egyptian-American, told Foreign Policy. The suggestion, the article concluded, is that the democracy-supporting and “independent” Muslims in the West may use their platform to impact change in their regions and countries of origin. While Saudi Arabia has not responded to the accusations, the kingdom’s resort to the Muslim Brotherhood card to discredit critics is not news to Mideast observers. Knowing that the controversial Islamist group is negatively seen by many Western governments, including the US, Riyadh has traditionally painted dissidents as Brotherhood supporters. Most recently, when the global backlash over Jamal Khashoggi’s murder started reaching worrying proportion and damaging the reputation of the hitherto idolized and revered Mohammed bin Salman, Riyadh started speaking of the slain journalist as “a dangerous Islamist.”     But Saudi Arabia’s effort to discredit Khashoggi proved monumentally unsuccessful. While MBS is still facing global isolation, US-based Time Magazine named Khashoggi—along with other journalists whose audacious reporting put them in harm’s way in their countries—as 2018’s persons of the year.

Rabat – The board of directors congratulated Lalla Hasna on one of her most notable achievements this year, being appointed Ambassador of Goodwill by the heads of state and government at the 1st Summit of the Congo Basin and the Blue Fund in Brazzaville on April 29. For her part, Lalla Hasna commended the foundation’s efforts to fully carry out programs such as the extension of the Eco-Schools program was extended to preschools, with the aim of making sustainable development education an integral part of kids’ education. The meeting also touched upon updates of the foundation’s Air-Climate program which focuses on “Helping Morocco contribute to the mitigation of local air pollution and global warming; educating citizens, civil society, business and government about the impacts of greenhouse and climate change.” Lalla Hasna launched several educational programs for sustainable development, coastal management, sustainable tourism, and a program to develop the Marrakech palm grove. The princess also visited Japan in November to represent her foundation. While there, she earned the the Goi Peace International Award in Tokyo for her lifelong commitment to environmental protection, and an honorary doctorate from Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. The Goi Peace Foundation grants the award to individuals and organizations that have made outstanding contributions toward the realization of a peaceful and harmonious world in their fields. The Goi Peace Foundation has awarded its international prize every year since 2000 to prominent figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev, Bill Gates, Oscar Arias Sanchez, and environmentalist Lester Brown. Education was the main driver behind Lalla Hasna’s visit to Japan. The princess met with Japanese Minister of Education Masahiko Shibayama. The pair discussed how to develop Morocco’s education, especially the learning materials and methods in Moroccan schools.

Rabat – The board of directors of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) approved a $96.6 million loan Thursday for “the implementation of a results-based program to improve access to employment (PARAAE)” in Morocco. Morocco “is one of the first African countries to use this innovative financing instrument, which adapts the disbursement cycle to achieving results while reducing transaction costs,” the AfDB said in a statement on December 13. The program, according to AfDB, aims to facilitate access to the labor market for youth and women and improve employment quality in the country. It will also “contribute to enhancing human capital by improving the workforce skills and employability.” “Fostering job creation by supporting entrepreneurship and training is, for us, a major priority contributing to sustainable, stronger and more inclusive growth,” said Mohamed El Azizi, the AfDB’s director general for the North Africa Region. The program will allow, for the first time in Morocco, the establishment of a center for vocational training teachers, and a second training institution for entrepreneurship training. In October, King Mohammed VI gave instructions to an education committee to implement new vocational training programs, create new training centers, and to reinforce youth entrepreneurship programs. The AfBD-financed program aims to provide over 90,000 jobseekers with “access to the Taehil National Employability Support Program each year,” and  will enable “180,000 job seekers to benefit from support services.” With the implementation of the ambitious project, more than 110,000 young people, 50 percent of whom are women, will get access to qualifying training. In the long term, said the bank’s Morocco country manager Leila Farah Mokaddem, “about 2,000 people carrying a project can start their own business  each year.” The program, which plans to support Morocco in its strategies for promoting employment and vocational training, meets three of the bank’s five highest priorities: “Feed Africa”, “Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa,” and “Industrialize Africa.” Morocco received the new loan five weeks after the AfDB bank approved a €117 million loan to finance investment into making drinking water available for 2.5 million people in Morocco. According to the AfDB, the fifty-year partnership between Morocco and the bank includes more than 160 projects and programs with a total fund of more than $10 billion. More than 80 percent of the funding is devoted to basic infrastructure in energy, water, transport, agriculture, and social development.

Rabat – As the New Year 2019 and the Amazigh New Year 2969 are drawing near, Amina Ben Sheikh, the president of the Moroccan news outlet “Alalam Al Amazighi” (Amazigh World), addressed a message to King Mohammed VI on December 7, calling for the recognition of the Amazigh New Year, January 12, as a public holiday. Ben Sheikh referred to Morocco’s 2011 Constitution which recognizes Tamazight (Berber) as an official language alongside Arabic. In her message, she wrote that “recognizing the Amazigh New Year as an official national holiday side by side with the other national holidays would restore the spirit and philosophy of the Constitution.”  Ben Sheikh emphasized that the decision to make January 12 an official national holiday would also be in line with King Mohammed VI’s speeches concerning the Amazigh culture.  To make her point, the journalist referenced the monarch’s speech on October 17, 2001, in which he said: “the integration of Tamazight is a national responsibility, for no culture can deny its roots. From these roots, [Morocco] must embrace openness and reject close-mindedness in order to thrive and develop.” Although Tamazight was officially recognized almost eight years ago, draft laws related to the integration of Tamazight in all fields are still on hold, Ben Sheikh noted. According to Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Malki’s statement in July, the government is taking a cautious approach to the Tamazight law calling for the language to be integrated into public administrations and services.  The government does not want to rush the law’s implementation, fearing the “complications” it may pose in the future, because it is connected to the dream of a successful and fair law that would not cause conflict in the Moroccan identity, according to El Malki. Morocco presented draft laws 26.16 and 04.16 relating to the integration of Tamazight into national education and administrative institutions as well as the protection and development of both Arabic and Tamazight. The draft laws strive to boost the status and usage of Tamazight in public administrations and services and in all “priority areas of public life,” including documents, such as ID cards, passports, drivers’ licenses, and banknotes. The Moroccan government has contemplated making the Amazigh New Year a national holiday following calls from several Amazigh associations in the country. On January 12, Morocco will celebrate the Amazigh New Year 2969,  known as “Yennayer.”

Rabat – The Middle East and North Africa Business Aviation Association (MEBAA) will be returning to Marrakech for its 2019 MEBAA Morocco airshow. The airshow will take place from September 17th to the 19th at Menara airport, and will feature products from top aviation companies around the world like Gulfstream and Boeing.  MEBAA is a non-profit Emirati organization that acts as a “platform for members of the business aviation industry in the MENA region to gather, understand and communicate the needs and benefits of the industry,” according to MEBAA. Aviation has grown in Africa, keeping up with the increase in business and tourism. Swiss research company Air Transport Action Group says the aviation industry generated 55.8 billion USD in 2016 and supported about 6.2 million jobs. That is in addition to the 35.9 billion USD generated from tourism. As these figures grow, business and government leaders are seeking to profit immensely throughout the continent.  The 2017 MEBAA Morocco also took place in Marrakech, at Menara airport. Minister of Tourism Mohammed Sajid led the delegation of government officials that attended the forum and took part in the opening ceremonies alongside the CEO of the Moroccan Airports Authority Zouhair El Aoufir. Menara airport alone contributes to  roughly 40 percent of air movements every year in the country, according to experts. MEBAA predicts this forum will be another success for both the organization as well as the Moroccan aviation industry. Ali Alnaqbi, the executive chairman of MEBAA said “We are pleased to be bringing the MEBAA Show Morocco and MEBAA Conference back to Marrakech for 2019,” according to news sources. The venue of MEBAA Morocco changed to Menara airport from Mohammed V in Casablanca, where the first MEBAA Morocco was held in 2015. The event has already brought positive growth to the country, with aviation companies Jetex Flight Support and Swissport Executive Aviation reaching agreements to operate in the country. In addition, nine additional Fixed-Base Operating(FBOs) in the process of setting up at Moroccan airports as well. These companies will be able to provide maintenance services, flight instruction, fueling, and other services at the airports.   As business investments and tourism begin to flood Africa, MEBAA predict that “Due to its strategic location between Europe, the Middle East, and the rest of Africa,” the country will become a popular future hub for travelling throughout the region, and with the right investment, a prime source of capital for international businesses and the Moroccan government.

Rabat – This week marked a series of landmark appointments aimed at ensuring King Mohammed VI’s call for more effectiveness and inclusion in Morocco’s public services is implemented. Mohamed Bachir Rachdi, whom King Mohammed VI appointed yesterday as head of the Nation Authority for probity and the fight against corruption, gave his first press conference in which he lambasted the country’s corruption level. Speaking yesterday to a group of journalists in Rabat, Rachid damningly said that despite a series of recent reforms to improve public management and foster accountability, corruption continues to drain Morocco’s resources and efforts at full-fledged democratization. According to Rachdi, corruption does not only cripple the country’s ability to deliver on its vast socio-economic potential; it also “negatively impacts the confidence of both Moroccans and foreign investors.” While exacerbated corruption leads citizens to question how possible genuine change is, it discourages foreign investors from launching development-inspiring economic ventures in the country, he explained. But the new boss of Morocco’s anti-corruption architecture did not just berate the country’s corruption index.  “This is both an honor and a great responsibility,” he said, thanking King Mohammed VI for choosing him to lead the “crucial fight against corruption.” Rachdi also acknowledged Morocco’s enormous development potential. He added, however, that to reach such potential, a sustained and relentless battle against corruption and related practices is needed. For Morocco’s new anti-corruption man, his appointment “marks a new era” in Morocco’s fight march toward accountable and efficient governance. “We hope to be part of an era of real and irreversible changes,” he said.  A “central instrument” in Morocco’s desire to “optimize on its enormous resources,” the National Authority will not only prevent corruption, Rachdi said. In addition, the body will also put in place “effective and appropriate strategies” to monitor and assess public policies.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – On Thursday, the Senate unanimously adopted a non-binding resolution condemning Jamal Khashoggi’s murder and concluding Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing. The resolution, introduced by Republican Bob Corker, will go to the House on December 19. “Unanimously, the United States Senate has said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is a strong statement. I think it speaks to the values that we hold dear,” said Senator Corker. “I’m glad the Senate is speaking with one voice unanimously toward this end.” Just offered a joint resolution with a number of my colleagues to condemn the murder of Jamal #Khashoggi and hold the Saudi Crown Prince accountable. It will send a strong signal to MbS, and we are hopeful it will pass today. Read more: https://t.co/k1HnA2owGJ. pic.twitter.com/ibCFVJj4RV — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) December 13, 2018  The resolution employs strong language and states the that Senate “believes Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi” and “calls for the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure appropriate accountability for all those responsible for Jamal Khashoggi’s murder.” Prior to the vote, the Senate also approved a measure by a 56-41 vote that would require the US to end its military support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The two resolutions signal Congress’s increasing dissatisfaction with the Trump administration’s relationship with Saudi Arabia “What the United States Senate said today, in a very loud way, is that we will not continue to have our military posture dictated by a despotic murderous regime in Saudi Arabia, a regime which does not respect democracy, does not respect human rights, a regime whose leader, nobody doubts, was involved in the horrific murder of a dissident journalist in the Saudi consulate in Turkey,” Senator Bernie Sanders told reporters. The resolutions counteract President Trump’s recent statements regarding the murder. On December 12, Trump told Reuters that Saudi Arabia has “been a very good ally” and reasserted that the “Crown Prince vehemently denies” involvement. However, the CIA concluded that the Saudi Crown Prince did order the October 2 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia acknowledges Khashoggi’s murder and arrested various people possibly involved in the killing. Five of those arrested face the death penalty.  In the Senate’s resolution, members also call upon Saudi Arabia to release jailed women’s rights activists, including Raif Badawi and Samar Badawi. Advocating for women’s suffrage and increased participation of women in Saudi government and society led to the activists’ arrest.

Rabat – South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon will visit three North African countries next week to strengthen bilateral economic cooperation, South Korean news agency Yonhap, reported Thursday. A seven-day trip will take Lee to Algeria on December 16, Tunisia on December 18, and Morocco on December 20. In a two-day visit to Morocco, the South Korean prime minister will meet with Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani.  Lee “plans to ask Morocco to help Korean companies participate in large state projects,” according to Yonhap. Since former Korean prime minister Chung Hong-won visited Morocco in 2014, it will be the first time a South Korean prime minister make an official visit to Algeria and Tunisia. Lee will meet his Algerian counterpart Algeria Ahmed Ouyahia to discuss ways to boost economic partnerships between the two countries, especially in construction and infrastructure projects. During his trip to Tunisia, Lee will meet Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi and other government officials. Given the three nation’s strategic location linking Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, the Korean prime minister seeks to deepen economic ties with the North African countries and promote investment for his country’s business companies. Lee’s planned visit to Morocco comes seven months after Moroccan head of government EL Othmani visited Seoul in May at the invitation of Lee. It was the first time a Moroccan head of government visited South Korea. In the May meeting, both Lee and El Othmani discussed the bilateral cooperation that has united the two countries since diplomatic relations opened in 1962. El Othmani led a delegation which included a number of ministers.

Rabat – Members of DGSN intercepted a Brazilian woman trying to smuggle 815 grams of cocaine earlier in December. DGSN revealed on Friday that the woman was also hiding 610  grams of cocaine in her abdomen. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) arrested the 49-year-old woman on December 2, as she landed in Mohammed V airport in Casablanca from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The war against trafficking of drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis, and hash is making headlines in Morocco.  One of the biggest cocaine arrests in Morocco took place last weekend, Saturday, December 8. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) seized one tonne of cocaine paste from a criminal network specialized in smuggling cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. A spokesperson for Morocco’s security services, Boubker Sbik, has lauded the efforts of the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) and DGSN in busting drug traffickers. Saturday’s arrest is the fruit of a “qualitative process, which is part of a precise strategy based on the coordination of efforts between DGSN and DGST,” said Sbik.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Sports and Youths Rachid Talbi Alami has finally spoken about why Morocco won’t compete to host the 1991 African Cup of Nations (CAN). Alami said that it has never been the plan for Morocco to organize the CAN 2019 or replace Cameroon. “It has never been a candidate or thought to do so,” Alami told RFI. He added that the decision requires a major attention. “Everyone must mobilize to succeed. To organize something professional, this has to be plannedin advance, which is not the case.” He added that Morocco will host the 2019 All-Africa Games next summer, and that Morocco is mobilizing its assets to make the event successful. “We cannot make a decision like that  six months of the event coming,” he said. After the Confederation of African Football’s (CAF) decision to strip the hosting rights from Cameroon earlier this month, international media speculated that Morocco and South Africa could be a possible replacement to Cameroon. However, when CAF announced the re-launch of the bidding process, Morocco remained silence which surprised and resulted in rumors and speculations from international media. On Wednesday, an Algerian media outlet took speculations too far, claiming that Morocco is fearful of Algeria. The news outlet said that Algeria is Morocco’s reason  for not hosting the tournament. The news outlet also claimed that Morocco did not present any clear reasons for its refusal to replace Cameroon as “it owns the facilities and stadiums that allow it to do so, but the real reason is apparent.” Before CAF’s decision to eliminate Cameroon, Moroccan officials vowed full support for Cameroon, denying that Morocco wants  to replace it. In March, President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa said that Morocco ‘is alongside our Cameroonian friends.” He added that FRMF is at “the disposal of the Cameroonian Federation to make the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon,” and “the rumors are over. Egypt is now expected to submit its bid to host the 2019 CAN.

Rabat – A month after a team being appointed to lead the competition council, King Mohammed VI has appointed a new ombudsman to monitor public service quality and be the voice of everyday Moroccans. Mohammed Benalilou, Morocco’s new ombudsman, met with King Mohammed VI yesterday at the royal palace in Rabat, according to a royal office statement.  During their meeting, the King explained to the country’s new ombudsman the prerogatives of his new functions as well as the royal expectations with regard to justice, social equity, and transparency. The King spoke of “the Ombudsman Institution as an independent national body” who fundamental role will be to guarantee citizens’ rights and “end injustices,” the statement noted. Called to act as an intermediary between citizens and state institutions, Benalilou’s “particular role” will be to “preserve the rights of citizens in their relations with the administration, as well as its action aimed at providing justice to them against abuse of any kind, under the rule of law and within the framework of the consolidation of the principles of justice and equity.” King Mohammed VI, whose many recent appointments signal a desire for his “modernized and accountable public service” appeal to be accelerated, stressing the importance of good governance and respecting of the rule of law.  In addition to monitoring public service quality through citizens, Benalilou will also be expected to make recommendations in matters of equality, transparency, and public management. As a crucial body in the royal vision for a more democratic and inclusive Morocco, the Ombudsman’s overarching function will be to “moralize public life,” according to the royal office. Benalilou’s appointment comes at a time when Morocco seeks to both reassure citizens and attract more foreign investments by espousing practices that strengthen the country’s maturing democratic institutions. When appointing the head of the much-anticipated Competition Council a month ago, King Mohammed highlighted that the central mission of independent bodies is to guarantee “neutrality and transparency in all its activities and strengthen the competitiveness of the country’s economy.”

Rabat – UK-based Altus Strategies announced it had discovered more zinc, cobalt and copper prospects at its Takzim project in central Morocco. The exploration had encouraging results for the company at its 71.8 square kilometer Takzim project as the Surface samples include 4.64 percent zinc, 7.78 percent copper and 0.15 percent cobalt, Altus said in a statement on December 12. Altus’s Chief Executive Steven Poulton said, “Although at an early stage, we are encouraged by these further discoveries at Takzim. “The next phase of exploration is currently being planned and will focus on establishing the potential source and scale of the copper, cobalt and zinc mineralisation discovered to date.” The UK-based mining exploration company has completed mapping and reconnaissance exploration over the Takzim project, including the recently granted Takzim Est licenses.  In May, Morocco granted licenses to Altus to explore zinc, copper and other base metals in different locations in the kingdom, including Takzim Est, Arfa, and Ammas, totaling 87.55 square kilometers. In February, the company’s subsidiary, Aterian Resources, received six permits in the Zaer region, 80 kilometers south of Rabat, over an area of 96 square kilometers. The Takzim project consists of “five licence blocks” located in Eastern Jebilet province of central Morocco, 35 kilometers northeast of Marrakech. Founded in 2007, Altus Strategies is a British exploration project generator with a focus on the African continent. Altus discovers and develops natural resources such as gold, copper, iron, zinc, and silver in African countries including Morocco, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Liberia. In September, the Moroccan Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah said that Morocco mined 35.11 million tons of minerals and precious metals in 2017, earning MAD 56.5 billion in revenue. In 2016, mines produced 28.92 million tons, and mining investments amounted to MAD 32 billion. Mining production, 90 percent of which is phosphates, made up 10 percent of GDP and 20 percent of Morocco’s exports. Morocco also mines gold, silver, copper, zinc, and cobalt. In its latest industry trend analysis, the BMI research group ranked Morocco’s mining sector as the second most attractive market in the MENA region, after Saudi Arabia, with an overall Mining Risk Reward Index (RRI) score of 56.3 out of 100. Rabbah stated that Morocco has ambitious goals for 2025 to develop the non-phosphate mining sector. The goal  is to triple the sector’s turnover, multiply investment tenfold in exploration and mining research, and double job positions.

For the first time, the application also requires an experiment, demonstration, or simulation within the video that illustrates the concept being communicated. “If we are to build a greater appreciation of science in the public consciousness, education is key. We need great scientists, but more importantly great communicators who can unlock the mysteries of nature in ways that amaze us, ” said El Hassan Bouaghad, the vice president of Scientific Morocco and director of the program. “Exposure to a topic for the first time allows innovative insights, and youth have the ability to communicate with their peers in a way that others can’t.” After the submission of applications on January 19, 2019, a team from the Scientific Morocco Association will pre-select applications to then be reviewed by a jury of scientists and science communicators. Students are judged on their ability to communicate the topic in an engaging, interesting, and imaginative way. Students applying must also engage in peer review. Each applicant will rate the applications of five other applicants.  The 12 winners will receive full scholarships, paid for by the US State Department, to the renowned Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama in July of 2019. The students will also travel to Washington D.C., where they will visit scientific, cultural, and educational sites on an immersion tour.  The Scientific Morocco Association aims to make scientific knowledge more accessible to Moroccans. With various initiatives, the association strives to create opportunities for Moroccans to engage in STEM. According to their website, “Space Camp provides unique inspirational experiences to talented youth that can help shape their future choices and push them to inspire other kids.” Space Camp is held at the US Space and Rocket Center. Every year students from across the United States and over 150 countries take part in the camp. Throughout the experience, trainees experience simulated missions, collaborate in teams, and learn about flight and space history. According to Space Camp, 61 percent of all graduates are in the fields of aerospace, defense, energy, education, biotech or technology, or studying to do so.

Rabat – Australian prime minister Scott Morrison will soon announce his country’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The Australian government warned its citizens to take caution when traveling to Indonesia before the expected move for the Australian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  The Australian department of foreign affairs  said that Australians who are planning to visit Bali and tropical islands for holidays must “exercise a high degree of caution.” According to Al Jazeera, Morrison might announce the decision as soon as Saturday. Through this move, the Australian government will follow Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The decision was also followed by several countries, including Paraguay. The move erupted tension in the Arab world, as global leaders, including King Mohammed VI, denounced the US decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In December, King Mohammed VI said that “the city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all.” He added that “the city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its isancient identity, and its great political symbolism.”  The US’s decision also angered Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who said that he will no longer accept the US as a mediator for peace talks between Palestine and Israel. The president also said that Trump’s move undermined possible peace negotiations over the area.  World leaders denounced the move. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called Israel a “terrorist state” and a “child killer,” saying Trump’s move was “provocative and unjust.”

Rabat – Days after the much-awaited Geneva meeting between stakeholders in the Western Sahara dispute failed to deliver significant overtures, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, has expressed his “great frustration” over the lack of discernible settlement prospect in the Western Sahara conflict. Speaking today at the Heritage Foundation, the US national security adviser, John Bolton, said he was concerned and “frustrated” that the territorial dispute in Western Sahara conflict has still not been resolved. “I’d like to see this resolved if the parties can agree on the way forward. That’s the preference,” Bolton said in the Q&amp;A session that followed his keynote address. He mentioned his tenure as assistant to the UN’s former Personal Envoy, James Baker, as well as his tenure as Us ambassador to the United Nations, stressing that despite all the efforts made by James and Baker, the UN failed to bring an end to the conflict. Bolton voiced his frustration that after 27 years the conflict is still in standstill, and called on Algeria and Morocco to work out a formula to put an end to it. During his address, the American official said that the United States will no longer support UN missions that have failed to fulfill their mandates. He mentioned the Western Sahara conflict and stressed that the pressure that the US’s role  in convincing the UN Security Council ro reduce the mandate of the UN mission in Western Sahara for six months only, as opposed to the traditional one-year period. The move came as a result of Washington’s determination to see the parties achieve real progress towards achieving a solution, Bolton explained.  Commenting on the UN peacekeeping mission in Africa, Bolton picked the Western Sahara conflict as his “favorite example” to criticize the UN MINURSO. He said, “ Unfortunately, all to often at the United Nations, establishing the peacekeeping force and deploying is the end of creative thinking. And the mandate is renewed almost automatically. The Secretary General special representatives comes in every year , gives a report . The security council rolls the mandate over and not very much happen.” Referring to his participation in 1991 in the drafting of the document that established the UN mission in Western Sahara, Bolton added, “I think there needs to be a lot more focus on resolving the underlying conflict and therefore having success in the peacekeeping mission. Success is not simply continuing the mission… and I pick the Western Sahara conflict as my favorite example.”  He also recalled his previous job with UN’s former personal envoy James Baker in 1997.  “When I got the UN in 2005-2006 , again we tried to fix … all what we wanna do is hold a referendum  for 70,000 voters . 27 years later the status of the territory is still unresolved,” he emphasized. “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Bolton wondered with frustration. Bolton’s statements followed UN roundtable in Geneva on December 5-6, which saw the participation of Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania and the Polisario.   The four parties expressed their satisfaction with the UN-led Geneva talks. The roundtable closed with an agreement from all parties to convene again in a similar early in 2019. Although UN envoy Host Kohler has been lauded for managing to bring Morocco and Algeria around a common roundtable, the Geneva meeting has not totally dissipated old doubts. Dubbing the whole process as “business as usual,” some have pointed that it still remains to be seen whether the scheduled meeting in early 2019 will lay the ground for more diplomatic momentum. Known for his reserved and somewhat unwelcoming attitude toward MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, Bolton has been credited with the recent US-led initiative to shorten the extension period of MINURSO’s mandate. Instead of the ordinary one-year extension, he convinced Trump’s administration to opt for a shorter six-month mandate in order to heap pressure on the conflicting parties to find a quick political solution. There have also been heightened concerns that Bolton might convince the US to cut financial contribution to MINURSO. Bolton has long criticized the peacekeeping body for its failure to fulfill its purpose in 27 years of existence.

Rabat – In a recent report, Morocco’s Court of Auditors has identified major deficiencies in the implementation of the 2009-2012 emergency program to reform education. The program intended to make up for the recorded delays in the educational sector since 2000. However, the report uncovered mismanagement and a lack of proper financial controls. “The Court of Auditors considered that the Ministry of National Education’s emergency plan did not achieve all its objectives, nor did it have the expected positive impact on the education system,” the report concludes. The court made the report public on December 12. The report comes three months after the president of the Court of Auditors, Driss Jettou, gave the 2016-2017 annual report, which identified serious deficiencies in public and private schools regarding infrastructure, reception capacity, and the number of teachers. The state allocated a total budget of approximately MAD 45.27 billion for the three-year program, with MAD 27.5 billion going to regional academies and 17.7 to the education ministry.  However, the total resources allocated to the education sector exceeded, according to the report, the planned budget for the emergency program by MAD 3.85 billion. “Taking into account the payment appropriations for the years 2009-2012 and the commitment appropriations for the 2012 budget year, the resources allocated to the education sector, excluding payroll, amounted to MAD 49.12 billion.”  The ministry, however, “did not have a document approved by the Ministry of Finance, identifying the sources of funding and justifying the increase in the appropriations allocated to the education sector during the period 2009-2012.” The court calculated the amount based on the administrative accounts of the education ministry and the accounts of regional academies. The Court of Auditors attributed the weak performance to the lack of “sufficient management capacity” in the project implementation, planning, and financial management. The report noted some progress in the education system in terms of “quantity.” The number of enrolled students increased from 5.6 million students in 2009 to 6 million in 2017 (up by 373,212 students in eight years), while the number of schools increased from 9,397 to 10,756. Nevertheless, the court identified serious deficiencies in capacity, infrastructure, and pre-primary education. The emergency program could only build 286 new schools out of the 1,164 schools planned in the program, at an implementation rate of 24 percent. When it came to expanding existing schools, the program planned to build 7,052 new classrooms. Yet, the number did not exceed 4,062 classrooms (57 percent). Despite the resources allocated for renovating schools, the Court of Auditors found some schools lacked basic facilities in the  2016-2017 school year. The report identified 6,437 schools without connection to sewage, 3,192 schools not connected to drinking water, 681 schools not connected to the electricity network, in addition to 9,365 dilapidated classrooms. In 2012, the emergency program had an object to generalize pre-primary education to 80 percent of primary schools by 2015.  However, the program did not meet its goal as only 24 percent out of 7,767 primary schools had pre-primary education in the 2016-2017 school year, according to the report. The report also noted the problem of school overcrowding, which increased between 2008-2009 and 2016-2017, from 7 percent to 21 percent in primary schools and from 16 percent to 42 percent in secondary schools. In order to overcome the acute and accumulated shortage in teachers, the education ministry resorted to recruiting 54,927 “contractually” between 2016 and 2017. The hired teachers did not have the required training which may, according to the report, negatively affect  education quality. The Court of Auditors recommended the education ministry conduct a thorough examination of the current education situation. It also called on the ministry to take necessary measures and to implement risk assessment and alternative solutions before embarking on any program, particularly regarding the management capacities that various partners use in the program implementation.

Rabat – Motii participated in the coding and debugging workshop in Agadir during DevFest Agadir 2018, hosted by Google Developer Group (GDG), where he made a presentation about his favorite programming language, Python.  Motii became the youngest speaker at a GDG conference, where he was among participants from big tech companies such as Google, and speakers from the US, Germany, and Spain. At the event, he earned himself the title of the “youngest Moroccan programmer.”  In an interview with news outlet RT Online, Motii said that he owes some of his progress to his brother. ”My brother’s influence was very important; he got me into this field. I thank him so much.” When asked about his favorite programming language, he said: ”Python is my favorite programming language. I use it every day.” Motii compared Python to one of the biggest programming languages, Java, arguing that Python is his favorite language because “it is more productive and unlocks more opportunities. There is a lot of syntax and functions and its variables are easy.” While the boy’s family discovered that he was a rising talent in the world of programming, they still did not expect him to be as good as he is. His uncle, Abdellah Motii, said: ”We knew he was interested in computing for a while but we didn’t think he was that good at it. His motivation is what got him into learning.” Idder started learning how to code when he was only ten. He codes in Python, Java, C++, HTML, and Scratch, and he is now in his second year of vocational training.  The self-taught programmer is also a self-taught English speaker. He said he learned English from movies and videos on the internet. 
 Zakaria Jaiathe, a senior software engineer who met and had a “spontaneous” interview with the young programmer, has started a campaign on the for-profit crowdfunding platform GoFundMe to purchase Motii a pro laptop.  Jaiathe said: “I was so amazed by [Idder Motii’s] technical background and his ability to discuss and understand very advanced topics such as machine learning and augmented reality at his age.”  DevFest Agadir 2018 is a free two-day workshop, on “codelabs, hackathons, hands-on experience, coding and debugging,” that took place in Agadir’s National School of Applied Sciences (ENSA) from December 8 to 9. Motii has joined the list of young Moroccan prodigies such as Mariam Amjoun, a nine-year-old Moroccan girl who won the 2018 Arab Reading Challenge in Dubai, beating 10.5 million participants in October, and eight-year-old Moroccan Malak Belarbi, who won first place in Turkey’s global mental arithmetic competition in the same month.

Rabat – The two chambers of the Colombian parliament expressed full support for Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara through a resolution, denouncing the serious violations of human rights against Sahrawi in the Tindouf camps, in Algeria. The resolution quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) said that the MPs of the Colombian parliament “reiterate” full support “for the efforts made by the kingdom of Morocco since 2007 in favor of a just, lastting and mutually acceptable political solution to the regional dispute over the Sahara, on the basis of the Moroccan initiative for the negotiation of a status of autonomy of the Sahara region.” Like the international community, the resolution described Morocco’s autonomy initiative as “pre-eminent-serious, credible and realistic.” The resolution recalled that the UN and the Security Council resolutions have long described Morocco’s autonomy plan as a credible solution to the Western Sahara conflict. The resolution added that “only a political and negotiable solution to the issue of the Sahara preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the kingdom of Morocco is able to promote peace and stability in the Maghreb and Sahel region.” The MPs also expressed “great concerns” about the “serious violations” of human rights by the Polisario Front, including the “restriction on freedom of movement, expression, and demonstration” in the Tindouf camps. MPs, who voted for the resolution also called for “the census of the populations of these camps in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2414 of 27 April 2018 and the 1951 Geneva Convention and the relevant conclusions of the UNHCR Executive Committee.” MPs and senators from major political parties signed the resolution, including the ruling  Democratic Center (party). Other parties whose members signed the resolution are the Radical Change Party, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the National Unity Part, the MIRA Party and the Green Alliance Party. The resolution also commended Morocco’s efforts to ensure development and better human rights in the country.

Rabat – Kyiv Post reported that the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumers’ Rights Protection have inked a veterinary certificate for exports of Ukrainian egg products. In April, Ukraine’s food state service announced that Morocco’s government gave the green light to open the national market to Ukrainian chicken and meat. “The State Service on Food Safety and Consumer Protection of Ukraine and the competent authority of the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to a veterinary certificate for the export of meat and poultry products from Ukraine to Morocco,” according to a statement released by Ukrainian Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food.  In January 2018, the National Association of Egg Producers (ANPO) said that The average Moroccan consumer ate 180 eggs in 2017, a significant increase over the 138 eggs consumed in 2010. Morocco’s increased demand for eggs was completely met last year, as the country produced 5.5 billion units in 2017, according to preliminary figures from the ANPO. In 2017, egg production needed a  MAD 3.25 billion investment with an estimated turnover of MAD 6.75 billion, the Association said. In August, Morocco also approved US poultry to enter the Moroccan market. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced that Morocco will import US poultry, opening up an estimated $10 million market. “The Trump Administration continues to prioritize the opening of new markets for U.S. agricultural products. This new access to the Moroccan market is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports,” said Robert Lighthizer, The US Trade Representative (USTR) representative. In 2017, Morocco produced 5.5 billion eggs.

On November 19, the French government decided to charge international students higher registration fees starting from the 2019-2020 academic year. The Conference of University Presidents (CPU) published a statement on Monday asking the government to suspend the planned increase for registration fees. “France needs international students who contribute to its development and influence in the world,” says the statement. The statement added that ‘the announced general increase in registration fees is not an appropriate response, as it carries with it the significant risk of excluding students and france student doctoral students whom we welcome today.” Moreover, the CPU board of directors “requests that the entry into force of the provisions in question to be suspended”. For her part, the French minister of higher education, Frederique Vidal, addressed a letter to university presidents and directors of higher education schools on Monday explaining that international students who reside f in France for several years will pay the same registration fees as European students.  She added that students who already began their studies in France are not concerned by the increase. The French prime minister, who announced the international education reform bill, explained that it would serve to fund more education-related projects and build more facilities to accommodate students and invest more in foreign language education. The decision faced heavy criticism from students, who decided to protest, adding to the current chaos in France.

Rabat –  Algerian news outlet Ennahar Online translated Morocco’s decision to not bid for the 2019 AFCON as “fear” of Algeria. In an article posted yesterday, Ennahar asked a provocative question in its title “Algeria is behind Morocco’s decision to not host CAN 2019?” The news outlet also claimed that Morocco did not present any clear reasons for its refusal to replace Cameroon as “it owns the facilities and stadiums that allow it to do so, but the real reason is apparent.” On Wednesday, Morocco’s Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami officially announced that Morocco will not bid to host the tournament. On December 1, the Confederation of the African Football (CAF) stripped Cameroon of AFCON hosting rights due to lack of venues and facilities to host teams and fans. After Cameroon’s rejection, CAF invited other countries to submit applications to host the tournament. International and local news outlets speculated that Morocco would step up replace Cameroon, but Alami’s statement denied the rumors. Even before CAF’s decision to eliminate Cameroon, Moroccan officials said they were not interested in hosting Morocco’s government also showed full support for Cameroon’s determination to host the tournament. Throughout the year, Moroccan officials vowed their support for Cameroon. In March, President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa said that Morocco ‘is alongside our Cameroonian friends.” He added that FRMF is at “the disposal of the Cameroonian Federation to make the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon,” and “the rumors are over. Egypt is now expected to submit its bid to host the 2019 CAN.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Interior has deployed a special patrol unit to intensify the fight against vendors selling fake olive oil across Morocco. Frauds in several regions of the country are reportedly distributing and selling unregulated, fake olive oil containing a toxic chemical substance imported from the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, causing a public health risk.  The frauds allegedly use special capsules and mix them with lukewarm water to produce a liquid that resembles olive oil. The Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said on Monday at the House of Representatives that his ministry will be strict in dealing with frauds who are caught selling fake essential oils. The olive oil frauds are not new to Morocco or other parts of the world According to Akhannouch, Morocco has harvested 2 million tons of olives this season, an increase of 28 percent compared to the crop last year. The minister announced at the 5th National Fair of the Olive Tree, which took place on November 28-December 1, that Morocco has become the 4th largest olive oil producer worldwide. The olive tree is the main fruit tree cultivated in Morocco. Morocco’s principle  regions for olive production are Marrakech, Fez, Meknes, and Casablanca. Olive trees cover more than 1.07 million hectares, accounting for 65 percent of the tree species in the country.

Rabat – Owners of passenger vehicles valued at less than MAD 160,000 will have to pay MAD 12,000 instead of MAD 4,500 to have comprehensive insurance. The price increase is due to the compensation the client receives from insurance, reported daily newspaper Assabah in its Wednesday edition. Despite offsets, insurance company profits remain high and do not stop increasing each year. The insurance sector recorded a net profit of MAD 4.33 billion in 2017 and is expected to rise by the end of 2018. The insurance market recorded in 2018 a turnover that exceeds MAD 6.29 billion, up by 5.8 percent compared to 2017. The assurance fee in Morocco is calculated based on tax horsepower, the type of the engine (gasoline or diesel), and the age of the vehicle, among other things. Salaries stagnate, living costs rise Assabah, which first reported the news, noted that the insurance companies’ move is “unwarranted and controversial.”  The newspaper suggested that the move is likely to raise eyebrows in various Moroccan sectors, especially given the country’s extremely low minimum wages for employed Moroccans.  But another eyebrow-raising element to the move may be consumers’ feeling that their recent demonstrations against relentless commodity price fluctuations and rising costs of living have not been taken seriously by both the country’s authorities and leading businesses. Earlier this year, a nationwide boycott movement manifested Moroccans’ accumulated grievances towards a system which many demonstrators said favors rich business owners over Moroccan consumers. While there were promises that prices would go down, things have remained virtually the same. Meanwhile, demands to raise the country’s minimum wages have been met unfavorably by the government. Last month, chief of government El Othmani’s meeting with trade unions’ representatives ended in a stalemate.  In France, by comparison, only three weeks of general strike resulted in the French government bending to most of the protesters’ demands. France’s Yellow Vests’ demands were similar to the series of complaints Morocco’s boycott campaign had raised: an aloof and pro-rich government elite, as well as an exponential rise in living costs. The contrast, however, is that France’s popular uprising compelled authorities to–even temporarily–forsake their ivory tower and listen to disaffected and impoverished citizens. “I know I have hurt some of you and I take full responsibility,” President Macron said in a speech earlier this week, as he announced tax cuts and wage raises. While the French President’s late-minute surrender has not fully placated the protesting, many observers have suggested that his move means that at least the government has taken heed of the people’s struggles to make ends meet. In Morocco, however, wages are significantly low and stagnant while taxes and insurance fees are exponentially rising. Moreover, Assabah noted, income deduction to pay for taxes or insurances fees should be based on a given customer’s socio-economic status, or the price of the purchased good. But in Morocco, “insurance fees rise when insurance companies feel like it.”

For Algerians, Morocco is among the best destination for New Year’s Eve, according to Visa-Algerie.com. The travel website said that travel agencies are listing Morocco among the best New Year’s Eve destinations for Algerians. A sale manager at a travel agency said that Dubai comes first, Istanbul second, while Marrakech is the third best destinations for Algerians. The website said that the ranking for the best destinations for  New Year’s Eve for Algerians internationally is: Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, and Dubai. The North African country is also a top choice for Portuguese tourists. According to Pedro Costa Ferreira, president of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), Morocco remains one of the top vacation destinations for the festive season. Morocco’s stability and strategic location make it a favorite for international visitors. The 2019 Travel Risk Map illustrates how Morocco as a safe destination with relatively low terrorism threats, risk of natural disaster, or health issues. In the first half of 2018, tourist arrivals increased by 10 to 5.1 million tourists compared to the same period in 2017. A significant increase was seen among Italian tourists with an 18 percent increase, followed by Germans (13 percent, and French tourists 10 percent.” Spanish tourists account for 6 percent, while British tourists for 7 percent.

Rabat – France and Morocco have signed a French-learning agreement to revitalize French in Morocco.  Signing the document in Rabat yesterday, Rachid Talbi El Alami, Morocco’s youth and sports minister, and Jean-François Girault, the French ambassador to Rabat, said that the document is a positive step towards the strengthening of the cultural and linguistic proximity between Rabat and Paris. According to the two officials, the recently signed document follows in the footsteps of a 2017 agreement between France and Morocco to revive the French language’s appeal and reclaim the prestige it has lost in recent decades in a number of predominantly Francophone countries. The document being signed is “validation of the initial tentative settlement,” said El Alami, in reference to the 2017 agreement between the two partners.  However, the Moroccan official added, what is new in the newly signed accord is that it will enlarge the inroad of French language into Moroccan schools and cultural centers. In the frame of the agreement, Morocco’s youth and sports ministry and French authorities will cooperate to build French language learning centers in youth cultural centers (Maison des Jeunes) around Morocco. “The project entails the building of French language centers in all Moroccan youth cultural centers,” said the Moroccan minister. He added that the project will be monitored by his ministry “in collaboration with the French Institute in Morocco.” While strengthening the linguistic bonds of the Rabat-Paris rapprochement, the agreement will also help young Moroccans wishing to master the French language. For the French ambassador, despite recent setbacks, his country’s language remains an important international language to have in one’s linguistic toolkit.  He expressed his desire to have more Moroccans learn French and be interested in French culture. He said: “The francophone area is open to French, Moroccan, African, and European youth. Girault explained that learning French can open many doors, especially in terms of professional career. During the signing ceremony, 42 children from youth centers in Kbibat, Al Amal, and Mechouar received their “French as a foreign language” certificates. Recent controversies The agreement comes in a politically charged moment for France and the French language. In 2017, President Macron launched an initiative to make France a global language.  The French president appointed Morocco’s Leila Slimani as his francophone affairs councilor. Macron argued that former French colonies, which now make up the majority of the International Organization of Francophonie, are the sole recourse if France wants to reclaim its lost cultural and linguistic global prestige.  Increasingly turning his gaze towards Francophone countries, Macron vowed to increase the number of Francophone African students in French higher learning institutions. In recent months, however, the French government passed a controversial bill on university fees for foreign students.  According to the new bill, non-EU students, who, like their French and EU counterparts used to receive free-of-charge education, will now have to pay 30 percent of the total cost of their university degrees. The new regulation will enter into force starting in the 2019-2020 academic year. Ever since, many in France have voiced concerns about the future of French and Francophonie, saying that rather than make France attractive, the new regulation will make students choose countries like Canada, the US, or England over France.  Others have suggested that the historical and cultural proximity between France and former colonies will be a basis to exempt francophone students from paying the new fees.  But it remains to be seen whether France is taking the complaints into account and whether the document signed yesterday is part of more agreements to come.

Rabat – The Russian ambassador to Morocco, Valerian Shuvaev, has confirmed to Sputnik News that Morocco lowered the grain tax to “zero” for Russia. “Of course, this is good news because Morocco’s grain experts are one of the main Russian exports to Morocco.” He added that Morocco’s decision will give Russia “more opportunity to increase the volume of deliveries and, in general, to expand our trade,” he said. Sputnik reported that Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said that trade between Russia and Morocco increased in the first half of 2018 to $900 million, or 20 percent that the same period of 2017. The news outlet added that the main Russian export goods are petroleum products, agro-food products, and coal. Russia is also Morocco’s primary citrus export destination. In 2017-2018, the North African country’s exports of mandarin and tangerine totaled 205,091 metric tons to Russia and 166,299 metric tons to the EU. In October, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said that agriculture products represent 77 percent of Moroccan exports to Russia, estimated at MAD 1.5 billion.  The official offered the statistics during his meeting with Patrushev. Akhannouch said that the growth of trade between Rabat and Moscow is in the order of 10 percent since 2014. Patrushev also presented a series of aspects of economic cooperation between the two countries, referring to the joint ventures in fruit, vegetables, and red meat. The meeting was held as part of a mission to Morocco by the Russian Export Centre (REC) group of companies, during the 7th Moroccan-Russian Joint Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation. On the sidelines of the joint commission, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said economic exchanges have reached a “satisfactory” level as well as cooperation in the key sectors of agriculture, energy, tourism and industry between the two countries.

Rabat – Achiume’s visit to Morocco is will last until December 21. She will meet with government officials, local NGOs, and victims of racism as part of her fact-finding mission. Morocco’s human rights minister, Mustapha Ramid, is expected to welcome Achiume today before her scheduled meetings with stakeholders and academics including the Rabita Mohammedia des Oulemas, Mohammadia’s League of Scholars. Achiume will reportedly visit Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, Tangier, Tetouan, Nador, Fez, and Agadir. At the end of her stay in Morocco, as in each country, the Special Rapporteur will hold a press conference during which she will present her “final observations, recommendations, and reports.” The reports of each examined countries are given to the Human Rights Council annually during its June session. Achiume has already examined the United Kingdom. In her report about the UK, she wrote: “I am shocked by the criminalisation of young people from ethnic minorities, especially young black men.” Achiume condemned the fact that young black men in the UK are  “over-represented” in police criminal search and prison system. Morocco received a total of 11 visits between 2000 and 2016 from UN Rapporteurs on several issues such as politics, economy, social and cultural rights, said Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The UN established the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in 1993. Tendayi Achiume, appointed in September 2011, is the fifth Special Rapporteur on racism.

Rabat – With the help of modern satellite analysis techniques, the Andalusian Council of Agriculture obtained data which shows that Morocco’s greenhouse crop is growing rapidly than Spain’s. The council issued its latest report which emphasized the “strong growth” of greenhouse acreage in Morocco, which increased from 9,000 hectares in 2001 to almost 24,000 hectares cultivated at the end of the last year, Spanish outlet La Voz de Almeria reported on December 10. The greenhouse’s cultivated surface in the North African country is expected to increase to 26,000 hectares at the end of this year, says the council’s report. The illustrated data corresponds only to the Souss-Massa-Draa region, namely the provinces of Agadir-Ida-Ou Tanane, Inezgane-Ait Melloul, Chtouka-Ait Baha, and Taroudant. The estimates provided in the report indicated a “significantly larger area” when adding other regions known for their abundant agricultural crops such as Gharb-Chrarda-Beni Hssen in Western Morocco and Tangier-Tetouan in Northern Morocco. The strong growth is particularly shown in the provinces of Kenitra, near Rabat, and Larache, near Tangier, where greenhouse acreage has grown from 2,975 hectares of protected crop in 2002 to more than 8,500 hectares in the previous year, up 179 percent. Northern Morocco is the region where growth in greenhouse cultivation is the most notable, especially in areas closer to the ports that the greenhouse vegetables ship from. According to the Spanish report, greenhouse vegetables in these areas are growing much quicker than the rest of the North African country. Morocco is Spain’s largest non-EU fresh fruit and vegetables supplier with a total volume of 321,189 tons worth €507 million, the Spanish federation of fruit and vegetable exporters (Fepex) reported last week. Tomatoes are the most exported agricultural products to the world, mainly to the EU. The UN Statistics Division (UNSD) ranked Morocco fourth in tomato exports in the world at 527 million kilograms in 2017, 7 percent of the world’s total.

Rabat – Morocco sees the potential for cooperation in the Kazakh tourism market, said the country’s first Ambassador to Kazakhstan Abdeljalil Saubry at the December 5 inaugural Moroccan Tourism Day in the capital َAstana.

“The number of companies presented and their reputations demonstrate a great interest in Morocco today. It demonstrates great potential and opportunities that we have and we will develop further,” he said. “We see that Kazakh tourists are eager to see new countries and to discover new cultures.  This inspires us to promote the tourism sector and improve the service,” he added. 

Moroccan National Tourist Office for Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States Director Samir Soussi noted that holding the tourism day event was a push for large-scale tourism promotion.

“The Kazakh market is one of the priorities for us. We do not have a large flow of Kazakh tourists, but we see how they enjoy staying in Morocco. We have a tourism development project in Kazakhstan and we are going to strengthen our presence,” he said.

One study shows that Kazakh outbound tourism increased by 63% in 2017 against 49% in 2016.  Morocco mostly imports cereals, cotton, and gas from Kazakhstan, while exporting citrus fruits and seafood. Morocco established its first embassy in Kazakhstan at the end of 2016, almost 25 years after diplomatic relations were first established.

In a series of articles posted by Russian news outlet Sputnik News, the Russian ambassador to Morocco, Valerian Shuvaev, discussed Moroccan-Russian diplomatic ties, military agreements with Rabat, and his country’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. Shuvaev said that “it is early to discuss the possibility of selling S-400s in Morocco as the country has made no official request.” In 2017, international media reported that  Morocco is interested in acquiring Russian S-400 ground to air missile system. In response, Shuarev said that “You should understand that it is a very complex system. In order to deploy such an air defense system an extensive preparation process and understanding why they are required.” Traditionally, the US is Morocco’s largest military supplier.  In November, the US State Department announced that it has approved a “possible foreign military sale to Morocco” for a budget of $1.259 billion. For Russia, Algeria remains its primary buyer. But, the Russian diplomat said that his country has “no limits in our military and technical cooperation, especially when it comes to Morocco. These issues depend on the Moroccan party to a large extent.” The Russian diplomat added that Morocco showed “interest in Russian military production,” adding that his country is ready to cooperate. Quoting CNBC television channel, Sputnik said that at least 13 countries are interested in acquiring Russia’s S-400, including Morocco. In recent years, Morocco has been determined to build a stronger military, investing billions of dollars in the purchase of machine guns and equipment for tanks from the US. Global Firepower ranked Morocco 55th among 136 countries in its 2018 military strength ranking.  Although Morocco has increased its military spending in recent years, Algeria remains the first in Africa to spend billions of dollars on military equipment. Algeria was ranked 23rd, according to the Global Firepower.

Rabat – Unsatisfied with the performance of the current authorities, a group of young Tunisian activists has called for a general strike to protest against bad governance. Calling themselves ‘Red Vests,’ an apparent nod to France’s ongoing rising prices and anti-‘arrogant elite’ protests, the Tunisian group said that their resentment and desire to demonstrate is motivated by systemic government failure and widespread corruption in the country. Like their French counterparts, Tunisia’s Red Vests say that an aloof and corrupt government has driven up unemployment and poverty, exacerbating the grievances of the North African country’s large portion of disenfranchised. Despite Tunisia’s reputation for  progressive reform and most performing democracy in the Arab world, the Red Vests accuse the country’s authorities of championing “a policy of systemic impoverishment.” In a Facebook post on Friday, December 7, the group said it wants to “save Tunisia” from both its harsh socio-economic circumstances and the “lack of vision” prevailing in government circles. The Red Vests movement’s call for a general strike to commemorate the eleventh anniversary of the Arab Spring comes amid a spiral of strikes. In November alone, the North African country was home to 746 social protests, according to the Economic and Social Rights Forum quoted by Middle East Eye. While Tunisia has collected enthusiastic applause from the international community for its bold liberal-minded reforms, the IMF-monitored austerity measures have created quarters of unhappy and economically disaffected.

Washington D.C. – Pedro Sanchez attempted on several occasions to use Brexit negations to revive Spanish calls for shared sovereignty over Gibraltar once the UK has left the EU. In fact, his government threatened to veto a Brexit deal over the status of the Rock. As Spain pushes its agenda in Brussels, the Moroccans should be discussing with the British and the Europeans the future of the Moroccan cities of Ceuta and Melilla occupied by Spain. Additionally, Rabat should remind London of its promise not to let Spain control both sides of the Mediterranean and warn the European Union about applying double standards in applying the concept of self-determination in the Western Sahara versus Gibraltar. Morocco may not be involved in the Brexit negotiations, but any changes to the status of Gibraltar should be of a major concern to its diplomats. If the Spanish positions effectively become EU policy, then Spain would have scored a major victory. A shared sovereignty over Gibraltar must open the door to a similar deal between Morocco and Spain over the two enclaves. Some may argue that there are no apparent relations between the two cases, but the fact that Spain has insisted that Gibraltar is not part of Great Britain and as such is not covered by any agreements, is the same as Morocco asserting sovereignty over Ceuta, Melilla and the Western Sahara. Withstanding that Gibraltar residents rejected shared sovereignty with Spain in a referendum in 2002, the UK territory should leave the EU in case Brexit is finalized. Thus a change of legal substance to this status favoring a Spanish control should trigger a start of dialogue over the fate of the occupied cities in Norther Morocco. Moreover, Moroccans must remind Pedro Sanchez that Spain that insists on a referendum for self-determination in the disputed Western Sahara cannot ignore Gibraltar’s’ Constitution that offers the locals a large degree of self-rule short of full autonomy. Spanish politicians must choose between supporting self-determination or political negotiations to resolve these types of conflicts. Rabat should not be fooled by Pedro Sanchez charm offensive. Spain’s prime minister visited Morocco two weeks ago bringing promise of full cooperation on several fronts but with no firm political backing for Rabat’s positions in the Western Share or a promise to open an honest dialogue for the decolonization of the two enclaves. Even if a Brexit agreement passes, the status of Gibraltar would remain fluid. Therefore, Moroccan diplomats and civil society must remain alert. Spanish goodwill toward Morocco must be translated into concrete backing of Rabat’s positions on strategic topics. If Mr. Sanchez insists in having a crucial say in Gibraltar’s future despite of the local population’s desire to stay within the UK, then Madrid should come out and support Rabat’s similar position in the Western Sahara.

Rachid Talbi Alami à #Arryadia) pic.twitter.com/J8UBC3Urnd — Arryadia TV officiel (@arryadiatv) December 12, 2018  In recent days, local and international media have been speculating that Morocco intended to submit its bid to host CAN, after Cameroon lost its hosting rights. Cameron lost eligibility to host the tournament on November 30, due to delays with venue building and security concerns. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) is currently looking for alternatives to host the CAN. The confederation will announce the hosting nation on January 9. Morocco was under consideration as a possible alternative. While several Moroccan sports officials denied Morocco’s intention to replace Cameroon, the head coach of the national football team, Herve Renard expressed a different view. Last month, Renard publicly stated that he believes Morocco meets all the requirements to host the football tournament which will witness the participation of Morocco’s national team. CAF called on all of its Member Associations to submit their bid dossier before Friday, December 14, hoping to secure a new host by the end of December.

Rabat – After years of severed ties between Morocco and Venezuela, the Moroccan minister of foreign affairs, Nasser Bourita, met with his Venezuelan counterpart, Jorge Arreaza, to strengthen bilateral relations. On the sidelines of Marrakech’s intergovernmental migration conference on December 10 and 11, which saw the adoption of the Global Migration Compact, the two ministers shared views on migration issues and human rights. Venezuela’s Ministry of People’s Power for Foreign Affairs shared a photo of the two ministers on Twitter, writing: “From Marrakech … Venezuela is consolidating friendly relations between the nations [Morocco-Venezuela].” #AHORA | Desde Marrakech, consolidando el mundo pluripolar y las relaciones de amistad con los pueblos, el canciller Jorge Arreaza se reúne con Nasser Bourita, ministro de Asuntos Exteriores y Cooperación Internacional de Marruecos pic.twitter.com/OtOtbSSevF — Cancillería 🇻🇪 (@CancilleriaVE) December 10, 2018 Rabat broke off diplomatic relations with Caracas in 2009 due to Venezuela’s support of the Polisario Front claiming Western Sahara, constituting a threat for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Morocco had summoned its ambassador to Venezuela in January of the same year for supporting the Polisario separatists.  Venezuela is one of the countries that recognizes Polisario’s self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). The meeting between the two counterparts was not the first of its kind this year. Bourita and Arreaza met in September at the 73rd session of the UN’s annual General Assembly in New York, paving the way for a smoother meeting at the Marrakech conference. Over 160 countries approved the Global Compact on Migration (CGM) Monday.  The compact aims “to better manage international migration, address its challenges, and strengthen migrants’ rights while contributing to sustainable development.”

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) denied rumors circulating on social media and local news outlets that allege its members arrested  French activists who were protesting the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The DGSN’s statement , which was quoted by Moroccan television channel 2M, said that its members  “[had] not initiated or restricted any freedom of movement against any foreign or Moroccan citizen in the city of Marrakech.” The French activists  are members of Identity Generation, a movement that is known for its hostility and racism toward migrants. During the conference, they carried a banner that read: “No to the compact of Marrakech. Stop the massive immigration.” The political movement originated in France  in 2012 “to fight massive immigration to and the Islamization of Europe.” It also has branches in the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. On Saturday, December 8, French yellow vests protested the Marrakech compact on the sidelines of their protests against Macron’s government. A Twitter user shared the video of the protest against the UN migration pact, which was captioned: “In Lyon, the yellow vests are mobilized against Marrakech’s pact.” On Monday, more than 160 countries voted in favor of the compact today.  The migration pact aims to address humanitarian concerns, human rights issues, and developmental aspects of international migration. It also seeks to protect the dignity of all migrants, regardless of their status. The compact promises to ease the pressure on countries that welcome and host refugees.

Rabat – Morocco’s citrus production for the marketing year 2018-2019 will reach an expected 2.6 million metric tons, up 18 percent compared to last marketing year, the US Department of Agriculture said in a report published on December 7. Compared to the last marketing year, the report forecasts an increase in Moroccan citrus products, including tangerine and mandarin with 1.2 million metric tons (up 14 percent), orange with 1.2 million metric tons, (up 18 percent), and lemon with 45,000 metric tons. The increase in production, according to the report, is “due to the favorable weather conditions and increases in the area harvested as younger trees begin to bear fruit.” Based on the forecast, Morocco will export 585,000 metric tons of tangerine and mandarin during the 2018-2019 marketing year, up 9 percent compared to the previous marketing year. Meanwhile, the country’s exports of orange will reach 190,000 metric tons, up 42 percent. Russia and the EU are Morocco’s primary citrus export destinations. In 2017-2018, the North African country’s exports of mandarin and tangerine totaled 205,091 metric tons to Russia and 166,299 metric tons to the EU.  Morocco’s exports of tangerine and mandarin to the US increased by 30 percent over the last five marketing years, making it the North African country’s fourth mandarin importer with 55,561 metric tons, after Canada (67,800 metric tons). The increase is due to the market access that the US regained in Morocco’s Berkane region. US leading importer and distributor of fresh fruits LGS Specialty Sales announced in last month the company is expecting a large crop of Moroccan citrus “thanks to a strong growing season.” The company said that Berkane is a fertile area which “was selected specifically for its climate and rootstock, both of which are especially conducive to producing superior citrus.” The USDA report also showed forecast figures about Morocco’s citrus domestic consumption which will see some increase in the 2018-2019 marketing year. Moroccans will consume an expected total of 765,000 metric tons of tangerine and mandarin, up 8 percent over 2017/2018; and 950,000 metric tons of fresh orange (up 14 percent). According to the report, “many [Moroccan] farmers had to dump their products in local markets, causing prices to drop to their lowest levels.”

The Ajel News 24 outlet tweeted on December 3 that Time listed Mohammed Bin Salman(MBS) in its “Person of the Year” issue for 2018.  A talk show on Saudi’s 24 channel also displayed a “photoshopped” cover of Time magazine reading, in English, “The most influential person in the world.” The cover image shows MBS. The channel uploaded the show’s episode to Youtube on December 5. MBS is actually on Time’s list of 100 Most Influential People in 2018. The Person of the Year and the 100 Most Influential People are two separate, annual Time magazine issues.
 The tweet also claimed the Saudi crown prince is “the only Arab figure chosen by the magazine.” Some news outlets, including RT Arabic, repeated the claim. Former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al Ibadi, an Arab, was also listed among the top 100 Most Influential People. Time published the online article on Al Ibadi and MBS in April 19. In an article for Time magazine, Saudi Arabian women’s rights activist Manal al-Sharif praised MBS for lifting restrictions on women, challenging “the culture of corruption, and reining in religious police who choked us.” Time has chosen Jamal Khashoggi, three other journalists and a news organization as its Person of the Year for 2018. Saudi operatives closely linked to MBS murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.

Rabat – ACWA Power, a water desalination and power generation company, is working together with ECOHZ, a promoter of renewable energy, to empower Moroccan women around the Noor Power Plant in Ouarzazate, Morocco.  The Noor Power Plant, run by ACWA Power, is the world’s largest concentrated solar power farm. ACWA Power aims to develop the communities and support the women around the plant as a corporate social responsibility project. ACWA commissioned WOCAN to carry out the W+ standard.  Women Organizing for Change in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management, WOCAN, developed the W+ standard, which according to the organization, “quantifies and monetizes the social capital created by women, to recognize and reward their contributions to sustainable environments and communities.”  The standard is a quantifiable measurement of UN sustainable development goal five: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. WOCAN’s W+ standard accounts for time, income and assets, health, leadership, education and knowledge, and food security in order to produce quantified women-benefit units. With the CSR project, WOCAN will focus specifically on income, assets, knowledge, and leadership. “Engaging and empowering women in project communities will create better project outcomes and improve lives. WOCAN is excited to collaborate with ACWA Power and ECOHZ and enable credible, measurable social co-benefits in renewable energy projects,” said Jeannette Gurung, executive director of WOCAN. David Ungar, the executive director of greenhouse gas mitigation and sustainability at ACWA Power, stated, “We are in an era where we are able to have a very direct positive impact in the communities in which we operate. The W+ units help us to achieve our goal to make a measurable difference in-line with the United Nations SDG’s.” The project, which started in 2013, hopes to aid women through increased income, access to education and healthcare, employability efforts, and ultimately recognizing and rewarding women’s contributions to a sustainable future.  In targeted communities, ACWA Power has developed agricultural and handicraft cooperatives, as well as implemented training in livestock and handicraft activities. The CSR project will be implemented throughout the plant’s operation, until 2043. “Our commitment in countries we operate in extends beyond supplying electricity to the grid. We are passionate about our model of developing plants in remote areas and actively collaborating with the local communities,” said Paddy Padmanathan, president and CEO of ACWA Power. “We are proud to be working with W+ to contribute towards increasing income and employability.” The collaboration between ACWA Power, ECOHZ, and WOCAN hopes to work towards UN SDGs five and seven. The fifth SDG promotes gender equality and women’s empowerment. The seventh SDG calls for affordable and clean energy, focusing on renewable energy. Tom Lindberg, the managing director at ECOHZ, added, “We work to change corporations’ energy behavior and are enthusiastic to be able to empower women at the same time—contribute to both SDG seven and SDG five.” In the MENA region, only 29 percent of clean energy companies claim to have gender equality in their employment. The project supports the need to increase representation of women in the energy sector, starting in Morocco. When companies purchase renewable energy, they will be contributing to women’s empowerment at the same time.

Rabat – The minister of Islamic affairs, Ahmed Taoufiq, flew to Mecca on Sunday to discuss the preparation for the next hajj season with the Saudi minister of pilgrimage, Mohamed Saleh Bin Taher Benten. During the meeting, the two officials agreed on the preparations required for the next pilgrimage season for Moroccans, according to a statement from the Saudi Ministry of Pilgrimage quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). This meeting is part of consultations with the heads of delegations to prepare the next season of pilgrimage, to provide the best services to pilgrims, and to allow them to perform their rituals in the best conditions, added the press release. The Saudi minister also held meetings with the president of religious affairs of Turkey and the minister of religious affairs of Indonesia, the statement said. In the 2018 pilgrimage season, several Moroccan pilgrims complained about their struggles in Mecca due to lack of management, transport, and shelter. Videos posted online showed Moroccans complaining about the bad conditions. Several Moroccans also said that they had missed major hajj rituals, such as the “stoning of the devil.” Pictures of Moroccan pilgrims also featured elderly men lying weakly on the floor. The Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs, however, denied the allegations in a statement. The ministry said that “some allegations reported by some media outlets” were “lies dating back to previous years,” claiming that information about pilgrims losing their way in Mecca was also false. The ministry also described the 2018 hajj season as “positive.”

Rabat – The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) started a three-day workshop on food security assessment Monday in the context of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. The workshop is in line with “the 2018-2019 sub-regional roadmap for the follow-up and support to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Objectives (SDGs) in North Africa adopted in March 2018 at the Sub Regional Coordination Meeting for North Africa,” CEA said in a statement. FAO Representative in Morocco Florence Marie Rolle said, “SDGs have become the main reference for national development policies and programmes, however, their follow up and implementation still require huge efforts.” The three-day workshop, according to Rolle, aims “to respond to the government’s request for technical support, especially regarding the production of sufficient and reliable data to measure food security indicators.” Experts from the FAO statistics division are carrying out the training which focuses on the prevalence of malnutrition and moderate or severe insecurity, measured by the experience-based food insecurity scale (FIES) indicator. Assessing people’s access to adequate food, the FIES indicator can be integrated with various types of population surveys, according to the CEA statement. The FIES “provides an opportunity to strengthen the links between agriculture, social protection, health and nutrition, therefore contributing to a better understanding of the causes and consequences of food insecurity.” North Africa is experiencing a number of food security related challenges due to climate change, said Marieme Bekaye, the economist in charge of environment and sustainable development at the ECA Office for North Africa. To overcome these challenges, the economist explained, North African countries need “general and multisectoral approaches” and adequate policies to help them “strengthen the resilience and sustainability of their food production systems.” “This objective can only be achieved by improving the availability of national statistical data, which is key for efficient policy monitoring, policy orientations and the distribution of resources,” she added. The two organizations have offered training to representatives from many Moroccan ministries including foreign affairs, agriculture, health, and governance.  Beneficiaries also include organizations and institutions based in Morocco such as the Arab Maghreb Union, the High Commission for Planning, and the High Commission for Water and Forests and the Fight against Desertification.

In 2017, the Moroccan Electronic Interbanking Center said that retail websites affiliated to the center registered MAD 2 billion in income in the first nine months of 2017. The number represented an increase of 51 percent from 2016.  The revenue came from 4.8 million online payment transactions via Moroccan and foreign credit cards, marking an increase of 86.2 percent. Billing websites were the largest contributors, according to the CMI statistics. Airline websites came second with a share of 22.8 percent.  E-commerce in Morocco is developing and is still linked to the evolution of the digital economy. Morocco introduced the 2020 Morocco Digital Plan, which aims to accelerate digital transformation and promote e-commerce.   The North African country also seeks to strengthen its digital exports and  become a regional digital hub. In November, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani  said that Morocco wants to promote the best international practices in the business world, such as “simplification and digitization of administrative procedures, the modernization of the company’s legal and legislative frameworks, the universalization of the single portal as well as the improvement of benefits in their favor.”

Rabat –Following Palestinian authorities’ failure to pay civil servants, Qatar stepped up in the name of “Arab and Muslim fraternity.” But the Gulf nation’s financial activism has met reluctance in some Palestinian leadership circles. Qatar, which is increasingly establishing itself as an international donor, recently pledged a $90 million salary assistance package to mitigate the dire economic conditions of Palestinian civil servants.  In early November, Doha delivered $15 million in the first disbursement of the promised salary package, Reuters reported. “Long live Qatar! Long Live Palestine,” the newspaper quoted some enthusiastic Palestinian youth as shouting while Mohammed Al-Emadi, the coordinator of Qatar’s Gaza-related diplomatic and financial actions, delivered the package.  The Qatari funds reportedly helped ease the dire socio-economic conditions and the financial meltdown which Israel’s blockade has inflicted on the Gaza strip. According to Qatari sources, the salary disbursement went to 27,000 civil servants out of the 40,000 Hamas has hired since 2007. But, Reuters added, Qatar’s intervention created some unhappy quarters in Gaza. A group of young Gazans stoned Mohammed Al-Emadi’s bodyguard’s car, while others complained that Doha’s intervention is happening under Israeli monitoring.  On Tuesday, the Jerusalem Post reported that the circles of unhappy Palestinians, backed by Hamas’ rival Palestinian authority, have called for Qatar’s Gaza representative to be sent out of the territory.  According to anti-Qatar protesters, the Gulf nation’s financial activism in the Gaza strip aims to create a “separate Palestinian political entity.” But the harsh criticism targeting Doha is not just about the Qatari salary disbursements to Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Qatar is also aiming to build an international airport in Gaza, in defiance of the Israeli blockade. While many Palestinians and Palestine-supporting voices around the world welcomed the move, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), widely considered a staunch political adversary to Hamas, has discredited Qatar’s benevolent intentions. In PLO-loyal Palestinian circles, Doha is a divisive force rather than a “savior” or supporter of the Palestinian cause. They accuse Qatar of using its financial assets to further its own agenda in impoverished Palestinian territories. Mahmoud Al-Zaq, a senior representative of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, a PLO-affiliated group, said: “The Qatari funds have prolonged the life of the Palestinian split [between the West Bank and Gaza Strip] and seek to turn it into separation.” But Qatar’s Gaza-oriented diplomatic activism is hardly a one-off, given Doha’s increasing reputation as the donor of Muslim countries in need of financial help. Earlier this year, while Turkey’s economy was on the brink of financial collapse due to American economic sanctions, Qatar pledged $15 million to assuage the consequences of Washington’s sanctions. Back then, too, Qatar’s move was seen by some observers as a pay-back move in recognition of Turkey’s stance during the latest Gulf crisis, rather than a generous action to help a “brotherly Muslim” country. While recognizing that Ankara-Doha strategic rapprochement did play a part in Qatar’s decision to salvage a crumbling Turkish economy, both Ankara and Doha declared that “Muslim solidarity” played an equally crucial role in Qatar’s decision to step up for Turkey. “We stand by our brothers in Turkey that have stood with the issues of the Muslim World and with Qatar,” Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim tweeted. Meanwhile, Qatar has not responded to the accusations facing its actions in Gaza.

Rabat – The Russian ambassador to Morocco, Valerian Shuvaev, has told Sputnik News that Russia “maintains friendly relations with the parties to the Western Sahara conflict.” The diplomat added that the conflict should be resolved under the auspices of the UN, “especially since there is a Council authorized to resolve these issues.” Shuvaev said that Russia’s expertise was to “provide practical formulas.”  However, “because there are many parties involved in the conflict, certainly someone will consider it a kind of pressure, and this is something we want to avoid.” “We maintain normal relations with all parties to the conflict; we keep contacts with the Polisario Front, and with Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania.” He said Russia is ready to recognize any decision agreed on by the parties. Moroccan observers and analysts consider Russia one of the main supporters of Algeria and its ally the Polisario Front. Despite the rapprochement between Morocco and Russia in recent years, Algeria has stronger relations with Russia because they share technical military cooperation. Russia remains the primary military supplier of Algeria. Russia also supports a “referendum in Western Sahara.” In July, Russian Ambassador to Algeria Igor Belyaev was quoted by MEMO as saying, “Moscow is keen to take the position in favour of the implementation of the United Nations resolutions. Russia supports what the United Nations delegates are doing to organise the referendum in Western Sahara. It also supports the efforts of UN Secretary-General Envoy, Horst Kohler, to re-launch dialogue between Morocco and the Polisario.” Russia also opposes Morocco’s position that Algeria should take responsibility as a main party and not as an observer to the conflict as it has been claiming for years. The Russian foreign affairs ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said that Algeria should shun Western Sahara peace talks as an “observer country.” Russia also supports Algeria’s traditional position that Morocco and the Porsario are the only parties that should negotiate. Traditionally wary of the UN-led political process, Russia also blocked an initial draft of the  UN Security resolution on the extension of MINURSO in April of this year. Russia aimed to make the resolution friendlier to Algeria. After the resolution was adopted, Russia’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Vladimir Safronkov, said that the text of the resolution was “unbalanced.” He added that the US-drafted resolution was slightly one-sided and that “a number of suggestions by other Security Council members remained unanswered.” Russia, however, was unable to do the same with the recently adopted Resolution 2440. The resolution named Algeria, calling on the country to work constructively along with the other parties to ensure a successful result in the UN-led process.

Rabat – As UN members adopted the Global Migration Compact in Marrakech on Monday, Gallup released a new Potential Net Migration Index (PNMI) investigating what it would be like if everyone were free to move to whichever country they wanted, permanently. Gallup, an American public opinion poll company, interviewed nearly 500,000 adults in 152 countries between 2015 and 2017.  Although the new index did not predict “migration patterns,” it did give an idea of potential net gains or losses, what sort of people each listed country attracts, and how much a country’s population would change in case of free migration. The index did not report “Potential Net Brain Gain … for countries with a sample size of less than 200.” Gallup had access to a sample of fewer than 200 people in Morocco. In the case of other Maghreb countries besides Morocco, Algeria would lose 31 of its adult population, 44 percent of its youth aged 15-29, and 40 percent of its “brains.”  Tunisia would lose up to 27 percent of its adult population, 30 percent of its youth, and 44 percent of its brains. Mauritania would lose 25 percent of its adult population and 33 percent of its youth. Apart from Libya, Morocco had low numbers regionally. Morocco would lose 19 percent of its adult population and 29 percent of its youth population. Libya would lose 16 percent of its adult population, 19 percent of its young people, and 25 percent of its brains. The top 10 desired countries by potential migrants worldwide are the US, Canada, Germany, France, Australia, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Japan, and Italy. The other desired countries are Switzerland, the UAE, Singapore, Sweden, China, New Zealand, Russia, the Netherlands, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey. The US population would boom if migration were free. A total of 158 million adults would move to the country. Canada’s and Australia’s populations would more than double. According to an April study by ReKrute, 91 percent of Moroccan professionals aged 35 and younger said they wanted to move abroad in search of better work conditions and quality of life, which includes health care and comfort.  Young, well-trained Moroccans set their sights on European countries.  Canada, which attracts 37 percent of Moroccan professionals, is the hottest destination, not only for Moroccans but for many people in the world, according to the report. Moroccan physicians and doctors, in particular, experience tough working conditions. They are underpaid and under-equipped, which prompts them to emigrate. According to a survey by Moroccan marketing agency Sunergia and news outlet L’economiste released in November, some 59 percent of youth aged 15-24 said they would not hesitate to migrate irregularly. Many Moroccan migrants are persistent in trying to leave the country, mostly risking the western Mediterranean route by boat. At the same time, the government strives to curb irregular migration by land and sea toward Europe. Amid the EU migration crisis, over 160 countries approved the Global Compact on Migration (CGM) Monday in Marrakech.  Describing the Global Compact, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that it is a “roadmap to prevent suffering and chaos” experienced by migrants. The compact aims “to better manage international migration, address its challenges, and strengthen migrants’ rights while contributing to sustainable development.”

by Zakaria wadghiri Rabat – A man who attacked Strasbourg’s Christmas market is on the run after he opened fire and “spread terror” Tuesday evening, in the words of French interior minister Christophe Castaner.

On Wednesday, police made an initial announcement that three people were dead and 13 injured after the attack. However, the toll was later revised to two dead and 14 injured, nine of them seriously.

The Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office has opened an investigation into “murders, attempted murders involving a terrorist enterprise and terrorist criminal conspiracy,” Castaner said.

Castaner identified the shooter, who was already known to law enforcement. The prefecture of Bas-Rhin indicated that the suspect was registered as “S,” short for “State security.”  According to the Guardian, French police had already tried to arrest the suspect earlier Tuesday for armed robbery. 

Anonymous police officials told the AP news agency Wednesday that the man was identified as 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt.

German police said the suspect was in prison in Germany in 2016 and 2017 for theft and then deported to France.

The French intelligence services knew the suspect, who was born in Strasbourg in February 1989, as a potential security risk.

The French interior minister said, “The government has decided to move the security level to the emergency attack level with stricter border controls and increased controls at all Christmas markets in France to avoid the risk of copycat attacks.”

The French military spokesman, Colonel Patrik Steiger, said that the shooter did not seem to be targeting soldiers patrolling in and around the market, but rather civilians.

Soldiers guarding the Christmas market shot the suspect. Not fatally wounded, he escaped in a taxi, said BFM TV.

No one immediately claimed responsibility, but the US-based Site Intelligence Group, which monitors radical websites, said that ISIS supporters were celebrating.

In recent years, several extremist attacks have hit France, including coordinated attacks on several Paris sites that killed 130 people and injured hundreds in November 2015, and a truck attack in Nice in 2016 that killed 86 people and injured hundreds.

Rabat – Haiti’s Foreign affairs minister Bocchit Edmond reaffirmed his country’s support for Morocco’s autonomy plan in a meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Tuesday. The minister also reiterated support for Morocco’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty on Western Sahara. A joint statement issued after the meeting said, “The Haitian Minister has reaffirmed the respect of the Republic of Haiti for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and its sovereignty over the Moroccan Sahara.” Edmond also commended Morocco’s autonomy plan “to reach a solution to this dispute,” indicating that it “constitutes a guarantee for stability in the region,” the statement added. The joint statement added that the meeting between the two officials is in line with the continuing political dialogue between Morocco and Haiti. The meeting, according to the statement, reflects “a common desire to give a new impetus to the relations of cooperation between the two countries in several areas of common interest.” According to Bourita, both officials agreed on the importance of encouraging and promoting the culture and heritage of both countries, as well as building the bridges of cultural partnership. “The two sides have agreed to further strengthen the bilateral relations, described as excellent, mainly through the promotion of the bonds of friendship, brotherhood, and cooperation between the governments and peoples of the two countries,” said the statement. Edmond is leading a large delegation on an official visit to Morocco. Having arrived in Marrakech to participate in the intergovernmental conference for migration, Lebanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Gebran Bassil also reaffirmed his country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity.

Rabat – From December 3 to 9, 27 people died and 2,023 others sustained injuries in 1,500 urban traffic accidents. In a statement, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said the accidents were mainly due to loss of control of vehicles, failing to yield, excessive speeding, and pedestrian and driver errors. Other causes were drivers ignoring “STOP” signs and traffic lights, driving in a forbidden direction, and driving under the influence of alcohol. Of the many injured by vehicular accidents last week, the DGSN noted that 68 suffered severe injuries. The statement added that police detained 4,673 vehicles and withdrew 5,399 car registration documents. Police issued 31,305 tickets, transmitted 10,176 records to the Department of Public Prosecution, and recorded 21,129 fines. The sum of fines road traffic violators had to pay was MAD 4,611,525.

Rabat – Morocco’s flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) received its first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on Tuesday. The new airplane will offer more passenger seats and help the company grow its international business. The national carrier ordered four 787-9 Dreamliners from Boeing in the last two years, valued at $1.1 billion. The order included two Dreamliners purchased in December 2016 and two purchased in December 2017. The Boeing 787-9 is “a second member of the super-efficient Dreamliner family” introduced to RAM, Boeing announced in a statement Tuesday. Royal Air Maroc’s CEO and Chairman Abdelhamid Addou said, “We are particularly pleased to receive today our airline’s first 787-9, which will soon be joined by three other models from the same family.” “The choice of this airplane forms part of our strategy to continuously expand and modernize our fleet,” Addou added. The delivery of the new airplane comes a week after RAM announced it would join the oneworld global airline alliance in mid-2020. By joining oneworld global alliance, RAM will be the alliance’s first African full member and first recruit globally since 2012. “This will further strengthen our country’s and Royal Air Maroc’s leadership position on the continent,” said Addou. The larger and longer-range 787-9 will enable RAM to board 30 extra passengers for a maximum capacity of 302 seats and fly up to 14,140 kilometers farther before refueling.  The Moroccan state-owned airline plans to deploy the new 787-9 on flights from Casablanca to Paris, New York, and Sao Paulo, in Brazil. “In 2015, the airline was the first in the Mediterranean to fly the 787-8, the initial Dreamliner that offered 20 percent less fuel and fewer emissions,” said Boeing. With the introduction of the 787-8, Royal Air Maroc opened a new non-stop route from Casablanca to Washington, D.C, and has plans to serve Miami starting in 2019. The Moroccan flag carrier will also receive its first 737 MAX later this month to join a fleet of more than 60 Boeing airplanes. The 737 MAX is “the latest and more efficient version of the 737 airplane.” Boeing is a joint venture partner with Morocco Aero-Technical Interconnect Systems (MATIS Aerospace) in Casablanca, which builds wire bundles and wire harnesses for Boeing and other aerospace companies.

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign affairs minister has reaffirmed Rabat’s commitment to its continental and global leadership on migration issues. Earlier this week, over 160 governments met in Marrakech to adopt the UN-led pact on “safe, orderly, and regular” migration.  Despite the enthusiasm and overwhelming support the document has garnered in the international community, opposing voices, spearheaded by the US government, gave the compact a cold shoulder.  They withdrew from signing the document, believing the pact encourages illegal migration. They argued that the pact legitimizes irregular migration and blurs the lines between migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Speaking to Morocco World News on the sidelines of the Marrakech event, however, Nasser Bourita, who led the Moroccan delegation, lambasted, albeit diplomatically, the heavy criticism that the pact has received from various quarters. For the Moroccan minister, the pact goes beyond the symbolism that both its supporters and detractors have ascribed to it. In addition to symbolizing the will most governments have to commit to a common frame governing intercontinental human mobility, the pact came as a further vindication of the principle that international issues call for collective efforts. Morocco is a migration champion “Morocco is comfortable with this compact because it had already anticipated it,” Bourita said, hinting at the large regularization campaign that Morocco launched in 2013 under the auspices of King Mohammed VI. Since the 2013 royal call to regularize sub-Saharan migrants willing to make a home in Morocco, over 60,000 undocumented migrants have so far been granted Moroccan residency cards. Morocco’s migration policy is founded on three pillars, Bourita argued. “One pillar is solidarity [humanism], which allowed the regularization of sub-Saharan migrants who were in an irregular situation. The second pillar is that of responsibility and firm action in regards to human trafficking networks and networks of clandestine migration. The third is cooperation on the bilateral, continental, and national levels.” Morocco’s migration policy, Bourita explained, is engrained in “an African strategy on migration and development.” With King Mohammed VI having been appointed to lead the coordinated African migratory policy, Morocco wants to remain faithful to its position as a continental and global champion on migration, he said. “Morocco played an active role in the writing of the compact. Its ideas, its philosophy; Morocco’s logic is already integrated into the compact. It’s not a legal document that we have to translate into our legal texts.” ‘Morocco is no one’s policeman’ But Bourita did not only have praise for the transformative potential of the Marrakech migration compact.  He firmly rebutted accusations against Morocco’s recently-launched tough campaign against irregular migration, saying that despite its openness to migrants, Morocco cannot let human trafficking networks establish a safe haven on its territory. However pan-African and globalist in its dealings with migrants and their rights to decent living conditions, Morocco’s sovereignty is non-negotiable.  “A migration policy should not mean leniency, it should not mean leaving the borders open or accepting that clandestine migration establishes itself. Morocco launched in 2014 and 2016 a process of regularization.  “It said to everyone found within its borders that you have the possibility to have papers, to integrate, to have means of work, access to education and to health…. Those who didn’t want to stay in Morocco, why are they here? They are here to use the Moroccan territory to go elsewhere in an illegal, irregular manner.” Bourita elaborated that Morocco had to assume its responsibility by “taking measures to fight against these networks, to repatriate those who are in Morocco without the desire to integrate, those that chose to be in Morocco and use the kingdom as a platform to go elsewhere.” But what about the claims that Morocco’s sudden toughening towards sub-Saharan migrants, which included repatriation and “forced displacements,” came as a result of European pressure? Did Rabat bend to Brussels’ security desires to salvage the numerous deals that bind the two partners? “Our relationship with the EU is a global one. It’s not based on one issue. We are neighbors. Morocco is the closest African country to Europe. It’s a relation of geography; it’s a relation of history. For 50 years we are engaged in agreements with the EU. We have 4 million Moroccans living in Europe. We have security cooperation. We have economic cooperation,” Bourita said. For all the strategic and historical significance of the Morocco-EU partnership, however, Rabat does not, and will not, bend to external diktats, the minister firmly explained. Morocco, according to Bourita, takes enormous pride in its sovereignty and will not exchange it for safeguarding strategic partnerships. “What we are doing, we are not doing it for Europe. We are doing it as a responsible country that cannot allow that its territory be used by anyone for illegal migration or human trafficking…. “Morocco does not do this as someone’s policeman. It does it because it is a responsible country and a country that controls the flows that enter and leave its territory. And it will continue to do this with a global approach.”

By Trista Youssef Rabat – Time magazine has honored Jamal Khashoggi and other endangered journalists reporting on the Philippines and Myanmar for defending truth in a decade when independent journalism is under attack. Time’s editor in chief, Edward Felsenthal, wrote on the work of endangered journalists, “They are representative of a broader fight by countless others around the world—as of December 10, at least 52 journalists have been murdered in 2018—who risk all to tell the story of our time.” A Myanmar court sentenced two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, to 7 years in prison for reporting on the state military’s human rights abuses toward Rohingya Muslims.  The Philippine government targeted Philippine journalist Maria Ressa for her website’s critique of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. The government sued Ressa for tax evasion in an apparently politically motivated attempt to shut down her publication.  The staff of US publication Capital Gazette were also among the “guardians” Times honored, because the staff suffered a shooting that left five dead in June. Time chose the journalists as Person of the Year “for taking great risks in pursuit of greater truths, for the imperfect but essential quest for facts that are central to civil discourse, for speaking up and speaking out.” Jamal Khashoggi, whose death is widely speculated to have been ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has brought international attention to Saudi Arabia’s poor human rights record.  Khashoggi’s death has also reshaped global alliances with the Saudi kingdom as politicians around the world are hesitant to maintain close relations with MBS.  Ironically, Time magazine named Mohammed bin Salman one of its “Most Influential People of 2018.” In an article for Time magazine, a Saudi Arabian women’s rights activist, Manal al-Sharif, praised MBS for lifting restrictions on women, challenging “the culture of corruption, and reining in religious police who choked us, literally and figuratively.”

Rabnat – King Mohammed VI said he learned with great emotion the sad news of the death of Moroccan singer Hamid Zahir, in a letter addressed to the artist’s family, on Tuesday. The monarch expressed his heartfelt condolences and sincere feelings of compassion to the family members of the deceased, friends and admirers. The King described Zahir as “one of the pioneers of the Moroccan folk song” who contributed during several decades to the enrichment of Morocco’s artistic repertoire with high quality songs and masterpieces. Zahir died Monday in Marrakech, his birthplace. The prominent Moroccan singer had suffered a stroke and battled with renal insufficiency, spending 10 days in the intensive care unit. The singer and lyricist was born to a Syrian mother and a father from El Kelaa des Sraghna in central Morocco and discovered his passion for music at a young age. His songs “Lalla Fatima” and “Lalla Souad” are some of the best-known classical Moroccan songs. Between 1947 and 1951, Zahir began performing in Marrakech’s famous square, Jemaa El Fna, where multiple forms of art flourish, from the long-lasting storytelling genre known as “Al Halqa,” to  dancing and magic performances.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI granted UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres an audience at the Royal Palace of Rabat on Tuesday afternoon, according to a Royal Cabinet statement. Speaking to the King, Guterres expressed his gratitude for Morocco’s successful holding of the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Over 160 countries adopted the Global Compact on Migration (CGM) on Monday, the first day of the migration conference in Marrakech. The migration pact aims “to better manage  international migration, address its challenges, and strengthen migrants’ rights while contributing to sustainable development.” Prominent world leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and Canadian immigration minister Ahmed Hussen, joined the two-day conference in Marrakech. “Guterres noted Morocco’s human rights achievements and its constructive role in terms of south-south cooperation and the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and climate change,” reads the Royal Cabinet statement. The UNSG also lauded the kingdom’s generous and unwavering commitment to peacekeeping operations, especially the contingents of the royal armed forces deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. Foreign minister Nasser Bourita said last month that Morocco had provided more than 60,000 soldiers to peacekeeping operations in 17 operations around the world since the creation of the UN.  Discussing the Western Sahara issue in light of the Geneva roundtable held on December 5-6, the King reiterated Morocco’s support for the UN Secretary-General and his personal envoy’s efforts’to reach a mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.

Washington D.C – As the foreign ministers of Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, and representatives of the Polisario secessionist movement met in the comfort of the Swiss city Geneva, thousands of displaced Sahrawi men, women and children continue to linger in brutal conditions. Forty-three years into this endless conflict, they remain stateless with several generations born and raised without a home. Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel’s account describing the first UN-led talks in six years as “full of laughs” captures the careless attitudes of some parties to this turbulent UN mission. This gathering looked more like a vacation and less than a marathon meeting to resolve decade old and established hurdles that Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario deadlocked over for years. In fact, Algeria, that has the key to ending the confrontation by the virtue of its total control over the Polisario Front’s positons in the negotiations, is in no mood for a resolution because it will have far less leverage against Morocco in other territorial disputes namely the final status of the Eastern Sahara. The unresolved issues surrounding the efforts of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to end the conflict have remained the same since the collapse of the Baker I plan in 2001. The main disagreement revolves around what constitutes the right of self-determination. For the Polisario and its overseers in Algiers, self-determination can only be achieved through independence, while Morocco considers an autonomous Western Sahara under its sovereignty as a form self-determination. Since the Geneva talks did not bring new ideas to address the core disagreements, they are less likely to produce a breakthrough. Morocco and the Polisario met and failed to agree before during the Manhasset negotiations in Manhasset, New York in 2007 and Algeria remains as an observer in the conflict in the eyes of the United Nations Security Council. While some expert concluded that the Geneva round table ended on an optimistic note, the civilians suffering in tents do not see any positive in waiting for many more years before they can return to their homes. Most Sahrawis currently trapped in Tindouf were born in the camps, never having known their homeland. Their demands to go back home to the Sahara, a region mired in decades of political deadlock, should be on the top of the UN agenda. Unfortunately, the Algeria-Morocco rivalry continues to overshadow the humanitarian disaster in the Camps. The thousands of Sahrawis who followed the Polisario front to the Algerian desert in 1975 remain dependent on international humanitarian aid with little hope for self-sufficiency. They thought it would be only a temporary refuge before their eventual return and never imagined they would turn into a bargaining chip in the longest-running conflicts in Africa. The Sahrawis of Tindouf should be given the opportunity to return home regardless of the status of the U.N. talks on the future of the Western Sahara. Algeria and the Polisario promised them to return home in few months. Now, the UN is committing them to a state of permanent displacement and condemned to a life of waiting in the most inhospitable environment. At the end of the day, no one in Geneva was representing the Sahrawis of Tindouf. The Moroccans, including those of Sahrawi origins, went back to the “luxury” of the Moroccan Sahara, the Algerians played nice with Horst Kohler by attending the meeting but in fact went back at pretending to be just observers, and the Polisario leaders are just enjoying the contentment of traveling as VIP’ away from the misery of the Camps.

Rabat – Members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets voted in favor of  the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement on Monday evening. The vote comes a few days after the European Union Council adopted the agreement which Morocco and the EU signed on July 24 in Rabat. On Monday, the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade (INTA) adopted, by an overwhelming majority, the Moroccan-EU agriculture agreement. A final vote in a plenary session in January will follow the adoption of both the agriculture and fisheries agreements. The fisheries deal must pass through the EU Parliament and receive ratification by all 28 EU member states before entering into effect. Several members supported the renewal of the partnership, including Spain. On November 13, Spanish Minister of Agriculture Luis Planas called for a “rapid ratification” of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement at the European Parliament.

Rabat – The secretary of state for higher education, Khalid Samadi, has said that people who have degrees from vocational training schools are most likely to find jobs. Like King Mohammed VI, the head of government, and other officials, Samadi emphasized the importance of vocational training during a meeting at the House of Representatives on Monday. Samadi said that a field study by the Ministry of Education found that 63 percent of students with vocational training degrees find a job within nine months of graduation. The official said that the study, which sampled 20,000 students enrolled in vocational training, showed that after three years, the rate of professional integration is more than 80 percent. Samadi said that a new strategy was developed in the field of vocational training, in accordance with King Mohammed VI’s instructions during his August 20 speech on the Day of the Revolution of the King and the People. The official said that the strategy aims to set up a new offer adapted to the changes that Morocco is experiencing in terms of direct investment abroad, particularly in renewable energies, the automotive industry and many other opportunities offered in the labor market. During a working session in October, King Mohammed VI ordered the government to create a committee to elaborate specific solutions to curb youth unemployment. The King instructed that the committee should find solutions to youth unemployment. He also called for new vocational training programs, new training centers, and to reinforce youth entrepreneurship programs. The unemployment rate remains relatively high among youth aged 15-24 (27.5 percent). The rate among women and those with degrees is 13.8 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively. The unemployment rate of those with a vocational training certificate is 23.9 percent: 36.5 percent for women and 19.3 percent for men, according to Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP). A survey from the Moroccan marketing agency Sunergia found that 4 out of 10 Moroccans would emigrate if they could due to the high unemployment rate or difficulty finding jobs and difficult social and economic situations.

Rabat – Spanish oil company Cepsa and Derhem Holding will create a joint venture in Morocco with the goal of having a network of 100 fuel stations over the next five years. Cepsa set the ambitious goal of taking over 15 percent of the Moroccan fuel station market in the near future, Spanish business outlet El Economista reported December 7. Two months ago, Cepsa expressed its interest in expanding its presence in northern Morocco, a “preferred market for expansion due to its proximity to our refineries on the south coast of Spain.” “In July 2018, we established a 50/50 joint venture with a local partner to commence the development of our business in Morocco, with the objective of opening 30 points of sale by 2020, 100 points of sale by 2023 and a 15% market share in the medium-term (by number of service stations),” the Spanish oil company said in a statement on October 2.  CEPSA aims to focus on retail, business to business sales, and storage. Taking advantage of its proximity to Morocco, Cepsa can now grow its business by exporting more fuel from its refineries in southern Spain. The Derhem Holding group has been a major fuel distributor in Morocco’s oil industry for 40 years, especially in Morocco’s southern provinces, via its subsidiary Atlas Sahara. Petrosud is currently CEPSA’s only presence in Morocco. Cepsa holds a 35 percent stake in Petrosud, “which is focused on the marketing of marine oil at the port of Agadir.” It will be the first time the company has distribution business outside of Europe. Cepsa’s investment in Morocco will help the company achieve its goal of increasing its number of service stations to 1,940 stations in Europe, the Canary Islands, and Morocco.

Rabat – Yellow vest protesters were not convinced of Emmanuel Macron’s sincerity. The president gave a speech yesterday and plans to add more reforms to ease the tensions that have gripped France for the past month.  Macron promised tax cuts on overtime work, encouraged businesses to give end of year bonuses to employees, and promised to raise the minimum wage by €100 in 2019.  Since the protests began, the government has struggled to respond to public anger and maintain order. Initially, Macron and other officials denounced the protesters.  During his Arc de Triomphe speech, Macron promised violent protesters would “face justice,” and interior minister Christophe Castaner labeled the protesters as “thugs” in a tweet.  But it seems the French government has not been watching the same protests as the people have. An Elabe poll released last week found 72 percent of the French public supported the yellow vest protesters.  The effect of this widespread support was felt in Macron’s speech yesterday, when he admitted the protests were “partly my fault,” and gave credit to his many critics. The yellow vests, however, are not buying his promises. This morning during a gathering of protesters in the city of Le Boulou, they offered their analysis of the speech to the Local.  One 55-year old man said the speech “almost seems like a provocation.” Another exclaimed, “Maybe if Macron had made this speech three weeks ago, it would have calmed the movement, but now it’s too late.”  Most yellow vests vow to continue moving into their fourth week of protests, but, some French protesters are looking to see an end to the carnage. A survey after Macron’s speech yesterday showed 54 percent of the public would like the protests to end soon. In addition, Jacline Mouraud, the woman credited as being the founder of the yellow vest movement, said in an interview on French television, “The door is now open … we can’t spend the rest of our lives hanging out on roundabouts.”  But dedicated protesters are not wavering. As the protests threaten to persevere into the Christmas season in France, one protester leveled more criticism at Macron, saying this year, “Santa Claus has nothing in his sack.”

Rabat – A video of a Danish photographer climbing the Great Pyramid of Giza with a girl who took her top off to reveal her lingerie has stirred controversy among Egyptians who considered the incident insulting to the historical landmark. 
The photographer also posted a “sexual” photo of himself and the girl in a move that provoked Egyptian authorities. Many people took to social media to express their rage, deeming the stunt “immoral” and “insulting.” Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities said on Saturday, December 8, that the actions of Andreas Hvid and his unknown companion were a “violation of public morality.” Egyptian authorities are investigating whether the video was faked after officials suggested that it could be. The three-minute video was allegedly taken at night as the pair waited for the crowd to disperse from the area. Hvid wrote in the description of the video uploaded on YouTube on December 8: “In late November 2018, a friend and I climbed the Great Pyramid of Giza (a.k.a. Pyramid of Khufu, Pyramid of Cheops).” Hvid told the Danish tabloid news outlet, Ekstrabladet, that climbing the 450-foot pyramid took about 25 minutes.  Scaling the pyramids is forbidden in order to preserve the landmark, one of the seven wonders of the world. The Danish pair were not the first to climb the pyramid.  In 2015, 18-year-old German tourists broke Egypt’s law and climbed the Great Pyramid, which earned them a life-long ban from entering Egypt.

By Zakaria Wadghiri Rabat – The French government plans “to fully integrate the Muslim religion to the 1905 law,” French Minister of the Interior Christophe Castaner told the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) on December 9. French Prime Minister Aristide Briand introduced the Law on the Separation of Church and State in 1905. The law instituted and defined France’s secularity. It guaranteed freedom of worship in the spirit of the French Revolution of 1789. The law then applied to Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. It prohibits public funding of religion and holding political meetings in places of worship. Castaner announced that the government was planning to amend the 1905 law. He said that the amendments are not about “undermining the principles of the separation law” or “calling into question the secular system it defines” but of “strengthening it in the world of 2018.” He said, “The Islam of France should be freed from control and power struggles.” Secretary of State Laurent Nunez has been pushing for the 1905 law to apply to Islam. Leaked government documents detail the main points that the government will amend, reported Liberation. The government later said the leaks were “simply working documents.” The planned amendments would increase supervision over financial resources coming from abroad.  Six months before the next elections of the CFCM in July 2019, Muslim leaders voiced their unity against internal divisions, their independence from the state, and their citizenship, on Sunday at the Arab World Institute (IMA) in Paris, said Le Figaro. The head of the Grand Mosque of Paris, Dalil Boubakeur, said, “We cannot be forced to change” in his speech at the IMA. “The 1905 law would limit mosque activity to worship. Islam is a religion, a culture, a human reality, and a remarkable civilization,” stressed Boubakeur. Yesterday morning in Albi, France, dozens of people gathered to protest the proposed amendments, in particular bringing all places of worship under the 1905 law. The people responded to the call of La Libre Pensee, an association that campaigns for freedom of thought. In his speech to the Bishops’ Conference of France  April 9, French President Emmanuel Macron called for “repairing the link between Church and State,” angering the leftist opposition who accused him of attacking secularism. “An unprecedented and dangerous affront to the 1905 law,” Generation.s’ founder Benoit Hamon called it.

Rabat – Two Moroccan nationals died on Sunday when a residential building caught fire in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy. A source from the Moroccan Consulate-General in Bologna told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), that the victims were a married Moroccan couple residing in Italy with their two children. Their surviving children, aged 14 and 16, suffered severe injuries in the fire. The source explained that the fire broke out because two homeless men lit a fire for warmth in the building’s basement. The full circumstances of the tragedy are still under investigation by the Public Prosecution of Reggio Emilia. The Moroccan Consulate-General in Bologna is taking charge of returning the two victims’ bodies to Morocco as soon as possible.

Rabat – Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister and UN diplomat,  commented positively on King Mohammed VI’s dialogue offer in an interview with Jeune Afrique. Brahimi said that he has been saying for “twenty years that there is no reason for the relations between Algeria and Morocco to be in this state.” He recalled the King’s offer of dialogue to Algeria, calling for a joint mechanism of consultations and frank dialogue to restore the bilateral ties between the two countries. “You know, now there has been this initiative of the King. There was also a very warm message from President Bouteflika to the King a few days ago,” said the former Algerian diplomat. King Mohammed VI made his offer to Algeria on November 6. Algeria has not responded to the offer yet, but Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika sent a formal message to King Mohammed VI to congratulate him on Independence Day, November 18. In his message, Bouteflika emphasized his country’s “firm determination” to improve bonds of fraternity and solidarity. Morocco, however, did not consider Bouteflika’s message a direct answer to King Mohammed VI’s message. In the midst of Algeria’s continuous silence, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita summoned the Algerian ambassador in Rabat to ask him for his country’s position on the King’s offer. The meeting did not result in any statement from Algeria. After the meeting, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, saying that the royal initiative “stems from a sincere desire to create a framework for direct and inclusive bilateral dialogue to resolve all disputes between the two countries.” Brahimi acknowledged that his country has not yet answered. “For the moment, there has been no answer from Algiers.”

Rabat – Angry students are hoping today will go down as “Mardi Noir,” or Black Tuesday. The planned protests will add to the damage already occurring. Students are angry at President Macron due to two controversial pieces of legislation he plans to introduce. He plans on changing the current end-of-term exam from broad subject choices to narrower course-specific exams, reports France24. He also wants to introduce stricter entrance requirements to French universities.  Students claim the law will increase inequality between wealthier schools and more economically challenged ones. Following protests throughout the country, one of the leaders of a French student union said students planned on demonstrating “until our demands are met.” The French government has not faced a student-worker protest movement since the May 1968 demonstrations paralyzed the country. The protesters earned the nickname “Children of the Yellow Vests” from observers in the country. In a France 24 interview, a researcher states, “If the student movement has taken hold it is in part thanks to the Yellow Vests.”  Protesters have clogged French roads and vandalized buildings for nearly a month. The protesters, initially outraged at a proposed tax on gasoline, also attacked tax hikes on pensions, the stagnant economy, and several other issues.  Macron has attempted to quell protesters in several ways over the past few weeks. He discredited the protests as unnecessary acts of violence and asked for calm. He also promised to cancel the planned “green tax” in addition to planned tax increases on parts of the working and middle classes. However, he refused to increase taxes on businesses as well, claiming it “would weaken us, we need to create jobs.” French officials estimate that the protests will affect approximately 450 schools, according to the Local. As disgruntled students take to the streets alongside enraged workers, Macron is facing the French government’s worst nightmare.

Rabat – On Monday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and the chairman of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki, signed a headquarters agreement on the African Migration Observatory. Proposed by King Mohammed VI, the African Migration Observatory will be in Rabat. It will have the task of collecting data and developing exchanges as a well as facilitating coordination between African countries on migration issues. Faki told the press that the observatory will be an important tool for analyzing migration and obtaining reliable statistics that are specifically African. He added, “It is time for Africans to manage this (migratory) issue on their own,” according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Faki also expressed Africa’s “strong” commitment to the Global Compact on Migration adopted yesterday. He said that the document includes “important provisions to protect migrants.” Faki also confirmed that migration is now at the heart of the global and African agenda, saying the adoption of the document in Marrakech is the best illustration. Bourita said that the King had proposed the observatory and that  African leaders supported it in July in Nouakchott at the 31st AU summit. The observatory, according to Bourita, is the beginning of the implementation of the Global Compact on Migration, which emphasizes that better knowledge of migration will lead to better management. At the opening of the conference, Bourita recalled King Mohammed VI’s message to the participants. In his message, King Mohammed VI said, “Africa will not be the subject of the Global Compact, but the African continent will be an actor – a key one.” Bourita said the King’s message carries “strong signals in terms of dealing with the migration issue.” He added that migration requires shared responsibility from all affected countries.

Rabat – Spain’s Hemisphere Cable Company (HCC) is planning to build new submarine fiber optic cable infrastructure connecting Europe and Latin America. Named WASACE 1, the new cable will connect Fortaleza in Brazil to the Canary Islands and Seixal in Spain with additional subsidiaries in Cape Verde, Casablanca, and Madeira in Portugal, HCC said in recent statement. “HCC is delighted to invest initially for the WASACE 1 system, opening a new era in the connection between Europe and Latin America. It will do so by offering low-latency communication services by providing a direct route between these continents without going through the US,” said Luis Jara, CEO of HCC. The new broadband telecom infrastructure “is a major milestone within the goal of becoming the main interconnection HUB facing and uniting Africa, Latin America, the Mediterranean region, Europe and the United States,” Jara added. The new system will fill a gap in undersea cable map connectivity, offering a competitive price for submarine traffic distribution systems across the Atlantic ocean. WASACE 1 will also speed up the time of signal transmission and reception by reducing “the RTT (Round Trip Time) between Europe and Latin America by over 60 percent when compared to actual routes through the US.” Once built, WASACE 1 “will be the first system to deploy the next-generation fiber-optictechnology between Europe to Latin America multiplying the capacity of previous outdated systems.” The 29,000-kilometer-long submarine system will provide 8 fiber pairs for a total capacity of 144 terabytes per second, each pair having an upgradeable initial capacity of 18 terabytes per second. The project will be completed within 30 months and is expected to be delivered by mid 2021. The new infrastructure will include a Network Operation Center and a new data center in the Canary Islands from which additional itineraries are planned for West Africa, the Mediterranean, and North America. The Canary Islands-based company will also deploy a second submarine cable, WASACE 2, which will connect the Canary Islands to South Africa. HCC plans to announce the project before mid-2019 to be completed during the second half of 2021.

Rabat – In a note to prosecutors across Morocco, Mohamed Abdennabaoui, the president of the Prosecutor General’s Office, reminded lawyers of articles 447-1, 447-2, and 447-3 of the penal code referenced in Law 103-13 criminalizing all forms of gender-based discrimination, including public harassment, sexual assault, and cybercrimes. According to Article 447-1, “Any person who intentionally [uses] computer systems, captures, records, broadcasts or disseminates someone’s private or confidential information or statements without their prior approval” will receive a prison sentence from six months to three years and a fine ranging from MAD 2,000 to 20,000.  Article 447-2 states that individuals broadcasting or disseminating someone’s statements or pictures without their prior approval or making false allegations or statements aiming to harm someone’s private life or reputation will receive a prison sentence from one to three years and be fined MAD 2,000 to 20,000. If the criminal acts are committed against a close family member—a spouse, a fiancé or a dependent—the culprit will face a five-year prison sentence and pay a fine ranging from MAD 5,000 to 50,000, according to Article 447-3. Repeat offenders, regardless of relationship to the victim, will receive the same penalty of five years and a fine of MAD 5,000 to 50,000. Abdennabaoui stressed that citizens’ complaints of cyber crimes must be taken seriously. He said it is not only women who need protection from discrimination and sexual assault but also men. Cyber criminality is a growing concern for Morocco, judging by the amount of money the country has been investing in the fight against cyber criminality since 2017. The “cybersouth” initiative, a joint project between the European Union and the Council on Cooperation Against Cybercrime, financed under the European Neighborhood Instrument, started on July 1, 2017. According to a 2015 Global Information Society Watch (GISWatch) report, Moroccan Cybercrime Services, working under the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), identified 112 cases of cybercrime in 2011, over 26 of which were crimes against personhood, including sexual harassment.

Rabat – An earthquake struck the northern edge of the Rif mountains overnight, rocking the city of Al Hoceima. The epicenter of the quake was centered in the Sidi Boutmim area and affected a 25-kilometer area, according to news outlets.  Al Hoceima sits near a major tectonic plate boundary separating the African and Eurasian plates, which makes it a vulnerable spot for earthquakes. In 2004, one of the deadliest earthquakes to hit Morocco occurred near Ait Kamra in the Al Hoceima province. The earthquake leveled nearly 2,600 houses and killed approximately 630 people. Last year, earthquakes struck the area twice in one month. A 4.0 earthquake struck the Al Hoceima province at the beginning of November, and a 3.8 quake hit neighboring Driouch province at the end of the month.  There have been no reported deaths or significant damage from yesterday’s earthquake. However, a study conducted by researchers indicated that Al Hoceima might not always be so lucky. The study determined that “a significant percentage of the buildings of Al Hoceima have a high seismic vulnerability,” meaning that the city could potentially be victim to another tragedy like the 2004 earthquake unless people take action to improve buildings.

Rabat – An investigating judge at the Fez Court of Appeals brought a prosecution case on Friday against Abdelali Hamieddine, the regional secretary of the PJD of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region, for being an accomplice in the murder of Mohamed Ait Ljid Benaissa, a leftist student. The case goes back to February 1993 when a group of masked people reportedly beat Benaissa using sharp objects as he was leaving Dar El Mehraz University in Fez. Benaissa was then taken to a private hospital where medical staff found he had suffered a deep fracture in his head causing internal bleeding and death. In July 2017, the Ait Ljid Benaissa family filed a complaint “about facts of the murder.” Hamieddine’s lawyer, Abdessamad Idrissi, also a member of the PJD, immediately condemned the case on his Facebook page, calling it “political” and contrary to “principles of justice as internationally recognized.”  “There some people who seek to destroy confidence in any possibility to have an independent judiciary based on law and conscience,” Idrissi wrote. Moroccan Minister of State for Human Rights Mustapha Ramid found the investigating judge’s decision to prosecute Hamieddine “astonishing.” Hamieddine was previously prosecuted for the case in the 1990s. At the time, the criminal chamber acquitted Hamieddine of the accusation, which had been based on the grounds that he “contributed to a quarrel that led to the killing” of Ait Ljid, Ramid wrote on his Facebook page.  The minister, who is also a leading member of PJD party, referred to “Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which explicitly states that no one may be again subject to trial or punishment for a crime for which he has already been convicted or acquitted in a final judgment in accordance with the law and criminal procedure of each country.” The PJD’s general secretariat held an extraordinary meeting on Monday night condemning the decision to prosecute Hamieddine, the party’s parliamentary councilor. The decision “constitutes a “serious violation of the rules of fair trial … and threatens the stability and sovereignty of judicial decisions and affects judicial security,” the party said in a statement after its Monday meeting. The PJD expressed its absolute solidarity with Hamieddine and announced they will form a committee led by Ramid to follow the case and provide support.

Rabat – The Mohammedia Court of First Instance sentenced seven individuals for selling meat from dogs and diseased cows on Monday afternoon, following their arrest last month.  After the sentence was announced, the courtroom was filled with screams and shouts from the families of the convicted who believed the court’s decision was “unfair.” Late in November, Royal Gendarmerie forces in the region dismantled the ring after they caught three of them drunkenly transporting rotten beef from diseased cattle and dog meat to be sold later. The gendarmes confiscated sharp weapons, meat grinders, and two dying cows found hidden by the accused. On further investigation, police found cow heads in public dustbins and videos of the culprits trying to bribe gendarmerie members to keep silent about their activities. News of the suspects’ acts has shocked and disgusted Moroccans, who expressed anger on social media. While some called on the court to hand down severe penalties to the suspects for threatening people’s health, others condemned the killing of stray dogs.

Rabat – INTA approved the European Union-Moroccan agriculture deal on Monday. A final vote in a plenary session in January will follow the adoption. Several EU commissions have adopted the agriculture partnership between the EU and Morocco, including the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) in November. The votes of the EU committees reflect the positive view of the members of the European Parliament towards the partnership between the EU and Morocco. INTA’s adoption also brushes aside Polisario’s repeated allegations that Morocco exploits the natural resources of Western Sahara. The chairman of the Morocco-EU joint parliamentary committee, Abderrahim Atmoune, said, “The vote adds value to the quality of relations with the European Parliament.” Quoted by Moroccan television channel 2m, Atmoune said the vote also comes to “consolidate the growing strategic importance of Morocco in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the model of democratic, political, and economic development that the kingdom embodies in relation to other countries, particularly in North Africa, and in the Arab world.” Atmoune also emphasized “the common will to continue the Euro-Moroccan dialogue and the importance of finding answers to the challenges and threats facing our regions and acting in solidarity” to promote the cooperative binding between the EU and Morocco. As well as the agriculture agreement, Morocco and the EU have agreed to renew their fisheries deal, which expired on July 14. The fisheries deal must pass through the EU Parliament and receive ratification by all 28 EU member states before entering into effect. Several members supported the renewal of the partnership, including Spain. On November 13, Spanish Minister of Agriculture Luis Planas called for a “rapid ratification” of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement at the European Parliament.

Rabat – At the opening of the intergovernmental conference on migration in Marrakech Monday, the Moroccan foreign affairs minister, Nasser Bourita, spoke about Morocco’s leadership in migration. Speaking to the press at the conference, the official went over King Mohammed VI’s message to the participants. In his message, King Mohammed VI said, “Africa will not be the subject of the Global Compact, but the African continent will be an actor – a key one.”  The monarch also emphasized the importance of sharing responsibility to tackle migration challenges. According to Bourita, the King’s message includes “strong signals in terms of dealing with the migration issue.” He added that the migration phenomenon requires in-depth international cooperation. The minister also expressed satisfaction with the UN choice to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in Marrakech. He said that hosting the major event in Marrakech “shows the confidence of the international community in the organizational capacity of Morocco.”  He added that Morocco is committed to helping several countries under the Marrakech compact to develop their own migration policy. More than 160 countries voted in favor of the compact today. Bourita said that the Marrakech compact will serve as a reference for all countries to establish national policies. He noted that the political document will also constitute a framework for international cooperation.

Rabat – The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has arrested a three-member terror cell for their alleged ties with ISIS. Aged between 21 and 31, the suspects were active in the city of Kenitra, according to a statement from the Ministry of Interior. The preliminary investigation revealed that the suspects were promoting terror propaganda and were planning acts of terrorism to undermine the stability of the country. Investigations found that one of the suspects attempted to join ISIS both in the Syrian-Iraqi conflict zones and in its active factions in West Africa before deciding to commit a terrorist act in Morocco in coordination with the other members of the cell. The same suspect was also in constant contact with one of the extremist members of a terror cell arrested on November 9 in Ait Melloul in southern Morocco. The ministry said that the suspects will be put in custody after investigations. Thanks to its efforts to combat terrorism, Morocco now ranks 132nd out of 166 countries at threat of terrorism in the 2018 Global Terrorism Index. The country is listed among the countries least affected by terrorism, which makes it safer than the US, France, and Algeria. Today’s operation comes after a similar arrest of a six-member terror cell for their alleged ties with ISIS. On Saturday, October 8, BCIJ also busted an international cocaine trafficking ring. Throughout the year, BCIJ has carried out similar operations across the country.

Rabat – The AMU secretary-general, Taieb Baccouche, said that the foreign ministers of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) received invitations to a meeting in Tunis in preparation for the summit, according to La Presse.  The news outlet added that Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Mauritania accepted the AMU’s invitation. All members also expressed their determination to host AMU’s Council of Foreign Ministers. Baccouche said that Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita “affirmed” Morocco’s willingness to “host the work of the 7th summit of the AMU on the 30th anniversary of its creation.” The AMU meeting is in line with King Mohammed VI’s call to ensure better cooperation between Maghreb countries. On the 43rd  anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI called for a joint mechanism of dialogue and consultation with Algeria to break the stalemate between Morocco and Algeria, which hampers the Maghreb unity project. In response, Algeria emphasized the need for an emergency meeting of the council of foreign ministers of the AMU. Morocco’s eastern neighbor, however, did not answer Morocco’s dialogue initiative. Algeria’s lack of response urged Morocco to ask for a direct answer. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Morocco remains “open and optimistic” about the future of relations with Algeria  and that the recent Algerian request for a meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) foreign ministers is “unrelated to the royal initiative.”  The ministry added that Morocco’s offer is “purely bilateral, while the Algerian approach is part of the revival of regional construction.”

Rabat – Following his first official visit to Rabat on November 19, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez attended the migration conference in Marrakech on Monday and discussed the plight of Moroccan seasonal workers in Spain on the sidelines. Saad Eddine El Othmani and Sanchez exchanged their views on the issue of migration, agreeing to work together through investing and launching income-generating projects that would ensure good quality of life for potential migrants in their countries of origin.  The two prime ministers reaffirmed their shared goal to promote regular migration instead of irregular and integrate migrants in each of their host countries, Morocco and Spain. In regard to the situation of Moroccan seasonal workers in Spain, El Othmani urged Sanchez to agree on a fair employment policy that would guarantee the working conditions and dignity of the workers. During the 2018 summer agricultural season in Spain’s Huelva, Moroccan workers complained of sexual harassment and assault, prompting both countries to investigate and stress the need to set terms to ensure better conditions for Moroccan workers. Despite the allegations, Morocco and Spain are preparing for the next seasonal farming campaign in Huelva, in southwestern Spain. During his recent visit, Sanchez announced his country’s intention to strengthen and modernize the border with Morocco to combat irregular migration, signifying the strong Spanish-Moroccan cooperation on security.

Rabat – The president of the National Museum Foundation (FNM), Mehdi Qotbi, and the managing director of the Renault Maroc group, Marc Nassif, signed a donation agreement on Monday in Rabat.  The deal will link Renault to the various museums affiliated with the foundation in Morocco. According to the deal, Renault will donate a specially-equipped van to FNM to transport artwork safely. 
In a statement to the press, Qotbi said he was happy to see FNM partner with the private sector. He added that many companies had already partnered with FNM.

The Renault van will help to reduce the cost of transporting works of art within the kingdom, Qotbi said.

Nassif said it was a “great day” since this agreement seals a partnership that began several months ago. The partnership began when Renault brought children from orphanages in Tangier and Casablanca to visit the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rabat.

Rabat – Morocco has moved up one place to become the second-best performing country in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) for the year 2019, behind Sweden. Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute, and the Climate Action Network published the 2019 CCPI report Monday, December 10. Sweden scored the highest in the annual ranking with 76.28 points, followed by Morocco (70.48) and Lithuania (70.47). The survey showed that the UK, India, Norway, Portugal, and the European Union were also among the top countries and regions with a “high” ranking.  Saudi Arabia, the US, Iran, South Korea, and Taiwan scored very low in the overall climate change index ranking among a list of 56 countries. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the only two countries in the Middle East included in the ranking. In addition to Morocco, the North African countries included in the ranking were Algeria, which ranked 44th and scored low, and Egypt, which ranked 21st and rated medium. Morocco ranks “high” in all CCPI categories, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, renewable energy, energy use, and climate policy. The index, which evaluates and compares the climate protection performance of 56 countries and the EU, stated that Morocco’s renewable energy projects and goals resulted in a high rating in the climate change ranking.  Morocco “has significantly increased the share of renewables over the past five years and has increased new renewable energy capacity,” wrote the survey. The survey noted that with the connection of Noor Solar Project, “the world’s largest solar plant and multiple new wind farms to the grid, the country is well on track for achieving its target of 42% installed renewable energy capacities by 2020 and 52% by 2030.” The index also looked at Morocco’s progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and climate policies. Since the energy sector contributes greatly to the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of a country, Morocco scored a low GHG emission level. Morocco hence contributes to limiting global warming effects in the world because it is one of the 56 countries and the EU which are together responsible for over 90 percent of global GHG emissions. Global emissions of CO2 account for 80 percent of global warming, which scientists expect will climb nearly three percent in 2018. The North African country has also maintained its high ranking in the Climate Policy category, said the CCPI index survey. “While national experts observe some delay in the implementation of national policies, they acknowledge the consultative process of developing a long-term strategy for 2050, which among other initiatives could make the country a policy frontrunner on the international level,” reads the survey. The CCPI aims to put political and social pressure on countries which have failed to take ambitious action on climate protection. The index also highlights countries with the best practices in climate policies.  The CCPI bases 80 percent of its evaluation on indicators of emissions, renewable energy, and energy use, and the remaining 20 percent is based on national and international climate policy assessments.

Rabat – A former adviser to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, Bassam Abou Sharif, has said Saudi Arabia allowed the decision to assassinate Arafat. In an interview with Shehab News Agency, Sharif said, “The former US President George Bush spoke with the Saudi regime after a meeting with the former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, during which Arafat’s assassination was discussed, and the Saudi regime agreed.” Sharif added that Saudi Arabia agreed to the assassination of Arafat because he “became an obstacle to peace and the implementation of the Arab peace initiative.” He added that he has documents on the White House meeting between Bush and Sharon. Sharon told the former US president, according to Sharif , that “he could no longer keep his promise of not physically attacking Yasser Arafat because he was (leading terrorism) and collaborating with Hamas, and that Hamas operations would be implemented with the approval of Arafat.” Sharif added that Bush remained silent and nodded his head, approving Sharon’s plan. Following the meeting, Bush contacted his long-time regional partner, Saudi Arabia, and informed them of the decision. Sharif continued that Saudi Arabia agreed. Sharif said that his new book, titled “Assamak Al Malih” (Salty Fish), contains many secrets regarding the assassination of the former president of Palestine and the assassination of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin. Arafat died unexpectedly on November 11, 2004, at the age of 75 at a hospital near Paris shortly after being admitted, due to unknown causes. The cause of his death has been debated since then. There was much speculation that Israel was behind the death of Arafat. The New York Post reported in January of this year that Sharon ordered Yasser Arafat’s assassination.

Rabat – In my three years living in Morocco I have been impressed by how much construction activity I see, especially in public spaces, such as new sidewalks, plazas, parks, and playgrounds.

Surely everyone would like to enjoy these improvements for many years to come. Unfortunately, there are already visible cracks (literal and figurative) in infrastructure that is still new and has hardly been used.
 
I am not going to blame the government, corruption, or cheating with bad materials and inflated prices. Instead, I will blame the deficiencies in my own profession: Architecture.

Architects must respond to the clients’ wishes of course. But architects must also advise them when they see bad practice.

Time and time again I see projects which overreach, using expensive materials and elaborate designs. I understand these projects were designed to win a competition or get the client’s approval. But even if a client asks for it, architects should not promise features with flashy 3D images that the client cannot afford to build well and maintain. Yet architects in Morocco continue to overreach even though Moroccans are surrounded by examples of crumbling benches and dried-up fountains.

Globally, there is an obsession with the new and amnesia for what we already have. In order to improve public space and the quality of life in towns and cities, however, there must be a mentality shift, one that emphasizes real long-term quality over short-term glitter.    Architects, urban designers, and landscape designers must think simple. This is actually difficult because we think elaborate things are more beautiful. But simple things that function well give people more pleasure than overly complex things. Apple’s products are a modern example of good minimalist design. But there are also many examples of traditional Moroccan houses which are both simple and elegant. One aspect of being simple means that designs must be easily buildable by local workers with local materials. This is not a limitation; this is a strength. If you want proof, look at the Yves Saint Laurent Museum in Marrakech. Durable materials, such as solid stone, cast iron, and precast concrete, are weatherproof, too heavy to be moved, cannot be burned, and can be cleaned of graffiti. Plastic, wood, glass, sheet metal, and Moroccan zellige tile can be destroyed by weather and vandalism in a matter of months. They should only be used in interior spaces and where staff is around to protect them. 

As a general rule, architects should stop proposing water fountains. They look good in 3D images but are rarely maintained. The pumps stop working, they leak, and the water gets dirty and dries up. The fountains inevitably become trash bins.

Outdoor furniture, such as benches, playground equipment, and trash containers, must withstand the abuse they inevitably receive. A simple but durable playground is better than a fancy but damaged playground.

Finally, architects also have to be realistic when budgeting for maintenance. Repair and cleaning do not generate the buzz that a ribbon cutting ceremony does, but they are just as important. New but ruined infrastructure is a waste of money and has a depressing effect on society. If there is only money to build and not enough to maintain, then it is better not to build. It can always come later.

Architects need to stop overreaching and design within the client’s resources. So let’s apply Moroccan common sense: Let’s build “b’shwiya” (slowly).

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) President Ahmad Ahmad has declared that CAF will announce the nation to host the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), also known as AFCON, on January 9. In an interview with Agence France-Presse on Monday, Ahmad stated that “South Africa could step in as hosts of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.” Cameroon lost its AFCON hosting rights on November 30, due to delays with venue building and security concerns. CAF then invited all CAF member associations to submit their bid dossier for the 2019 AFCON. Ahmad also revealed that two or three nations have shown interest in taking over next summer’s football event from Cameroon. The president named South Africa as having filed a letter of intent. “According to my information, two or three letters of intent have arrived,” Ahmad told AFP.  “South Africa is one of the countries to have sent a letter of intention. Two or three countries have made serious inquiries,” he added. Cameroon will now host the 2021 tournament, originally given to Côte d’Ivoire, which will now host the 2023 competition. “In 2021 they will be ready: we will organize the CAN in Cameroon. And in 2023 it will be held in Ivory Coast.”  Countries with intent to host the African competition will have until Friday, December 14, to submit their bid. For several months, even before Cameroon was disqualified, Morocco has been expected to replace Cameroon as the host of the AFCON, however, Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) President Fouzi Lekjaa denied Morocco’s intention to organize the event. Several football personalities, however, have said Morocco would be the best candidate for the organization of AFCON. Among them is the head of Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority Federation, Turki Al Sheikh, and Morocco’s football team head coach, Herve Renard.  Al Sheikh said in a phone interview during the Egyptian “Sada El Balad” television program that Saudi Arabia is ready to mobilize all its resources “if our Moroccan brothers ask us.” He also announced Saudi support for Morocco to host the African Nations Championship. For his part, Renard believes that Morocco is ready in terms of infrastructure, in the hope that Morocco will host the event even if it will add extra pressure to the country.

Rabat – In a video a group of Moroccan men, dressed in djellaba, a Moroccan traditional robe, played Dakka Marrakchia, a lively traditional Moroccan genre of music from Marrakech, as they drove their car on the streets in France.   The video  has been circulating on social media since last Saturday. The men chanted “Macron resignation,” and “Go, go yellow vests,” as they passed by yellow vest protesters who danced and cheered along to the Moroccan music. The yellow vest protests against fuel taxes have transformed into anti-Macron demonstrations that have reached an unprecedented scale of violence. Throughout the protests, protesters have looted shops, smashed cars, and defaced the Arc de Triomphe with graffiti insulting President Emmanuel Macron. On Saturday, French police used tear gas for the first time to disperse protesters in an attempt to stop the violence. Yet, about 126 people still suffered injuries that day due to the protests. Nearly 90,000 members of law enforcement were on duty across the country on the same day to respond to clashes, 8,000 of which were deployed in Paris. One protester stood out as she had a different approach to ending the violent demonstrations. Bursting into tears, the woman fell onto her knees and called for the clashes to end. “You should be with us for the people, for France, for our homeland, for our nation!” she shouted. The movement started in Paris on November 17 to protest an unpopular tax on fuel proposed in France’s national budget. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that Macron was going to propose “measures” to end protests. According to a recent opinion poll, Macron’s perceived pro-rich policies have made him unpopular with the French people. Even former pro-Macron voters have expressed their dissatisfaction, claiming that the president has betrayed the values and policies he appeared to espouse during his presidential campaign.

Rabat – In his speech of November 6, King Mohammed VI extended a hand for peace and goodwill to the Algerian government, with the hope to start a new chapter of good relations. Algeria has not yet responded to this initiative of friendship. Their no-answer posture is in many ways equivalent to saying unofficially: No way. During the 130-year spell of French colonial presence in Algeria, France considered this country as a French department: “Algerie Francaise.” Realizing that it was going to ultimately leave Algeria when the independence war of November 1, 1954, to March 19, 1962, started, France turned to the Moroccans, asking to negotiate the restitution of territories that France cut off from Morocco during colonialization.  King Mohammed V, in the name of the pan-Arab brotherhood utopia of the time, turned down the French initiative saying that it would be equivalent to stabbing a sister country in the back. He said that after independence Algeria would, unilaterally, restitute the territories in question. However, after independence in 1963, Algeria flatly refused to do such a thing on the grounds that the territories in question were fully Algerian. The abrupt refusal escalated the tension between the two countries and a war known as the “Sand War” ensued in September 1963 leading to the defeat of Algeria. Rather than hold onto the territory grabbed during the brief war by the Moroccan army to make a land swap later on, King Hassan II, in an unexpected move, instructed the army to return home to avoid a long term conflict with Algeria. But the harm was done and animosity towards Morocco was born in Algerian official circles. Sahara conflict  During the era of Algerian President Houari Boumedienne (1932-1978), in the official narrative, Morocco was seen as the enemy because it fought Algeria as a young nation. The official policy among political leadership and army strategists stated, in private, that Morocco was a great danger to the unity and survival of Algeria and, as such, must be challenged in all areas and at all times. One first such challenge was the Sahara issue. While Boumedienne in 1974 accepted the takeover of the territory by both Morocco and Mauritania, he adopted the Polisario Front in 1975. By the time Algeria had an upper hand over the Polisario Front, the latter’s goal was no longer to end Spanish colonization but to create an independent state. The tripartite agreement between Spain, the colonial power, Morocco, and Mauritania, known as of November 15, 1975, ceded the territory to Morocco and Mauritania. To mar the Moroccan-Mauritanian takeover, Algeria armed the Polisario, which launched attacks on both Morocco and Mauritania. Mauritania, unable to bear the brunt of the military onslaught, left the territory and ceded its part to Morocco in 1979. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Algeria not only armed the Polisario but, also and most importantly, bought external support for it in the Organization of African Unity and in the UN, thanks to the petrodollars it got from its oil revenues. Morocco countered Polisario’s military efforts by building a defensive wall, the Moroccan Western Sahara wall, an approximately 2,700-kilmeter-long structure that stopped Polisario’s encroachments in the territory under Moroccan control. Morocco also put forth an autonomy plan for the territory in 2007 as a possible solution to the Western Sahara conflict. The plan has since received support from many nations of the world as a viable political solution to the conflict. Closing the border Besides the Sahara conflict, official Algerian enmity is expressed through the actual closed border and the cessation of all possible economic activity. In 1994, the Hotel Asni in Marrakech witnessed one of the first terrorist attacks in Morocco. Three Algerian-French nationals carried out the attack, which left two people dead. Morocco accused Algerian intelligence services of planning the deadly shooting, a claim that worsened the diplomatic relations between the two neighboring countries. Morocco then closed off its border with Algeria briefly. Algeria used the move as an excuse to permanently close the borders to stop Algerians visiting Morocco in millions and spending lots of money, strengthening the Moroccan economy. It is also an excuse to prevent the Algerian people from seeing Morocco’s tremendous development in various sectors of the economy in spite of Morocco’s lack of oil. Algerian animosity toward Morocco is exclusively the work of the Algerian military that controls the country through docile political parties and an incapacitated president. Other than that, the Algerian people feel close to the Moroccan people because of shared religion, language, and culture, and they express this closeness every time they are given the opportunity. What will alter Algeria’s belligerent attitude? The hate of Morocco and what it represents is engrained in the Algerian military psyche, and only two possible developments can, ultimately, put an end to it. The first possibility is that Algeria goes bankrupt and allows the IMF and the World Bank to clean its financial mess, opening its economic border and allowing Moroccan companies to do business in Algeria. Another possibility is that Algeria will cut subsidies, bringing the population to the streets. An ensuing revolution could end military control and bring democracy to the country. Barring these two developments, Algeria will continue holding a grudge against Morocco and the Maghreb Union will just be wishful thinking, if not a political joke, to say the least.

Rabat – Morocco now ranks 132nd out of 163 in the 2018 terrorism index, gaining nine places compared to the 2017 report when it ranked 123rd. The report showcases that Morocco has two strategies to deal with foreign fighter returnees: Deradicalization programs and imprisonment. In 2015, Morocco established a policy that allowed law enforcement to apprehend returnees for investigation and put them in custody. Returnees typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. Morocco also set up a program to counter violent extremism through hard security measures, regional cooperation, intelligence sharing, the promotion of moderate Islam, and democratic reform. According to a document shared by Morocco on the Move, Morocco’s counter- radicalization strategy seeks to protect citizens from extreme forms of Islam. The strategy also includes renovation and upgrading of mosques, making official lists of imams public, and reviewing laws governing worship locations. Morocco’s strategy makes the North African country safer than powerful countries, including the US, ranked 20th, and France, ranked 30th. Tunisia was ranked 47th, while Algeria ranked 54th. Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy received  praise from several international powers as something that can be learned from.   In its 2018 Country Report on Terrorism, the US Department of State applauded Morocco’s efforts in combating terror threats internationally. he State Department said, “Following the August attacks in Barcelona, Morocco assisted the Spanish investigation and promised to expand cooperation to track terrorists of Moroccan origin radicalized abroad.” Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), which was introduced in 2015, reinforced the country’s strategy to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking. In the last three years, Morocco’s BCIJ has dismantled a number of terror cells and helped several countries to arrest suspects with ties to terrorism. Just recently, on December 7, Morocco’s BCIJ arrested a six-member terror cell for their alleged ties with ISIS. On Saturday, BCIJ also busted an international drug trafficking ring, seizing 1 ton of cocaine. BCIJ also arrested seven members involved with the international drug trafficking network.

Rabat – Algeria‘s paradoxical foreign policy is an expression of its narrow vision rather than diplomatic wisdom and international credibility, but Morocco still has patience.  Algeria has shown no intention of opening dialogue, yet Morocco is still extending the offer of genuine dialogue with sincere intentions. Algeria has tried to escalate the situation by fabricating tensions and arming the militia of Polisario since 1974, yet Morocco is still wisely trying not to be trapped in the trenches.  In his speech to commemorate the 43rd anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI called on Algeria to reopen the border that has been closed between the two countries since 1994 and proposed a joint political mechanism for dialogue and consultation. He stressed Morocco’s openness to any Algerian proposals to overcome the stalemate between them. Two days after the speech, Algeria hired David Keene, a former president of the American National Rifle Association (NRA), to lobby in the US for Polisario against Morocco. Algeria pays him $360,000 a year. The firm, which Algeria pays with taxpayer money, is just one example of how the lobbying machine in Algeria prioritizes Polisario over the day-to-day Algerian suffocation under military oligarchs. Other similar cases unveil how much Algeria’s diplomatic policy generously spends on the world’s case brokers in the United Nations, Latin America, and the European Union. Algeria’s total budget to harass Morocco annually exceeds $200 million. As researchers and observers, we ask how the response of the Algerian government towards any calls for rapprochement can be explained? Is this new in the history of Moroccan-Algerian relations, or has it always been the case? To answer how Algerian political and social behavior towards Morocco and its southern Sahara is structured, Moroccans must understand the internal historical institutionalism under which governing institutions in Algeria shaped their adversarial behavior when dealing with Morocco. Using historical institutionalism as a method of analysis, we can identify the ways in which the presidency in Algeria and the army have reinforced an adversarial attitude towards Morocco. We can begin by focusing on the Al Moravid dynasty under Youssef Ibn Tashfine when fighting the battle of Sagrajas, or the Zallaqa battle, in 1086. Algeria’s behavior since the Al Moravid Dynasty in 1086 When Prince Youssef Ibn Tashfine, the first sultan of the Al Moravid Dynasty, crossed into Andalusia in 1086 to fight the Castilian King Alfonso VI in the Battle of Zallaqa, an Algerian got in the way. Banu Hammad, who was governing what was then known as “the Middle Maghreb” (half of Algeria of today), created troubles by allying with the Banu Hilal tribe to divide the eastern part of the dynasty because Tlemcen, now in Algeria, was then part of the Al Moravids’ territory.  Prince Youssef Ibn Tashfine immediately returned to Morocco after his victory in the Battle of Zallaqa. He then cleverly avoided war with Banu Hammad. With wisdom, Youssef Ibn Tashfine sent a letter to the prince of Banu Hammad, accusing him of creating and using other tribes against Tashfine to invade his territory at a time when they must unite to confront the Castilians in Andalusia (Ibn Khaldoun, 1385; Ibn Al Athir, 1231; and Ali Ben Moussa, 1955). Ten years later, Banu Hammad tried to enter from the east, and Prince Youssef Ibn Tashfine ordered his armies to retreat, extending his hand and reconciling with them again and appeasing them by isolating the governor of Tlemcen and appointing a new one (Ibn Al Athir, 1231). What does the event tell Moroccans? It says a lot about today’s offer of reconciliation by King Mohammed VI. It has always been the same in the Moroccan culture. A historical institutionalist would call this process “Path Dependency.” It means that “history matters,” (North 1990: vii), and critical junctures have come to play an increasing role in explanations of institutional change. Institutions reduce uncertainty within a relevant group by providing information that establishes expectations for the future actions of others (Knight, 1992). It explains why the action of Algerian elites (civilians and military) becomes institutionalized over others and how individual decisions “scale-up” to institutional outcomes. Examining political phenomena such as the rival doctrine against Morocco by Algeria’s elites is best comprehended “as a process that unfolds over time.” (Pierson 1996, 126). It is “institutionalist,” as Harvard University’s Paul Pierson puts it, “because it stresses that many of the contemporary implications of these temporal processes are embedded in institutions – whether these be formal rules, policy structures, or norms” (Pierson 1996, 126). Relations in everyday life There is no gathering or international event through which Algeria does not try to distort Morocco’s reputation. Algeria also pays countries in Africa and Latin America, and lobbying firms in the US to invent imaginary entities that could delay Morocco’s development path. Algeria was the only Arab country to criticize Morocco’s right to Perejil Island, off the Moroccan coast near Ceuta. Algerian diplomats in Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Washington are paid generously and are siphoning off the money of the Algerian people who are in need at banquets, parties, and lobbying firms. Despite all this, Morocco is still patient and sound. In a football game, Egypt attacked the history of Algeria by casting doubt on the number of victims during the French colonialism, the history of resistance, and Algeria’s national anthem. How would Algeria react if Morocco harbored the Kabile of Tizi Ouazzou in Oujda and set up a camp near Sidi Yahya, a few kilometers from Algeria, and then diabolically urged them to ask Algeria for independence? How would Algeria react if Moroccan embassies mobilized to facilitate the movements of Algerian people to only destabilize Algiers?  I am sure Moroccans would feel ashamed and never raise their heads but denounce the repugnant maneuvers. The following statements of two former politicians representing both Morocco and Algeria confirm my beliefs. Abderrahmane Al Youssefi, former Moroccan prime minister and the historical personality who was raised in the left and accompanied the “Government of Change” (Gouvernement d’Alternance) period with success in the 1990s, welcomed King Mohammed VI’s speech. Al Youssefi argued: “I received with great joy and great satisfaction what was stated in the speech of His Majesty the King on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March.” He appreciated the call for positive conditions for achieving historic reconciliation with Morocco’s Algerian brothers in a constructive spirit. Al Youssefi said all files are open for deliberation, and the countries and their leaders do not need any mediation to have the courage to innovate solutions to all outstanding problems. Contrary to the enthusiasm of Abderrahmane Al Youssefi, the former Algerian Minister of Culture Mouhieddin Amimore said Algeria’s failure to respond to Morocco’s call for dialogue was a “polite response.” He explained that Algeria is uncertain of the move’s intentions because trust between the two countries has eroded since 1963. In his analysis of King Mohammed VI’s recent actions, the Algerian politician said: “At first sight, the Moroccan monarch’s speech seemed laden with goodwill and good intention, but conscious reading confirms a clear deception.” The two statements of the political leaders reveal one truth that Algeria is convinced of the good intentions of Morocco, yet their military doctrine prevents any such reconciliation process and genuine bilateral dialogues. Morocco has grown up. The issue of Morocco’s homeland and territorial unity has grown within Morocco, and Moroccans’ patience has grown bigger. Where are the educated elites of Algeria? Where are its religious scholars? Where are its authentic journalists, to show the military machine that it is time to break the illusion? Morocco’s historical patience is a centuries-old Moroccan principle. Examining historical institutionalism proves to me a constant pattern of adversarial behavior from Algeria towards Morocco. In response to the glorious success of the Green March, Algeria deported more than 45,000 Moroccan families in 1975 who were brought to live in a border camp. The only crime they committed was that they were Moroccans. For the military machine in Algeria to endure, Algiers must prolong enmity with Morocco.

Rabat – Moroccan singer Hamid Zahir died today in Marrakech, his birthplace. Zahir had suffered a stroke and battled with renal insufficiency, spending 10 days in the intensive care unit, his family said in their announcement to Moroccan media.  The singer and lyricist was born to a Syrian mother and a father from El Kelaa des Sraghna in central Morocco and discovered his passion for music at a young age. Zahir, whose birth name was Hamid Ben Taher, had worked as a butcher, but then started to play the “oud,” a lute-type instrument known as the “King of Instruments” in the Arab world.  Between 1947 and 1951, Zahir began performing in Marrakech’s famous square, Jemaa El Fna, where multiple forms of art flourish, from the long-lasting storytelling genre known as “Al Halqa,” to  dancing and magic performances. Zahir made his debut with songs “Awin Awin,” and “Lila a Sidi Amara” and reached the peak of his success in the early 1960s with songs like “Marrakech Sidi Koulou Fareh Lik” (All Marrakech is happy for your majesty) in honor of King Hassan II’s enthronement in 1961. His songs “Lalla Fatima” and “Lalla Souad” are some of the best-known classical Moroccan songs.  Zahir met and became friends with legendary Egyptian singers Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez. The artist also held several musical parties at the royal palace.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed a message to the leaders and representatives of the countries taking place in the intergovernmental conference on migration in Marrakech on Monday. Read by Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, the King’s message emphasized Morocco’s commitment toward migration and the need for shared responsibility as a principle to tackle migration challenges. He dedicated the first lines of his message to thanking and welcoming  leaders to Marrakech and Africa. “What more symbolic venue could there be for this landmark event that has brought us together today than Africa – the cradle of the first human movement – than Morocco, an origin, transit, and destination country, and, finally, than Marrakech – its timeless melting pot?” he said. King Mohammed VI also expressed pride in Morocco being chosen to host the event: “I say ‘pride’ because the international community has chosen to convene this global even in the kingdom of Morocco and humility, given the magnitude the issue, of what has already been achieved and of what is still to be done.” The monarch also said that Morocco’s efforts throughout the years to tackle migration are “neither recent nor incidental.” The King emphasized Morocco’s “longstanding, voluntary commitment expressed through a policy which is humane in its philosophy, global in its substance, pragmatic in its methodology and responsible in its approach.” The King then recalled his African Agenda on Migration, which was unanimously adopted by the African Union Conference in January 2018. When introduced to the AU through a message read by El Othmani at the 30th AU Summit, the King described the agenda as a “flexible, scalable, and legally non-binding document.” In his message to the AU, the King said that migration should be seen as a “natural phenomenon” and should be celebrated. “We should adopt a positive stance on the issue of migration by highlighting the humanistic rationale of shared responsibility and solidarity.” Today in Marrakech, the sovereign reiterated his message, emphasizing that Africa should not be the subject of the Global Compact, but the African continent “will be an actor—a key one.” He said that the African agenda has been playing a “pioneering role, anticipating the importance of being aware of migratory dynamics, something which has been acknowledged by the global compact.” The King concluded his message by calling for solidarity-based sovereignty, multilateralism, and a shared responsibility to face migration challenges.

Rabat – Over 160 countries approved the Global Compact on Migration (CGM) Monday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the compact a “road map to prevent suffering and chaos” which aims to benefit the world’s population. Taking place today and tomorrow in Marrakech, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration aims “to better manage  international migration, address its challenges, and strengthen migrants’ rights while contributing to sustainable development.” The pact “is the first-ever inter-governmentally negotiated agreement to cover all dimensions of international migration in a holistic and comprehensive manner,” according to the UN. According to UN figures, there are over 258 million migrants around the world living outside their home countries, representing 3.4 percent of the world’s population, up 2.7 percent since 2000. Speaking at the Marrakech conference, Guterres regretted that over 60,000 migrants have died on the move since 2000, calling the tragedy “a source of collective shame.” Moments before the adoption of the migration pact, Guterres said, “This moment is the inspiring product of dedicated and painstaking efforts.” In July, 192 UN member states approved the global migration pact. However, a number of countries, including the US, have withdrawn from the pact primarily citing national sovereignty concerns. “It is true that some states are not with us today,” said Guterres. “I can only hope that they will see the GMC’s value for their own societies and join us in this common venture.” The pact is not legally binding and the approving states are not requested to sign it but only to approve it by acclamation. Guterres said that the UN will not impose migration policies on member states. UN Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour, who chairs the Marrakech intergovernmental conference, attributed criticism of the agreement to a “very bad understanding of the text.” “It must be read after all, it’s a very long and detailed text—or based on ignorance or bad faith because when we hear constantly that this pact is damaging to the sovereignty of states, we must really ask ourselves what document have they been reading!” Arbour said last week. UNSG spokesman Stephane Dujarric explained the pact saying, “This is about helping countries manage migration. This is about reaffirming the rights of countries to obviously control their own borders. It seems to defy logic to see how you can manage migration without having a global conversation.”  Prominent names such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and Canadian immigration minister Ahmed Hussen joined the two-day conference in Marrakech. Guterres will officially launch the Migration Network at the Marrakech conference. Later today, the UN secretary general will also participate in a high-level event to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights along with several former high commissioners for human rights.

Rabat – Having arrived in Morocco on Sunday, UN chief Antonio Guterres expressed gratitude, “in particular,” to the Moroccan government “for their welcome and the fantastic miracle of the conference center,” according to UN.org. About 150 countries have confirmed their intention to vote for the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration today in Marrakech. Pressing support for the pact, Guterres said that the countries’ participation “is a clear demonstration of the importance our global community places on the pursuit of the better management of international migration, through a cooperative approach that is grounded in the principles of state sovereignty, responsibility-sharing, non-discrimination and human rights.” The UN migration document aims to fulfill 23 objectives, including providing basic services for migrants, eliminating all forms of discrimination against migrants, and sustainable reintegration. The accord also aims to ease the regular migration process and to solidify international cooperation and efforts to save migrants’ lives, and reduce environmental and other factors that force people to flee their countries of origin. Guterres also urged  leaders of the countries participating in the conference to “breathe life,” calling on them to “demonstrate the compact’s utility: to Governments as they establish and implement their own migration policies,” as well as “to communities of origin, transit, and destination; and to migrants themselves.” The UN said that the migration compact meets all standards to cover “all dimensions of international migration in a holistic and comprehensive manner.” The compact came out of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which was adopted in 2016. It was developed after 18 months of discussions, according to the UN. Morocco’s Representative to the United Nations Omar Hilale said it was a “historic moment for two reasons.” He explained that the conference is the first of its kind that tackles migration issues. The second reason, according to Hilale, is that the “Marrakech document will be the first document in UN history that will address the rights of migrants and defend it.” He added that “Marrakech will lend its name to this document.”

Rabat – Today and tomorrow, representatives of 180 countries are meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, to sign what supporters have called “a landmark agreement” on migration. But how effective is the much-awaited Global Compact? And what do stakeholders expect to get from the Marrakech meeting? Many such questions were raised and answered, if unsatisfactorily, during the 11th Global Forum on Migration and Development, which also took place in Marrakech. The three-day event, December 5-7, felt like a thematic prelude to the Global Compact. It was in many respects designed as a preparatory workshop to explain, perhaps to reluctant countries and apprehensive attendees, the “historic meaning” of the Global Compact for Migration. In three days of discussions, sometimes diplomatic and unforthcoming, other times hot and tense, participants made it their call to lay down the foundations of what looked like a “brave new world” for migration and migrants. The Global Compact, it was steadily maintained in the numerous panels and side-events that made up the hectic program of the migration forum, is a vindication of the universal rights and dignity of migrants. ‘Global solutions to global crises’ Morocco, the host country, was prominently represented in debates and panels.  Rabat pioneered the 18-month-long discussions and negotiations that ultimately led to the conception and adoption of a universal declaration on migrants’ rights, argued Driss el-Yazami, the president of Morocco’s National Council for Human Rights (CNDH). In doing so, he added, Morocco joined the company of countries that have opted for “intelligent policymaking and universal fraternity” in the face of daunting international crises. For the Moroccan official, it does not help to view migrants as threats to host countries’ security and socio-economic wellbeing. Migration and migrants constitute an essential element of all thriving societies, he said. He added: “As the host of the historic document to be adopted very soon, Morocco is reaffirming its commitment to our fundamental capacity to face together our common challenges.” Morocco’s enthusiasm was supportively greeted throughout the forum; some delegates, more exultant and lyrical than El-Yazami, went as far as saying that the forum’s challenge and ambition was to nurture “evidence-based policies” and “sincere dialogue” to “breathe life” into the soon-to-be-adopted compact “by generating ideas, projects, and actions.” “A historic event in a historic city,” said a visibly upbeat and Marrakech-enamored Antonio Vitorino, head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).  What makes the Global Compact historic, Vitorino elaborated, is the unprecedented fervor the idea has generated in the international community. It is not all the time that developed and developing countries speak as one on a global issue with such far-reaching consequences as migration. Adopting a document that supports a common North-South vision to “make migration work for all” should be celebrated, not decried or frowned upon, the IOM chief suggested. Divergences and apprehension Beneath the hubris and celebration, however, there sat unexpressed frustrations, sustained apprehensions, and abiding doubts about the political potency of a non-binding agreement. “I am sorry to say this, but the forum was utterly disappointing,” said Yamta Helene Mariam, who attended the forum as a voice of the “disappointed civil society.” Mariam is the president of the Moroccan Women Migrants Association, and she is a “daily witness to the plight and despair of sub-Saharan migrants.” In defense of her pessimism and reluctance to join the bandwagon of countries celebrating a non-binding document, she explained to Morocco World News that “international policymaking has always been a domain of influence-peddling, inequality, and imposed policies.” “Did you hear any prominent African voice today?” she asked, with a facial expression that seemed more shocked than rebellious, or perhaps both.  “I leave the forum confused. I am confused because I didn’t hear anything about Africa’s stance on migration. This global compact is the culmination of debates and decision-making that never put concerns of origin countries at the center. I think multinationals and powerful external actors are imposing their will on Africa. I am afraid Africa will come out of this agreement as loser. ‘J’accuse.’…” Jean Ngendahimana, a German migrant rights advocate of Rwandan descent, who represented Germany’s civil society, agreed with Mariam’s reservations. But Ngendahimana’s pessimism left an exit door for optimism and the transformative “agency of migrants and collective international action.”  Despite the Global Compact’s numerous implementation pitfalls and nice-sounding vagaries dressed as recommendations, Ngendahimana argued, there is reason to hope that an unprecedented North-South understanding can yield a number of positive results. “But I wanted migrants to be at the center of debates because you cannot have a panel of men discuss feminism and gender issues” he said. Migrants, he continued, should not be a security or economic side event in discussions that address their suffering. Rather, their stories and struggles should be part of any global action on migration. Ngendahimana is not totally desperate, nor does he, like Mariam, point fingers or call names. Multilateralism works best when each party makes concessions to ensure the possibility of the general good, he argued. The compact, after all, creates a venue for genuine multilateral cooperation on migration.  There should at least be hope, he emphatically told Morocco World News, that global stakeholders will in time commit to a shared and sustainable future. But the only way forward for the Compact is to ensure that “this is not one [of] those conferences where governments and civil society can come together to talk nicely, fail to implement, and get lost in discussions. We need a comprehensive policy on migration.”   But the meltdown and apprehension-filled reactions were already there before the Marrakech forum. From the very outset, earlier this year in July, Trump’s America withdrew from the UN General Assembly’s vote, judging the idea incompatible with its “America First” policy.  In the course of the three-day-long Marrakech forum, the US was notably absent. On December 10-11, Washington’s absence will surely be the elephant in the room.  “It is always disappointing not to have the US on a global platform,” said an African delegate. “My country will sign the compact, but I do not agree with the ideas and recommendations. This is another imposition that small countries are following in spite of themselves. We are, like flowing water, following the direction we have been instructed. But I assure you this is going to fail, just like the millennium goals for sustainable development. We have seen this before.” But Washington is hardly the only heavy-weight absentee. Other countries, including Australia, Israel, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Austria, have made clear their unwelcoming take on the UN-led compact. Meanwhile, Belgium is undecided, divided even. Switzerland, Bulgaria, Latvia, and the Dominican Republic are unsure, unconvinced, and reluctant. They have told the UN that their governments will not be present in Marrakech. The Croatian Parliamentary Representative, Hrvoje Zekanovic, has sent notifications of a “press conference AGAINST” the compact to be held today near the hall where governments will convene to adopt the pact. He is protesting against his government’s decision to adopt the pact. So far, though, the heavy criticism and the last-minute withdrawals have left the pact’s supporters unmoved. For them, the symbolism and hope attached to the compact is such that no opposing force can withhold the positive energy it elicits and symbolizes.  “We are witnessing from some political sectors the manipulation, the distortion of the objectives of the pact,” said IOM head Antonio Vitorino. The lesson from all of this?  The compact is “the end of the beginning,” said Louise Arbour, the special representative of the UN Secretary-General for international migration. The end is nowhere in sight and will depend on the commitment level from all signatories once the pact is adopted, Arbour argued, suggesting that a two-day international conference will not miraculously solve the world’s migration crisis.

Rabat – Mohammed Rabii has won his eighth professional battle over his Kazakhstani contender Alexandr Zhuravkiy. The boxing match took place Saturday at Marcel-Cerdan sports hall in Levallois, France, on the sidelines of the World Boxing Association’s principal battle between Michel Soro and Greg Vendetti. The undefeated Moroccan boxer won yesterday’s match by points after dominating all eight rounds. Rabii, 25, made his professional debut at super welterweight division on March 11, 2017. That day he took down his Hungarian rival, Laszio Kovacs, by technical knockout.

Rabat – The Moroccan delegation to the roundtable talks in Geneva most likely reiterated that only the autonomy proposal should be discussed. Polisario has certainly insisted that the referendum for independence should be included as an option. Mauritania is expected to be neutral and perhaps stated that the problem needs to be solved for the sake of a Maghreb Union.

The Algerians have undoubtedly held their usual stance that Morocco should adhere to international legality and allow for a referendum which includes independence as an option.

The UN envoy, Horst Kohler, told reporters that a peaceful solution to the conflict is possible.

A solution is possible of course, but only if the current Algerian regime wants to end its financial, political, diplomatic, and military support of Polisario. Let’s not fool ourselves with these UN meetings. Forcing Algeria to be part of the roundtable will not bring an end to the conflict.  As a matter of fact, Algeria had insisted before and after the roundtable that they attended only as observers. An observer is just that and is not under any pressure to contribute to a solution. That is a primary reason why these UN talks will never succeed. It is no secret that Polisario is simply a tool for Algeria to use when needed.  Algeria has the last word in choosing if it should continue with the status quo or decide that it is time to work with Morocco on a peace plan. All signs indicate that Algeria is not interested in doing so. The refusal to reply to the Moroccan monarch’s proposal for peace is a clear sign that it is not how they see the solution to the conflict.

Many believe that Algeria is simply stubborn and refuses to make peace. But that’ i not the case. The Western Sahara conflict is a raison d’etre for the current regime. If the conflict ends, the regime will be deprived of its livelihood, and it will no longer be able to sell the pretext to the Algerian people that they are arming themselves to the teeth to deter an invasion from the Moroccans. A solution will only come if the Algerian people are somehow able to change course and say loud and clear that they can no longer be governed by octogenarians from another era, put in place a democratically elected government, and not one created in the presidential palace run by none other than the brother of the very ill president of Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Right after the roundtable ended, Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita already sensed that the Algerians are not contributing positively, which led him to stress that “it is not enough … a good atmosphere should be translated into a genuine will” to change the situation. “This momentum will have an end if there is no political will,” he warned.

The next planned roundtable will be challenging for the Moroccans. It will have to advance beyond simple remarks and a fake friendly atmosphere. That is something the Algerians will not make any effort to accomplish, because they do not have to.  Morocco should redouble its efforts to convince the international community that the only way towards ending this conflict is the direct involvement of Algeria in the political process. Without a clear definition of what the UN needs to achieve from the Geneva talks and what its parameters are, the talks will end up producing the same effects as the nine informal talks held under the auspices of the former UN personal envoy, Christopher Ross.

Rabat – Yellow vests in France marched carrying a banner saying, “Marrakech, c’est not” (No to Marrakech), referring to the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration that will be formally adopted on Monday in Marrakech. A Twitter user shared the video of the protest against the UN migration pact, captioned: “In Lyon, the yellow vests are mobilized against Marrakech’s pact.” À #Lyon les #GiletsJaunes mobilisés contre le #PacteDeMarrakech. #8decembre pic.twitter.com/QAGMv2EK6g — Etienne d’Esparbès (@ey_desparbes) December 8, 2018  The protests against migration are not contained only in France, with protests against the migration pact also erupting in Canada. According to CBC, nine people were arrested during the protest which took place on Parliament Hill Saturday afternoon. The protests followed the government’s decision to sign the pact on migration. On Friday, Canada’s Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said in Marrakech that the compact is an important agreement. He added that the pact will make countries work together to challenge migration’s causes and circumstances. The migration pact aims to address humanitarian concerns, human rights issues, and developmental aspects of international migration. It also seeks to protect the dignity of all migrants, regardless of their status. The compact promises to ease the pressure on countries that welcome and host refugees. Leaders of at least 135 countries will convene at the Intergovernmental Conference in Marrakech to adopt the migration compact. However, a number of countries have declined to join the UN pact, including the US, Italy, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Israel, Latvia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Switzerland. The UN migration accord contains 23 objectives including the facilitation of the legal migration process, strengthening coordinated international efforts to save migrants’ lives, and reducing environmental and other factors that force people to leave their countries of origin.

Rabat – Boubker Sbik, spokesperson for Morocco’s security services, has lauded the efforts of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST).  He said that the arrest of the members of an international drug trafficking network on Saturday morning by Morocco’s Central  Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) is the fruit of a “qualitative process, which is part of a precise strategy based on the coordination of efforts between DGSN and DGST.” He told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), that this operation is one of Morocco’s biggest drug arrests in the last two years.  On Saturday, authorities arrested seven individuals linked to the criminal network, specializing in smuggling cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. BCIJ also seized one ton of cocaine, in addition to a domestic truck loaded with sacks of cocaine paste weighing one ton in total, two rubber boats, two four-wheel-drive cars, a GPS, and a water engine. Sbik confirmed that the seven individuals, all of whom are of Moroccan nationality, were arrested. He added that there might be possible international suspects involved in drug-trafficking crimes in Morocco. He said the coordination between DGSN and DGST has enabled the seizure of more than 65 tons of cocaine and 43 tons of cannabis in 2018. The cooperation between the two services also enabled authorities to seize more than 1,003,000 psychotropic pills, including ecstasy. The official added that yesterday’s operation followed an important operation carried out in October 2017 by BCIJ. The operation, according to Sbik, was carried out based on a lead provided by DGST. During the 2017 operation, authorities arrested 10 people for their ties in an international cocaine trafficking network. BCIJ members also seized 2,588 kilograms of cocaine in different locations: A car registered outside Morocco, a farm located between Temara and Skhirat, another farm in Bouznika, and in Nador in northern Morocco.

Rabat – After Luka Modric won football’s most prestigious individual award on Monday, several football media outlets reported that the votes had been manipulated. In at least one instance, that may be the case. The Ballon d’Or organizer, France Football, listed an alleged Comoros’ football reporter, “Abdou Boina,” as a journalist working for the Albalad Comores newspaper.  However, the journalist does not exist in real life, and the newspaper has been closed for 6 years. Boina voted for Mbappe as his first choice, Modric as his second, Ronaldo as his third, Hazard as his fourth, and Salah as his fifth. A former sports photographer, Toimimou Abdou, who reportedly worked for the paper was quoted as saying that no one called Abdou Boina ever worked there, and the paper shut down in 2012. “I hallucinate when I see that Albalad Comores exists,” he said. In addition, France Football represented Comoros with a flag that is 17 years out of date. Stephane Ahamadi, the president of Comoros’ journalists association, has also commented on the controversy. He stressed, “There is no record of anyone called Abdou Boina.”

Rabat – German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to arrive in Marrakech on December 10 to attend the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Moroccan news outlets said King Mohammed VI will receive Merkel in an audience during her visit in Morocco. Last week, Germany’s government spokeswoman, Martina Fietz, said that Merkel would participate in the migration symposium. In a meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in Berlin last week, Fietz said that Morocco is a major partner in several fields, including migration. The migration pact aims to address humanitarian concerns, human rights, and developmental aspects of international migration. Leaders and officials from more than 100 countries are expected to take part in the symposium. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will also participate in the two-day conference. The UN migration pact seeks to achieve 23 objectives, including measures to improve border management, provide basic services for migrants, eliminate all forms of discrimination against migrants, and achieve sustainable reintegration. The pact also seeks to facilitate the legal migration process, strengthen coordinated international efforts to save migrants’ lives, and reduce environmental and other factors that force people to leave their countries of origin.

Rabat – A source told Morocco World News that on Saturday, members of Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) and Morocco’s General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) dismantled irregular migration networks operating from the southern Atlantic coast of Tangier, between Oued Taddart and Briyech in northern Morocco. The operation also led to the arrest of 68 irregular migrants, including 45 Moroccans and 3 sub-Saharan migrants. Five members of the networks were arrested. Authorities also seized a vehicle used in the transport of migrants, and 2 zodiacs. Earlier this week DGSN and Morocco’s National Criminal Judicial Brigade (BNPJ) dismantled a criminal network involved in irregular migration that operates from Casablanca and northeast Morocco in Oujda and Berkane. The police carried out the dismantling operation simultaneously and arrested 16 individuals. Throughout the year, Moroccan officials have shared the number of aborted irregular migration attempts. In October, the governor and director of immigration and border surveillance, Khalid Zerouali, said that Morocco’s security forces have aborted approximately 65,000 irregular migration attempts annually since 2016. The number has more than doubled from an average of 32,000 annually between 2003 and 2015 to nearly 65,000 since 2016.

Rabat – At an event in Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shared concerns over the violent clashes which erupted on Saturday between demonstrators and law enforcement in Paris.  Speaking at a rally, Erdogan condemned Europe’s failure to uphold democracy and human rights adequately. The Turkish president said he is both against the “chaos ” caused by demonstrators and the “excessive use” of violence by police. Erdogan also denied claims that Islam and refugees are the cause of instability.  In his address, the president said, “Those who provoked hostility against migrants and Islamophobia fell in their own trap.”  “Turkey is against the violence,” Erdogan added. Protesters and French police clashed on Saturday, with France deploying armored cars to face the protests. Protesters set fire to a law enforcement vehicle, which led to further escalation. The yellow vest protests started in November in Paris, but have spread to other European cities, including Brussels. The protesters are denouncing rising fuel taxes and living costs in Europe. About 125,000 demonstrators marched in France as part of the movement. The French government deployed 8,000 police to face Saturday’s protests. Police arrested more than 1,000 protesters yesterday.

Rabat – On Saturday, Paris was rocked by a massive number of protesters, destroying police vehicles with stones and fire. Police, for the first time since the launch of the protest, fired tear gas to disperse protesters. One protester had a different approach to ending the violent demonstrations. Bursting into tears, the woman called for the clashes to end. While wearing a yellow vest, the protester was heard saying, “But look what you do to us! You should be ashamed of yourself…. We don’t even hate you!” As she fell on the ground crying, she exclaimed, “You should be with us for the people, for France, for our homeland, for our nation!” She added that protesters are not carrying arms. Translation: “But look what you do to us! You should be ashamed of yourself…We don’t even hate you!.. You should be with us, for the people, for France, for our homeland, for our Nation!” I wonder if she’s complaining about fuel prices or being replaced by the Third World 🤔 pic.twitter.com/tQ0bYejG9u — Vengeful Jesus (@VJ_Rises) December 3, 2018  Videos of the woman went viral on social media. About 125,000 demonstrators marched in France as part of the yellow vests movement. French Minister of the Interior Christophe Castaner announced that 1,385 protesters have been arrested. “There were 1385 arrests, as I speak, and this number will still increase,” the official said. On Saturday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that Macron was going to propose “measures” to end protests. About 126 suffered injuries on Saturday due to the protests. Nearly 90,000 members of law enforcement were on duty across the country yesterday to respond to clashes. Eight thousand of them were deployed in Paris.

Rabat – Morocco’s BCIJ has arrested seven individuals linked to a criminal network specialized in smuggling cocaine between Morocco, the US, Latin America, and Europe. In line with the arrest on Saturday morning, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) seized a domestic truck loaded with sacks of cocaine paste weighing one ton in total, two rubber boats, two four-wheel-drive cars, a GPS, and a water engine. According to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the criminal network smuggled cocaine by sea on a merchant vessel from Latin America to Moroccan waters, then transported the cocaine to El Jadida, near Casablanca, by a fishing vessel. The traffickers later transported the cocaine loads by land on a truck carrying vegetables. The BCIJ arrested the alleged criminal mastermind behind the cocaine trafficking, in addition to the seven accomplices who have criminal records in drug trafficking. The suspects are currently held in custody, undergoing investigations under the supervision of the public prosecutor. Authorities seek to determine whether the criminal network has links to a bigger crime organization in South America.  This is the second biggest operation conducted by Morocco’s BCIJ in recent years. In October 2017, Moroccan authorities dismantled an international drug trafficking ring in possession of over 2.5 tons of cocaine.  Drug trafficking continues to be an issue in Morocco, especially the movement of psychoactive drugs and cannabis, or hash, which are popular in the illegal drug market. Morocco’s report on the implementation of criminal policy announced in July that authorities recorded 85,000 cases of drug-related crimes in 2017. Drug cases resulted in the arrest of 74,573 suspects in 2012, while 88,179 suspects of drug-related crimes were arrested in 2016.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Congolese author In Koli Jean Bofane addressed an intimate gathering at Rabat’s Bistrot du Pietri on Thursday, November 29. Bofane’s 2018 book “La Belle de Casa” recounts the murder of a young Congolese woman on the streets of Casablanca. “I knew Rabat, I knew Marrakech, I didn’t know Casablanca,” said the Belgium-based writer, describing his thoughts before beginning the book. “Casablanca is a city of the twenty-first century with its turpitudes: the rich are very rich and the poor are very poor.” Bofane first encountered Casablanca in twenty-first century fashion via Google Maps, exploring the city’s streets and neighborhoods through the computer. After completing the first 160 pages of “La Belle de Casa” from Belgium, he relocated to Casablanca, where he spent three months living in the city’s “quartier Cuba” and walking the streets where his novel takes place. “For writers, [everything] starts with intuition,” he said. Speaking to Morocco World News, Bofane reflected on what he referred to as “literary analysis,” or a mode of reflection and inspection beyond the day to day snapshots which other media provide. “Literature is a tool to express more,” he said. “We have the time to elaborate and study things close up, to really reflect. It’s really a question of time in some ways.” When Ichrak, a beautiful young Congolese woman, is discovered dead, all of the “Derb Taliane” neighborhood ignites with suspicion and gossip. The novel opens as another young Congolese immigrant, Sese, reports the murder in a spartan police station, where policemen are playing dominos and “waiting for a crime to be committed.” Although the novel’s opening sentence announces a murder, the author was emphatic that “La Belle de Casa” is not a police novel. Ichrak’s death sparks a subsequent police inquiry and a deeper look at the various characters and societal forces implicated in her death. The intersections of poverty, racism, and gender feature prominently in “La Belle de Casa,” and they also are themes the author grappled with in earlier works, such as “Pourquoi le lion n’est plus le roi des animaux” (1996) and “Mathématiques congolais” (2008). Additionally, the theme of diaspora and global migration are central to Bofane’s writing. He was born in 1954 in Mbandaka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to the political turmoil in protracted sectarian violence, Bofane now lives in Belgium with his family. Bofane also noted that Morocco is a nation of diaspora, as over 5.5 million Moroccans are estimated to live abroad. However, Morocco is now positioning itself as a transit and destination country for trans-African migrants.  “We need a country like Morocco on the African continent,” he said. Contemporary Moroccan photographer Hassan Hajjaj took the photograph on the book’s cover. Hajjaj’s pattern-rich, color-saturated style reflects a hybridity of North African and African traditions, similar to those expressed in “La Belle de Casa.” The event was coordinated with the Casablanca-based bookstore, Livremoi, which hosted a similar conversation with Bofane one night earlier, on November 28. A plaque in the cafe’s enumerates the other authors who have graced Pietri’s previous literary panels, including the celebrated Moroccan writer Tahar Ben Jelloun.

Rabat – While Paris police arrested over 300 yellow vests in central Paris earlier today, Belgian police have arrested around 70 people in different areas in Brussels, Ilse Van De Keere, spokesperson of Brussels police, told AFP. Keere reported that around 400 protesters gathered in front of the Belgian prime minister’s office, calling on Prime Minister Charles Michel to resign while smashing traffic lights and street signs in the area.  The police set barricades to block entry to the minister’s office, but failed to contain resolute protesters, who destroyed police vehicles, throwing stones and flares.  Police also used barricades to block access to the European Parliament. For the first time, Paris police used tear gas against the protesters on Saturday, whereas Belgium police used pepper spray to disperse the protesting crowd. 
The movement that started in Paris on November 17 to protest an unpopular tax on fuel proposed on France’s national budget has morphed into a series of anti-government demonstrations, calling for French President Emmanuel Macron to resign.  In recent weeks, the anti-government mood has spread to Belgium and the Netherlands. The increasing violence initiated by the yellow vests in Paris prompted government officials to suspend the fuel tax proposal.

About 8,000 police officers are currently on duty in the French capital to prevent more violence.

Rabat – Three girls, two boys and a woman who had accompanied her daughter to the disco, died in the incident overwhelmed by the crowd on Saturday, reported the Italian news agency ANSA. The teenagers were aged between 14 and 16 and the woman was 39. Over 100 other people were injured, including 13 with serious injuries, officials said. People reportedly panicked and ran for the exit of the disco, in a small town of Corinaldo, after a substance similar to pepper spray was spread inside. Over 1,000 people are thought to have attended the Lanterna Azzurra nightclub where Italian rapper Sfera Ebbasta was staging a concert around 1 a.m. local time.  The number of attendees exceeded the capacity of the disco. “The tickets sold are about 1,400 for a capacity of about 870 people,” said Italy’s head prosecutor Ancona Monica Garulli. Witnesses to the incident said they smelled an “acrid odour” and that the exit doors were blocked as people tried to escape. “At one point we started to cough, the air was missing like when there is a fire, and we all went to the exit. There were boys who fell in the crush, overwhelmed by others who ran,” ANSA quoted one of the boys present at the disco as saying. #Corinaldo (AN) #8dic 1:00, squadre #vigilidelfuoco impegnate nel soccorso in una discoteca. Forse per la dispersione di una sostanza urticante, ragazzi fuggono per il panico calpestandosi. Sei purtroppo quelli deceduti, decine feriti pic.twitter.com/NvII0jD7oe — Vigili del Fuoco (@emergenzavvf) December 8, 2018  Another witnesses said, “We were dancing while waiting for the concert to begin when we smelt an acrid odour … we ran towards the exit but found it locked, a bouncer told us to go back.” “We saw bodies lying on the ground, covered with white sheets and a man wandering around like a sleepwalker … He kept saying ‘my daughter is dead’ …”, said another witness, a woman whose 14-year-old daughter was among the injured. But authorities have denied parts of witnesses’ account of the incident, the Guardian reported. Oreste Capocasa, Ancona’s police chief, said that the club’s exit door was not closed, casting doubt on claims by a number of witnesses, including teenagers and parents who were among the attendees and reported to have run to a locked exit.  “The barriers at the exit fell. People fell and crushed by the crowd,” Capocasa told RaiNews24 on Saturday morning. Ebbasta said on Instagram: “I’m deeply saddened by what happened last night in Corinaldo… I don’t want to make judgment about this, but I would just like to ask everyone to stop and think how dangerous and stupid it can be to use pepper spray in a disco.” The Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini was the first to express his condolences to the victims, ANSA reported.

Rabat – The Yellow Vest protestors, whose anti-Macron demonstrations have reached an unprecedented scale of violence, have taken French authorities by surprise. The yellow vests are denouncing President Macron’s apparently pro-rich policies and the high cost of living. Using tear gas for the first time on the protesters, French police managed earlier today to restore relative order in Central Paris, according to France24. “We have already detained 481 people in Paris, of whom 211 people have been placed under arrest,” France’s Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said.
 Fearing that the riots would turn more violent on the third weekend of the Yellow Vest protests, police fired tear gas shots, the newspaper explained. French authorities decided to close major monuments and sites in the city including the Eiffel Tower, Louvre and Orsay Museums, Grand Palais, and opera houses. Music shows were also cancelled. Thousands of “Yellow Vests” named after the high-visibility jackets worn by French drivers, started street protests November 17 in Paris, due to an unpopular tax on fuel proposed in France’s national budget.  The increasing violence initiated by the Yellow Vests pushed government officials to suspend the fuel tax proposal.

About 8,000 police officers are on duty in Paris to avoid the break out of more violence.  On Friday protesters proceeded to set vehicles on fire during late night riots. Last Saturday, protesters looted shops, smashed cars, and defaced Triomphe monument with graffiti.  Four people have died since the beginning of the protests. Claiming to have been spurred by Macron’s “arrogance” and contempt for poor and low-income France, protesters said they are willing to spend Christmas and the New Year calling for Macron to step down as president. “I’m prepared to spend Christmas protesting at this roundabout with my children – we won’t back down and we’ve got nothing to lose,” the Guardian quoted a 41-year old protester as saying. “He gave good speeches and I really believed his promises that he would change France. But not any more,” the protestor continued, hinting at the general mood of disappointment and despair among the majority of poor-income French people. “I think we’ve got to the point of no return,” said another. Before Macron rose to political prominence, he explained, “there were the rich, the middle and the poor.” Following Macron’s ultra-liberal policies, however,  “ it’s the very rich and the poor, nothing in between.” According to recent opinion poll, Macron’s perceived pro-rich policies have made him outright unpopular with the French people. Even former pro-Macron voters have expressed dissatisfaction, claiming that the president has betrayed the values and policies he appeared to espouse during his presidential campaign.  Only 18% of French now favor Macron, according to the opinion poll.

Rabat – Angelo Fillipini, 74 and native of Como, northern Italy, has been the subject of a long-standing search warrant. But decades-long efforts from Italian law enforcement agencies proved insufficient until recently, Italian newspaper La Provincia Di Como reported. As a member of the “Ndranghetisa Spinella-Ottina” clan, Filippini made a fortune from illicit activities that entailed receiving and storing large quantities of heroin. These activities cost the fugitive a sentence of 11 years and seven months. To make police lose track of him, Filippini relocated to Morocco‘s Temara, in the vicinity of Rabat, Morocco’s capital. While in Temara, the Italian started a real estate business, starting a whole new life to escape from both Italian and Moroccan law enforcement.  After more than two decades living with as a real state agent, the Italian fugitive was only identified earlier this year thanks to a cooperative investigation by Moroccan and Italian police.  Arrested last April, Filippini was extradited to Italy Wednesday, 5 December, escorted by staff of the SCIP – Service for International Police Cooperation of Morocco’s Department of Public Security.

Rabat – Guterres “will be traveling to Marrakech, Morocco over the weekend where he will attend the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration on 10 and 11 December,” announced UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a Friday briefing. Dujarric said that 135 countries have informed the UN they will be  attending the Marrakech conference, suggesting their commitment to the UN Global Pact to regulate international migrations. “We also expect more of them to register on the first day of the conference,” the UN spokesperson added. In July, 192 UN member states, except the US, approved the global migration pact, which aims “to better manage  international migration, address its challenges, and strengthen migrants’ rights while contributing to sustainable development.” Although a number of countries have withdrew from the pact, UN Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour has expressed confidence in the future of an international pact on migration.   Arbour, who arrived in Marrakech earlier this week to attend the 11th Global Forum on Migration and Development, will chair the Marrakech intergovernmental conference. The US, Italy, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Israel, Latvia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Switzerland, are the countries whose governments have so far declined to join the UN pact. However, the UN hopes that some of the reluctant countries, still in the consideration phase, may be convinced to later join the pact. The pact is not legally binding after its formal adoption. “This is about helping countries manage migration. This is about reaffirming the rights of countries to obviously control their own borders. It seems to defy logic to see how you can manage migration without having a global conversation,”  Dujarric said Friday. Guterres will officially launch the Migration Network at the Marrakech conference. On December 10, the UN secretary general will also participate in a high-level event to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights along with several former High Commissioners for Human Rights. , The intergovernmental conference in Marrakech for the adoption of the UN migration compact represents a platform for cooperation and a positive change in the way that migration policies and challenges are approached.

Rabat – Verizon Wireless just expanded their services to 54 additional countries, including Morocco, offering its customers data usage outside of its coverage area. The company only mentioned 5 countries, namely Qatar, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya.  The telecom provider has just enabled its American customers to use their smartphones to access to Internet, make calls, and texting, the same way as home. Billed at $ 10 a day, customers can benefit from 24 hour connection sessions with a total volume of 500 MB. Once the Internet volume is consumed, customers can purchase a second pack of 500 MB.  On days when the internet is not used, the 10 dollars will not be charged. The roaming fee can be reduced to half if traveling to Mexico or Canada.  Verizon revealed that 33 countries can be concluded in the Internationally Monthly Plans. This means that users will be billed monthly rather than daily. With this new expansion, Verizon now has coverage in 185 countries around the world.  To activate the TravelPass service, the customer must send the word “Travel” by SMS to 4004, or online or via the carrier’s application.

Rabat – Corruption costs Morocco two percent of its economic growth annually, said Lahcen Daoudi, Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of General Affairs and Governance on Thursday. “We are determined in our fight against corruption that costs Morocco’s economy a two percent annual loss,” he told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) during the closing of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The forum’s theme,  “Reinforcing Business Integrity in Morocco,” aims to raise awareness about the importance of finding means to eradicate corruption in Morocco through new programs with the help of private sector companies. The president of OECD in the MENA region, Nicole Illerman, said that the forum is based on OECD’s program devoted to strengthening integrity in the Moroccan business sectors.  The OECD organization’s country program for Morocco was signed on 15 June 2015.  Morocco will consider strengthening its strategic partnership with OECD to become the first country in the MENA region to benefit from an OECD Country Program. The MENA-OECD Initiative covers Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In July 2017, the US State Department released a report identifying corruption and ineffective management as Morocco’s biggest concerns that hamper its economic growth. The report emphasized that the country’s development plans and efforts are considerably limited by corruption and inefficient management. In July 2018, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that that corruption wastes approximately seven percent of Morocco’s GDP every year, suggesting that the most effective way to deal with Morocco’s enduring economic and social problems is to fight corruption in public administration. One of Morocco’s most recent anti-corruption initiatives include the anti-corruption hotline launched in May 14. In the same month, the Public Prosecution Office in the Ministry of Justice reported that it had registered 599 calls from witnesses reporting different forms of corruption. The initiative comes in line with the government’s national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050. Morocco improved slightly in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2017, compared to 2016, owing to the government’s efforts to counter administrative corruption, abuse of power, and public funds mismanagement.

Rabat – More than 100 state leaders and representatives will gather at the UN Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the “Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration” in Marrakech on December 10 and 11. UN Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour said she is “very confident” on the future of an international pact on migration, although a number of countries have chosen not to adopt it, reported AFP. In July, the UN member states approved the global migration pact, which aims “to better manage  international migration, address its challenges, and strengthen migrants’ rights while contributing to sustainable development.” However, some countries, including the US, Italy, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Israel, Latvia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Switzerland, have declined to join the UN pact or are still in the consideration phase. “I am very confident: a large number of states continue to keep their word, they reached agreement on July 13 in New York after very serious and very intense negotiations,” Arbour told AFP. “The countries dropping out of the process today had, after all, obtained concessions during the negotiations, and I must admit that I find it a little surprising.” The UN migration accord contains 23 objectives including the facilitation of legal migration process, strengthening coordinated international efforts to save migrants’ lives, and reducing environmental and other factors that force people to leave their countries of origin. The document also includes proposed measures and actions regarding improving border management, providing  basic services for migrants, eliminating all forms of discrimination against migrants, and sustainable reintegration. Since some countries have refrained from being part of the migration pact, Arbour believes that their move will affect their foreign policy. “I think that their foreign policy and the spirit of multilateralism is pretty seriously affected if they, in a sense, disengage from a document that they’ve agreed to just a few months ago. So, I think it reflects very poorly on those who participated in what were actual negotiations,” Arbour told UN News. For Gotz Schmidt-Bremme, German co-chair of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), the UN compact is a “controversial text,” but “migration requires an international approach.” “Perhaps the benefits of legal migration have been over-exposed by forgetting the challenges. We have underestimated the needs of communities who especially want to see migrants integrate” and “are worried about illegal migration,” Schmidt-Bremme told AFP this week in Marrakech ahead of the GMFD conference. Human rights defenders find the pact insufficient, especially on migrants’ access to humanitarian aid and basic services or the rights of migrant workers, AFP reported. While some critics see the UN migration pact as an encouragement to uncontrolled migration or an attack on national sovereignty, Arbour attributed criticism of the agreement to a “very bad understanding of the text.” “It must be read after all, it’s a very long and detailed text—or based on ignorance or bad faith because when we hear constantly that this pact is damaging to the sovereignty of states, we must really ask ourselves what document have they been reading!” Arbour stressed. The pact, according to Arbour, explicitly expresses that “the sovereignty of states is the cornerstone of migration policy. How can we imagine that almost 190 states gathered in New York inadvertently abandoned their sovereignty and their national interests?” It clearly “acknowledges that no State can address migration alone, and upholds its sovereignty and its obligations under international law,” according to the UN. The approval of the global migration compact is not legally binding for countries. The most recent former president of the General Assembly, Miroslav Lajcak, made similar statements about the UN accord. The compact “does not encourage migration, nor does it aim to stop it,” Lajcak said in July. “It does not dictate. It will not impose. And it fully respects the sovereignty of States.” While people around the world have been migrating throughout history, the world has seen a major upsurge in migration in the recent years. According to the UN, there are over 258 million migrants around the world living outside their home countries, representing 3.4 percent of the world’s population, up 2.7 percent since 2000. As migration is expected to increase in the future, the world hopes for a better life and dignity for all migrants.  The intergovernmental conference in Marrakech for the adoption of the UN migration compact represents a platform for cooperation and a positive change in the way that migration policies and challenges are approached.

Washington D.C. – United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his personal envoy have reached an important milestone in the political process. For the first time in more than six years, they were able to hold a roundtable attended by all parties—Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania. Horst Kohler has, therefore achieved in 14 months what his predecessor was unable to accomplish in nine years. Unlike the nine informal talks former personal envoy, Christopher Ross, held with Morocco and Polisario, this roundtable has also included Algeria and Mauritania. However, given Algeria’s insistence that it is not a party to the conflict and Morocco’s firm position that no progress can be made until Algeria takes a key role in direct negotiations, this roundtable is unlikely to result in any substantial progress. Algeria keeps dodging its responsibility Morocco has responded favorably to the Security Council’s request for the parties to enter into serious negotiations to reach a political solution. A clear indication of this was King Mohammed VI’s express invitation to Algeria to engage in serious negotiations and consultations during his Green March speech on November 6. But although Morocco has shown willingness to engage in the UN-led political process, Algeria does not want to negotiate with Morocco a face-saving political formula that would preserve all parties’ interests while maintaining regional stability. Influential members of the Security Council are well aware of Morocco’s long-held position that no political solution is possible unless Rabat and Algiers reach a compromise, since the latter is the Polisario’s principal backer. Algeria has not responded to the Moroccan request. Instead, to sabotage King Mohammed VI’s dialogue initiative and dodge its responsibilities, it has called for a meeting of foreign ministers of the Arab Maghreb countries. Algeria called for the meeting although it is common knowledge that it has weakened the Maghreb Union for many years by prolonging the Western Sahara conflict through its continuous defense of Polisario and the consequent breakdown of relations with Morocco. In addition to not responding to Morocco’s invitation, immediately after the Security Council adopted Resolution 2440, Algeria concluded a contract with the US public relations firm Keene Consulting, owned by David Keene. Having previously worked for Algeria, Keene is a close friend to US National Security Advisor John Bolton. The move reveals Algeria’s intention to undo the progress Morocco has made in the Security Council over the past two years. Algeria knows that Morocco has gained positive momentum recently through the firm language against Polisario in the Security Council resolutions on the Western Sahara. The recent resolution has called on the Polisario to refrain from taking actions that could destabilize the region or change the status quo in the area east of the Moroccan defense wall, including Bir Lahlou and Tifariti, which Polisario claims falls within its “liberated territories.” Morocco’s momentum is also evident in the inclusion of Algeria in a Security Council resolution on the Western Sahara for the first time since 2002 and the beginning of the political process. Such a mention is a rebuttal to Algeria’s claims that it is not a party to the conflict. Although the resolution did not expressly designate it as a principal party to the conflict, Algeria is aware that the new language of the Security Council resolution could open the way to more changes in the language of future resolutions and the overall position of the Security Council. That the statement of the UNSG spokesperson issued Tuesday makes no distinction for the first time between Morocco, the Polisario Algeria, and Mauritania is very telling about the current dynamics in the Security Council. Business as usual The Geneva meeting has been just another occasion for the parties to show political commitment to the Security Council, while restating their long-held positions. Accordingly, no substantial progress will come out of it in the foreseeable future. Rather the next few months will bring more competition between Morocco and Algeria to win over the support of the Trump administration and members of the US Congress. The Algerian government’s hiring of Keene Consulting and Foley Hoag—a PR firm that has been working for Algeria for more than two decades—indicates that it is doubling down on efforts to derail Morocco’s attempts to establish Algeria as a principal party to the conflict. Aware of the influence of National Security Advisor, John Bolton, in the Trump administration and his previous positions on the conflict, Algeria rushed to hire a lobbyist who has close ties to him. Algeria seeks to prevent any further progress that could serve Morocco’s interests in the coming months. Because the conflict does not affect US national security and is not on the Trump administration’s priority agenda, the US public and congress members are mostly uneducated about the political and historical facts and geopolitical implications of the conflict, a factor that Algeria has exploited for four decades to advance its agenda. Algeria has sought to attract the sympathy of members of Congress, particularly senators, towards Polisario, pushing the narrative that it defends the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination. Morocco must, therefore, redouble its efforts to persuade the Trump administration and Congress to pressure Algiers to fully assume its responsibilities. Rabat should also use Algiers’ contract with David Keene as proof of its direct involvement in the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria is the only country that politically, financially, militarily, and diplomatically supports Polisario. It spends huge amounts of money on public relations firms to influence the position of the US government on the conflict. More than ever, Morocco needs to use the media to its advantage to get the message across to the Washington political establishment, educate influential political and media circles about the conflict and increase its outreach efforts to the Congress and US officials to counteract Algeria’s narrative and expose its role in perpetuating the conflict.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – The Youth for Africa and Sustainable Development Goals (YAS!) Is a movement starting in Africa to connect North and West African youth interested in business. YAS! “supports the development and growth of youth entrepreneurship in Africa,” according to the organization’s site.  The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Fortune 500 company Accenture created the organization. YAS! intends to connect youth with businesses, mentors, and investors, all in one convenient location. The site offers youth four main pillars to accomplish their missions: learning, mentorship, financial education, and opportunities.  UNDP regional director Lamin Momodou Manneh predicts YAS! will aid in accelerating business growth in Africa. As Africa’s population grows, the business industry on the continent is also expected to grow exponentially. Although Africa has been historically exploited for its plethora of resources, businesses have begun to invest in developing the African business environment. BMCE Bank held its 4th African Entrepreneurship Award in Casablanca this year, seeking startups from around the country to fund. YAS! Is scheduled to open next Monday in Lagos, Nigeria. But the website will delay its public opening until the 12th to give investing businesses, mentors, and stakeholders the ability to connect and participate in introductory workshops.  YAS! is a creative new solution to bring North and West Africans into the business world, and allow businesses the chance to invest early in many of the revolutionary ideas from the region that struggled to find an audience before.

Rabat – When a Moroccan man, allegedly residing abroad, went to book a room at the hostel in Marrakech he found out that as a Moroccan he was not allowed in. The visitor secretly recorded a video of his conversation with the hostel receptionist, not showing either of their faces. Their conversation went as follows: “You will not accept any Moroccans here?” asked the visitor. “Yes, because, we Moroccans are nasty, we do not know how to behave…Europeans, on the other hand, are remarkable” the receptionist stated. The receptionist informed him that Moroccan guests staying at the hostel in the past had caused many incidents, adding that he was only obeying his boss’s orders.  When the visitor asked him if his boss was a foreigner, he said “yes.”  “He is a foreigner yet he is making his own law in [Morocco] that is not his country,” the visitor argued. Francophone media outlet AJ+ received the video, recorded on November 30. 
The footage stirred controversy on Facebook and Twitter. The act was condemned as racist by many Moroccans.  Others pointed out that “racist door policy,” can be found in many big cities around the world and recounted their experiences, giving examples of clubs and hotels in Tunisia or Cote d’Ivoire’s Abidjan who do not welcome the countries’ nationals. The hostel manager provided Morocco World News with Kaktus Hostel’s side of the story. He claimed that  the man who recorded the video was actually a journalist who took advantage of the receptionist’s inexperience to spark controversy The hostel manager explained that the hostel, rather than being “racist,” is merely abiding by the law that prohibits an unmarried man and woman to live under the same roof. He justified the policy by explaining that since the hostel has mixed dorms, it cannot violate the law and host Moroccans because “ there are a lot of laws in Morocco that apply for Moroccans but not for tourists, and which we do not necessarily agree with,” he stated, giving article 490 of the penal code as an example. Article 490 of the Penal Code punishes all out-of-marriage sexual relationships with imprisonment from one to three months and a fine of MAD 2000 to 20,000. The manager said that it is the same with Moroccan university dorms, there are separate female dormitories and male dormitories. “If you don’t provide any marriage certificate then we cannot accept you. It’s not because we are racist but because we do not want to do something against the law,” he told MWN. Kaktus Hostel has a high score on Tripadvisor and welcomes tourists from all around the world. The hostel description reads: “We wanted to create an economical and socially responsible hostel. Kaktus Hostel is more than just a simple accommodation for travelers; it is a place of experimentation into sustainable development, as well as a place for artists and culture to thrive.”

Rabat  – A public high school in Eastern Morocco is planning a new contest that will bring students across Morocco together. Sijilmasa high school in Errachidia, calls it the “Sijilmasa Challenge,” and they hope the idea will spread across Morocco.  Naaim Elhoussaine, a teacher at the school, developed the challenge because he   wanted his students to improve their self-confidence and language skills using what they have learned in class. The competition will have a central question or prompt that students will need to discuss. This year, the topic of conversation will be “If you were a leader, what would you do to make a better future for your country?” Students will have to film themselves asking another English-speaking Moroccan the question and take part in a five-minute conversation about the topic. Competitors will then have to send their videos to the official Sijilmasa high school email. The competition is a tool for public educators to work around the fewer resources they have per student compared to private schools.  The Moroccan public school system has long been accused of resource mismanagement, and as private schools become more popular, students are seeing differences in education qualities based on socioeconomic conditions.  One of the areas public schools lack in is developing the English communication skills its students need. The Sijilmasa Challenge plans to continue every year, giving Moroccan students in the public system an opportunity to develop effective English communication, in addition to promoting critical thinking about issues in Moroccan society.  The competition began on December 1st and will close on the 31st. Interested students are encouraged to check the school’s website for additional information about the contest.

Rabat – Parties represented at the roundtable held on December 5-6 in Geneva showed initiative to engage further in similar talks that will possibly lead to the negotiations needed to find an agreed on and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Observers and analysts, however, expressed doubts over whether Algeria will finally admit its role in the conflict. While the UN called on all four parties to the conflict to work constructively with UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler, Algerian media, including TSA, insists that the roundtable meeting merely concerned Morocco and Polisario, with the participation of Mauritania and Algeria. When referring to the roundtable, the news outlet described it as simply being “between Morocco and the Polisario Front, which is attended by Mauritania and Algeria,” thus minimizing the role they play as a party to the conflict. Sahrawis, including former Polisario members, are aware of Algeria’s role in the four-decade long conflict. Sahrawi activist and Polisario critic Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud has condemned Algeria’s ignorance regarding the issues  Sahrawis face in Tindouf camps. The former Polisario member also called on Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the UN-led political process. Mustafa Salma shared his concerns with Morocco World News, posing a question to Bouteflika’s government: “In their opinion, what is the solution? referring to the Western Sahara conflict and the struggle of Sahrawis in Tindouf Camps. Independence of Western Sahara is Unfair to Morocco “What is Algeria’s proposal as the world is demanding a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict?” asked Salma. The activist, who is known for his criticism towards Algeria and Polisario, also lambasted the former head of the Algerian foreign affairs committee of the national assembly, Ibrahim Boulahia. On Wednesday, during a live broadcast on Al Hurra television channel, Boulahia repeated his country’s claims that the Western Sahara conflict should be solved between Morocco and Polisario. Invited to the broadcast, Western Sahara expert Samir Bennis argued that while Algeria denies its role in the conflict, the eastern neighbor arms, and hosts Sahrawis. Bennis emphasized the unbearable living conditions in the Tindouf camps, where thousands of Sahrawis are held captive. Commenting on Bennis’ statement, Boulahia asked: “how could it be possible for a country to incarcerate more than 60,000 or 70,000 of Sahrawis?” Criticizing Boulahia’s argument, Mustafa Salma: “what is [Algeria’s] proposal, knowing that the independence of [Western Sahara] will damage the interests of 40 million Moroccan.”  He added, “Is it reasonable to satisfy 60,000 or 70.000 thousand at the expense of 40 million? This is unfair.” According to Salma, Morocco is accepting to engage in further talks to confirm its firm position that it will never accept a solution that would damage its territorial integrity project. Morocco, for Salma, is “open to all proposals that would satisfy everyone.” But, Algeria is not making an effort to end the conflict. Salma concluded his statement to Morocco World News with a rhetorical question “What does Algeria want from Morocco?” referring to its unwillingness to cooperate and engage in the frank and a direct dialogue needed to end the conflict. Kohler is wise enough to keep tension at minimum Following Geneva’s roundtable of talks, Salma said that Kohler has been “smart” to reduce tension between the parties to the conflict. In a Facebook post, Salma expressed his disappointment over the outcomes of the first roundtable held between the parties to the conflict since 2012. The activist also doubted that Kohler will find a solution to the conflict, although the former President of Germany knows how to calm the tension over the conflict. Kohler created the idea of a roundtable that brings the parties together under one roof. Salma added that “The roundtable was also created with an ideal timing to avoid the pressure of the Security Council and the headache of the parties.”. At the end of the roundtable in Geneva yesterday, Kohler expressed his intention to invite the parties to the conflict to a meeting in the first three months next year. He confirmed that all parties are positive about the prospective invitation for further talks. Kohler also said that a “peaceful” solution to the Western Sahara conflict is “possible.”  Commenting on Kohler’s roundtable plan, Salma said that “the idea of a roundtable seeks to make us forget about April’s meetings,” referring to the Security Council meeting to adopt UN resolutions for the conflict. “Kohler invented the idea of a roundtable to convene the concerned parties in what it seems to be negotiations- which meet the expectations of the Maghreb peoples, and whose leaders attended,” argued Salma. According to Mustafa Salma, the UN’s roundtables and meetings represent a policy of distraction. “When we will get bored [by the roundtable idea] as we did about April’s meetings, the international community will think, without hesitation, of inventing another formula that will distract us until we firmly realize that the solution is in our hands.”

Rabat – According to the document, Morocco lost an average of $174.019 million per year between 1998 and 2017 due to climate hazards, impacting its gross domestic product in the same period.  Meanwhile, the Global Climate Index ranks the country in the same position as many others, including Namibia, Mauritius, Malta, Mali, Maldives, Luxembourg, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Qatar.   Germanwatch, an NGO that seeks to influence public policy on trade, the environment and relations between the Global North and South, studied the climate risks of 180 countries this year.

Rabat – African Football Confederation (CAF) has invited all CAF Member Associations to submit their bid dossier for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations before Friday, December 14. Following the withdrawal of hosting rights of the Total Africa Cup of Nations 2019 (AFCON) from Cameroon, on November 30, the CAF presented an update on Thursday regarding the approval process for a new host country.   CAF requirements are as follows:    CAF will make further statements when appropriate.   Local and international news outlets have been speculating that Morocco might replace Cameroon, althoughSouth Africa might also try and clinch the hosting rights. Several Moroccan sports officials denied Morocco’s intention to replace Cameroon, repeatedly stating that Morocco supports Cameroon’s bid. But after their failure to get ready in time, Morocco could be a possible option. The head coach of Morocco’s national football team, Herve Renard, has publicly stated that he believes that Morocco meets all the requirements to host the African event.

Rabat – Senegalese national Pape Diouf did not hold back in voicing his displeasure at the CAF, particularly towards the Moroccan president. He accused CAF president Ahmad of being “a puppet of Moroccans,” after the federation agreed to move the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations from Cameroon to a new country. Although the new country has not been determined yet, Diouf has already displayed his displeasure at the decision. The CAF stated that Cameroon lost its spot to host the cup because the country was not prepared. This conclusion came after inspectors visiting Cameroon discovered a lot of the venues planned to host the game weren’t constructed yet. In addition, the Cameroonian government has had security issues in the country that it has failed to control. The country’s military has battled the militant group Boko Haram for the past four years and has struggled to control the northern portion of the country where the terrorist group conducts its operations, according to the International Crisis Group. In addition, the country has also had a resurgence of violence between the country’s English speaking population and the majority Francophone population. An incident earlier this year led to 17 deaths, according to News24. Egypt, one of the other Arab countries participating in the CAN, also seemed to support Morocco as the new host. A spokesman for Egypt’s football league announced Egypt “will not compete with another Arab country,” according to French football site Goal. This leaves the door wide open for Morocco to successfully win the bid with little competition, and will possibly strengthen Morocco’s tripartite bid with Spain and Portugal to host the 2030 World Cup as well.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – On Thursday, a resolution sponsored by the US condemning the militant group Hamas for its attacks on Israel, failed to pass at the UN General Assembly. The United States and Israel led an aggressive campaign to pass the resolution. While the resolution won a majority, it failed to obtain the two-thirds backing required. The vote was 87 to 57, with 33 abstentions. Before the vote, Arab nations needed two-thirds majority for approval of the resolution, instead of the simple majority supported by the United States. The 193-member body narrowly passed the requirement, ultimately leading to the failure of the resolution. The US lobbied aggressively to persuade Arab states to break from their routine backing the Palestinian position, and instead to vote in support of the resolution. US Envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, pleaded with Arab states before the vote.  “I want to take a personal moment and ask my Arab brothers and sisters — is the hatred that strong?” Haley said. “Is the hatred toward Israel so strong that you’ll defend a terrorist organization? One that is directly causing harm to the Palestinian people? Isn’t it time to let that go? For true peace and security in the entire region, isn’t it time for both sides to let this go?” The White House envoy, Jason Greenblatt, who is working on the Trump administration’s peace proposal, sent letters to diplomats from Morocco, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, and Oman. “The time has come for all countries to take a stance on whether they are for or against Hamas’ violence,” said the letter.  All Arab states ultimately voted against the resolution. Speaking for the Arab bloc, the Kuwaiti representative expressed disappointment that the US draft resolution failed to mention a two-state solution and focused solely on condemning one party. The draft resolution ignored Israeli actions against Palestinians. Last month, Palestinian rockets fired into Israel. Israeli aircrafts responded through bombing targets in Palestinian territory. The recent flare-up of violence in Gaza prompted an international response, spurring  the desire for potential peace talks. Reactions to the resolution’s failure Although the two-thirds majority was not achieved, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu commended the “sweeping majority of countries” who had stood up against Hamas for the first time. Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, reacted positively to the resolution’s defeat. “The Palestinian presidency will not allow for the condemnation of the national Palestinian struggle,” Abbas said The Israeli envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, criticized the states that voted against the resolution. “Your silence in the face of evil reveals your true colors,” he said. “It tells us what side you are on — the side that does not care about the lives of innocent Israelis and innocent Palestinians who have fallen victim to the terrorists of Hamas.” For the first time at the UN, a record 87 countries condemned Hamas for its rocket fire &amp; use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes against Israel. I thank @nikkihaley for her hard work in forming an unprecedented coalition. We will continue to fight for the truth! pic.twitter.com/MBDLERD23y — Ambassador Danon (@dannydanon) 6 décembre 2018   In an official statement, Hamas thanked member states “that stood by our people’s resistance and the justice of their cause.” A spokesman for Hamas, Sami Abu Zahri, also responded to the failed resolution. “The failure of the American venture at the United Nations represents a slap to the US administration and confirmation of the legitimacy of the resistance,” Zahri wrote on Twitter. What is Hamas? Hamas is the largest Palestinian militant group. The group originated in 1987, following the first intifada. While its origins are carrying out the armed struggle against Israel and providing social welfare programs, in 2005, the group began engaging in the Palestinian political process. However, Hamas or parts of Hamas are considered to be a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, EU, and the UK among other powers. Morocco and Israel Morocco has no official diplomatic ties with Israel. However, the connection between Moroccan Jews in Israel and the Jewish community in Morocco is at the core of the Israeli-Moroccan relations. Morocco maintains economic ties, and traded $37 million worth of goods with Israel in 2017, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).

Rabat – After being accused of exploiting user data by Cambridge Analytica, Facebook faces yet another scandal.  On Wednesday, December 5, a British parliamentary committee accused the social network of disclosing users’ personal data to certain companies, with more than 200 pages of internal emails from the US giant supporting the claim. Facebook has been under the watchful eye of this commission for several months as part of an investigation into “fake news”.

The publication of these documents is in the public interest, said Damian Collins, chair of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMSC).

The DCMSC raises important questions regarding how Facebook manages user data, their policies for collaborating with application developers and how they choose to use their dominant role in the social networking market, he added.
 
Facebook “has never sold people’s data” and the documents published on Wednesday “are presented in a very misleading way without any context,” said a Facebook spokesperson contacted by AFP.  The spokesperson cited the changes made by the social network in 2014 and 2015 to prevent the sharing of data from friends of users with application developers.

This is not the first case Facebook has faced, such as accusations of Russian interference on its platform in the 2016 US presidential election, but also the scandal of Cambridge Analytica’s use of user data without their knowledge for political purposes, as well as a security breach that led to the hacking of millions of accounts. “We allege that Facebook itself is the biggest violator of data misuse in the history of the software industry,” said Ted Kramer, owner of Six4Three, a company that sued Facebook, in an interview with CNN last summer.

Rabat – British oil and gas company Sound Energy has kicked off drilling the TE-10, the second of three planned exploration wells in Tendrara region in eastern Morocco, the company announced in a statement on Friday. Located at 25 kilometers northeast the Tendrara’s anticipated production area, “The TE-10 well will test the North East Lakbir prospect in the Company’s Greater Tendrara permit.” The drilling program will take an estimated 30-40 days at a total measured depth of 2,200 meters. Last month, Sound Energy plugged and abandoned the TE-9 well, drilled to a total depth of 2,925 meters, after the company failed to find producible natural gas at the well. The TE-10 well will test the North East Lakbir prospect in the Company’s Greater Tendrara permit and is located approximately 25 kilometers to the northeast of the recently awarded Tendrara production concession. TE-10 will test “a material TAGI stratigraphic trap and a smaller TAGI structural closure,” the company said.  The North East Lakbir has mid case potential of 2.7 trillion standard cubic feet (Tcf) of gas originally in place (GOIP), a 4.5 Tcf GOIP upside case, and a 1.5 Tcf GOIP low case. Sound Energy estimates a success chance of 14 percent. The TE-10 well is located in a smaller structural closure, which has a mid case potential of 128 billion standard cubic feet (Bcf) GOIP, a 210 Bcf GOIP upside case, and a 75 Bcf GOIP low case. The company estimates a success chance of 26 percent. On August 31, Sound Energy signed a new eight-year petroleum agreement with the National Office of Hydrocarbon and Mines (ONHYM) in Tendrara region. In October, the Moroccan finance and energy ministries approved the agreement to drill for oil in Morocco’s eastern Tendrara region. The new petroleum agreement, named “Greater Tendrara Petroleum Agreement,” covers an area of approximately 14,500 square kilometers extending across eastern Morocco and “surrounding the development concession application area relating to the Tendrara gas discovery.”

Football superstar Lionel Messi is now a member of the Beitar Jerusalem fan club. The team’s owner Moshe Hogeg presented Messi with a card during an event in Barcelona on Tuesday, according to the Times of Israel.  Messi is also involved in Hogeg’s tech company Sirin Labs, where he advertises the company’s products like their new phone Finney. Hogeg bought the football team earlier this year, and it seems he has brought Messi along to represent that as well. In the past, Messi has faced scrutiny  several times for his close relationship to Israel. In 2013, Messi and his club team FC Barcelona visited Israel in a peace tour, where a photo emerged of him kneeling at the wall with a Jewish yamaka, drawing criticism from many Arabs that said he was alienating a large amount of his Muslim fanbase with his actions.  Messi also tried to visit Israel again this year with the Argentina national team for a friendly game before the world cup, but it was canceled after fans protested the game because of Israeli actions in Palestine.  International protests grew after a video emerged of a Palestinian football player being shot by Israeli snipers. Messi’s latest involvement with Beitar has already drawn controversy, due to the fan base’s past actions. In 2012, fans of the team marched into a mall in Jerusalem and began assaulting Arab employees, and in 2013 fans of the team protested to the team’s signing of its first two Muslim players. In 2017, an official on the team also stepped down after declaring he would never bring a Muslim player back to Beitar, according to Al-Araby news.  Beitar has responded to these incidents by trying to crack down on racist behavior, threatening to revoke fans’ tickets displaying anti-Arab sentiment. In addition, police have conducted operations against violent, bigoted fans as well. Despite these actions, it seems Beitar’s reputation has become intertwined with its fans actions, and Messi’s allegiance to the team will likely inflame old tensions and continue to alienate a large part of his international fanbase.

Rabat – Morocco will launch its first nationally made nanosatellite at the end of 2019. The nanosatellite will weigh just 960 grams and will be manufactured by a group of students from Dhar El Mahraz University in Fez. The team works under the supervision of professor Mohamed Karim, director of Systems Integration and Advanced Technologies Laboratory. The University of Oujda and Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane also contributed to the project. Morocco World News contacted the professor to learn more about the project, but did not receive a response. Some local media outlets, however, reported that the project would be completed by the end of 2018, while others reported 2019. The first Moroccan-made satellite is a simple cube with a volume of 10 Cubic centimeters and 960 grams. The two previously launched satellites weighed 1,100 kilograms each. The Ministry of Higher Education allocated MAD 108,023 to finance the project.  The nanosatellite will have 1 watt of power, and a lifetime between 6 months and 2 years. It will also includes a camera and will be on an altitude of 650 kilometers. The cube-shaped satellite will have 5 faces covered with a solar plates. The 6th face will carry the transceiver antenna allowing communication with two ground stations in Fez and Ifrane. Its typical mission will either be to observe and measure the terrestrial environment, or to test new technologies in space. On November 21 at exactly 2:42 AM (gmt+1), Morocco launched the second surveillance satellite, Mohammed VI B. It is used mainly for civil purposes including mapping, agricultural monitoring, natural disaster management, as well as border and coastal surveillance. The satellite is capable of turning around the Earth in just 1 hour and 40 minutes, with a lifetime between 15 and 30 years.

Rabat – International news outlets reported on Thursday that the 63-year old, one of  Hezbollah’s top supporters, pleaded guilty in front of a court in Washington, according to the US Justice Department. The US Treasury listed Tajideen as a “specially designated global terrorist” in 2009 for alleged financing to Hezbollah. With the charges against  him, Tajideen might face a five-year prison sentence. Tajideen will also pay a forfeiture of $50 million, the department added. Quoted by US News, Attorney General Matt Whitaker said that the Department of Justice “has put a target on Hezbollah.” He added, “We are going to keep targeting Hezbollah and other terrorist groups and their supporters, and we are going to keep winning.” Morocco’s law enforcement arrested Tajideen in 2017 in Casablanca. The arrest and Morocco’s decision to extradite was an important contributor to Hezbollah. In May, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that tension between Iran and Morocco flared when Morocco arrested Tajideen. He also added that Iran “threatened Morocco to release him. We gave him to the United States and from that day there was a change.” Bourita said that the change “threatens our own security.” Bourita made this statement after Morocco decided to cut ties with Iran on May 1, accusing Iranian ally Hezbollah of delivering military equipment to and training the members of the Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. “This Mr.Tajideen who was captured in Morocco was laundering money in Africa. All the benefits to Iran from Hezbollah are being reinvested in Africa,” Bourita said in an interview with  US news outlet Breitbart News in September. The official added that Tajideen was important to Iran because he was “linking” Iran and its proxy with sub-Saharan countries, especially “West Africa.” The official said that when Morocco proved the alleged Polisario-Hezbollah collusion, Hezbollah members were ordered not to talk “with Lebanese accents but to be more discreet when they are coming” to Tindouf.

Rabat – After Morocco’s agreement to allow US poultry import in August, the US will gain a new access to export its beef into the Moroccan market. The US Trade Representative (USTR) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced Thursday that the Moroccan government “has agreed to allow imports of U.S. beef and beef products into Morocco,” under the terms of the US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA). “New access to the Moroccan market for beef and beef products is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports of U.S. agricultural products,” said Robert Lighthizer, the USTR’s representative. Earlier this year, Morocco also approved the import of Russia’s beef products and Ukraine’s beef and poultry. According to a USDA release, Moroccan imports of  agricultural products from the US exceeded $512 million as of November this year. The Trump administration estimates the North African country would represent an $80 million market for US beef and beef products. “Finding new markets for American agricultural products has been a priority for the Trump Administration from day one, and the opening of the Moroccan market is good news for our producers,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. Perdue made a similar comment when American poultry products gained access to Morocco. “American beef is the best in the world, and once Moroccans get a taste of it, they’ll surely want more,” he said. In August, the USDA announced that Morocco will import US poultry, opening up an estimated “$10 million market.” Morocco’s agriculture ministry stated that imports of poultry meat and poultry products from the US are only frozen products. The ministry imposed health conditions on poultry imports saying, they must be accompanied by a halal slaughter certificate and a health certificate. Concerning the new imports of US beef products, USTR and USDA leaders met with Moroccan officials to discuss “a health certificate and the terms for the import of U.S. high quality and standard quality beef into Morocco,” reads the USDA release. In 2017, the US was the world’s third largest beef exporter, with total revenue of $7.3 billion of global sales of beef and beef products. The new market for poultry and beef could ease the pressure put on the American farmers as many countries such as China, the EU, Mexico, and Canada have been imposing taxes on US agricultural products. The levy was a response to new US tariffs being placed on steel and aluminum against these countries. The poultry and beef deals are a follow-up of the free trade agreement (FTA) between Morocco and the US being implemented, signed June 15, 2004, and effective since January 1, 2006.

Rabat – Last Saturday, riots broke out in Paris due to an unpopular tax on fuel proposed in France’s national budget. Tens of thousands of French citizens held street protests to voice dissatisfaction with France’s increased cost of living.  Protesters vocalized a variety of demands, including cheaper energy costs, lower taxes, higher salaries, better retirement policies, and Macron’s resignation.  Paris saw some of its most violent rioting in decades, leaving four dead, 250 injured, and millions of dollars in damage. The French police also reported that they took 412 people into custody during the weekend. The increasing violence prompted government officials to suspend the fuel tax proposal.  French officials brace for “significant violence” in Paris this Saturday, as activists from the “yellow vest” movement are calling for “Act IV” – a fourth weekend of protest, on social media. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that 89,000 police officers will be on duty and armored vehicles will be stationed in the capital to prevent a repeat of last week’s violent uprisings.  “We are facing people who are not here to protest but to smash and we want to have the means to not give them a free rein,” Philippe told reporters. City authorities say they are increasing protection measures for famous landmarks after the Arc de Triomphe sustained damage in last week’s riots.  According to Culture Minister Franck Riester, the Eiffel Tower, Louvre and Orsay Museums, Grand Palais, and opera houses will close on Saturday. Riester stated in a radio interview, “We cannot take the risk when we know the threat.”

Rabat – A statement from the Ministry of Interior said that the suspects are aged between 24 and 37. The ministry added that the suspects were plotting to undermine the security and stability in the country. Information from Morocco’s General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) made the arrests possible, according to the statement. During the arrest operation, BCIJ members seized several electronic devices, knives, as well as notes and books glorifying terrorism and inciting violence. According to the ministry, the  preliminary investigation revealed that the members of the cell had recruited young people, with the aim of inciting them to carry out serious attacks against the stability and security of citizens. The suspects will be brought before justice after further investigations. Throughout the year, BCIJ  has carried out similar operations across the country. In November, BCIJ reported the arrest of two suspects who were planning a terrorist attack with intent of undermining  the country’s stability. The suspects were arrested in Inezgane and Ait Melloul, southern Morocco. In July, BCIJ officials arrested seven pro-ISIS extremists operating in central Morocco, near Agadir and Marrakech. In the same month, BCIJ arrested four suspects in four Moroccan cities: Casablanca, Nador, Tangier, and Tiznit. The head of BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame said in October that Morocco has dismantled 183 terror cells since 2002. Morocco’s BCIJ is also known for its international cooperation with several countries, including France and Spain.In a recent report, the US Department of State said that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.”

Rabat – According to a press release by the Robotics Innovation Center in Bremen, Germany,  the center will conduct a four-week field test campaign November 14 to December 14, on the northern part of the Moroccan Sahara as part of the European Union’s Strategic Research Cluster (SRC) on Space Robotics Technologies. The overall goal of this strategic research cluster (SRC) is to enable major advances in Europe’s space robotic technologies. The project is a joint collaboration between the European Space Agency (ESA), the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the national space agencies of France, Spain, Italy, and Great Britain.  Inspired by the NASA Mars Sample Return Mission, the field test campaign aims to make use of a recently developed software which enables a rover connected to a robot to cross nsa one-kilometer distance over the Moroccan desert to collect soil samples.  In the process, the rover will have to make his way through the different ground obstacles since the area is known for wide plains, steep slopes, and gorges. The rover has already successfully participated in a simulated space mission in the semi-desert of Utah, USA, in 2016.

Rabat – A peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara is “possible,” the UN special envoy for the Sahara said on Thursday after a two-day round table between the parties in Geneva, the first talks since 2012.

The former German president Horst Kohler, who has been in charge of the issue since 2017, has also announced that he intends to hold a new meeting in the same format in the first quarter of 2019.
 
Kohler told reporters that he was looking forward to inviting delegations to the second round table.

The UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for the Sahara had invited delegations from Morocco, Algeria, Polisario and Mauritania to participate in a round table on December 5 and 6 in Geneva, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2440.

Hailed by the UN as a first step towards a renewed process of negotiations aimed at reaching a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable solution, the Geneva meeting was held in an atmosphere of serious engagement and mutual respect, the UN envoy noted.

Rabat, whose delegation in Geneva was led by foreign minister Nasser Bourita, rejects any solution other than autonomy under its sovereignty, citing the need to preserve regional stability.

The last round of direct negotiations launched by the UN in March 2007 stalled due to disagreements between Morocco and Polisario.

Both Moroccan and sub-Saharan migrants were aboard eight makeshift boats when naval forces discovered them at risk of sinking between Tuesday and Thursday of this week. The Royal Armed Forces (FAR) reported that two of the migrant boats sank soon after the navy helped the immigrants to safety.  The navy units successfully returned the migrants to Ksar Sghir in Tangier, Al Hoceima, and Nador in the Rif region. In a similar rescue operation in November, the navy rescued 136 undocumented migrants aboard inflatable boats near Tangier. The intercepted migrants were also sailing from Nador and Tangier. Late in October, the Moroccan navy intercepted four boats carrying 143 migrants off the coasts of Tangier and Nador. Attempts at irregular migration continue to pressure Moroccan authorities and make headlines in Morocco. In September,  a young Moroccan woman named Hayat died after navy opened fire on a migrant speed boat. Moroccans have protested the harsh measures against migrants, and the government has reported  large numbers of “intercepted immigrants.”

Rabat – The King appointed Bouayach during a royal reception at the Royal Palace in Rabat on Thursday, according to a statement from the Royal Cabinet . Bouayach will replace Driss El Yazami, who has been head of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH) since March 2011. “After recalling the council’s positive contribution to the promotion of human rights in our country,” the King’s decision accompanies efforts to continue “to strengthen and enhance the achievements made by Morocco in this field,” reads the Royal Cabinet statement. The monarch emphasized “the need for the Council, in its new composition and as an independent National Institution, to fulfill the missions assigned to it,” regarding the national mechanism for the prevention of torture, child rights violations, and the protection the rights of people with disabilities. Founded in March 2011, the CNDH is a national institution responsible for the protection and promotion of human rights in Morocco. It replaced the former Advisory Council on Human Rights, which was established in May 1990. The CNDH is accredited as an “A” status NHRI by the International Coordinating Committee (ICC) in accordance with the UN General Assembly’s international standards adopted in 1993. The council publishes annual reports on the situation of human rights and related issues in Morocco. It also monitors and investigates human rights violations and advises on national legislation in accordance with international human rights conventions. Bouayach was appointed Morocco’s ambassador to Sweden in 2016.  Born in 1957 in Tetouan, Bouayach is a human rights activist who has worked with the UN, the African Union and the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network. Known for defending women rights, Bouayach was the first woman to be at the head of major Moroccan  NGO the Moroccan Organization of Human Rights (OMDH), a role which she assumed in 2006.  The newly-elected CNDH president spent two years working with renowned sociologist Fatima Mernissi on Women’s Rights, namely Muslim women’s rights. In 2011, King Mohammed VI appointed Bouayach as a member of the Consultative Commission on Constitutional Reform in the midst of the Arab Spring. The King awarded her the Order of the Throne for her contribution to the Moroccan Constitution. Bouayach has received many awards, including the French Legion of Honour in 2014, for her integrity and constant involvement for human rights. She has a master’s degree in economics from Mohammed V University in Rabat.

Rabat – Students from the Casablanca School of Management (SUPRH) formed a collective group with The Bahri association, a marine environmentalist group. This union is being called “Africologie,” according to local news. The group is planning a massive clean-up operation at Scarabee beach in Casablanca on December 16th. Environmentalists say Scarabee is at a critical level of litter, and as Morocco’s largest city continues to grow, littering will intensify.  The goal of the students is to get at least 1000 students from 13 different universities throughout Morocco to participate, with students from across 12 countries. For the past eight years, Bahri was attempting to clean beaches by itself but the workload has undoubtedly increased as the city grows and tourism increases. Africologie plans to hold annual massive clean up efforts around Africa and promote bonds between Moroccans and other Africans.   Although the activists have gained more followers for their cause, they are still fighting an uphill battle against the littering epidemic that is flooding the country. African news agency ENCA reports that the 2016 ban on plastic bags has done nothing to help, as people still dump waste without a second thought. Currently, only 21 out of 40 beaches qualified to earn the international “Blue Flag” distinction that is awarded to clean, high-quality beaches.  Climate change is a problem that requires international cooperation, and Morocco has tried to take a leading role, hosting the COP 22 UN climate convention in 2016. But, at the same time trash heaps continue piling in the country.  In June, British Ambassador Thomas Reilly criticized the high amounts of waste near the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah dam in Rabat, highlighting the waste issues Morocco still faces internally, while preaching environmentalism externally.

Rabat – Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said “Morocco could become the Czech Republic’s largest economic partner” in Africa, on Wednesday, at the launch of the Czech-Moroccan Business Forum in Casablanca. Morocco and the Czech Republic “are currently discussing cooperation in the automobile, aircraft and armaments industries,” reported Czech Radio. Babis described Morocco, where he lived for five years as a Czech company representative in the past, as crossroads between Europe and Africa. Over the past five years, Czech exports to Morocco have doubled and many Czech companies are operating in Morocco, according to Czech Radio. In 2017, trade between Morocco and the Czech Republic totaled $435 million. In this regard, Babis reaffirmed his country’s determination to strengthen trade with Morocco, the Czech Republic’s second largest partner in Africa, reported Maghreb Arab Press. Babis arrived in Rabat on Tuesday leading a delegation of 37 business leaders, in addition to Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Marta Novakova, State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Miloslav Stasek, and Czech Ambassador to Morocco Hanane Saadi. The head of the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic, Jaroslav Hanak, told Czech Radio that “this was the first time that Prime Minister Babis has travelled with a business delegation outside of Europe.” Babis met the president of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), Salaheddine Mezouar.  Mezouar said that the meeting with Babis will “give new impetus to cooperation between the business communities of both countries.” Czech prime minister also met representatives of different Moroccan investment groups to discuss opportunities in the renewable energy and agricultural sectors.  The head of the local CzechTrade mission, Tamer El-Sibai, said that Morocco plans to invest $30 billion in the energy sector to which the North African country gives special attention, in addition to agriculture and construction. Babis affirmed that Morocco offers “great potential” to investors in many sectors, including the aeronautics and automotive industry. “Since Morocco is the largest automobile producer in Africa, Czech companies could try to become subcontractors,” Babis said. Babis said that he also discussed military cooperation between Morocco and the Czech Republic, noting that Morocco spends up to €4 billion on military technology. According to the Czech Confederation of Industry, Morocco showed great interest in the Czech Technical University’s projects which aims to collect water from humidity in the air. The Czech prime minister informed that a delegation of Moroccan industrialists will later visit the Czech Republic to explore business and investment opportunities in the country.

Rabat – According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Kohler issued a statement after the closing of the roundtable, convening Morocco, Mauritania, Polisario, and Algeria. According to the statement, the delegations agreed that the personal envoy would invite them to a second roundtable in the first quarter of 2019. Kohler’s statement added that the “delegations discussed regional issues and the next steps in the Western Sahara policy process.” According to Kohler, all delegations recognized that cooperation and regional integration “are the best way to address the many important challenges facing the region.“ The delegations also acknowledged that a solution to the Western Sahara conflict will contribute to the improvement of the lives of the people of the region. Following the roundtable, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said in a press conference that the Moroccan delegation, especially Sahrawi members gave presentations about the development projects in the region.   The delegation included President of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid; President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region Ynja Khattat; and Fatima Adli, a member of the Smara municipal council. Bourita, who led the delegation, added that Ynja, Adli and Errachid also explained the role of women and youth as a bridge to end the conflict. Bourita confirmed that Kohler talked about his intention to invite the parties to conflict to a second roundtable that will occur in the first three months of 2019. He added that the participation of Sahrawis in the roundtable had an important influence. Bourita added that Morocco emphasized at the end of the roundtable that “a good spirit to end the conflict is good, but not enough.” He said that there should be an “utter determination to find a solution” to the conflict. While acknowledging that the discussions in Geneva were carried out in an atmosphere of optimism, Bourita said that “we should be certain” that this is  translated into a strong willingness to end the conflict. He concluded that Morocco considers this roundtable “as a test to see whether the parties have the determination to move forward toward a solution.”

Rabat – The Spanish Navy has sailed one of its vessels near the British territory of Gibraltar while blaring the Spanish national anthem. Citizens of the small British territory were surprised to hear “La Marcha Real” playing at full volume as the Spanish corvette sailed by. The Spanish ship allegedly sailed close enough to be considered illegal. However, the Spanish point out that Gibraltar has no territorial waters according to the 1713 Utrecht Treaty.  A video of the Descubierta-class ship Infanta Elena was posted Tuesday by a Gibraltar resident, according to Spanish news outlet The Local. It immediately drew a large amount of criticism from citizens of Gibraltar and the international community. Spanish press were quick to defend the Navy’s actions, however, stating that the commander of Infanta Elena decided to play the Spanish anthem after the British played the UK’s anthem over a radio channel reserved for emergencies.  It is not the first time the British territory has had to deal with Spanish encroachment. In September, the British navy fired several warning shots at a Spanish vessel that got too close to its nuclear submarine the HMS Talent, according to the Dailymail.  A Telegraph report also says the British fired shots at a Spanish ship that got too close to an American submarine. The incidences led to the British creating a permanent response force to ward off the Spanish.  As Brexit comes closer, the future status of Gibraltar has come under question. Spain has always claimed sovereignty over Gibraltar, and as Britain withdraws itself from the rest of Europe, the Spanish are once again interested in the territory. In November, a Spanish government spokeswoman said, “It is clear … that any agreement between the European Union and Britain require the prior approval of Spain, relating to Gibraltar,” according to Reuters. The Spanish navy normally patrols the Strait of Gibraltar to monitor irregular migrants attempting to cross, usually from Morocco.

Rabat – According to the latest report from the Department of Treasury and External Finances (DTFE), the treasury debt reached MAD 715 billion by the end of September, up 4.6 percent from September 2017. Due to spending exceeding revenue, Morocco’s budget deficit for the first three quarters of 2018 was more than MAD 29 billion. The report noted that with MAD 715 billion in debt, the treasury’s total debt represents 67.3 percent of the 2017 GDP. The 2018 GDP data is not yet available.  Meanwhile, debts of enterprises and public companies in the country are estimated at MAD 178 billion as of June 2018.  The report forecasts that the rate of the national debt has continued to grow throughout the last quarter of 2018. The government sought to reduce its annual budget deficit from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2017 to 3 percent in 2018. However, the report foresees that the year will end with a higher deficit than that of last year’s due to the decline in tax revenue. The expected rate is estimated at around 3.8 percent. In a parliamentary meeting in October, the president of the court of auditors, Driss Jettou, warned about the treasury’s debt, which reached MAD 692 billion by the end of 2017. Jettou called on the government to raise taxes and cut spending, to accelerate growth to reduce debt, and to ensure that Morocco can meet its debt obligations over the medium and long-term. Both internal and external debts increased significantly between 2016 and 2017. The report also drew attention to the alarming increase of the country’s external debts, which amounted to MAD 153 billion by the end of September, representing 21 percent of the total amount of the treasury debt.The public external debt amounts to over MAD 330 billion, representing 31 percent of the 2017 GDP. According to Trading Economics, Morocco held MAD 492 billion in external debt by this summer.

Rabat – In the late 1940s, American director Orson Welles began to realize the legendary Shakespearean play “Othello” on the big screen. However, although he planned to produce the film in Italy, one of the story’s settings along with Cyprus, fate brought him to North Africa instead.  The geographical change proved to be an extreme boon for the director, and it enabled him to produce one of the most renowned classical films of cinematic history.  The play “Othello,” a story about a general in the Venetian army, was originally published in 1603 and was based on an earlier Italian novel called “Un Capitano Moro.”  The play immediately became a hit, and one of the first things that grabbed the attention of the 17th century English audience was the race of the protagonist. Othello is ambiguously described as a “Moor,” a term used during the time to describe Muslims of the Maghreb and Andalusia.  But Othello had a special connection with Morocco from the beginning. Historians have supported claims that Othello was based on Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud ben Mohammed Anoun, the Moroccan ambassador to Queen Elizabeth I at the time. Anoun’s delegation stayed in England for six months, giving Anglo-Saxons a rare glimpse of a Moorish individual in person. Coincidentally, Othello was released a year later, according to the British Library. When Welles was filming the cinematic version in 1948, funding problems caused Welles to constantly put the project on hold to continue work on other directors’ movies, according to Moroccan news outlets.  Eventually, the filmmaker travelled to Morocco to shoot the film, setting up in El Jadida and Essaouira, coastal cities south of Casablanca. Welles immediately fell in love with Morocco, describing it as “uncontaminated, cheaper, and historically closer to Cyprus than Italy.” Welles finished Othello in Morocco, and it debuted in Rome in 1951. Since, the movie has become a world renowned classic. But Morocco has not received much credit for helping create one of Welles’ most defining films. Many viewers would not be able to differentiate between the Moroccan coast and places around Europe. But Othello remains a silent salute to the silent beauty that Morocco emanates.

Rabat – In a phone conversation with Mauritania’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, US Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale commented on this week’s UN-led Western Sahara discussion being held in Geneva. In his conversation, Hale said that the US supported efforts made by the United Nations Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler.  According to Mauritania’s state-owned news agency AMI, Hale said that his country also backs any “initiative that aims to end the Western Sahara conflict,” hoping that an end will soon be reached. Weeks before the kick off of the roundtable and the adoption of Resolution 2240, Hale and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Moroccan analysts speculated that Guterres might have been trying to convince the US to vote for a one-year extension for MINURSO. The Security Council, however, voted for a six-month extension for the mandate of MINURSO on October 31. The two-day roundtable discussion, which began yesterday and continues today, is held behind closed doors. Morocco’s delegation is led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. None of the members of the delegations have commented on the roundtable yet. The delegation includes three Sahrawis: President of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid; President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region Ynja Khattat; and Fatima Adli, a member of the Smara municipal council. The presence of Sahrawis in the delegation angered pro-Polisario news outlets, including “Futuro Sahara.” The news outlet called the Sahrawis representing Morocco in the Geneva talks “traitors.” The three Sahrawis represents a significant message from Morocco as it strengthens the legitimate representation of Sahrawis. Moroccan analysts predict that the negotiations are unlikely to lead to future negotiations as long as Algeria does not admit playing a role in the conflict.

Rabat – The much-anticipated roundtable discussion over the future of Western Sahara negotiations began yesterday, convening the four parties to the conflict. The two-day meeting is the first of its kind since 2012.  At the request of the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, the roundtable aims to step up measures to launch negotiations to end the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita is leading the Moroccan delegation, composed mostly of Sahrawis, in order to reinforce Morocco’s position that there should be no solution that damages Morocco’s territorial integrity. Morocco has held firm that its autonomy plan, introduced in 2007, is a just and credible solution to the dispute. The North African country has also been putting pressure on its eastern neighbor Algeria to admit its role in the conflict. Following direct and clear messages from the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Algeria, King Mohammed VI decided to extend his hand to the Algerian government hoping to initiate frank and direct dialogue, and in turn break the icy bilateral ties between the two countries. Bouteflika’s government has not answered Morocco’s dialogue initiative yet, and some Algerian observers found King Mohammed VI’s offer “questionable” and “not sincere.” Moroccan analysts and observers believe that Algeria is unlikely to accept its role in the Western Sahara conflict nor Morocco’s dialogue offer. In a statement to Morocco World News,  Moroccan political analyst El Moussaoui El Ajlaoui said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres aims to identify a path towards future negotiations to end the persistent  conflict. Guterres, according to Ajlaoui, is “focusing on the conflict as a regional dispute,” as his personal envoy invited Morocco and Polisario, as well as Mauritania and Algeria to the discussion in Geneva. The use of the word ‘parties’ includes Algeria, Mauritania “Inviting Algeria and Mauritania as parties in the conflict and not observers is proving that Guterres is making the conflict a regional issue that should be solved between all parties and not between Polisario and Morocco as Algeria claims,” according to the analyst. Algerian officials, including Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and his foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel, shrunk their country’s role in the conflict, claiming that the conflict will end after discussion solely between Morocco and the Polisario Front. Morocco, however, says Polisario is an illegitimate representative of the Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps in Algeria. While it is hosting and arming the members of the Polisario Front, Algeria still claims to be neutral and an observer party to the conflict that aims to back Sahrawis’ “independence” referendum. Ajlaoui said that in its last resolutions and reports the UN and its Security Council used the word “parties.” In Arabic, according to Ajlaoui, there was a misleading translation of the word parties to indicate a duality of “two parties” to the conflict. Algeria has been using this translation to convince itself that the Western Sahara conflict should be solved between the “two parties” to the conflict: Morocco and Polisario. Now Security Council Resolution 2440 has used clear language  including Algeria and Mauritania as parties, according to Ajlaoui. In his talk with Morocco World News, Ajlaoui doubted that Geneva’s roundtable will lead to future negotiations. “What Guterres and his personal envoy Kohler aim to do is to implement Resolution 2440, which clarified that the conflict is regional.” He added that the resolution also confirmed the threat imposed by the regional conflict in Western Sahara and in the Sahel. The United Nations also decided on claims promoted by the Polisario Front regarding the “liberated zones.” The resolution clearly called on Polisario to respect its commitments in Bir Lahlou and Tifariti, two regions that have been claimed as  “liberated zones.” The resolution, therefore, brushed aside Polisario’s claims, calling it to comply with the UN orders. High-level Moroccan delegation is significant message Commenting on the Moroccan delegation accompanying Bourita, Ajlaoui said that the choice of the members of the delegation is “very important and significant.” He added that the delegation, for the first time, included three members from the Sahara, who were voted on without any refusal from the United Nations. The Moroccan delegation includes President of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid; President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region Ynja Khattat; and Fatima Adli, a member of the Smara municipal council. Observers believe that the participation of Sahrawis strengthens their legitimate representation. The representation of Sahrawis in the Moroccan delegation, according to Ajlaoui, is an essential card during Geneva’s roundtable and negotiations around Morocco’s agreements with the EU. Algeria’s ignorance of resolution shows ill intention Political expert Abdelfettah El Fatihi told Morocco World News yesterday that Algeria’s ignorance towards Morocco’s dialogue offer shows that the eastern neighbor is attending the Geneva round-table with “ill intention.” He added that Morocco is complying with UN Resolution 2440, which called on all parties to show determination in working  constructively with Kohler to ensure a successful UN-led political process. He added that Polisario and its supporter Algeria “did not understand this part of the UN resolution.” He said this ignorance will “threaten the future of the consultations in Geneva.” El Fatihi told MWN that Algeria’s silence “urged Guterres to address a message to the parties in order to respect the content of the latest resolution without preconditions.” Prior to the roundtable, Guterres’ deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq, said on December 4 that Guterres wants the four parties to the conflict to engage in “good faith, without preconditions and in a constructive spirit in the discussions.” Ajlaoui also commented on Algeria’s silence regarding Morocco’s dialogue offer. He said that Algeria has a problem of trust.  “Algeria’s borders with all the surrounding states are military zones. When a state turns its border areas into military zones, it means that there is tension with all its surrounding countries, including Niger, Libya, Tunisia, Mali, Mauritania, and Morocco.” He added that if the Algerian regime changes, there might be a possible future solution to the Western Sahara conflict.

Rabat – Judicial police in Kenitra, north of Rabat, have arrested two women who were charging people for a fake opportunity to get a government job. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement that two people who fell victim to the suspects showed up at the police school in Kenitra carrying fake “summonses” to take the police exam. After hearing their story, DGSN arrested on woman acting as an intermediary for fraud and forgery of official documents. The woman was found with financial transfer receipts. After further investigation, police arrested the main suspect in Temara, a town south of Rabat. Police found a large number of false summonses to take exams of several public institutions and 13 forged summonses for police exams in the suspect’s house. The two women, aged 37 and 41, charged their victims MAD 40,000 to 80,000 in exchange for the summonses. DGSN said that the suspects are now in custody, and they are continuing to investigate to determine other members involved in the case.

By Zakaria Ouadghiri Rabat – “We are determined to cooperate fully with our brothers in the five Sahelian countries to develop zones facing serious security threats that have an impact on the security of the entire region, including Morocco,”Head of Government Saadeddine El Othmani told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). He said that Morocco had prepared a program that would be presented at the conference concerning its actions in the Sahel region. Immediately after his arrival in the Mauritanian capital, the head of the Moroccan government held a one-on-one meeting with the Mauritanian Prime Minister Ahmed Salem Ould Bashir in the airport’s VIP lounge. The Moroccan delegation is participating in this event as a partner country. The G5 Sahel countries are seeking Morocco’s expertise in several areas, such as the fight against desertification, water control and counter-terrorism.  El Othmani expressed Morocco’s determination on Wednesday in Nouakchott to strengthen its cooperation with the Sahel countries (Mauritania, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger) who face serious security threats.  This Thursday’s meeting is dedicated to the organization’s Priority Investment Programme (PIP) for 2019 to 2022.  The PIP is used for implementing the G5 Sahel Development and Security Strategy (SDS) and is structured around the four strategic areas of intervention (Defence &amp; Security, Governance, Infrastructure, and Resilience &amp; Human Development). Normally, it is the Minister of Foreign Affairs who represents the kingdom at Group meetings, as was the case in September 2017 in New York at an inter-ministerial meeting on “Security and development in a French-speaking region in solidarity” and in February 2018 in Brussels. Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita is participating in the Geneva roundtable on the resumption of negotiations on the Sahara. On the orders of King Mohammed VI, El Othmani is leading a delegation to the G5 Sahel (GHS) conference that is held on December 5 and 6 in Nouakchott, Mauritania, according to a statement from the Head of Government Department. The statement noted that this conference brings together a number of heads from both government and state, as well as representatives of donor countries to mobilize the necessary resources needed for the investment priorities program of the G5S countries. This conference is the second conference for donors to G5S countries after the one held in Brussels last February, which raised $414 million for the G5 Sahel counterterrorism task force. G5S is an institution for coordinating regional cooperation in development and security issues in West Africa. It was formed on February 16, 2014, in Nouakchott, Mauritania, at a summit of five Sahel countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger.

Rabat – Morocco’s national carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) will join the oneworld global airline alliance which includes industry heavyweights American Airlines and British Airways. RAM’s membership is expected to take effect in mid-2020, announced oneworld Wednesday, December 5, in a statement. “Its regional subsidiary Royal Air Maroc Express will join as a oneworld affiliate member at the same time.” Commenting on the new membership, Royal Air Maroc CEO Abdelhamid Addou said, “This undoubtedly represents one of the most significant landmarks in our airline’s 60-year history and on our journey to establish Royal Air Maroc as the leading airline of Africa.” Although South Africa’s Comair, “which flies as a franchisee of British Airways,” is a oneworld affiliate member, Royal Air Maroc will be oneworld’s first full member from the continent, reads oneworld’s statement. “Africa is the last major region where oneworld  does not have a full member airline – and has one of the fastest predicted air travel growth rates over the next few decades,” said oneworld Governing Board Chairman Alan Joyce and Qantas CEO. Oneworld CEO Rob Gurney said, “Royal Air Maroc is growing into a truly global airline, with its home base Casablanca to be developed into Africa’s leading aviation gateway while also consolidating its place as Africa’s number one financial centre.” Morocco received a total of 10.5 million tourists between January and October this year, an 8 percent increase from the same period last year, according to the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism. On a fleet of 55 airplanes, RAM carried 7.3 million passengers in 2017 with an average of 245 daily departures. The state-owned airline generated $1.7 billion in revenue last year. RAM, which employs 5,413 people, has 94 destinations in 49 countries across the world. By joining oneworld, Royal Air Maroc will add 34 new destinations and 21 countries to the alliance map, expanding its network to reach 1,069 airports in 178 countries. As Royal Air Maroc has a five-year plan to expand its fleet to carry 13 million passengers per year in 121 destinations in 68 countries, oneworld alliance will gain 15 additional destinations and 9 countries. Launched in February 1999, oneworld is an alliance of some of the world’s leading airlines such as American Airlines, British Airways, Malaysia Airlines, and Qatar Airways.  The alliance carries “550 million passengers a year on a combined fleet of 3,500 aircraft.” Oneworld generates $135 billion in revenue annually.

Rabat – A Moroccan woman told British police that her British husband recruits young men to fight for ISIS in Iraq and Syria, reported Moroccan newspaper Al Massae on Wednesday. Due to the serious accusation, the man spent 13 months in jail before police discovered upon extensive investigations that the man was innocent, the man told Al Massae. It all started when the family moved to Morocco from the UK, which the woman did not like. She sought a divorce, prohibited her husband from seeing their children, and left Morocco to file her complaint in Britain. Another case of a Moroccan wife’s false accusations of her foriegn husband was recently publicized in Australia. A Moroccan woman called Asmae punched herself in the face allegedly to frame her Australian husband, Faisal Khan, for domestic violence after she had secured a visa through their marriage. Police arrested the husband on charges of assault, but CCTV footage cleared his name. The footage shows Asmae leaving their apartment, entering an elevator, and punching herself twice on the left side of her face, leaving visible bruises under her eye and on her cheek.

Rabat – Although Morocco has not executed an individual since 1993, some human rights groups say the de facto abolition of the death penalty is not enough. The Moroccan Organization of Human Rights (OMDH), and the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty (WCADP) are urging Morocco to join an international agreement ending capital punishment. Morocco still maintains the death penalty as a lawful practice, and reports estimate there are at least 95 people currently on death row, according to a report from Cornell. Morocco had six chances prior to 2018 to join the UN moratorium banning the practice,but each time the country chose to abstain from the vote. This angered activists who cite the country’s constitution as proof the practice is immoral and should be ended. Though the vote to join the agreement was scheduled for December 13, activists managed to postpone Morocco’s official vote until December 19, giving them an opportunity to repeat their pleas to the government, according to news outlets.  Globally, capital punishment is steadily declining as more arguments emerge against its cruelty, as well as its statistical failure to deter future crimes. Currently, Egypt is the only country in North Africa to still carry out executions, reports Amnesty International. Even though the other countries are abstaining from executing criminals, no country in North Africa has legally abolished the practice yet.   About 60 percent of the world’s population live in countries where the death penalty is still legal. The Huffington Post reports that powerful nations like the US, China, India, and Pakistan are the top executors. However, activists still hold out hope that things will change. Amnesty International Secretary-General Salil Shetty commented that as more countries have abolished the practice “the isolation of the world’s remaining executing countries could not be starker.” For Morocco, banning capital punishment could potentially have benefits in the political realm. As Morocco looks to become a more involved member of the international community both economically and politically, joining the growing team of abolitionist countries will make Morocco a pioneer among North Africa and a leader of human rights globally and accomplishing something a developed country like the US has still failed to do.

Rabat – Morocco’s state secretariat will soon acquire Credit Card Terminals, which will be provided to police stations, officers, and gendarmes, so traffic violations can be paid with bank cards.  State secretary Najib Boulif revealed the news while responding to a question from MP Abderrahmane Harfi’s during Monday’s parliament session. The MP revealed that police and gendarmes do not accept checks as a payment method, even though it is legal and must not be refused. Boulif pointed out that the article 223 of the Traffic Code says that “fines shall be paid in cash or by check, and by all other payment method determined by the administration.” This has resulted in citizens filing complaints when their checks are refused. Harfi said that citizens find themselves having to carry money whenever they drive, while some foreigners find themselves forced to pay traffic violations in cash.

Rabat – The 11th Global Forum on Migration and Development (GMFD), which was launched yesterday in Marrakech, sought to tackle the question of narrative and policy-making pertaining to the increasing transcontinental mobility. Convening country delegates, academics, civil society, and media personalities, the forum revolved around an overarching theme of finding the mechanisms needed to fully integrate migrants in their host countries. The mood was set at around 10 a.m, with a plenary panel that mainly discussed ways to implement international agreements and conventions to “ensure the respect of the rights of migrants, regardless of their status.” Louise Arbour, the representative of the UN-Secretary General, said that the forum’s aim is to “harness the undoubted benefits of migration and mitigate its numerous challenges.” While they approached the forum’s theme “Honoring International Commitments to Unlock the Potential of All Migrants for Development” from different approaches, panelists overwhelmingly agreed on the importance of narrative. How we present migrants in the political debate, they argued, has a huge bearing on the societal and political dynamics of how each society includes its migrants in its policy-making. Listening to the different speakers, there was a discernible sense of hope in and commitment to international conventions on migration. When properly managed, migration can be a source of socio-economic wealth, they explained in chorus. There were talks on the need to respond to populism and reactionary pan-nationalism with “creative, innovative and inclusive policies.” Some pointed out the “manifest importance of multilateralism in providing platforms to address global challenges.” Others highlighted the question of rights and belonging in countries that have adopted a multicultural approach.    For all the in-depth and diverse perspectives that attendees gathered from different panelists, the conference’s most telling moment arrived when a 20-year old panelist took to the stage to “speak on behalf of all young migrants around the world.”  Yasmin Youssef, a German of Lebanese descent, spoke eloquently about the constant challenges of being a migrant. The discrimination, the question of double awareness and divided loyalty and not knowing where you really belong, constitute some facets of the constantly difficult experiences of being a migrant, Yasmin elaborated. “Migrants need to be thrice as good or brilliant to be taken seriously,” she explained. And while a forum such as the GMFD is important in creating a multi-stakeholders and multinational platform for dialogue and debates, Youssef argued that the whole exercise of having discussions would be a grand failure if migrants are not invited to the table.  Effectiveness and success in migration-related actions and policies necessarily pass through genuine concern about the challenging lives of the disenfranchised, whose life stories constitute the very center of the debate. Not only should they be invited to the discussion, but their voice should actually matter the most, Youssef explained.  “Nothing about us without us. Don’t make assumptions about us or what we want. If you care, make us visible,” she said. Youssef’s speech was greeted with a thunderous ovation, probably the most outstanding acclamation of the day. But was that the whole point? Does giving a young migrant a few minutes to address a global forum actually achieve anything in terms of genuinely giving space to the concerns and difficulties of migrants? What about the tokenism part of it all, with Youssef’s voice and words set to evaporate as soon as the forum ends and the panelists and attendees—generally affluent and well-educated—go back to their everyday life, unaffected by the stories they spoke and heard about during the three-day forum? It’s a complicated tale, Yasmin told Morocco World News on the sidelines of yesterday’s conference. Regarding the potential change that may stem from her visibility on stage, she was cautiously optimistic.  “With all events, there is always the threat that young people or young migrants are only placed there to look good, for decoration. But I think that for this event I had the chance to speak to everyone, to make my story heard.” Her optimism, she suggested, lies in the fact that you “can always use social media to present yourself and make your voice heard.” As for her insistence on genuine care and the necessity of making migrants part of the debate on migration, she told the story of Lebanese social workers assuming what Syrian refugees needed.  The social workers distributed “fat winter jackets and blankets” to a group of refugees, thinking that they were being helpful. But the refugees were not impressed, complaining that “It’s 35 degrees outside and we don’t need these [fat jackets and blankets].” “We always assume for people instead of actually going to the people and asking them what they need, what they wish for. I think you should not make decisions if you don’t know what people want or need.”

Rabat – Based on intelligence provided by General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST), police arrested a truck driver who was attempting to smuggle 400 bags of hashish, weighing a total of 10 tons, on Tuesday and Wednesday in El Jadida, near Casablanca. The police investigation resulted in the arrest of three other suspected criminals, including the owner of the truck, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement. Police seized a sum of €10,000 from the gang, which is suspected to be linked to a criminal network operating in international drug trafficking. After a careful and technical inspection, the packaging and wrapping of the seized drugs indicate that the drugs were intended to be smuggled by sea, added the statement. Police placed the suspects in custody while the judicial investigation is ongoing, under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office. The investigation aims to determine whether there are any other possible suspects in the criminal network, its extensions inside Morocco, and to identify their possible links with criminal networks internationally.

Rabat – The French judiciary has reportedly released Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred, who is charged with two counts of rape, on parole Wednesday afternoon. Although the French court has yet to officially announce the news of Lamjarred’s release, several Moroccan celebrities congratulated the singer and his family. Singer Hasna Zalagh posted a photo of Lamjarred on her Instagram, congratulating all his fans and parents, actress Nezha Regragui and singer Bachir Abdou. She wrote: “Finally…Thank God. Congratulations to the renowned actress Lalla Nezha and singer Bachir Abdou, and all of Lamjarred’s fans…”     واخيرا…..🙏 حمد الله على السلامة مبروووووك والف هنية للممثلة القديرة للا نزهة والمطرب القدير البشير عبدو وهنيئا لكل #فانز سعد لمجرد # الحمد لله @saadlamjarred1 Une publication partagée par  hasna zalagh (@hasnazalaghofficial) le 5 Déc. 2018 à 12 :53 PST  Moroccan singer Miryam Labiad also posted an Instagram story about Lamjarred, saying: “Thank goodness, Welcome back.” French authorities arrested the 33-year-old pop singer for the second time on August 26 in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France, after a new rape complaint was filed against him by a young French seasonal worker. Following the Saint-Tropez incident, Lamjarred paid €150,000 bail and was let out on probation. On September 18, Lamjarred went back to jail following the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal’s decision after the prosecutor’s office in Draguignan appealed his release. The singer is already on trial for the sexual assault of French national Laura Prioul in 2016. Lamjarred has faced other rape accusations previously. The first rape accusation came in 2010 in New York. US prosecutors later dropped the case when the plaintiff withdrew. Saad Lamjarred is one of the most popular artists in Morocco and the Arab world. His hit song “Lmaallem” (the boss), as of February 2018, was the most-viewed song by an Arab artist on YouTube. The music video has been seen more than 691 million times.

Rabat – Amidst the launching of a master class series, Martin Scorsese expressed his concerns regarding the future of the cinema industry in a world that is facing an industrial and technological revolution.

“Everyone can make films today,” and routes to finance films can be found, “but no one can see them, theaters are closing,” explained Scorsese at the 17th Marrakech International Film Festival (FIFM).

It is hard to know where the movie theater business is heading in the age of streaming video services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO, and Hulu. Today, many cinemas have closed, and the number of moviegoers is decreasing globally as people become resentful of the idea of going to the cinema. Despite all the amenities that a cinema theater can offer, attendance graphs show fewer and fewer people are going to the movies.

“We’re in a second industrial revolution, and I have no idea how the future is going to shape up in terms of visual storytelling to an audience, in a room, with people watching one screen. I know that it’s essential, and we have to fight to keep theatres open as much as possible because it’s a communal experience,” Scorsese argued.

There are countless reasons why many people do not go to the cinema anymore and prefer to watch movies online from the comfort of their home.

First of all, the rise of home video streaming services has widened home entertainment options. Large high-definition televisions, Blu-Ray, and DVD players also allow people to watch what they want, when they want, and in cinema level quality.

Secondly, movie ticket prices and cinema gimmicks have reached record highs. Movie theater concessions have large markups as cinema exhibitors do not make the money they used to in the past. Most of the ticket cost goes to film production companies and film distributors. Cinema exhibitors are obliged to mark-up the price of concessions to keep their cinemas alive and working. Another reason why people stopped going to movie theaters is because the internet has affected the industry as well. The world wide web has enabled viewers to watch films on their phones and computers.

Unlike opera and theater, cinema has always been the working man’s medium. Everyone was able to afford a ticket. It was the only form of escapism the working class had. When Scorsese was a child, he was diagnosed with severe asthma. “I couldn’t play sports, I couldn’t run, I couldn’t laugh too much because of the spasms.” 

Cinema was the only escape for Scorsese. “We were working class people who didn’t have books in the house, so everything was visual … we couldn’t afford to go to the theater and see the plays by Tennessee Williams or Arthur Miller.” 

Filmmakers and storytellers like Martin Scorsese help fight xenophobia, racism, intolerance, and populist nationalism.

“If you’re interested in continuing the human species you have to address core issues such as nurturing love, compassion, and understanding other people. Because we now have the power to wipe out mankind. Essentially I keep coming back to these subjects,” said Scorsese.

Rabat – The Director General of National Security (DGSN), Abdellatif Hammouchi, has issued a decree to financially reward Moroccan police officers of all ranks, grades, corps, and specializations. The reward serves as a recognition of officers’ efforts in serving citizens and a motivation to develop security services and raise awareness of the challenges related to public affairs. It is also intended to improve the social welfare of police officers. DGSN launched the initiative last year as part of the financial governance system it adopted in the last three years, which has enabled the payment of all financial arrears, including those related to staff indemnification for mobility. The indemnification for mobility is now disbursed to police officers before they carry out assigned tasks. In previous years, police received indemnifications after the mission, and they were sometimes delayed for several years.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of State for Human Rights Mustapha Ramid and UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Philippe Poinsot signed the agreement in Rabat on Monday, December 3. The agreement will activate the National Action Plan on Democracy and Human Rights 2018-2021 (PANDDH) at the cost of MAD 28 million, the Maghreb Arab Press reported. The project aims to facilitate information exchange with the associated actors and institutions, like universities, involved in the implementation of the plan.  Through cooperation with UNDP and United Nations agencies in Morocco, the project will also develop tools and mechanisms that will enable Morocco to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the PANDDH plan. Ramid said that the project is of “paramount importance” because it will integrate all facets of  human rights, including political, civic, economic, social, and cultural aspects, into public policies and sectoral programs in a collaborative approach involving all actors. The minister added that Morocco is “the 39th country to adopt an action plan in human rights, in accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action.” Poinsot affirmed that the UNDP will support the project through a management unit and a monitoring and evaluation mechanism. Adopted in 2017 by the government council, the PANDDH will serve as a framework for coordinating public policies and economic, social and cultural development programs in the field of human rights.

Rabat – Moroccan and Tunisian women below the age of 40 will need the company of a close blood-related male kin known as “mahram” in Islam (brother, husband, uncle, or father) to be able to work in Kuwait. Kuwait’s Public Authority of Manpower announced the decision that women under the age of 40 will need to be accompanied by a close male relative, in addition to a security clearance in order to receive a work permit. The same source maintained that Kuwait’s decision came with the consent of the three countries, Morocco, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The new restrictions, which do not apply to women of other nationalities, have sparked online controversy as to why these three nationalities were singled out. Many social media commentators linked Kuwait’s new ban to stereotypes against Moroccan women, basing their judgment on those who have engaged in prostitution in the Middle East. “Why Morocco and Tunisia?” some commentators wondered, questioning why the country did not put restrictions on women from other nationalities such as Egyptians or Syrians. The new situation of women from these countries in Kuwait may become similar to that of women in Saudi Arabia. Women are not allowed to travel alone without the company of a mahram in the kingdom, not even while  performing the hajj pilgrimage.

Rabat – Morocco’s delegation is led by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Morocco’s delegation arrived at the Palace of Nations Geneva at 2:30 p.m on December 5. The delegation also includes Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale and President of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid, and President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region Ynja Khattat. Analysts say the participation of Ynja and Ould Errachid strengthen the legitimate representation of Sahrawis. Fatima Adli, a member of the Smara municipal council is also on the list of Morocco’s delegation. Adli has been representing her region at various national and international symposiums, to show development experienced in the region and the involvement of Saharawi women in the management of the region.   In September 2011, she was part of the Moroccan delegation sent to the UN headquarters in New York to defend the Morocco’s positions during the work of the 4th Commission. Ould Errachid is also the deputy mayor of the city of Laayoune. He is one of the members of the Reguibat tribe, which represented a quarter of the Sahrawi population according to the Spanish census of 1974. Yenja, who is a former member of the Polisario Front, returned to Morocco in the mid-1990s. Yenja has accompanyied several Moroccan officials during their official trips to Brussels to defend the EU-Morocco agriculture and fisheries agreement. He has repeatedly  brushed aside Polisario’s allegations that Morocco exploits the natural resources of Western Sahara, claims which are amplified by Polisario and Algerian media.  The Algerian delegation is led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel, while Mauritania’s delegation includes Minister of Foreign Affairs Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, among other representatives. The separatist group will be represented by the self-proclaimed president of Parliament Khatri Addouh, and M’Hammad Khaddad, former chief of military security. A day before the UN meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed all the parties to the conflict, urging them to engage in the UN discussion without preconditions and in a good faith.

Rabat – After an 18-month blockade of Qatar, Saudi Arabia finally made an initial move to defuse the tension with its neighboring country. The move comes  as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman struggles to overcome the diplomatic crisis and international condemnation he faces for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Emir Sheikh Tamim “received a written message from King of Saudi Arabia, inviting HH the Amir to attend the 39th Summit of the Supreme Council of the GCC that will be hosted by the Kingdom on December 9,” Qatar News Agency (QNA) tweeted on December 4. However, QNA did not say whether Sheikh Tamim would travel to Saudi Arabia to attend the summit. The Bahraini secretary general of the GCC, Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, delivered the invitation during a reception held by Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad Al Muraikhi, reported Al Jazeera. Saudi Arabia’s invitation comes a day after Qatar’s decision to withdraw from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In a shift from his previous tone, Prince Mohammed unexpectedly praised Qatar’s economy as “strong” at a conference in Saudi Arabia in October, following Khashoggi’s murder. Last month, Kuwait’s Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled al-Jarallah confirmed that all six GCC countries would attend the annual summit. Al Jarallah said the summit could present a “hope to resolve the Gulf crisis and solve the differences.” On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt all cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar after alleged accusation of “funding terrorism and for having  a too-close relation with Iran.” Qatar’s denied the accusations saying they were unjustified and based on false claims and assumptions. Since then, Saudi Arabia and its allies imposed a land, sea, and air blockade on Doha. Other Arab and Muslim countries joined the blockade campaign. Later that month, the Saudi-led bloc released a list of 13 demands, including “the closure of Al Jazeera television network and a downgrade of relations with Iran,” so as to normalize their diplomatic relations with Doha. However, Qatar rejected the demands as it found them to be “unreasonable.”

Rabat – UNESCO and Mohamed VI Polytechnic University will organize the Artificial Intelligence forum on December 12-13 in Benguerir, near Marrakech. The forum aims to “explore the opportunities and challenges of technological innovations relating to artificial intelligence (AI) in Africa,” UNESCO wrote in a statement. According to UNESCO, most African countries are equipped with mobile network coverage, “despite significant disparities between countries.” “The high rate of smartphone penetration has been followed by the development of many applications that facilitate everyday life be it with regard to health, education, culture or the environment.” In 2017, five Moroccan hospitals started integrating Sophia Genetics’ artificial intelligence programs into their clinics to help the identification of diseases causing mutations in patients’ genomic profiles. Sophia Genetics is a global leader in data-driven medicine.  In July, the global management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company, which specializes in digital transformation, held a conference in Morocco on artificial intelligence algorithms. The conference highlighted the powerful potential digitizing sectors of Morocco’s economy has, including agriculture, banking and tax, and the automotive sector. For UNESCO, initiatives on AI are still limited and “they raise important ethical questions concerning the use of private data, freedom of expression and responsibility.” The organization emphasized the societal impact of AI which may replace human capital and disrupt the job market. An issue which will be addressed during the conference among others. According to McKinsey &amp; Company General Manager in Morocco Jalil Bensouda, AI “is an incredible opportunity that can generate many jobs. For a job destroyed, more than 100 will be created in return.” AI is expected to create 2.3 million new jobs by 2020, according to Gartner. However, “There is a real global shortage for specialized profiles in AI,” Bensouda said. “Data scientists, data engineers, and data architects are in great demand. Given the employment situation in Morocco, this sector can be an important source of work.” With the support of Microsoft, the UNESCO’s two-day forum will discuss “ways in which artificial intelligence can serve as a lever for development, the future of AI in Africa and ethical issues for the continent.” Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi, UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay, and the President of the General Conference of UNESCO Zohour Alaoui will attend the conference. The event will gather ministers, experts, researchers, international and regional organizations representatives, NGOs, and civil society actors from around the world.

By Carolina McCabe Rabat – In response to continuous protests led by the “Yellow Vests,” French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced the planned fuel tax increase will be delayed for a six-month period. The tax increase was previously set to begin January of 2019. During the six-month delay, the government plans to discuss and assess alternative measures to assist the poor and middle-class, who rely heavily on their vehicles for daily activities. However, the suspension of fuel taxes has still not garnered the approval of the protesters. Protesters were disappointed in the government for merely postponing the fuel taxes instead of reversing the measure altogether . “The protesters feel they have been ridiculed by Macron. So they’re saying: we’re not going to take our yellow vests off, we’re going to leave them on because in six months we’re going to be coming back again,” said FRANCE 24 French Affairs Editor Philip Turle. Over the past three weeks, French protests have been responsible for over 4.5 million dollars in damage and lost tourism revenue. On the third weekend of protests, protesters turned violent with riot police being dispatched after businesses and vehicles were damaged.  Protesters are using the opportunity to demand greater changes than simply cancelling the tax, citing the economic struggles they have endured for years. They also seek an increase in the minimum wage and pensions. “The French people want a complete political transformation. They want to change the way things have been for the last 30 years. We’re sick and tired of taxes being raised and the quality of public services going down,” said Benjamin Cauchy, one of the Yellow Vests. “We are not going to drop our guard,” he added, calling for another weekend of protests. “Our demands are much bigger than this moratorium,’’ said Mr. Cauchy. ‘‘We want a better distribution of wealth, salary increases. It’s about the whole baguette, not just the crumbs.” The suspension of the fuel tax will result in a loss of about $2.3 billion, and will have to be offset by corresponding spending cuts, a government source said. I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago. The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 4 décembre 2018  “If the events of recent days have shown us one thing, it’s that the French want neither an increase in taxes or new taxes. If the tax-take falls then spending must fall because we don’t want to pass our debts on to our children. And those debts are already sizeable,” Prime Minister Phillipe said. President Trump took the opportunity to respond to the fuel-tax delay on Tuesday with a tweet.  Harm to the pursuit of combating climate change The purpose of the fuel tax was to encourage French motorists to use electric vehicles in order to reduce the country’s environmental impact. However, environmentalists are concerned the protests and general anger towards the fuel-tax may inhibit the greater pursuit of a greener society. While French protesters reject the fuel tax, the greater French population understands the detrimental impact of human activity on the climate. According to a study by the European Social Survey from 2017, about 94% of French citizens believe climate change is at least partly caused by human activity, with 73.7% believing the impacts will be bad.  “It is not by turning our backs on ecology that we will emerge from the political crisis we are experiencing,” said French political party Les Verts in a statement. “Ecology must not become the atoning victim of this government’s bad choices.”

Rabat – International news outlets reported today that a Turkish prosecutor has ordered that an arrest warrant be issued against two Saudis close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the killing of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi. On Wednesday, a  Turkish source close to the investigation dossier said that the prosecutor’s office filed a request to obtain the warrants for Saudi nationals Ahmad al Assiri and Saud al Qahtani, two allies of MBS. Former media advisor to the royal court Al Qahtani and former deputy chief of Saudi intelligence General al-Assiri were removed from office on October 20 after the murder of Khashoggi, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The prosecutor’s office in Istanbul believes that “there is strong suspicion” that the two sacked officials were involved in the planning the murder. On Tuesday, two US key senators concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Richard C. Shelby, a republican senator, also commented on bin Salman’s involvement, stating that “all evidence points to that, that all this leads back to the crown prince,” adding that “This is conduct that none of us in America would approve of in any way.” US President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense, James Mattis and Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo have all been defending Saudi Arabia, claiming there is no “smoking gun” linking bin Salman to the murder.

Rabat – The UN chief called on the four parties to the Western Sahara conflict to engage in a “good faith, without preconditions and in a constructive spirit  in the discussions,” which will take place in Geneva on Wednesday and Thursday at the request of his Personal Envoy Horst Kohler. Guterres’ deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq said in a press briefing on December 4 that the UN chief “reiterates his steadfast support to his Personal Envoy and his efforts to relaunch the negotiations process in line with Security Council resolution 2440 of 31 October 2018.” Like Resolution 2440, Guterres addressed a clear message to all parties to the conflict to show their commitment to the UN-led political process. The secretary-general’s message also placed all parties invite for Geneva’s talk on equal footing, including Algeria. Morocco, Mauritania, and members of the Polisario Front will also take part in the UN discussion. Guterres’ statement supports the decision of the UN Security Council Resolution 2440, which called on Algeria to “work constructively” along with the other parties and Kohler to ensure a successful political process to find an agreed and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Adopted on October 31, the resolution has for the first time included Algeria as a neighboring country to the conflict. The resolution also breaks Algeria’s precondition of being an observer. Prior to Kohler’s invitation for talks, Morocco has been clear that it cannot accept to sit in at the roundtable only with the Polisario Front as the separatist group is not a legitimate representative of the Sahrawis living in the Tindouf camps. For Morocco, future negotiations with Polisario will beimpossible if Algeria does not accept its responsibility and role in the conflict. Morocco’s diplomacy also stressed that the Western Sahara conflict should be solved between Algeria and Morocco, as the eastern neighbor arms, and hosts Sahrawis in Tindouf. Morocco’s delegation is led by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita.

Rabat  – Morocco’s Ministry of State for Human Rights under human rights minister, Mustapha Ramid, released a statement on Tuesday, decrying a document by Human Rights Watch (HRW) saying that the Moroccan court ignored “evidence of torture” against Hirak detainees. The article entitled “Morocco: Torture Suspicions Mar Mass Trial Verdicts,” published on November 30, focused on the case of Hirak Rif activists whose appeals case began on November 14, stating that “the appeals court needs to examine and discard any tainted confessions and ensure that no one is convicted except for real crimes.” Ahmed Benchemsi, HRW’s communications and advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa said that “A court shouldn’t just ignore evidence of torture.” Meanwhile, the statement pointed out that “the document assesses a case that is still on its first appeal stage,” noting it is more “ethical” to wait until the closing of the appeal process before commenting on the case. Responding to the article’s call on Morocco to give “justice” to the Hirak activists, the ministry affirmed the independence of the judicial power in Morocco, as per chapter 107 of the 2011 Constitution. The statement noted the HRW’s selective approach to the Hirak case, as it declared only attending 17 of the 86 Hirak trial sessions. HRW said that it has examined 55 court documents, reviewed 41 forensic reports, including 19 by National Human Rights Council, appointed doctors and 22 commissioned by the Casablanca first instance court, and interviewed 10 defense lawyers and six relatives of the imprisoned activists.  The statement also states that HRW’s document contains inaccurate information regarding the number of Hirak detainees who benefitted from the royal pardon in August. The document entailed that King Mohammed VI pardoned 116 detainees whereas the correct number was 184, except for the Hirak leaders such as Nasser Zefzafi. The ministry wrote that the Appeals Chamber of the appeal court will directly listen to the demands of the detainees and parties involved in the case. “The Moroccan authorities regret the publishing of such a document that dares to address an issue that is within the kingdom’s judicial sovereignty, especially since it concerns a case that is still ongoing,” the statement concluded. Morocco has repeatedly condemned foreign “interference” in the domestic case of Hirak Rif, including Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok who presented a report on the Hirak to the Dutch Parliament in September. Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, Nasser Bourita said that the report contained inaccurate facts and was a direct interference in Morocco’s domestic affairs, stemming from a lack of respect for the country’s judicial system. In June, a court in Casablanca gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years for 54 Hirak Rif activists. Zefzafi and three other activists received 20 years in prison for their participation in “unauthorized” protests. The Hirak movement began in October 2016 after the death of Mohcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to save his goods that had been confiscated by authorities in Al Hoceima.  The incident angered citizens, causing protests across the country, especially in Al Hoceima province, which condemned Fikri’s death and social disparities in Morocco. Police arrested an estimated 400 activists and protesters involved in the protests in 2016 and 2017.

By Trista Youssef  Rabat – Morocco continues to be an international leader in climate change and has shown its commitment to sustainable development by adopting environmental policies and successfully implementing them in recent years.  Under King Mohammed VI, Morocco has implemented a national policy for environmental protection to combat the effects of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 32 percent by 2030. Morocco has launched a series of initiatives aiming to promote a green economy, including the adoption of the National Environment Charter and Efficiency Strategy, as well as the liberalization of the renewable energy sector. The country remains an active member of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, hosting the organization’s 24th conference in Marrakech.  King Mohammed VI’s royal message was delivered Monday to the COP24 in Katowice, Poland, by Prince Moulay Rachid.  The message reiterated Morocco’s support for the African continent in efforts toward environmental protection, saying that “Driven by its commitment to African causes, the Kingdom of Morocco continues to support the implementation process of the three Climate Commissions, resulting from the Summit of African Heads of State and Government, held in the margins of COP 22: on the Congo Basin, the Sahel Region, and the island states.” The King criticized the international community for its lack of support offered to African states regarding climate change: “The African continent is hit hard by the negative impacts of climate change, even though it is not responsible for this unfair situation…Africa is not supported by partners and international donors.”

Rabat – Italian Cardinal and Pope Francis’s top advisor Pietro Parolin confirmed his attendance to the migration conference in Marrakech taking place on December 10-11, reported the Catholic news outlet Crux. “There will be a Holy See delegation that I myself will lead,” Parolin said on December 4 during an interview with the press. State leaders and representatives will gather at the UN Intergovernmental Conference to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The UN general assembly appointed as host  Morocco on December 2017, after adopting unanimously the  71/1 resolution dubbed the “ New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants,” in September 2016. “The Holy See has collaborated, especially thanks to the section on migrants and refugees of the dicastery for Integral human development, in a significant way to the creation of this document,” Parolin affirmed. “It seems to us that it’s a good reference point to at least begin to address in a collective way the topic of migration.” The migration pact aims to address humanitarian and human right concerns, and developmental aspects of international migration. It also seeks to protect the dignity of all migrants, regardless of their status, and promises to ease the pressure on countries that welcome refugees. Despite being invited to attend the conference, Pope Francis declined at the last minute but will travel to Morocco in March 2019 for a papal visit. Although Italy is highly concerned with migration issue and considered as a destination for migrants, it will skip the major event. The approval of the global migration compact is not legally binding for countries. By July 30, more than 23,990 migrants entered Europe through the western Mediterranean route from Morocco route in 2018, in addition to 18,298 arriving in Italy alone. More than 600,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years, Al Jazeera reported. “I don’t judge anyone,” Parolin commented on the Italian government’s decision to not attend the migration conference. “I can only express my disappointment, in the sense that this can be a useful tool.” Parolin, who is also the Vatican’s Secretary of State, hoped that the Italian decision “does not undermine the effort to face this topic, which I repeat must be addressed in a collective and global way.” Parolin answered press questions on the margins of a conference in Rome titled “Eternity, the other face of life.” In addition to the intergovernmental conference, Morocco currently hosts the 11th summit of the World Forum on Migration, which is held on December 5-7 in Marrakech.

Rabat – The Heetch application, which use geolocation  to connect passengers and drivers,  will provide its riding services in Casablanca. “We are proud of this permission which testifies the confidence of the high authorities of the city of Casablanca in our organization,” said Patrick Pedersen, General manager of Heetch Africa. He added that the license will encourage the company to “redouble” its efforts to  “offer Moroccans a transport offer worthy of their expectations and transport professionals a favorable, human and supportive social environment.” The company was granted the license after a one year discussion with Casablanca’s local authorities and Moroccan Workers’ Union (UMT). Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Pedersen said that Casablanca’s choice for launching Heetch’s business is due to the fact that the city has a good infrastructure and a high quality urban road network.

By Trista Youssef Rabat – Following a briefing with the director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, senior senators from both the Democratic and Republican parties decided to hold Mohammed Bin Salman responsible for the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  Gina Haspel briefed Senators in the Foreign Relations, Armed Services, and Appropriations araKhashoggiand Intelligence Committees on evidence collected by the CIA regarding Khashoggi’ death that took place on October 2nd in Istanbul’s Saudi consulate.  President Trump continues to deflect blame away from the crown prince in order to maintain an economic relationship with Saudi Arabia. The US continues to give military support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen and continues to profit from arms exports to the Gulf state.  Secretary of Defense, James Mattis and Secretary of State , Mike Pompeo have both defended Trump’s position on Saudi Arabia, claiming there is no “smoking gun” linking bin Salman to the murder. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham stated, “There is not a smoking gun – there is a smoking saw,” referring to Khashoggi’s dismemberment carried out by Saudi officials. “You have to be willfully blind not to see it”, Graham added.  Chairman of Appropriations Committee, Richard C. Shelby, stated that “all evidence points to that, that all this leads back to the crown prince,” adding that “This is conduct that none of us in America would approve of in any way.” Shelby commented on the compromising position facing US administration due to its strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia. “Somebody should be punished, but the question is: ‘How do you separate the Saudi crown prince from the nation itself?’” said Senator Shelby.  US policymakers remain divided on the issue, as was reflected in last Wednesday’s 63-37 vote advancing a Senate motion to limit Trump’s support for Saudi Arabia’s military campaign in Yemen.

Rabat – From November 28-30, Mohamed Methqal, ambassador and general director of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI), was at the head of the Moroccan delegation which participated in the event. Marking the 10th anniversary since its launch, this year’s event aimed to mobilize all stakeholders in promoting  South-South cooperation. Methqal was a panelist at the High-level Forum of Director Generals for Development Cooperation during session four, titled “South-South cooperation: regional perspectives,” on November 30. During his speech, Ambassador Methqal emphasized the pivotal role Morocco plays, under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, in the development of South-South cooperation for the benefit of Africa. Methqal said that Morocco made South-South cooperation “a vehicle for the sustainable emergence of Africa.” He also recalled that the promotion of the cooperation has been inscribed in the Moroccan Constitution since 2011. Ambassador Methqal also presented the different fields of action of the AMCI whose achievements are for the benefit of the African continent as a whole. Based on Morocco’s successful experience in developing South-South cooperation, Methqal outlined some principles that could help strengthen South-South and triangular cooperation at the regional level by partners. The principles include “interest in giving South-South cooperation a privileged place in the foreign policy of countries, the advantage of institutionalizing a network of South-South cooperation actors involving both state and non-state actors at the level of each country.” As part of the expansion of the international network of AMCI partners to promote South-South and triangular cooperation, Methqal held talks with several cooperation officials. He met Angela Ospina De Nicholls, General Director of the Colombian Agency for International Cooperation to develop cooperation programs at the regional level. The AMCI ambassador general also met representatives of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Islamic Development Bank and representatives of cooperation agencies from Peru, Singapore, and Indonesia to develop triangular cooperation programs. Established in 2008, the first Global South-South Development Expo “seeks to bring together leaders from cooperation agencies of national governments to provide an opportunity for them to exchange views on South-South and triangular cooperation approaches and methodologies.”

Rabat – The beIN Sports journalist  Hafid Derradji, said that Algeria’s silence is proof that Algeria is not ready to host sports events, including the World Cup and CAN, due to lack of infrastructure and lack of world-class venues. Derradji made his remarks during a phone  interview on Algerian sports television program “Al Hassad Al Ryadi.” قلناها من زمان بأن الكامرون لن ينظم كأس أمم أفريقيا ٢٠١٩، البطولة سيحتضنها المغرب دون غيره.. pic.twitter.com/CZWO1nnwii — hafid derradji (@derradjihafid) 30 novembre 2018  He added that he feels sorry for his country for not even being able to host  a “chess competition,” emphasizing that Morocco is “scoring positive points” in terms of infrastructure. On November 30, Derradji said: “We said it already. Cameroon will not host CAN 2019.  Morocco will host it and no one else.” In 2017, Derradji mocked the Algerian football federation, andhe speculated that the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) will announce Morocco as the official host of the CAN, replace Cameroon.   “A thousand congratulations to Morocco,” wrote Derradji. The journalist sarcastically added that “[t]he Algerian president of the football federation, Khierdine Zetchi, announced days ago that Algeria is ready to replace Cameroon…. Good morning.” Some of the speculation about CAFwas proved true, as it announced its decision to strip Cameroon ofthe right to host the African tournament. CAN, also called AFCON, will take place June 15 to July 13, 2019. CAF has now launched a new bidding process to appoint another host for the African tournament. Both Morocco and South Africa might try to seize the opportunity to host the event s after Cameroon’s failure to retainhosting rights due to delays in completing projects and building venues for 2019 CAN.

By Shaquile Goff Rabat – After the excitement of the 2018 World Cup, FIFA has finally paid out the clubs of players that participated. The organization pays out money from revenue gained during the international soccer competition. This year, British club Manchester City received the highest payment from FIFA, at $5 million. Real Madrid and Tottenham followed, with each team netting 4.4 million and 4.8 respectively. FIFA paid 736 players across 416 clubs around the world for their time. In Morocco, Renaissance Berkane received the highest amount of money at $171,922.50. Ittihad Tangier, Racing, and Wydad also received money, according to local media. In addition to payments for the 2018 World Cup, part of FIFA’s $209 million payment to clubs is to secure the release of players for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The payment system, called the “Club Benefits Program” was started during the 2010 World Cup with a $70 million fund. It grew with each sequential World Cup to its current total of $209 Million, a 200 percent increase from the 2014 cup, according to the FIFA website. Players participating in the system are paid more the longer they can remain in the competition.  Arguably the world’s biggest sporting competition, analysts predicted the 2018 World Cup would bring at least $6 billion in revenue to FIFA. In the past FIFA was criticized for raking in large sums of money, while host countries paid immense construction bills, and participating teams received no compensation.  Thus, FIFA is now spreading the wealth and FIFA’s president Gianni Infantino remarked: “so many different regions will benefit from this programme, which will help to develop football even further around the globe.”

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Agriculture, Sea Fisheries, Rural Development, Waters, and Forests Aziz Akhannouch led a delegation to the WestMed conference yesterday, held in Algeria this year. WestMed began in 2016 and is an annual meeting by Algeria, Spain, France, Italy, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Mauritania, Portugal and Tunisia that focuses on working towards the economic, political, and environmental improvements in the western Mediterranean region.  One of the main goals set by the organization is to develop a “blue economy,” one that sustainably uses resources from the sea, by 2022. The EU lauded the goal, especially after Spain and Portugal were asked earlier this year to reduce their overfishing of sardines in 2019, due to depleting global populations. Read Also: Foreign Ministry Announces Official Delegation for Western Sahara Talks Although the focus of the conference was on international maritime cooperation, Akhannouch’s trip to the Algerian capital also occurred as upcoming talks involving the two countries loom. The countries have been at odds for decades, especially over the sensitive issue of Western Sahara. The Moroccan-Algerian border is now extremely militarized with increasing tensions, prompting alarm and calls for calm in the international community.  In the past, Morocco has accused Algeria of attempting to isolate the country from the Maghreb, as well as funding the rebellious Polisario movement, but King Mohammed VI  wants to turn over a new leaf, calling for constructive talks in November between the two countries, in an attempt to thaw the icy relationship between the two nations. The UN voiced support for talks, but Algeria has not officially responded to the King’s offer. Meanwhile, the two countries are scheduled to meet tomorrow and Thursday, December 5-6, at a UN roundtable in Geneva for talks on Western Sahara. Mauritania and Polisario will also attend the talks, called by Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Horst Kohler.

Rabat – An Australian man has alleged that his Moroccan wife punched herself in the face to frame him for domestic violence after gaining a visa through their marriage. Faisal Khan from Sydney and Asmae from Morocco met online on a popular Muslim dating website, Muslima.com. According to Khan’s statements to Australian program “A Current Affair” aired on the 9News channel, the newlywed couple enjoyed eight months of a normal married life until one night in April when their usual arguments metamorphosed into something more. CCTV footage shows Asmae leaving their apartment, entering an elevator, and punching herself twice on the left side of her face, leaving visible bruises under her eye and on her cheek.   Police arrested Khan on charges of assault, however he vehemently denied the accusation, reported Australia’s 9News on December 3, describing the incident as “a case like no other.” The assault charges, which carry up to a seven-year prison sentence, were lifted when the CCTV footage emerged. Khan said that the couple constantly argued, and he had had enough of his wife’s “demands” in the months prior to the incident.  Khan also listed expensive items he had allegedly bought for his wife: Gucci tracksuits, leather jackets, jewelry, shoes, holidays, and fine dining. He also complained of sending money back to Asmae’s family in Morocco. “All this traveling, going back and forth, all the functions, receptions, engagements, jewellery stuff, probably about $200,000,” he said. In addition, Khan asserted that he spent $20,000 on legal fees and searched for hundreds of hours for the footage. Khan claimed that by arresting him, the police “unwittingly” “helped” Asmae steal his belongings, including designer sunglasses, expensive watches and a laptop. While Asmae did not give her version of the story, the husband claimed that she is “very, very dangerous.” He stated: “I entered and she said to me that ‘you think you are smart and you’re talking to lawyers about me, now see what I do to you.’” ”I am the victim now. I got used and abused over and over again emotionally, mentally, financially — you name it. I’m the victim. She did that so now it’s her turn to face the consequences,” he complained. It is not known whether Asmae suffers from mental or psychological instability.  However, the CCTV footage was enough evidence for prosecutors to remove the assault charges from her husband. Yet, the footage raises more questions than it provides answers: Was Asmae also prey to abuse? How far can an estranged woman go in a foreign country with a husband demanding her immediate deportation?

Rabat – Aspiring athletes from Africa are now able to compete for a chance to train in an official center sponsored by the American National Basketball Association.  The NBA opened its new center last Monday in the seaside town of Saly in Senegal. The center was opened under the “NBA Academy” program. The program seeks to “expose elite prospects to NBA-level coaching, facilities, and competition,” according to its website. The NBA has launched academies in Australia, India, Mexico, and China as well. In addition to two full-sized indoor basketball courts, the center in Senegal features educational facilities, a dormitory, and a weight room. The center will be used for the training of the top male and female basketball players in Africa.  Although basketball will be the main focus, athletes will also be taught life skills, important health and wellness practices, and financial management skills. NBA Academy Africa is jointly operating the center with Senegalese non-profit Sports for Education and Economic Development (SEED), an organization that uses basketball to engage youth in academic, athletic and leadership programs, reports Reuters.  Basketball has become increasingly popular in Africa, with Senegalese native and former SEED participant Gorgui Dieng’s 2016 $64 million deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves inspiring youth across Africa. Although mostly popular in sub-Saharan countries, basketball is also being played more in countries like Morocco, which hosted a training session with NBA and WNBA athletes in 2014.

Rabat – The secretary of state to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mounia Boucetta, said that the United Nations roundtable talks on Western Sahara, set to begin tomorrow, will be an opportunity to settle the issue of confidence-building measures. On Monday, Boucetta emphasized that Morocco’s autonomy plan proposal remains the only realistic solution to the conflict. Recalling the recently adopted UN Resolution 2440, Boucetta said that the Security Council’s decision marks a significant step forward, especially because it stressed the need to open a new chapter in the UN-led political process. In her address made at the House of Representatives on Monday, Boucetta said that the resolution is important because it “recognizes Algeria’s central role as a party invited to the Geneva roundtable.” Boucetta said that the resolution also dealt “a hard blow to the myth of the liberated territories.” The Security Council voted on October 31 in favor of the resolution, which warned Polisario to adhere to its commitments in Western Sahara, its buffer zones, and east of Morocco’s defense berm. Claimed as liberated zones by the front, the resolution listed Bir Lahlou and Tifariti as restricted zones, saying Polisario should not move its administrative offices to them and should respect its commitments to the UN. The UN talks in Geneva will convene tomorrow and Thursday, December 5-6, at the request of the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler. Morocco’s delegation at the Geneva talks will evaluate Algeria’s readiness to accept its role in the conflict without preconditions. Algeria has denied its role in the Western Sahara conflict, claiming itself as an “observer” to the conflict. The UN’s resolution sent a clear message when it included Algeria with Morocco, Mauritania, and the Polisario Front in its instruction that the parties should “work constructively” to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. Moroccan officials have also affirmed that the roundtable is far from being part of negotiations. The roundtable will instead serve as an initial step toward future negotiations.  The roundtable’s agenda will be a general discussion about the recent developments of the Western Sahara dossier and a review of Kohler’s visit to the region in June. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita will lead the Moroccan delegation, which includes Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Omar Hilale, President of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid, and President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region Ynja Khattat. The delegation also includes Fatima Adli, a member of the Smara municipal council.

Rabat – The president of the Spanish enclave of Melilla, Juan Jose Imbroda, has demanded a change in the Spanish civil code to no longer grant Spanish nationality to Moroccans born in Melilla. Imbroda will present his demand to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez today, December 4, Spanish outlet El Faro Ceuta reported. “Thousands of Moroccan children are born each year in Melilla and get Spanish nationality at the age of 18,” Imbroda told the Spanish media. “Everyday, pregnant women leave Morocco to go to [Melilla] regional hospital to give birth, taking advantage of the fact that the Spanish health services are obliged to serve them for humanitarian reasons, even if they do not have a social security card,” he added. Approximately 2,500 Moroccan women give birth each year at Melilla hospitals and 1,300 of them return to Morocco once they give birth. Once they reach the age of 18, “these children claim their right to Spanish nationality,” said Imbroda. This worries the president of Melilla, who fears the increasing number of Spanish citizens of Moroccan origin who will have the right to participate in elections and its possible political consequences. Imbroda will also address other issues regarding immigration and security in his meeting with Sanchez.  He said he will express his concern over the high number of unaccompanied foreign minors in Melilla and will ask Sanchez to reinforce the National Police and the Civil Guard of Melilla to help authorities deal with thousands of migrants in the city. “We need 200 civil guards and 200 more national police,” stressed Imbroda. In 2017, the number of unaccompanied foreign minors arriving in Spain rose by over 60 percent, according to the Spanish interior ministry’s figures. More than 17,413 unaccompanied foreign minors have arrived in Spain since 2014, including 3,329 minors in Melilla, the ministry added. Imbroda also indicated that he will need to increase the military forces in Melilla.  “We do not ask for more soldiers because we are going to make a war, but because [Melilla] is a strategically more delicate area,” Imbroda said.

The director of Miss Universe SA tweeted “The screaming of girls and people everywhere still rings in my head…They knifed people, burning people. It was horrifying.” Lack of police presence was criticized as well, with a music publicist saying “We found two cops only when we were getting towards the highway.” A statement from Global Citizens Monday said “After such an inspiring evening, we are saddened to hear the challenges people had while leaving the venue. We have been working to support people getting home safely.”  South African police said it only received one report of a single robbery and wasn’t aware of any others.

With Mohammed bin Salman’s increasing power in Saudi Arabia, the visits of Christian leaders from various sects to Saudi Arabia have notably increased, according to Al Jazeera. 2 new churches in Riyadh Mohammed bin Salman also received a delegation of American evangelical Christian leaders on November 1 at the Royal Palace in Riyadh. Among the delegation was the founder of the Jerusalem Prayer Team, Mike Evans, who announced that Mohammed bin Salman promised to open two churches in Riyadh. The scheduled date for the two new churches’ opening has not yet been announced. Mohammed bin Salman has been under international pressure following the scandal of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, in which MBS was viewed as the main culprit. In the last week, the Saudi crown prince made a tour of several countries, including Tunisia, Mauritania, and Algeria, to improve his global image. Upon learning of the visit, Tunisian activists and politicians gathered in front of the presidential palace in Carthage to express their opposition to Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the country. For his part, King Mohammed VI snubbed Mohammed bin Salman. A source told Morocco World News that MBS did not visit Morocco because the King did not agree to receive him, saying it did not suit his schedule.

Rabat – Global non-profit Operation Smile, which works with children with cleft palates officially launched another mission in Morocco on Friday. The organization held an opening ceremony at Al Kortobi Hospital in the city of Tangier, according to local news. Operation Smile is an initiative to provide repairs for cleft lips and palates for impoverished children globally. According to Operation Smile’s website, every three minutes a child is born with a cleft lip or congenitally-damaged palate. Founded in 1982 by Dr William P. Magee, Jr. and his wife Kathy Magee, Operation Smile has expanded from 18 volunteers to an international network of plastic surgeons, medical experts, and non-medical volunteers. In Morocco alone, the operation has provided free surgery to over 7,500 people and free dental care to over 5,600. The organization also has 250 Moroccan doctors in its global network. The first trip Magee’s team made to Morocco was in 1998, and they have operated in 36 different cities around the country over the past twenty years. In 2008, they established a permanent presence in Morocco by opening a care center in Casablanca. The center provides care year-round to hundreds of patients. Roughly 1 in every 500-700 newborns worldwide are born with a cleft lip or palate, according to the World Health Organization. Although the problem is congenital, those affected grow up having issues with swallowing, talking, as well as self-esteem. The problem is more prevalent among economically disadvantaged families as well, because they usually cannot afford the expensive plastic surgery that is needed.  The mission in Tangier has selected 160 children to undergo operations from December 3 to December 7. The surgeries will be led by a mixed team of eight Moroccan and international specialists. Lines of people waited outside of the hospital for a chance to bring their children in to be operated on, as long-standing issues in Moroccan healthcare are preventing these people from being able to afford it on their own.

Rabat – In an attempt to pacify the fierce protests which have sent thousands of protestors into French streets, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the suspension of the tax increase planned for January, on Tuesday. The French government will suspend the implementation of tax increases on petrol and diesel for six months, while electricity and gas prices will be suspended during the winter, AFP reported. “This anger, you would have to be deaf and blind not to see it, nor hear it,” Philippe said in a televised address after three weeks since the beginning of the yellow vest protests. “No tax merits putting the unity of the nation in danger,” he added. The six-month period will allow consultations  to examine measures that might be introduced to ease the burden of  the serious situation. “The French who have donned yellow vests want taxes to drop, and work to pay. That’s also what we want. If I didn’t manage to explain it, if the ruling majority didn’t manage to convince the French, then something must change,” Philippe said in his televised address. The tax raised prices 23 percent in a year, to an average of €1.51 per liter of diesel, after President Emmanuel Macron introduced a fuel tax to promote alternative energy. The last time fuel prices were this high was the early 2000s, says AFP. Instead of responding to the protesters’ demands initially, Macron chose to condemn the protests which caused a serious crisis during in the second year of his presidency. “Shame on those who have abused other citizens and journalists. Shame on those who have tried to intimidate elected officials. No room for this violence in the Republic,” Macron tweeted on the second weekend of the yellow vest protests. Far-right National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen, who has been on the side of the yellow vest protests, tweeted that she had asked Philippe during their meeting to “end the strategy of confrontation chosen by Emmanuel Macron for the past three weeks.” However, the prime minister’s office said a planned meeting on Tuesday between Philippe and a “yellow vest” delegation had been canceled for “security reasons.” Two of the protest leaders, Jacline Mouraud and Benjamin Cauchy, told AFP, that “they had received threats from hardline protesters who warned them against entering into negotiations with the government.” The demands of the yellow vest movement, which started three weeks ago, are mainly to abolish the fuel tax increase scheduled to take effect January and a higher minimum income. Some protesters ask for the return of a wealth tax on high-earners which the French government canceled in 2017. In his election campaign, French President Emmanuel Macron proposed measures to encourage companies to invest in the country, in turn generating job opportunities. After he became president in May 2017, Macron started implementing tax cuts for entrepreneurs and high-earners. The measures stirred anger among the “yellow vest” protestors who have blocked highways around the country and brought serious destruction to streets, shops, and public property. The protests have resulted in the deaths of four people “including an 80-year-old woman who died in hospital on Sunday after being hit by a tear gas canister in Marseille,” according to AFP. The yellow vest movement developed into fierce street clashes with police in Paris each weekend, which caused the arrest of 412 people on Sunday while 363 remained in custody.

Rabat – Morocco has harvested an estimated 2 million tons of olives this season, an increase by 28 percent compared to the crop last year. During his visit to El Attaouia province in El Kelaa des Sraghna, in the Marrakech-Safi region, at the 5th National Fair of the Olive Tree on Saturday, Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch said that the increase in olive production is due to the “favorable weather conditions.” The olive tree thrives in the Mediterranean climate with yearly temperatures between 15 and 20 degrees Celsius, rainy winters followed by sunny springs, and hot summers. At the closing ceremony of the fair, Akhannouch said that Morocco has become the 4th biggest olive oil producer in the world. Akhannouch emphasized the significance of the main fruit tree cultivated in Morocco. It covers more than 1.07 million hectares, accounting for 65 percent of the tree species in the country. The olive sector is also a major source for employment, providing 380,000 permanent jobs. Women make up 20 percent of workers in the field. The sector contributes to the trade balance by ensuring the inflow of foreign currency estimated at MAD 1.8 billion annually.

Morocco’s principale regions for olive production are Marrakech, Fez, Meknes, and Casablanca. Akhannouch emphasized that olive trees in the Marrakech-Safi region cover an area of 223,600 hectares, constituting 20 percent of the olive areas in Morocco and contributing 487,000 tons, 24 percent, of the national olive production. Investments in the sector are driven by the Green Morocco Plan (PMV), which set up 21,000 hectares of new olive plantations between September 2016 and September 2017, with two-thirds of the plantations part of solidarity-based agricultural projects, “Pillar II” of the plan. The Green Morocco Plan is an ambitious multi-year effort to better develop Morocco’s agricultural sector. The plan has further strengthened Morocco’s agricultural export industry. The 5th National Fair of the Olive Tree, November 28-December 1, sought to provide a platform for debate to discuss the development of the olive sector and define future challenges. A ministry delegation, the Marrakech-Safi governor, and operators in the sector attended the fair.

Rabat – Police in Spain arrested a 46-year old suspect on Monday for allegedly belonging to a terrorist group, the Spanish Ministry of Interior has said. A statement from the ministry said that the Moroccan man is suspected of indoctrination and defending terrorism using the internet. The preliminary investigation found that the suspect had contacts with a member of the terrorist organization called “Jabhat Al Nosra.” The organization is affiliated to Al Qaeda. The suspect, according to the statement, has shown his interest in traveling to Syria to participate in the fighting. The ministry added that the suspect resorted to drug trafficking to finance his travel towards the conflict zone. The statement continued that the 46-year old underwent a radicalization process that made him adapt radical habits and behaviors, such as watching videos of terrorist propaganda praising violent acts in conflict zones. The operation is part of the efforts made by the Spanish government to combat terrorism. Morocco cooperates heavily with Spain to strengthen security in controlling migrant flows and counter-terrorism. Both countries share and exchange intelligence to fight terrorism-related acts. The alarming rapidity of radicalization caused European countries and several countries from other continents to work with Morocco to combat extremism. Morocco’s international security cooperation is well recognized. In a recent report, the US Department of State said that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.”

Rabat – The president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), Aleksander Ceferin,  has said that he will not support a country from another continent to join a European bid to host the 2030 World Cup. Quoted by Al Jazeera, Ceferin expressed that he is not “in favor of cross-confederation bids.” In his first official visit to Morocco in November, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez officially proposed a trio bid between Morocco, Spain, and Portugal for the 2030 World Cup bid. Sanchez announced the news in a press conference he co-chaired with Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Sanchez said that through the bid, “We are launching a joint message, which is that this will be a bid between two continents. The King of Morocco is receptive and we’re going to work on it with Portugal. We are very excited about it.” Morocco already announced its intention to bid for the 2030 World Cup hosting rights, but has not yet announced whether it will accept Spain’s offer. Portugal is also still uncertain whether it is ready for the World Cup adventure. After Sanchez’s announcement, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said that his government has not received any official proposal from Spain regarding the trio bid. Costa said that the proposal is “an uncertain idea that has never been officially put to us, and when it is we naturally have to study it.” Ceferin also said that politicians should stay away from sports decisions.  “Someone should say once to the politicians it’s not up to them to speak if they will be hosts of the Euros or the World Cup or not,” said UEFA president. FIFA and UEFA have rules against any political interference in a sports tournament, but they do not have the right to attack politicians’ expectations. FIFA did not comment on the controversial tweet of US President Donald Trump during the 2026 World Cup bidding campaign, in which he warned  other countries against opposing the North American bid. Morocco competed to host the 2026 World Cup but lost to the North American trio bid in June. Immediately after its loss, Morocco announced its intention to bid again for the right to host the 2030 World Cup. The 2030 World Cup may have many more bids than the 2026 bid when the only bidders were Morocco and the joint bid between Canada, Mexico, and US. Several countries have shown an interest in bidding to host the global tournament, including four Balkan countries, England, and a joint bid from three South American countries: Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay.

Rabat – Spanish authorities have issued a travel warning advising Spanish citizens to be cautious when traveling to Morocco. After the Travel Risk Map 2019 listed Morocco as the only country to have a low risk level in North Africa, showing it to be as safe as most European countries on par with the US and Canada, the Spanish report thought otherwise. Spain’s annual report placed Morocco at the yellow level among 42 other countries where Spanish travelers need to maintain a moderate level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness when traveling.  Spain also ranked multiple countries in South America, Equatorial Guinea, and Rwanda on the same level, according to Moroccan outlet Akhbar Al-Yaoum. The Spanish ABC newspaper indicated that the yellow rating refers to “countries with a high rate of crime though it’s not worrying.” The Café La Crème shooting in Marrakech, November 2017, and assaults against tourists have heavily affected the travel warnings issued by foreign embassies regarding Morocco, a Spanish source told Akhbar Al-Yaoum. According to the Spanish source, Morocco still remains far safer than many other countries where citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance. Tourists are told to be extra cautious in Algeria, to avoid certain areas in Tunisia and Mauritania, and to avoid Libya completely.  American and European governments  regularly update their warning and alert system with information on continuing threats of terrorism, political violence, and criminal activity towards tourists abroad.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) might consider Morocco as an alternative host to Cameroon. The head coach of the national football team, Herve Renard, believes that Morocco is the right choice to host the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Renard believes that Morocco is ready in terms of infrastructure to host the African tournament. The coach expressed his hope for Morocco to be designated as host country for CAN 2019 “even if it will add extra pressure.” Cameroon lost eligibility to host the competition after inspections  of the country’s sports venues revealed that it was not ready to host the tournament. CAF will now start a new bidding process to appoint another host for the CAN, which will take place from June 15 to July 17. While Morocco repeatedly supported Cameroon’s bid before CAF made its decision, the North African country might compete with South Africa and other countries to host it. 🗨️ Hervé Renard : “Le Maroc est prêt à accueillir la #CAN2019, mais rien n’a été décidé !” pic.twitter.com/0Sep4PaEAU — beIN SPORTS (@beinsports_FR) 30 novembre 2018  Morocco’s successful experience in hosting the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN) might help Morocco clinch the rights to host CAF’s flagship tournament. Morocco’s Atlas Lions will take part in the CAF competition after a well deserved qualification. Fouzi Lekjaa, head of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) said that although the national team has had several exceptional generations of teams, Morocco has not been able to win the CAN since 1976.  He added that Morocco’s Atlas Lions and coach Herve Renard have received criticism. Lekjaa then called on critics to stop the “sterile criticism. We trust Herve Renard who has brought a lot to the Atlas Lions.” He also called for unity and support for both the coach and team. Morocco’s football team has delivered several solid performances, especially at the 2018 World Cup in their games against Portugal and Spain. In the 2019 CAN qualifiers, Morocco also received applause from their fans after they “broke the curse” and beat Cameroon 2-0.

Rabat – After a visit on Monday, King Mohammed VI was pleased to see the health status of the Gabonese president is improving, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The Gabonese president arrived in Rabat on November 29 to recuperate following a stroke in Saudi Arabia. The King requested the transfer of the Gabonese president, suggesting he finish his recovery in Morocco instead of London. On November 27, Ondimba’s wife Sylvia Bongo Ondimba announced that the president would leave Riyadh for Rabat to finish recovering. Gabon’s vice president, Pierre Claver Maganga Moussavou, has taken over official duties in Bongo’s absence. The monarch and the Gabonese president share a strong friendship. In 2017, Bongo shared a picture of himself and the King as teenageers. The picture illustrates the long-standing friendship between the two leaders.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI appointed Chami during a royal reception at the Royal Palace in Rabat on Monday. He will replace Nizar Baraka, who has held the position since August 2013. CESE provides advisory services to the government and the two Houses of Parliament. The Council gives opinions on the general orientations of the national economy and sustainable development. Chami is the former Minister of Industry, and he held the post between 2007 and 2011. He is currently the Moroccan ambassador to the European Union in Brussels, and has worked in this capacity since 2016.  Chami holds an engineering degree of the Central School of Paris, which he obtained in 1985, and an MBA from the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA,  obtained in 1989. Chami was also a deputy of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) of Fes between 2011 and 2016. The newly appointed CESE president held several positions with Microsoft, namely as head of the North and West Africa regions and the Southeast Asia region. The King established the CESE as an independent constitutional institution in February 2011. During Monday’s reception, the King also appointed Younes Benakki as Secretary General of the CESE. The monarch also appointed Latifa Akharbach as the new president of the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA).

Rabat – On Monday, the Casablanca Court of First Instance adjourned the trial of seven individuals suspected of supplying dog meat to markets and small fast food shops in Mohammedia, a city near Casablanca. The suspects’ family members were present at the trial, along with a few human rights activists who decried, amid heated debates between the defense and the prosecution, the crime committed against consumers and their health.  The judge adjourned the trial to allow the defense more time to prepare. Last week, the Royal Gendarmerie forces in the region dismantled the ring after they caught three of them promoting rotten beef from diseased cattle in addition to dog meat. The gendarmes found and seized sharp weapons and meat grinders found in the possession of the individuals. News of the suspects act has shocked and disgusted Moroccans, who expressed anger on social media. Some called on the court to hand down severe penalties to the suspects for threatening health, while others condemned the heinous acts against stray dogs.
 Murder of stray dogs is not uncommon in Morocco, and the reasons vary. Some of the recent publicized acts of violence took place in April, when dozens of stray dogs were shot in the coastal city of Agadir ahead of a visit by the FIFA 2026 Bid Evaluation Task Force, which was meant to determine  Morocco’s eligibility to host the 2026 World Cup. Photos and videos of the “gruesome incident” made international headlines, both shocking and angering people. Animals continue to be vulnerable to acts of violence, and there is not a law that punishes the abuse. It remains to be seen whether Morocco will enact legal punishments for cruelty and inhumanity towards animals.

Rabat – The tourism allowance will be linked to paid income tax, and the measure will be included in the Foreign Exchange Instruction, which is expected to be published and implemented in January 2019. This means that the tourism allowance (capped at 40,000 dirhams per year) would increase as a function of the paid income tax.

The minimum level would remain at MAD 40,000 and the surplus would equal the percentage of the paid income tax and capped at MAD 100,000 or MAD 150,000 per person per year, depending on the threshold of the currency reserves.

Impact studies on Morocco’s foreign exchange reserves are being conducted to establish the linking percentage (e.g. 50 percent of the paid tax, with a cap and a minimum).

Authorized intermediaries, bureaux de change, and money transfer companies duly authorized to carry out manual exchange can issue a foreign exchange allocation of a maximum amount of MAD 40,000 each year to Moroccans residing abroad, Moroccan and foreign individuals residing in Morocco, dual nationals, and minor children holding foreign passports.

Rabat – Qatar has officially announced its desire to end its membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which controls 40 percent of global oil reserves. Speaking at a news conference in Doha, the Gulf country’s energy minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi declared his country’s plan to withdraw from OPEC, claiming that the country wants to refocus and reassess its investments and development strategies. But the Qatari official, aware that the sudden announcement may generate speculation, especially given Qatar’s cold relations with Saudi Arabia, was quick to add that the move was not a grudge-dictated decision.  The ongoing feud with Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with the decision, Al-Kaabi insisted. Instead, he explained, Qatar has thought the move through for months, finally deciding that it was better to focus on natural gas, the country’s strong point. “The withdrawal decision reflects Qatar’s desire to focus its efforts on plans to develop and increase its natural gas production from 77 million tonnes per year to 110 million tonnes in the coming years,” he said. OPEC, a 15-country-strong bloc, dictates much of the fluctuations in global oil prices. Qatar joined the bloc in 1961, a year after the organization was founded. Saudi Arabia, a leading oil producer, was one of the pioneers of OPEC. Riyadh stills caries a strong voice in the bloc. Qatar, meanwhile, felt that it was not a big fish in the OPEC pool. “We are a small player in OPEC, and I’m a businessman, it doesn’t make sense for me to focus on things that are not our strength, and gas is our strength so that is why we’ve made this decision.” In addition to being a potential source of online and diplomatic speculation about the deteriorating ties between Doha and Riyadh, Qatar’s bombshell announcement also comes prior to an OPEC meeting scheduled for Thursday, December 6. In Qatar’s defense, Al-Kaabi said that Doha wants to “develop a future strategy based on growth and expansion, both in its activities at home and abroad.” Qatar Petroleum, the country’s top oil company, tweeted in confirmation: “Qatar announces it was withdrawing from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ‘OPEC’ effective 1 January 2019.” Qatar is home to major natural gas fields. Together with Iran, the Gulf nation is home to North Field, the world’s largest natural gas field.  While analysts maintain that the worsening rift played a role in Qatar’s sudden withdrawal from OPEC, Al-Kaabi was adamant that Doha is only eying an alternative that would yield more benefits to its aspirations for the “coming years.” “Achieving our ambitious growth strategy will undoubtedly require focused efforts, commitment and dedication to maintain and strengthen Qatar’s position as the leading natural gas producer,” he said. Qatar is the first OPEC member to withdraw since the bloc was established in 1960.

Rabat – The office of Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced earlier today that the head of state, who was set to host Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, had to cancel the meeting due to acute flu.  The Saudi prince arrived in Algeria late on Sunday for a two-day visit as part of his “world tour.” The cancellation of the meeting between Mohammed bin Salman and the Algerian president is likely to result in speculations that Bouteflika withdrew himself from the scheduled meeting with MBS to avoid criticism. At the announcement of the Saudi prince’s plan to visit Algeria, activists and some politicians raised their voice to object to the visit, calling it an “insult” and an “affront” to the country’s history.  The public outcry that surrounded MBS visit–both in Algeria and in other countries in the Maghreb region–may have to the Algerian president’s last-minute change of heart regarding the pair’s meeting, many have suggested. Meanwhile, other speculations include heightened concern about Bouteflika’s deteriorating health and his fitness for Office. Seizing the “flu” opportunity, some are asking whether Bouteflika is able to run a presidential campaign during the 2019 election. In power since 1999, Bouteflika seeks re-election for a fifth term during the 2019 Algerian presidential elections.  The National Liberation Front (FLN), Algeria’s ruling party, confirmed the president’s decision to run for a fifth term. FLN leadership is unanimously supporting Bouteflika’s fifth term aspirations, plainly disregard concerns over the ailing president’s degrading health conditions.   Former French Ambassador to Algeria Bernard Bajolet also questioned Bouteflika’s ability to lead. He said that Bouteflika is kept alive “artificially.” Last week, CEO of Cevital Algerie Issad Rebrab  said that Bouteflika is not even “aware” of the recent developments happening in the country. “An invisible hand is governing Algeria,” the businessman said. Amid speculations about Bouteflika’s decision not to personally host MBS, AFP reported that the crown prince’s visit in Algeria was greeted with outcry. A group of 17 “prominent journalists and intellectuals” harshly criticized MBS’ presence in Algeria, according to AFP. Abderrazak Makri of the Islamist Movement of Society for Peace said that MBS’s visit “does not serve Algeria’s image nor its reputation.” Bouteflika suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013. Several analysts and journalists recommended Bouteflika withdraw from the presidential election, questioning his ability to lead. The same scenario happened when MBS offered to include Morocco in his world tour. King Mohammed VI, however, refused to personally receive him due to busy agenda.

Rabat – Khat Echahid, a group of Saharawi di^polssidents, has addressed the international community in a letter that challenges Polisario’s current standing on the world stage.  The letter, Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported, aims to discredit Polisario, contesting the separatist front’s right to represent Western Sahara at the UN-led negotiating table.  The group’s letter comes as all stakeholders in the conflict prepare to attend a UN-monitored roundtable in Geneva on December 5-6. According to Khat Echahid’s letter, the most sustainable solution to the dispute is a sincere dialogue between Algeria and Morocco. The takeaway, as the group’s statement went on to say, is that Polisario is a pawn and does not carry the legitimacy to sit at the negotiating table. “Only Morocco and Algeria are qualified to de-escalate tensions and ultimately end the conflict,” according to the Sahrawi group. Created in 1973, the Polisario Front is a separatist group that has been calling for independence in Western Sahara. According to Khat Echahid, however, the front is only a small group of combatants usurping Sahrawis’ political rights and profiting off the status quo. “Polisario only represents itself,” the dissidents’ message asserted. They claimed that the front is not any more legitimate or popular with locals than Khat Echahid is. Should the international community decide to proceed with Polisario at the Geneva roundtable, Khat Echahid believes they should also be invited to participate.   Accusing the separatist front of periodically de-escalating tensions to catch the world’s attention by presenting themselves as freedom fighters, Khat Echahid invited the UN to dispatch “an independent observatory group in refugee camps [in Tindouf] to see that Polisario does not carry any legitimacy.”  Polisario, they stressed, tells a biased and incomprehensive story of the situation in Western Sahara as they “wish to eternally benefit off the current status quo.”  Khat Echahid has recently established itself as the most outspoken and vocal anti-Polisario “internal opposition party.” The group describes itself as “internal dissidents” or “opposition” and has been asking to be granted the same rights as Polisario on the global stage.

Rabat – Two Moroccan films have made it to the 14th Mobile Film Festival focusing on human rights, gender equality, the migrant crisis, and the struggles of LGBTQ+ individuals. The Mobile Film Festival invites participants globally to make a one-minute film using their mobile phones. This year, the festival’s theme, “#StandUp4HumanRights,”  commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The festival’s films featured sensitive topics, such as the migrant crisis, violence against women, and homophobia. It ran November 6-27.  On December 4 in Paris, winning candidates will receive €20,000 which will go towards the production of a short film.  Of 715 submissions from 81 countries, the festival’s jury selected 51 films from 19 countries, including the two Moroccan short mobile films, “Wet Drawing” and “Article 1.”  “Wet Drawing” addresses the issue of the migrant crisis. In just one minute, it depicts a tragic story  of families crossing the sea to seek asylum, only to lose “everything during their suicidal journeys.” This is not far from the reality of irregular migration. The film, by Achraf Maadadi, shows a man reading at the beach, who notices his two children digging out objects from the wet sand: schoolbooks and wet papers. As the man makes his way to the shore, he discovers a worn out, soggy teddy bear, a child’s bag, and a wet drawing. The child’s family drawing read, in faded colors, “Mama” and “Papa.” With a sad expression, the man looks up from the drawing and leaves, allowing the sea to swallow the lonely, wet drawing.  Thousands of migrants throw themselves at the mercy of the sea in search of a better life. Those that do survive see that sometimes reality is not what they had expected, while others drown with their dreams. In the first nine months of 2018, 13 percent of the undocumented migrants who attempted to reach Europe tried to cross the Mediterranean or Atlantic from Morocco. In the same period, 7,100 Moroccans attempted to cross to Spain, according to official Spanish sources. “Article 1” by “C5 A” students of La Ribambelle school in Casablanca touches upon gender equality. The film refers to Article 1 of the Moroccan 2011 Constitution.  The article reads: “Morocco is a constitutional, democratic, parliamentary and social Monarchy.” The film shows six children, three boys and three girls, at a classroom arguing in French about one line “All humans are born equal in rights.” In French, the word “homme” stands for both “human” and “man,” which becomes the center of their argument. One of the girls interrupted and ended the argument by reading from a dictionary that “homme” stands for “male or female” and went on to explain about how both sexes are equal.   Article 19 of the Moroccan Constitution stress that “the man and the woman enjoy, in equality, the rights and freedoms of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental character.”  For years, women around the world have been working to achieve gender equality and eliminate gender-based violence.  In September, the Moroccan government passed Law 103-13 to eliminate violence against women, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination. The law promises prison sentences ranging from one to six months for people who sexually harass women in public spaces. Harassment is defined as the use of words, acts, or signals of a sexual nature for sexual purposes. It remains to be seen whether Morocco will bring a law that protects sexual minorities in the future. The mobile phone festival was organized in partnership with the United Nations, Youtube, and the European Union, under the patronage of French President Emmanuel Macron. Since 2005, the Mobile Film Festival has promoted young talents in the international competition requiring “ 1 mobile – 1 minute – 1 film.”

Rabat – On November 11, the finance committee of the House of Representatives adopted some of the amendments from the 2019 Finance Bill, which included a tax increase of 50 percent on soft and non-carbonated drinks with high sugar levels. A VAT of MAD 70 per 100 liters was applied to sales of the sweet drinks with 5 or more grams of sugar per 100 milliliters. After consulting councillors and a hot debate within the committee members on Sunday, the government abolished the MAD 70 VAT on soft drinks. The decision was made after the soft drink manufacturers opposed the VAT, arguing that the tax is “not retrieved” so it is not considered a VAT. On the other hand, the 50 percent domestic consumption tax increase on soft drinks will be implemented gradually and based on sugar content. According to the councillors’ new amendments, no domestic consumption tax will be applicable for soft drinks containing less than 5 grams of sugar per 100 milliliters.  However, a 25 percent increase on domestic consumption tax will be implemented on soft and non-carbonated drinks containing 5-10 grams of sugar per 100 milliliters, and a 50 percent increase for soft drinks with more than 10 grams of sugar per 100 milliliters, according to Medias 24. Morocco’s 2019 Finance Bill allocated MAD 17.67 billion for the subsidy fund to subsidize butane gas, sugar, and flour. The figure is a significant increase of MAD 4.65 billion from the 2018 budget. Soft drink manufacturers are the biggest beneficiaries from the state subsidy on sugar. Morocco provides an MAD 3.7 billion subsidy on sugar annually for consumers, 40 percent of which goes to manufacturers. Manufacturers currently return only MAD 1 per kilogram of consumed sugar out of a total subsidy of MAD 2.8 per kilograms. Beginning January 2019, the concerned manufacturers will start returning the remaining MAD 1.8 per kilogram gradually. By 2021, manufacturers will be returning to the total subsidy of 2.8 per kilogram. The government expects to generate over MAD 313 million from domestic consumption taxes on soft drinks in 2019. The increased tax may make consumers reduce their consumption of soft drinks and juices and make manufacturers revise the sugar quantity they put in the drinks.

Rabat – French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe met with French political officials on Monday to discuss the continuing Yellow Vest protests. Philippe gathered members of the French administration to develop a solution to the current unrest in France. Philippe even cancelled a planned appearance at the COP24 climate change summit in Poland to call the meeting, according to France 24.  After returning from the G20 summit in Argentina, President Macron also held a talk with the prime minister, along with the interior minister and security officials.  Both branches of the legislative body of France will also address the issue. The National Assembly plans to discuss the protests during its session on Wednesday, and the Senate will do the same on Thursday. Various government officials addressed the public over the weekend, and Macron spoke at the Arc de Triomphe calling for calm. The finance minister also made promises to decrease government spending to end the unrest. Several people were injured during the violent protests over the weekend. Officials reported 263 people were injured due to the rioting, 133 of those injuries happening in Paris. The French police also reported that they took 412 people into custody during the weekend, with 378 still in jail as of today.  Three people have died in the protests since they started, , mostly due to traffic accidents as a result of the protests. Protestors burned cars along streets and vandalized buildings, scrawling graffiti on buildings and monuments throughout the capital. At the height of protests on November 17, protest numbers reached 282,000 people, but  have since decreased. However, the government claims protesters continue to damage property and use violence due to people purposely inciting violence. Macron faces a dilemma with the Yellow Vest protests. Originally campaigning as a “Man of the People,” he is being forced to quell a grassroots movement. His approval ratings fell after he introduced several tax cuts for the wealthy and businesses and increased taxes on fuel. The middle and lower class in France interpreted the policies as a betrayal of them for the benefit of the rich. As a result, Macron now faces the largest French civil unrest in 50 years with no clear way out.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced its delegation to the Western Sahara talks in Geneva Wednesday and Thursday, December 5-6. Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita will lead the delegation. The delegation will also include Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Omar Hilale, President of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid, and President of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region Ynja Khattat. The Laayoune and Dakhla regions lie within Western Sahara. Fatima Adli, a member of the Smara municipal council, will be also accompanying the delegation. The Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Horst Kohler invited Morocco to the talks on September 28. The ministry emphasized that the invitation was sent to Morocco, Algeria, the Polisario Front, and Mauritania. The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, said that the UN meeting in Geneva is a roundtable for talks and not for negotiations. He emphasized that there will be no direct negotiations at the roundtable with Polisario, and Morocco will not accept any solution against its sovereignty in the southern provinces. The meeting in Geneva is an initial move toward future negotiations to find a mutually acceptable and an agreed upon solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. It remains to be seen whether Algeria will accept its role in the conflict. Morocco considers Algeria’s involvement in the UN-led political process a priority. Algeria, however, considers itself only an “observer” to the conflict. Morocco refers to Algeria as a main party. The Moroccan diplomatic corps was satisfied with the decision of the UN Security Council, when it adopted Resolution 2440, to mention Algeria as a “neighboring” country instead. Morocco also welcomed the resolution’s decision to call on Algeria and the other parties to work “constructively” with Kohler throughout the UN-led process.

Rabat – The Center for International Policy (CIP) has released a report exploring the strings Riyadh has pulled to weave an amicable relationship with Washington, to illegally support election campaigns, and to influence US foreign policy. Saudi Arabia has taken a blow recently as Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) has been implicated as the mastermind behind the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, but even last year, Saudi Arabia spent millions to improve its image in the US while their bilateral ties were strengthening. Since 2017, Saudi Arabia has enjoyed relations with the US upon the election of US President Donald Trump. According to the report, the kingdom spent $27 million on firms registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), the legal apparatus for international lobbying, in 2017. The CIP also implicates Saudi Arabia in illegal spending in the US: Donating to election campaigns. The FARA firms Saudi Arabia paid spent $2.3 million on campaign contributions. Of those contributions, nearly $400,000 were made to congressmen which the FARA firms had contacted on Saudi Arabia’s behalf. On twelve occasions, the firms contacted the congressmen for Saudi Arabia and made campaign contributions on the same day. The report suggested that Saudi Arabia made donations through FARA firms to circumvent US federal law, which prohibits foreign donations influencing federal elections. Saudi Arabia’s FARA firms donated to the campaigns of 75 senators and members of the House of Representatives, all of which the firms had contacted on behalf of Saudi Arabia. Trump’s presidency coincided with Saudi Arabia’s forming of partnerships with 29 public relation firms aiming to form and strengthen ties between Riyadh and US congressmen. Some 100 individuals Saudi Arabia hired as registered foreign agents made more than 2,500 political contacts in 2017. “Saudi lobbyists contacted more than 200 different Congressional offices and every single Senators’ office,” the report states, according to Saudi Arabia’s 2017 FARA filings. Lobbying firms like the Glover Park Group and BRG Group, have since turned down their Saudi clients following Khashoggi’s murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on October 2. The investigation mentioned that some of the most cited reasons Saudi lobbyists used for contacting congressional offices in 2017 included “Yemen,” “Qatar,” and the “Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act” (JASTA), a law which allowed the ongoing lawsuit by families of 9/11 victims against Saudi Arabia. The report also noted that Saudi Arabia was Trump’s destination in his first trip abroad soon after he entered the presidency. Bin Salman and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner became close friends and paved the way for a closer friendship between Trump and Saudi Arabia. The report states that during Trump’s trip to the kingdom in May 2017, “Trump and Kushner were given the royal treatment and lavished with gifts.” “Trump was given the opportunity to grandstand on the global stage, announcing a $110 billion arms deal with the Kingdom, which has subsequently been shown to be inaccurate but continues to be asserted by the President.” Shortly after the historical visit, the US increased its support of Saudi Arabia on several levels, from the blockade against Qatar and the war in Yemen to the purchasing of weapons, the Iran nuclear deal, and even JASTA.

Rabat – Morocco has  approved the license application from Predator Oil, allowing the company to explore for gas in Guercif, a town in eastern Morocco. The eight-year licence will start with an initial 30 months of exploration across 7,269 square kilometers “to the east of producing gas fields and northwest of Sound Energy PLC’s Tendrara gas project,” according to Proactive Investors. The industry website added that the company will hold a 75 percent stake in the project. The Moroccan National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining  (ONHYM) will only have a 25 percent stake in the project. Predator Oil CEO  Paul Griffiths said that the company selected “Guercif based on its 12 years’ experience of exploring and financing Moroccan opportunities.” He also said that the region “represents a high impact, low cost, near-term drilling opportunities in a sophisticated and stable business and operating environment that is well understood by management.” The CEO expressed excitement in the project, saying that it “represents an asset that will fit very well with the company’s strategy of developing gas opportunities.” Morocco has attracted several international companies, including Sound Energy, a British oil company.  On June 6, 2016, Sound Energy made its first natural gas discovery in the Tendrara area in eastern Morocco. The TE-6 well encountered approximately 28 meters of vertical net gas pay.predotopredator oil  However, the company failed to find natural gas at the TE-9 well in the region. The TE-9 well was drilled to a total measured depth of 2,925 meters and will now be plugged, abandoned, and not tested.

Rabat – In a phone interview during Egyptian television program “Sada El Balad” (The Country’s Echo), the president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, Turki Al Sheikh, has pledged his support for Morocco to host the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. “Morocco, this brother country, deserves all our respect. We are ready to support it, and meet all its needs,” he said. Al Sheikh added that Saudi Arabia is ready to “mobilize all” its resources if “our Moroccan brothers ask us.” In September, Al Sheikh offered support for Morocco to host the 2019 CAN on his official Twitter account, surprising Moroccan football fans.  “In my capacity as President of the Arab Football Federation, I announce my full support for the brotherly Morocco in hosting the African Nations Championship instead of Cameroon,” said Al Sheikh. Last week, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) decided to strip the CAN hosting rights from Cameroon because it has not completed the venues and projects for the tournament. Why a surprise? Al Sheikh’s position is puzzling because it comes amid tension in Moroccan-Saudi diplomatic ties. Al Sheikh also led a campaign against Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Throughout the competition, Al Sheikh tweeted anti-Moroccan sentiments and politicized the sports competition. Morocco’s neutrality in the Gulf crisis between the Saudi-led coalition and Qatar angered Saudi officials, especially Al Sheikh. Al Sheikh said in one of his controversial tweets, “Some people went astray. If you want our support, you should seek it in Riyadh. What you are doing is wasting your time. Now ask the pseudo-state to help you,” referring to Qatar. One of the advisers of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Al Sheikh also lobbied for the United 2026 World Cup bid. Since then Saudi and Moroccan diplomatic ties have experienced tense times. When Mohammed bin Salman planned his “world tour” for last week, King Mohammed VI refused to personally receive him if he came to Morocco. An anonymous Moroccan source in the government told Morocco World News that King Mohammed VI refused to personally receive MBS, bringing up his “busy agenda.”  Morocco, however, did not decline the crown prince’s visit entirely, but offered for bin Salman to meet the King’s brother Prince Moulay Rachid instead. MBS rejected the King’s proposal.

Rabat – Maintaining the status quo in Western Sahara does not benefit any party, German foreign minister Heiko Maas said on Thursday. He made the remarks at a joint press conference with Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita after their meeting in Berlin. Maas stressed the need to seize every opportunity for integrated regional development.
 The German minister added that all parties need to adopt constructive attitudes at the roundtable talks on Western Sahara this week in Geneva. Maas reiterated his country’s support for the UN-led political process and for Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara Horst Kohler. German investments in Morocco are growing significantly and have great potential for further development, Bourita said.  Bourita described the cooperation between the two countries as exemplary in areas such as the environment, water, and agriculture. He noted that these areas are conducive to triangular cooperation with Africa. In 2012, then European Parliament President and German politician Martin Schulz made a similar statement, calling the situation in the Sahara “no longer tenable.”

The 17th Marrakech International Film Festival kicked off on Friday. At a press conference on Saturday German actor Daniel Bruhl explained that the jury is “very interested to see fresh voices” in the fourteen films competing for the festival’s Etoile d’Or (Golden Star) prize. Asked about gender equality in the film industry, a topic broached at film festivals from Cannes to Venice, Fifty Shades star Dakota Johnson said, “There were almost as many women involved in cinema behind the camera, in front of the camera, behind film festivals and in film festivals.”  Johnson continued by applauding the Marrakech International Film Festival for having more women than men on the jury panel. “This jury happens to have more women and perhaps there might be an avenue for this to occur more often in the future, and I think that’s awesome.” Women’s roles and treatment in the cinema industry is improving. Film narratives are changing as “there are lots of different films and roles that do great business at the box office with women in lead roles,” said Indian actress Ileana D’Cruz. The FIFM celebrates the achievement and talent of women in film this year with six films directed by women nominated among the 14 films competing for the Etoile D’or. The female directors include Alejandra Marquez Abella, Sudabeh Mortezai, Lila Aviles, Sayaka Kai, Nadejda Koseva, and Eva Trobisch. The second day of the festival offered screenings of two motion pictures with women in leading roles: Alejandra Marquez Abella’s “The Good Girls” and Sudabeh Mortezai’s “Joy.”  “The Good Girls” shines a crystalline light on upper-class women facing social decay during Mexico’s 1982 economic crisis. Sudabeh Mortezai’s “Joy,” winner of Best Film at BFI London Film Festival, sheds light on women from a different spectrum in society. The drama tackles sex trafficking issues among Nigerian migrant sex workers. Many stars turned up on the red carpet for the event: Kevin Dillon from Oliver Stone’s “Platoon,” Laurence Fishburne from “The Matrix,” “Burnout” director Noureddine Lakhmari, and the godfather of cinema himself, Robert De Niro.  FIFM paid homage to Robert De Niro, awarding him the Etoile D’or Saturday evening for his immense body of work.  Academy award winner and De Niro’s lifetime friend Martin Scorsese presented the award to De Niro.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI congratulated Raja of Casablanca on winning the African Confederation Cup, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The Moroccan monarch held a phone call with the President of the club, Jawad Ziyat, the coach of the team, Juan Carlos Garrido, and his captain, Badr Banoun, “expressing their heartfelt congratulations on this coronation that comes after a brilliant course,” according to the same source. During this telephone conversation, which took place after the match held tonight at the Martyrs Stadium in Kinshasa against the Congolese team of AS Vita Club, the Sovereign has entrusted the president, the coach and the captain of the Casablanca team with conveying his congratulations to the players, staff and supporters of the Raja team for “this important triumph, a source of pride for the entire sports public and the Moroccan people.” Raja of Casablanca won its first continental title in 15 years and its second Confederation Cup title on Sunday night in Kinshasa following a breathtaking match.

Rabat – Morocco’s Raja of Casablanca won the African Confederation Cup despite a dramatic 3-1 defeat in the second leg of the final, which took place tonight in Kinshasa. Kinshasa was never going to be easy for Raja of Casablanca, especially after slapping DR Congo’s Vita in an unforgettable night in Casablanca. So when the Moroccans walked down the Congolese stadium, they did so, as their coach said in the pre-match press conference, with the feeling of a tough but achievable mission. They knew that the Congolese side is famous for being clinical and rapacious at home. So they had to deal with it. Raja started the game rather confidently. Perhaps in a bid to maintain their first leg dominance, the Moroccans kicked off with tempo and energy, indefatigably running at the Congolese. The Moroccans were impressive, rampant, offensive, and dominant. At least during the first 20 minutes. That first half energy was soon rewarded. Just 21 minutes in the game, Raja’s Abdelilah Hafidi sent home a fine goal. It was not only a goal, though. It was a staggering statement, one that evinced all the importance that Raja attached to the continental glory that has not been theirs since 2003. At 1-0 in favor of the away side, it was difficult for the home side, the Congolese, not to feel haunted, hunted. The crowd begged for, demanded a reaction. Faithful to their pristine home reputation, however, Vita players progressively grew into the game. Such, in fact, was their growth that, in the last minutes of the first half, they announced what the second would be like for Raja: a nightmare, a hellish experience. One of those moments when you pray the gods of the game to already end the suffering that the opponents are callously inflicting on your side. At 45+4, in the dying minutes of the first half, Vita’s Jean-Marc Makusu scored the equalizer. That was never enough to bring hope back. But it counted—crucially. Armed with their famous “home winner” mentality, Vita stressed Raja to their core, crushing the Moroccans’ tactical disposition and forcing them to defend. So intense was the Congolese pressure that Raja was reduced to a defensive team. Stylish, dominant, irrepressible, stubborn, and impossibly invasive, Vita were all over the place. Raja tried to resist, but the heat proved unbearable. So they gave in reluctantly, frustratingly, ruefully. 2-1 at minute 71, 3-1 at the 74th minute, it was now Raja that stood incredibly shocked at the seemingly imperturbable composure of this bunch of Congolese lads who actually believed that a miracle was possible. Perhaps aware that playing offensively would amount to nothing but reckless lack of judgment, Raja’s Spanish coach instructed his players to park the bus. But isn’t that what Raja had been doing for the entire second half? So he told them to park it even further, to erect a defensive citadel so impenetrable that Vida’s attacking would ultimately sound laughable. That was it. Ultimately, Raja suffered greatly, but they won deservedly, at least when you consider how dominant they, too, had been at home just a week ago. It was a commendable display from Vita, but an enterprising match from Raja, for in the end they won. On aggregate, the score sheet read 4-3 in favor of Raja, definitely sealing the Moroccans’ first major continental trophy in 15 years.

Rabat – Youssef wore the transparent dress at Cairo Film Festival, exposing her legs and part of her buttocks. Many conservative Egyptians have expressed outrage. Others, however, have spoken in support of Youssef’s freedom dress as she sees fit.  A judicial source told AFP that “Youssef maybe imprisoned for up to 5 years, if convicted.” Meanwhile, the 44-old-actress apologized and said that she wouldn’t wear the dress if she knew it would provoke a controversy. Two Egyptian attorneys, Amro Abdelsalam and Samir Sabri, have filled a complaint against Youssef. They are infamous for filing lawsuits against celebrities. Sabri told AFP that Youssef’s dress does not conform with the Egyptian society’s principles, traditions, and moral values. He argued that the celebrity’s disregard for Egypt’s traditional dressing codes negatively reflected on the reputation of the Cairo Film Festival and Egyptian women in particular. The Egyptian Actors’ Syndicate also criticized the “appearance of some of the guests,” which it said “undermined the festival and the union”. “It was the first time that I wore it and I did not realize it would spark so much anger,” Youssef posted on her Twitter account. She reaffirmed her commitment to the Egyptian values and morals she grew up with.  Last year an Egyptian court jailed singer Shaimaa Ahmed for two years. The singer was suedfor appearing in a music video in her underwear while suggestively eating a banana. The sentence was later reduced to a year.

Rabat – The new president was sworn in on Saturday, promising radical change in his country. In a petition published on November 29, a group of NGOs said that the invitation sent to Polisario’s members for the inauguration of Mexico’s elected president is a “serious violation of Mexican democracy.” According to a joint statement published by Ambajadastv.com, the group of NGOs was surprised by the presence of “ a fictitious state not recognized by the United Nations or by the great powers such as China, Russia, the United States, France, and the entire European Union.” The statement challenged Mexican authorities’ decision to invite the “head of a fictional entity” to take part in a symbolic event like the presidential inauguration. While stressing Morocco’s contribution to stability and the security at the international level, the NGOs continued,  “What message do we want to convey to the international system and, in particular, to North Africa? “Let us not forget that Morocco’s role is to be a guarantor of stability and security, while the fictitious SADR is objectively and clearly a separatist group with obvious links to radicalism terrorism, smuggling.” The  visit, the statement elaborated, stood “in blatant contradiction with the democratic principles advocated by the ruling party (Movement for National Regeneration, Morena, of Castro-Chavista obedience); it is all the more serious that this visit is officially stamped in the heart of a symbol of our democracy .” The group of NGOs that denounced Polisario’s participation consisted of, among others, the Global Africa Foundation for Mexico, the Civil Society Assembly of Guerrero, and Urbana de Oaxaca. Morocco was also represented at said presidential inauguration. Morocco’s speaker of the House of Representatives, Lahbib El Malki, attended the event on behalf of  King Mohammed VI. King Felipe of Spain and the US Vice President Mike Pence also attended the ceremony. El Malki told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that he conveyed to the Mexican president King Mohammed VI’s congratulations and his sincere wishes for full success during his presidential tenure. El Malki also met with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard on Friday to discuss ways to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation.

Rabat – After a hectic week, a protest-tainted visit in Tunisia and a failed G20 summit in Argentina, Mohammed bin Salman arrived today in Nouakchott, Mauritania, amid yet another public uproar. Students and human right activist groups defied the Mauritanian government on Saturday, on the eve of the Saudi Crown Prince’s visit. In Nouakchott, thousands took to the streets to object to the scheduled visit of “a war criminal” and “a human rights abuser.” On Friday, a group of students called for nationwide protests to prevent the Saudi Crown Prince from setting foot on the “pure Mauritanian soil.” The group even petitioned the country’s government, requesting that Mauritanian authorities sever ties with Saudi Arabia as long as Riyadh remains engaged in the war in Yemen. Mohamed Ould Sidi, president of the student association spearheading the anti-Crown Prince protests in Mauritania, told Mauritanian outlet Al-Araby al-Jadeed: “We Mauritanians will not stand by and let the murderer of Yemeni children pollute our soil.” Ould Sidi explained that Mohammed bin Salman is also “responsible for jailing countless oulemas” and “uses the Saudi judiciary apparatus to silence opposition.” While Saudi TV channels showed footage of a smiling Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, arriving in Mauritania earlier today, according to Turkish outlet Yeni Safak, protesters in Nouakchott gathered to chant defying slogans addressed to both MBS and Mauritanian authorities, whom they accused of putting Saudi money and interests before the will of the Mauritanian people. On various main streets in Nouakchott, protesters sang in chorus “The people does not want Bin Salman,” or “The people wants the bloodbath to stop,” referring to the war in Yemen in Saudi Arabia’s harsh treatment of local dissidents. Algeria is MBS’s next destination. The Saudi prince is set to arrive in Algiers on December 6. Meanwhile, Algerian civil society has decried the scheduled visit, calling it an affront. Morocco, which withdrew itself from the Saudi prince’s agenda, is the only Maghreb country that has not been associated with MBS’ “world tour.”

Rabat – The decision was made at the meeting of pharmacists unions on Thursday, November 29, in Casablanca. The federation deplored the “irresponsible” treatment of the Ministry of Health regarding their claim book, namely the fiscal and legislative aspects related to the situation of community pharmacies. The FNSPM are demanding five flagship measures in the claim book, including putting an end to the anarchy that characterizes the planning of on-call pharmacies and the opening and closing hours of pharmacies in some cities.  Included in pharmacists’ demands is the regulation of the sale of veterinary drugs. They demand that t the sale of such drugs be exclusively granted to pharmacies. The demands also contain the establishment of medical coverage for pharmacists. The medical coverage should take into account the fragile socio-economic situation of pharmacies, on which the amount of the contribution will be based. They also requested the right to substitution, a medical mechanism to cope with the increasingly frequent phenomenon of stock-outs, in a context marked by the proliferation of generic medicines. Meanwhile, Pharmacists request an urgent reform of the sector’s taxation. They want to benefit from a tax exemption measure, considering it as the only way to mitigate the crisis affecting the sector.

Rabat – Paying a homage to the legendary actor, director and producer, the festival honored yesterday De Niro with the prestigious Golden Star in tribute to his outstanding acting career.  A friend and a colleague, Martin Scorsese handed the star to  De Niro. Delighted at the homage, De Niro gave a rousing acceptance speech in which he denounced President Trump’s policies.   Without naming President Trump, De Niro said, “Sadly, in my country, we’re going through a period of grotesque version of nationalism.” He added that this version is “Not the kind of nationalism where we celebrate the quality and character of our diverse population; but rather a diabolic form of nationalism marked by greed, xenophobia and selfishness under the banner of ‘America First.’” The Oscar-winning actor argued that “arts don’t respect borders … the arts celebrate diversity, origins and ideas. Look at us here tonight we’re enjoying films from 29 countries; we’re united in our love for films and our common humanity.” The speech was greeted with a standing ovation. Speaking of the talent of De Niro, Scorsese said that the superstar has the ability to attract people’s sympathy “with some really horrific characters.” The 17th annual film festival opened on Friday, November 30. Stars like Guillermo Del Toro, Robert Pattinson, renowned French film director Agnes Varda, and Egyptian divas Laila Eloui and Youssra are among the Marrakech event’s illustrious guests. Moroccan celebrities, including film directors and producers, musicians, photographers, actors, and designers are also taking part in the renowned film festival. On Saturday, Prince Moulay Rachid , who is also the President of the Foundation of Marrakech’s film festival, chaired a dinner offered by King Mohammed VI at the Palais des Congres in Marrakech. The prince was accompanied by his sister Lalla Meryem and his wife Princess Lalla Oum Kalthoum. In an editorial he afterwards wrote on the festival, the prince said, “After a year of reflection and introspection to redefine our editorial line, we gather once again to honor the magic of cinema.” Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the prince said that “our objective is to bond cultures together in a global paradigm where migration issues are at the forefront.” The Prince also paid tribute to renowned actors attending the festival. We have the privilege to welcome Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Agnès Varda, Robin Wright, Guillermo Del Toro, Thierry Frémaux, Cristian Mungiu, Yousry Nasrallah, Jilali Ferhati among others.”

Rabat – In a message on Saturday, the King said that he learned “with great sorrow the sad news” of the death of H.W. Bush. The monarch then expressed deep condolences and sincere feelings of compassion to the family of the former US president. King Mohammed VI also welcomed the strong ties of friendship and mutual respect that existed between Bush and late King Hassan II. He added that the friendship contributed to strengthening the diplomatic and strategic partnership between Washington and Rabat. The 41st president of the US died at the age of 94. His son and also former US President George Bush said in a statement issued on November 30: “Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro, and I are saddened to announce that after 94 remarkable years, our dear dad has died.” Statement by the 43rd President of the United States, George W.

Rabat – The Intergovernmental conference on migration will take place from December 10-11. Merkel’s visit was confirmed by Germany’s Government spokeswoman Martina Fietz on Friday, according to RT. Prior to Fietz’s announcement, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita held talks with his German counterpart Heiko Maas on the preparations of the conference. The German official said that Morocco is a major partner in several fields, including migration. The discussion, which took place in Berlin on Thursday, was also an opportunity to discuss Merkle’s participation in Marrakech’s migration conference. The migration pact aims to address humanitarian concerns, human rights-related, and developmental aspects of international migration. It also seeks to protect the dignity of all migrants, regardless of their status. The compact also promises to ease pressures on countries that welcome and host refugees. Morocco has established itself as a country of destination rather than just being a transit country. In 2013, Morocco introduced its National Policy on Immigration and Asylum to offer protection to migrants and refugees. The North African country has also launched regularization campaign for migrants and refugees who are aiming to settle in the country. Just days before the intergovernmental conference, Morocco will also be home to the 11th summit of the World Forum on Migration, which will be held on December 5-7 in Marrakech.  Co-chaired by Germany and Morocco, the forum on migration also aims to tackle questions related to migrants’ rights to decent working and living conditions in their host countries.

Rabat – One out of three Moroccans living with HIV does not have access to treatment as they are not aware of their HIV status. Despite the alarming figures, Morocco has also registered notable improvement in HIV monitoring and treatment. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), 50 percent of people living with HIV know their status in the Middle East and North Africa. In the meantime, the number of affected patients who receive treatment in Morocco reached more than 12,00 at the end of June 2018, against 5,301 in 2012. Access to HIV testing continues to increase with the completion of approximately 750,000 tests in 2017. In March 218, Morocco’s Ministry of Health announced that 70 percent of women carrying HIV have been infected by their husbands. The study showed that 39  percent of Moroccans living with the disease are women. HIV testing is mostly available at public health facilities. According to a 2017 official estimate,  2017 the number of HIV positive Moroccans decreased by 44 percent between 2014 and 2016, owing to preventive medical services. In its 2017 report, UNAIDS acknowledged the remarkable progress in Morocco in recent years. The country topped the MENA region in monitoring and combating the illness. According to Moroccan TV channel 2M, three regions hold a record of 62 percent of infections. The regions are Souss Massa, Casablanca Settat and Marrakech Safi. The Marrakech Safi region has 4,000 HIV-positive people. The TV channel added that 67 percent of infected people are in precarious situations. Homosexuals, sex workers and intravenous drug users are the most affected.  Quoting the Ministry of Health, 2M said that 990 new infections are listed yearly

Rabat – Yesterday’s G20 summit may prove to be the starkest and boldest statement regarding Mohammed bin Salman’s current standing on the global stage of likability. As leaders of the world’s 20 biggest economies met in Argentina yesterday to discuss the world’s most burning issues—that’s the narrative, at least—Saudi Arabia’s crown prince featured prominently by his newly acquired status: the pariah of world politics. Footage and pictures have gone viral of the Saudi’s utter isolation at the Buenos Aires summit. Whatever the reason—sincere commitment to human rights or circumstantial resistance designed to polish their own public personae back home—few world leaders appeared to be interested in having anything at all to do with the Saudi. If Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi Arabia hoped to use the G20 summit as a litmus test of how MBS would fare in opinion polls, to see where the Saudi crown prince stands and how he can revamp his discredited public image, Argentina was a suggestion that Khashoggi’s shadow still follows MBS. Not only did MBS’s traditional sartorial taste stand out amid “a sea of suits,” BBC’s James Landale remarked, Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader’s very presence in the Argentinian capital seemed to be adding a “toxic” touch to the reunion of the world’s powerful. The most powerful reminder of how unwelcome Mohammed bin Salman has become came as the summit’s attendees posed for the traditional family picture. “MBS was at the far end of the line rather by himself,” Landale wrote. Judging by his sour and seemingly rueful facial expression, the Saudi may have been wondering why in the name of God he came to this humiliating ritual. “At times,” the BBC report continued, “he looked uncertain, even nervous. Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand. They know just how toxic the Saudi leader is seen by some of their electorates.” There was, however, as is usually the case, a dim silver lining to MBS’s humiliating Argentinian summit. Russia’s Vladmir Putin, resolute in his anti-America-EU crusade, picked up an apparently fraternal conversation with the unwanted prince. What did Putin tell MBS? Perhaps Putin just wanted to score a point, to remind MBS, at the propitious moment, that he once made MBS’s day when everyone else plainly ignored hin. Britain’s Theresa May, who spoke to the Saudi prince on the margins of the summit, reportedly insisted that Riyadh “fully cooperate” with ongoing Turkish investigations into the difficult-to-sideline Khahsoggi affair. May’s unspoken words, given the London-Riyadh ties that her government is decided to uphold, is that MBS should be more careful in his moves amid ongoing furore over Saudi Arabia’s repressive regime. MBS should give his allies the chance to protect the alliance, she suggested. Next was France’s Emmanuel Macron, whose brief and easily theatrical encounter with MBS animated online speculations. Macron fumed, reprimanded, showed off his moral high ground. At least so it seemed. But his vehemence was diplomatic, polite, unchallenging. Like Britain, France is attached to its relationship with Saudi Arabia. Or is it to the Saudi petrodollar? “You never listen,” the French president was seen telling the Saudi prince off, according to widely circulated transcripts of the pair’s brief conversation. To Macron’s polite challenge, MBS is believed to have replied, offhandedly, “Of course I will listen.” What was the crux of Macron’s concern? What is it that MBS promised to listen to? No one knows. But that was apparently not the point. The point, Macron continued, is that he worries for MBS. “Don’t worry,” the prince said. “I worry,” Macron insisted. Did Macron worry that MBS is impossibly oblivious to the global Khashoggi outcry? Or is the French leader concerned that France may be forced to walk away from a crucial bilateral relationship that is increasingly unpopular with French voters? Again, no one can tell. What we do know, though, is that the G20 leaders’ snubbing attitude towards MBS was purely a statement intended to tell Saudi Arabia and its powerful prince to see the error of their ways, to change. But will MBS heed the warning? Will he change? And would that really matter at this point? If Buenos Aires was a test, MBS lamentably failed it.

Rabat – Morocco’s Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CESE) has highlighted the importance of migration for the country’s economic performance, urging authorities to further the socio-professional integration of sub-Saharan migrants. CESE has established itself as a monitor of Moroccan public life, evaluating performances and making recommendations for improvement on various issues of public interest. In its latest report, “Migration and Labor Market,” the body drew attention to the situation of migrants, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, in Morocco. The report gave an overall positive reading of migration and migrants’ impact on Moroccan social and economic life. Calling for more steps to economically and socially integrate migrants, CESE recommended that government officials and “other stakeholders” espouse an “innovative” approach to make migration “a true driver” of economic growth and development. Instead of the general tendency to shun and scapegoat migrants, Moroccan authorities should approach migration as enabling national growth and easing international solidarity, CESE suggested. The report mentioned the necessity of “coherent policies” to ease the social and “cultural integration” of migrants. While Morocco has already put in place legal mechanisms to integrate migrants, true integration calls for “coordinated actions” between relevant authorities and labor market stakeholders to guarantee migrants the right to work and decent living conditions. Other CESE recommendations included government efforts to promote social cohesion and a spirit of living-together to combat suspicion and hard feelings between migrants and locals. The CESE report comes less than two weeks before the UN-sponsored intergovernmental conference on the Global Compact for Migration. The two-day event (December 10-11) is set to take place in Marrakech and will convene world governments—only about 10 countries, including the US, have so far withdrawn—to adopt the equivalent of an international declaration on the rights of migrants and asylum seekers.

By Younes Masskine Rabat – In the Green March speech, King Mohammed VI reaffirmed that Morocco is reaching out to Algeria. Since then, many media outlets and political elites have expressed their hope to see the aspirations of nearly 100 million Maghrebis come true. Others reacted with accusation driven by stereotypes, bad faith, or worst-case scenarios. In reality, emotive language, litmus tests, and trying to push the other side to a tight corner are just the tip of the iceberg. The Morocco-Algeria rift runs much deeper. The dream of unity, which has existed since the feigned withdrawal of the European occupation from the Maghreb, will never see the light unless Maghrebis realize the geopolitics of the problem. It is neither chauvinistic nor narcissistic to say that Moroccans are the biggest losers in the state of delayed union of the Maghreb. The younger generations, born after the Green March in 1975, must know the reason of Morocco’s isolation, and why Morocco wasted so many opportunities for growth and reconstruction. They also should know why they became the victims of a great geopolitical game to isolate Morocco from the Maghreb, beginning, at least two centuries ago, with the colonial plan to divide North Africa. While European colonization brought the downfall of the Ottoman Caliphate in the rest of the Maghreb, Morocco survived the colonial machine that cuts countries off from their historical and religious roots. For France and other colonial powers, Morocco has always been the last bastion that they needed to conquer in order to link the colonized territories of Algeria with West Africa. The signing of the Treaty of Fez, by virtue of which Morocco became a French protectorate, brought about the fall of the 10-century-old Cherifien empire, said veteran Moroccan Independence Party leader, Mohamed El Khalifa, speaking at the anniversary of the launching of the e-newspaper al3omk.com. “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past,” George Orwell said in his 1984 novel. So the political elites who understand the roots of the past battles must break the taboo of fear and start the conversation and ask the tough questions about the factors of division in the Maghreb. There is no Moroccan–Algerian dispute outside a certain geopolitical structure, nor is there a question of Western Sahara outside the configuration left by colonial powers. If Morocco’s neighbors in the Maghreb sincerely want to break free from the constraints that have prevented Maghrebis, all these decades, from finding common ground and moving forward, they must recognize that they have inherited—consciously or unconsciously—agendas that are neither their own, nor to their interest. Every battle Maghrebis fought against each other was a lost one; the time has come for all Maghrebis to realize that their nation-states can only thrive in a united Maghreb. The subversion of Morocco is not an Algerian Bismarckian project but a neo-colonial one. The strong state with a long history that is Morocco is what prevents linking the former French colony of Algeria and the territories south of Tarfaya: Timbuktu, Dakar, and other parts of West Africa. This colonial project is not a thing of the past. A case in point is Libya, the scene of yet another Franco-Italian battle for a new sphere of influence. France has been working tirelessly to regain political, economic, and military influence in North and West Africa, just like it used to do in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Meanwhile, the US, a relatively new player, is pressing for less French influence in the region, pushing the countries of the Maghreb to get together. King Mohammed VI’s initiative for dialogue and the subsequent calls by Algeria and Mauritania for Maghreb foreign ministers to meet could give momentum for Maghreb countries to start taking action. History and diplomatic archives will tell us that Morocco has been unfair to Algeria, which, in reality has been unfair to itself by claiming or giving the impression that it is driven by its own agenda to gain a stranglehold on iron, phosphate reserves, or to have access to the Atlantic Ocean. According to independent historian Jilali El Adnani, in the late 19th century, French military leaders drew borders with Morocco on behalf of Algeria. The French called that border “the TTT line” for Tarfaya, Tindouf, and Touat. Their plan was to limit Moroccan sovereignty to territory above this line, making it easier for them to connect Algeria and West Africa, two regions then under their control. For a long time, the TTT line has been one edge of the Bermuda triangle of hindered progress in the Maghreb. Today, Maghrebis can turn the triangle into a river delta where Algeria and Mauritania meet Morocco and where old dreams are born anew. Translated from Arabic by Zakaria Wadghiri

Rabat – Although Holocaust studies have not yet been officially included in the Moroccan curriculum, it is possible that we will see this happen one day in light of the country’s special history. Recently, rumors have been circulating that Morocco has decided to introduce Holocaust studies into its educational curriculum. The reason for the confusion apparently arose from an innocent error in the translation of Morocco’s statements at the UNESCO summit which took place during the meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York in late September. Saad Eddine Othmani, Moroccan head of government and leader of the Justice and Development Party, approached the podium at the summit. He calmly read out a message sent by the King, a message of moderation, tolerance, and pride in the special model of relations woven between Jews and Muslims in Morocco. “The history we teach our children must include a pluralist range of opinions and stories, it must present humanity’s greatest moments, as well as its darkest ones,” he said. At the conclusion of his speech, he approached the director general of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, and shook her hand. There is no doubt that she understood Othmani’s meaning. Indeed, her surname hints at her connection with Morocco, and Audrey is the daughter of Andre Azoulay, advisor of King Mohammed VI of Morocco, and before that, advisor of King Hassan II. Morocco, regardless of whether it implements the Holocaust into the curriculum, is unique among Muslim countries. Most Muslim states oscillate between avoiding taking a stance on the matter and Holocaust denial, because acknowledging the Holocaust is perceived as harmful to Palestinian interests. So how can it be that Morocco acknowledges the Holocaust? The answer to this, as in many other matters, is the King, in this case King Mohammed V. According to the Moroccan narrative, which many Moroccans are familiar with, when the Vichy regime ruled Morocco at the beginning of the 1940s, King Mohammed V was asked to hand over the Jews of his country to the Nazis. The Moroccans relate with pride that the King refused to concede to this demand, arguing fervently that there were only Moroccans in his country. Of course, in reality the story was more complex: Restrictive decrees against the Jews were imposed at the instruction of the Vichy regime and freedom of employment, movement, etc., were limited. Up to today, the issue remains a source of dispute, and despite the important role King Mohammed V played, he has not yet been awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations. However, King Mohammed V was and remains a hero who saved the Jews. Here lies the real meaning of the story and whether accurate or exaggerated, it allowed Morocco to develop a positive national identity with regard to the events that took place during World War II and the horrors of that period. While in Europe the Jews were annihilated, the Muslims in Morocco helped save them. But what has happened since King Mohammed V’s gesture to the Jews of his land, and how does Morocco relate to the Holocaust today? Until 2009, Morocco made almost no public statements regarding the Holocaust. Morocco did not officially acknowledge or deny it. Among the general public a range of opinions existed, but on the national level silence reigned. In 2009, UNESCO inaugurated the Aladdin Project, designed to serve as a platform for activities and educational and cultural initiatives that would bring closer Jews and Muslims in the Middle East and beyond. It was initially established by France, Jordan, and Germany; later on, other states such as Indonesia, Mauritania, Turkey, Tunisia, and Egypt also joined. One of its endeavors involves the translation of literature and films about the Holocaust into the official languages of the UN, especially Arabic. The project even enables free digital download of the books, thus making quality content on the topic available. Morocco apparently liked the initiative and King Mohammed VI acknowledged the Holocaust in an official message to the initiators of the Aladdin Project. This was a rare official declaration by a leader of a Muslim country. When the King speaks, his message begins to trickle downwards, even though obstacles are met along the way. In April 2010, Andre Azoulay, the advisor to the King, declared that the Moroccan Ministry of Education needs to introduce the Holocaust into educational programs in schools. This initiative elicited protest from pro-Palestinian groups: They called for him to pack up his belongings and leave the country. In response to the protest, an opposing campaign, supporting Azoulay and the message he sought to impart, ensued. Despite the opposition, various elements in Moroccan civil society have adopted Azoulay’s message with pride and organized lectures and conferences in higher education institutions, including testimonies by Holocaust survivors who came to Morocco to tell their stories. In September 2011, the Mimouna association organized one of the first such conferences in the Arab world under the title “Mohammed V: Righteous Among the Nations.” In addition, there are other initiatives in Morocco that seek to change and adapt the educational program, in order to increase the representation of all shades of Moroccan heritage, including Jews and Amazigh (Berbers), which at present are almost completely absent from the history books. At the bottom line, whether the Holocaust will be officially included in the Moroccan curriculum or not, Morocco has a special history. Morocco’s recognition and sensitive approach to the Holocaust is an additional sign of the special relationship between Jews and Muslims in Morocco and the way this relationship is being included as part of the broader Moroccan heritage.

By Mohamed Bella Rabat – International film stars descended on Marrakech’s Palais des Congres to celebrate the opening of the 17th Marrakech International Film Festival, Friday, November 30. Stars like academy award winner Guillermo Del Toro, “Twilight” saga star Robert Pattinson, renowned French film director Agnes Varda, Egyptian divas Laila Eloui and Youssra, American painter and filmmaker Julian Schnabel, and Swiss actor Vincent Perez stepped foot onto the red carpet in Marrakech. It was a night when the warmth and hospitality of Marrakech met the star-studded glamor and style of international cinema. A large crowd gathered outside the barricades to catch a glimpse of the international stars and burst into applause for each film star’s arrival. The Marrakech International Film Festival’s opening ceremony kicked-off with a jury panel led by American director James Gray. Other members of the jury are actress Dakota Johnson, director Joana Hadjithomas, Mexican director Michel Franco, French director Laurent Cantet, British director Lynne Ramsay, Moroccan filmmaker Tala Hadid, Indian actress Ileana D’Cruz, and German actor Daniel Bruhl. In his opening speech, Gray said, “I’m an American and in this moment I feel a high responsibility to at least try to represent the best side of us – the open, the hopeful and thoughtful, and enlightened side.”  Gray stated that being at the festival gives him the opportunity to be “connected to another culture, another point of view and another idea of the world.” The opening ceremony was followed by a screening of Julian Schnabel’s ”At Eternity’s Gate.” The film, about the last years in the life of Vincent van Gogh played by Willem Dafoe, is a journey inside the painter’s mind.

Rabat – The website FlightNetwork.com has ranked Morocco’s Agadir beach 37th among the world’s top 50 city beaches. The website notes that the “golden sands” of the Agadir beach has something for everyone: A gradually sloping shore for non-swimmers, jet-skis for adventure-seekers, a tourist train for children, and vendors selling food for the hungry. Legzira beach in Tiznit was classified in both Africa’s top 50 beaches, and the world’s top 50 “untouched” beaches worldwide. The beach is perfect for people who desire to spend some quality time alone with mother nature while listening to the waves’ symphony. FlightNetwork said Tiznit’s “remote stretch of beach makes you feel like you’ve traveled back in time to a long lost land undiscovered by humans.” The website noted the beach’s two magnificent redstone arches that stretch into the ocean. The Agadir beach is a masterpiece, especially if viewed from Agadir Oufella, a mountain perch that allows the visitor to panoramically admire the city. The catalogue of the World’s Top 50 Beaches was collated by over 1,200 journalists, editors, bloggers, and agencies’ feedback who have adopted the culture of traveling as lifestyle.

Rabat – In the wake of the high-speed train (LGV) launch in Morocco, the National Railway Office (ONCF) has decided to extend its offer of free parking at the new train stations until December 9 instead of November 30. The parking lots at the newly inaugurated train stations in Tangier, Kenitra, Rabat Agdal, Benguerir, Oujda, and Casablanca Voyageur can house 1,800 vehicles.  The parking lots are currently free of charge until December 3, announced ONCF. The set ticket price for parking, after the free offer ends, will be MAD 3 per hour. For a monthly subscription, customers can pay MAD 300. The parking lots are under surveillance and are supervised by security guards 24 hours a day. ONCF offered free rides during the first week of the inauguration of the high-speed train, called “al-Boraq,” the first in Africa. On November 15, King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the high-speed train.  The train departed for the first time from Tangier with King Mohammed VI and Macron taking the first ride. The King also inaugurated the tripling of the Casablanca-Kenitra railway tracks, the complete doubling of the Casablanca-Marrakech railway tracks, the stations dedicated to high speed trains (Rabat Agdal, Tangier, Kenitra, and Casa Voyageurs), and the new stations of Oujda and Benguerir. The large-scale projects cost MAD 10.5 billion.

Rabat – When asked by Morocco World News about her experience with French tacos, Asmae, a 23-year-old Moroccan working in Rabat said: “When I thought it was the real taco, I was so disappointed. I thought that Mexican food is not that great.”  The first time she tried a French taco, she was under the impression that it was a traditional Mexican dish, a sentiment that is common among Moroccans.  Many mistakenly believe that the French tacos are actually Mexican tacos. While some do recognize that French tacos are not the same thing as Mexican tacos, they still believe that French tacos did originate from Mexican cuisine. There is a beauty in the fusion of cultures, especially when those countries are separated by an ocean, yet their cultures blend. Isidro Salas, the founder of the podcast Ten Thousand Tacos spoke to Morocco World News, and stated, “I do believe in the spirit of openness and sharing of what different cultures have to bring.”  Mexicans and Moroccans are welcoming societies that could create a delicious fusion of foods—with the French taco, that is not the case. The French taco may use a flour tortilla as its base, but that’s as close as it gets to being a real taco. Even then, the flour tortilla is not representative of what most Mexican tortillas taste or feel like.  The tortilla is a staple of Mexican food and the foundation of a true Mexican taco. Its existence dates back thousands of years before Christ. The Aztecs relied heavily on corn as a part of their diet and they used it to produce corn dough, which led to the creation of the tortilla.  The Nahuatl name for the flat corn breads produced by the Aztecs was tlaxcalli, but the Spanish gave it the name “tortilla,” which means “small cake.” Flour tortillas have traditionally been more popular in Northern Mexico and the US-Mexico border.  Tacos can have different fillings including beef, pork, chicken, and seafood. They are usually served with salsa, cilantro, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. Tacos al pastor are made of pork on a spit similar to the one used for shawarma. These tacos were created by Lebanese immigrants in Mexico in the 1960s.  Other popular tacos are the tacos de canasta (basket tacos) which are placed in a cloth-covered basket, which keeps them warm and softens the tortilla. Vegetarians can eat tacos filled with potatoes, cheese, and peppers.  With the spread of Mexican culture in the United States, other variations of the taco have been created. For example, the American chain restaurant Taco Bell serves Americanized versions of Mexican food and primarily uses flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas. Unfortunately, Americans also fall prey to misrepresentations of Mexican food and Taco Bell was recently voted the number one Mexican restaurant in the US.  That’s probably because the poll voters have not been fortunate enough to visit a real Mexican taqueria.  A taqueria can be a sit-down restaurant, a food truck, or in the case of basket tacos, a man carrying a basket. Taquerias will provide a variety of tacos, which you can customize based on what toppings or kind of meat you want.  In Texas, Tex-Mex is the mixture of Texan and Mexican cuisine. Tacos can have a hard-shell (an American invention) or a soft shell, and typically include shredded cheddar cheese. Other states along the Mexican-US border have their region specific variation of Mexican food.  So if the French tacos looks nothing like a real taco, why do they call it a taco?  Daniel Shkolnik of Vice News writes that “[t]he name works as a kind of marketing bait-and-switch, drawing people [in] with the promise of a Mexican culinary icon and then selling them something completely different.”  When people hear that a restaurant offers tacos, they might be inclined to try them if they believe that the food is Mexican or, at least, Mexican-influenced. Yet, the only part of the taco that can have some tie to Mexican culture is their use of a flour tortilla. Even then, it’s quite a different type of flour tortilla than what you will find in Mexico.  Speaking to Morocco World News, Jamal Hadil, a 22-year-old working in Rabat, said that he loves to eat French tacos for lunch but stated, “Fortunately, I had the chance to try a real Mexican taco made by a Mexican family and I just want to make one thing crystal clear, the only thing about the French tacos that seems to be a little bit close to Mexican food is the tortilla wrapping (but not really that close).” The French taco originated in the mid-2000s with a kebab restaurant owner in Vaulx-en-Velin, a suburb in the city of Lyon. French tacos consist of a type of meat, cheese sauce, French fries, and an additional sauce created by the restaurant.  O’Tacos, founded in 2007, was the first restaurant chain to sell French tacos and gained popularity quickly throughout France. Today, they have 160 restaurants throughout the world, including the first French taco restaurant in Brooklyn, New York.  Moubarik Abdelhadi opened the first French taco restaurant in Morocco, Tacos de Lyon, in 2011. Now they have 22 restaurants throughout Morocco, with six more expected to open. The French taco has become the star of the fast food culture in Morocco. Salas, who began his podcast as a tribute to his parents, refers to the French taco as a “travesty” and “not a real thing.” Salas’ parents earned a living selling tacos in California, and today he works to to educate people not only about the Mexican taco, but of Mexican culture.  Comparing the use of the word “taco” to music, he stated: “For example, in music, when someone does a cover of a song but fails to recognize where that came from—to me that’s a problem. It’s actually disrespectful.” In the same way that there is an appropriate way to cover music, there is an appropriate way to share Mexican cuisine and create fusions between different cultures.  While many restaurants in Rabat don’t actually advertise French tacos as Mexican food, you can still find quite a few restaurants that decorate their walls with pictures of real Mexican tacos and there are even a couple of restaurants that have the word “Mexico” in their names.  Clearly, some restaurants are still trying to maintain a tie between the Mexican and the French taco, or at least they believe that such a tie exists.  This is not difficult to do since there is a lack of Mexican food in Morocco. While there are a few Mexican restaurants in Casablanca and other major cities, they are not common in the way French tacos are. Even then, the few places that serve Mexican food more closely resemble Tex-Mex food. The closest you may come to real Mexican food can be by visiting the Mexican nuns that live in Casablanca.  The nuns have been living in Morocco for many years and while they don’t have a large variety of foods, you can buy homemade corn tortillas as well as some traditional Mexican dishes, like flautas and enchiladas (dishes that include corn tortillas). They cook everything with products they find in Morocco, rather than importing products from Mexico. This shows that it’s possible to cook Mexican food with Moroccan products and that Mexican food that can be halal, since many Mexican dishes traditionally use pork products.  Salas unequivocally believes that the French taco is a misrepresentation of Mexican cuisine, and similar to Shkolnik, he sees the use of the word “taco” as a way to attract patrons by letting them believe they are experiencing something more Mexican than it really is.  When speaking to him, he referred to the use of the label “taco” as something that “leads to a lot of disrespect.” Rather than using this opportunity to introduce a different culture to Morocco, companies use the name “taco” to create massive chain restaurants and profit from the misrepresentation of the taco.  “I cannot deny that when something like the word TACO gets to the other side of the world, it should bring with it the spirit of culture exchange,” argued Salas. That is not the current situation. It can be beneficial to bring Mexican culture and cuisine to other parts of the world but the rise in the popularity of the French taco does none of that. There is no cultural exchange occurring when advertising the French taco. Rob Gokee’s podcast, Tacocity, follows the stories of the chefs, immigrants, and restaurants that produce different styles of tacos.  Chef Farid Zadi has the restaurant Revolutionario in Los Angeles that produces a fusion between North African and Mexican cuisine. His dishes include corn tortillas and traditional Mexican dishes like pozole while adding a North African taste with tagine and lamb. He is considered the “first North African taqueria in the world.”  The fusion of different cuisines is not a new concept and it should be encouraged in order to create bridges between the different cultures, but there should always be a standard of respect and adequate representation.  If a Moroccan says that they love Mexican food, it shouldn’t be because they have tried the French taco but because they visited an establishment that has tried to offer an adequate representation of Mexican cuisine, even if it has a Moroccan twist.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has called out the minister of industry’s failure to perform satisfactorily, asking Moulay Hafid Elalamy to put the nation’s interests before his own. The King made the eyebrow-raising comments during a high-profile “work meeting” on Thursday at the Royal Palace of Rabat.
The King had summoned Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and a number of ministers in charge of strategic departments to discuss “a strategic reorientation” for employment and vocational training. Investing in youth employment and establishing a match between school curricula and the labor market’s needs prominently feature in the King’s successive push for a well-performing and inclusive labor market. The King has steadily called in the majority of his recent speeches for a new economic model that ensures accountability and inclusiveness, bridging the country’s socio-economic gap. He has especially called for more improvement and more efforts in areas such as energy and industry, as well as education and professional training, where satisfactory output is thought to vastly improve the country’s employment prospects. The King felt, however, that the ministers in charge of the strategic departments have not been doing enough for the success of his inclusiveness and efficiency roadmap, “one of the participants” told Moroccan outlet Medias 24. “You have been incapable of even producing a viable report on professional training,” King Mohammed VI reportedly fumed at the vocational training and employment minister. The King showed his frustration at the ministry’s inability to carry out reforms. Of all the ministers who attended the restricted meeting, Elalamy incurred the bulk of the royal fury, the participant noted to Medias 24. In addition to pointing out Elalamy’s department’s failure to meet royal expectations, King Mohammed VI called out the minister’s “arrogant behavior” and his dual nationality. Elalamy also holds Canadian citizenship, having graduated from Sherbrooke University in Quebec and served as a senior advisor in Quebec’s finance ministry. Earlier this year, in January, the King launched the Souss-Massa section of Morocco’s Industrial Acceleration Plan. The goal was to rekindle industry and create 22,000 jobs for the Souss-Massa region. The King complained, however, that very little has been done in one year to meet the goals. Angered by the slow pace and the unsatisfactory realization witnessed since he personally initiated the industrial plan, the King personalized the failure of Elalamy’s department. He fulminated at the minister’s “arrogant behavior unbefitting of public responsibility.” The King concluded by reminding Elalamy that the nation’s interests should always come before his own.

Rabat – George H. W. Bush died on Friday, November 30, at the age of 94, announced his son George W. Bush in a statement published on Twitter by a family spokesman. “George HW Bush was a man of the highest character and the best dad a son or daughter could ask for,” a statement from his sons, former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, reads. Bush had been hospitalized in the spring for treatment of a blood-borne infection. The death of the former US president came just a few months after the death of his wife Barbara, with whom he was married for 73 years. The couple had five children and 17 grandchildren.

After eight years as Ronald Reagan’s vice president 1981-1989, George Bush entered the White House as the 41st president of the United States in 1989. Running for a second term, he was clearly defeated in 1992 by Democratic candidate Bill Clinton.

Details of the funeral will be released in due course, the Bush family spokesman said.

US President Donald Trump praised his predecessor’s “unflappable leadership,” which will also be remembered in history for involving the US in the first Gulf War after Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.

Rabat – Rabat’s Mohammed VI Bridge, the longest cable-stayed bridge in Africa, is bathed in orange lights for the 16 days of UN’s #OrangeTheWorld campaign denouncing violence against women. The bridge, spanning the valley of the Bouregreg river near Rabat, will light up every evening throughout the 16 days of the campaign which began on November 25, signifying Morocco’s activism against gender-based violence. Orange lights have also illuminated the building of the delegation of the European Union to Morocco in Rabat.  Le batiment de @UE_au_Maroc à #Rabat rejoint encore cette année la campagne #OrangeTheWorld #16jours pic.twitter.com/qgcX3T3DD8 — ONU Femmes Maghreb (@ONUFemmesMghrb) November 27, 2018  In Monday’s Parliamentary session, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid reportedly wore orange clothing to show their support for the movement. Iconic buildings around the world, such as the Giza pyramids in Egypt and the EU Parliament in Brussels are embracing orange.  Following in the steps of the international “#MeToo” movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault, UN women around the world are observing 16 days of #OrangeTheWorld activism until December 10 “to bring together governments, communities, survivors, activists and the public through high-visibility events, using the signature colour orange.” Morocco’s new Law 103-13 to eliminate violence against women, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination, which took effect on September 12, promises prison sentences ranging from one to six months for people who sexually harass women in public spaces. Harassment is defined as the use of words, acts or signals of a sexual nature for sexual purposes. The #Masaktach (I won’t be silenced) movement followed shortly after as the Moroccan equivalent of the global #MeToo movement. Both the law against sexual harassment and Masaktach came after widely-publicized cases of rape, harassment, and violence which outraged Moroccan citizens. The latest rape case to receive wide attention was of Khadija, a 17-year-old Moroccan who said she was kidnapped and raped by more than 12 men for two months.  Her alleged rapists also tattooed her body against her will, she said, writing their names on her skin. Another case caused outrage in Casablanca last year when a group of teenagers aggressively groped a young woman on a moving bus while other passengers did nothing.

By Mohamed Hikal Rabat – For many Portuguese tourists, Morocco is a haven for their New Year’s vacation, in addition to Brazil and Cape Verde. According to Pedro Costa Ferreira, president of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), Morocco remains one of the top vacation destinations for the festive season. Based off of agencies’ travel reservations and packages, Ferreira told the Portuguese Lusa news agency that besides local destinations like Porto, Lisbon, the Madera, the Azores archipelago, and the Algarve, the Portuguese’ top foreign destinations for New Year’s are Morocco, Brazil, and Cape Verde. Ferreira indicated that travel prices increased slightly this year compared to last year, yet customers are continuing to buy the travel packages at the same rate. He expected travel agencies’ revenue to increase by 10 percent from last year. Morocco is a popular tourist destination worldwide, and the 2019 Travel Risk Map illustrates how Morocco as a safe destination with relatively low terrorism threats, risk of natural disaster, and health issues. Tourist arrivals in Morocco increased by 10 percent in the first half of 2018 to 5.1 million tourists compared to to the corresponding period in 2017. The greatest increase was seen among Italian tourists with an 18 percent increase, followed by the Germans with 13 percent, the French 10 percent, the British with 7 percent, and the Spanish with 6 percent.

Rabat – The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, told the press Thursday that there will be no direct negotiations at the UN roundtable talks on Western Sahara which will take place in Geneva on December 5 to 6.  Algeria will attend the roundtable as a neighboring country to the conflict. Morocco, Mauritania, and Polisario will all take part in the UN meeting. In a press conference following the Government Council on Thursday, El Khalfi noted again that the Morocco received the same invitation to the meeting as Algeria and Mauritania. El Khalfi reaffirmed Morocco’s firm position that it will not accept any solution against its sovereignty in the southern provinces. El Khalfi echoed a statement from Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, saying that Morocco will attend the roundtable to remind the participants of Morocco’s firm conditions. The Moroccan official also said that Algeria needs to contribute to finding a solution to the conflict, saying it is the “one which created the problem.” Earlier this week, Jeune Afrique said that Minister Bourita will lead the Moroccan delegation to Geneva’s roundtable. Morocco’s delegation will include the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region President Khattat Yanja and the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region President Hamdi Ould Errachid. The UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy, Horst Kohler, proposed the talks, and the invitations were highly welcomed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council. The UN aims for the meeting to serve as an initial step toward a more robust move in preparation to re-launch negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.
