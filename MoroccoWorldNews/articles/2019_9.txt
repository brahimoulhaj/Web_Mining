Rabat – A number of African officials have “saluted” Morocco’s growing role in furthering pan-African causes, stressing the country’s return to the AU and its increasingly Africa-focused diplomacy. The “African ministers,” whose comments came both during and after a UN General Assembly meeting over the weekend in New York, highlighted Morocco’s assertiveness in pushing forward its South-South vision, according to Moroccan state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The African officials lauded Rabat’s vision and leadership in instigating the debates and driving actions on a wide-range of South-South and African development-focused platforms, according to the Moroccan newspaper. “Morocco generally stands out at the international level in how it pushes for actions as well as pertinent and audacious initiatives,” MAP quoted one of the ministers, Sao Tome and Principe’s foreign minister Elsa Teixeira de Barros Pinto. She added, according to MAP, “Morocco is a great nation respectful of universal principles.” Suzi Carla Barbosa, Guinea Bissau’s foreign minister, echoed the same sentiment. The Guinean diplomat stressed Morocco’s “commitment to African causes.” He explained that while Morocco has always been an indispensable player and a good ally in African affairs, the North African country has been particularly active in promoting Africa in the past two years, following its admission to the African Union. Africa has become the center of Morocco’s “excellent diplomatic actions,” Barbosa said. The laudatory comments back up Morocco’s declared “African vocation.” Speaking at a panel on the sideline of the UN General Assembly over the weekend, Morocco’s foreign minister Bourita spoke at length about Rabat’s vision—and actions—for stability, peace, and economic prosperity in Africa. “Morocco strongly believes that the response to all our challenges is concerted action and shared responsibility,” Bourita said. He stressed Morocco’s actions towards helping the continent “emergence from its current challenges” through “frank mobilization” of African governments as well as “coherent and effective” continental policies. The notion of Morocco as an invaluable asset for the AU’s aspirations appears to be an established feeling among African officials. Like the ministers at the UN event in New York, other African officials have often spoken of Morocco—generally Moroccan diplomats—as effectively promoting African and South-South issues at the international level. With a King who “intelligently combines effectiveness and empathy,” Morocco has emerged as an example for many African countries, Mali’s former Prime Minister said in a recent op-ed on the twenty years of King Mohammed VI’s reign.

Rabat – The services of the Royal Gendarmerie and the civil protection recovered five more bodies on “Ennahla” beach in Zenata near Casablanca, on the morning of September 30. The police had previously retrieved seven bodies, including a 20-year-old woman, on September 28. The deceased were irregular migrants who were headed to Spain on a boat. The boat, allegedly carrying more than 50 migrants, sank at sea.  With the bodies found today, the death toll has reached 12 victims. Three other victims were found unconscious and were transported to the Moulay Abdellah provincial hospital for treatment. At the moment, Moroccan police are still searching for other victims, using Royal Gendarmerie aircraft and military boats. According to Hespress, police arrested the individual who was in charge of the immigration operation in Mediouna, a Casablanca suburb. The perpetrator is now in police custody under the supervision of the public prosecution. The news outlet pointed out that the Royal Gendarmerie arrested two other members of the illegal immigration network and are still searching for other accomplices. If arrested, prosecutors could charge the perpetrators with “forming a human trafficking criminal network.” This incident has brought to light Moroccan police efforts to curb irregular migration in recent years. Just this month, on September 7, police in the southern cities of Tan Tan and Laayoune arrested six people for their alleged involvement in irregular migration and human trafficking.  The same day, police in Oujda, eastern Morocco, arrested a Guinean national for his involvement in forcible confinement, organizing irregular migration, and human trafficking. The arrest came after a Sudanese citizen had called the police claiming that his brother was kidnapped by an individual active in irregular migration.

Rabat – The German international cultural center, known as the Goethe Institute, suspended all scholarships for Moroccan students due to security concerns on Monday, September 30. The Goethe Institute told Morocco World News that the decision came after three out of 14 Moroccan students from this year abandoned their studies and refused to return home, wanting to settle in Germany illegally instead. The suspension of scholarships will continue until the situation is “further clarified.” “We have to check how to avoid illegal stays,” the director of the Goethe Institute in Morocco, Susanna Baumgart, told Morocco World News. “For the 2020/2021 school year, we are considering a new start.” The Goethe Institute also ended its scholarships for Afghani students in 2010 for similar reasons. Students from all over the world can apply for scholarships to attend language courses in Germany through the institute. Fourteen Moroccan students were going to Germany every year via the scholarships since 2008.  The students were high school age. The scholarships covered accommodation as well as a stipend for other expenses. Education itself is free in Germany. In recent years, Germany has had a surge of migrants from the region either overstaying or coming illegally. In 2018, Germany deported 826 Moroccans illegally staying in the country, up from 634 in 2017. According to the German Interior Ministry, the number of immigrants Germany has deported to the Maghreb region grew nearly 14 times from 2015.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has again received support from both Bahrain and the UAE for its position regarding Western Sahara. Emirati Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan reiterated his country’s support for the United Nations political process to end the Western Sahara conflict.  The official made his statement at the general debate of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly held September 24-30 in New York. Al Nahyan said, “We welcome the efforts of our brothers in the kingdom of Morocco to reach a political solution to this issue.” He added that the UAE continues to believe that the “political process is the best way to settle the issue of the region,” and appreciates the efforts of the United Nations, the international community, and “friendly countries.” Bahraini Minister of Foreign Affairs K Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalif made a similar statement during his participation in the assembly on Saturday, September 28. “The kingdom of Bahrain … reaffirms its solidarity with the continuous efforts by the brotherly kingdom of Morocco” to find a political solution to the issue of Western Sahara, he said. Bahrain, he added, supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Morocco. It is not the first time both the Gulf countries affirmed their support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Bahrain and the UAE, along with 21 other states, recently expressed support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, an initiative submitted to the UN in 2007 as a possible political solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. On September 10, the permanent ambassador and representative of Morocco to the UN in Geneva, Omar Zniber, said  that 23 countries issued a statement, noting that the autonomy initiative “has been recognized by the Security Council as a serious and credible basis for definitely resolving the regional conflict.” The plan has gained support from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and countries in Africa. At the 74th debate of the General Assembly in New York, several countries from the continent reiterated support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported Monday, September 30, that several heads of states from Africa gave their support for the UN’s exclusivity in mediating the conflict to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution. Leaders from Burkina Faso, Comoros, Sao Tome and Principe spoke at the assembly, showing their support of the UN’s mediation as opposed to AU arbitration.

Rabat  – Rabat’s Court of First Instance sentenced Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni to one year in prison on Monday, September 30. Moroccan police arrested Raissouni and her fiance on August 31 for “illegal abortion and premarital sexual relations.” The court also sentenced Raissouni’s fiance to one year in prison for participating in “illegal abortion and premarital sexual relations.” The doctor who allegedly conducted the abortion for Raissouni received a sentence of two years in prison. The court announced the verdict nearly one month after the trial was set to begin. The court frequently postponed sessions for more evidence and defense preparation requests. Myriam Moulay Rachid, the lawyer of the convicted doctor, Jamal Belkeziz, presented evidence during the trial’s last hearing on Monday, September 22, that her client did not perform the abortion. She claimed that at the time of examination, a blood test on Raissouni showed a level of 13,585.9 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU-mL) for the “pregnancy hormone” Beta HCG, a level below the threshold of 30,000 mIU-mL that confirms pregnancy.  The lawyer argued that the HGG level was “unavoidable proof that acquits all the alleged culprits of abortion in this case.” On September 5, the public prosecutor of the Rabat Court of First Instance issued a statement on Raissouni’s arrest, emphasizing that the journalist was arrested for nothing other than an illegal abortion. He announced that the police arrested Raissouni at the entrance of a building they were monitoring. The prosecutor said that they suspected the clinic of conducting illegal abortion in the building.  Raissouni’s case stirred public debate about the lack of individualism. Feminists and activists signed a manifesto, initiated by prominent Moroccans Leila Slimani and Sonia Terrab, to criticize Morocco’s laws criminalizing sexual relations and abortion. International NGOs, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, also condemned the arrest, calling for the immediate release of Raissouni. The 28-year-old journalist writes for the Arabic-language daily Akhbar Al Yaoum.  Moroccan law criminalizes both sex outside marriage and abortion in cases where imminent danger to the mother’s life cannot be proven. It remains to be seen whether Raissouni will appeal the court’s verdict.

Rabat – The Netherlands’ National Police Directorate has fired Fatima Aboulouafa, a police chief known for objecting to the abuse of power, racism, and bullying within the police department. Aboulouafa, who worked in the southern city of Leiden, lost her job on Tuesday, September 24. According to police chiefs within the Hague unit, “Aboulouafa’s attitude caused strong internal tension.” The police chief of Moroccan origin had been working for 25 years in the police department. For the last year, she had had 130 police officers under her command, according to the Dutch news outlet, NRC. In an interview with the Jinek TV program, Aboulouafa said: “I felt unsafe during my career due to discrimination…. I was also discriminated against because of my origin and because I’m a woman.” Supporters created a Facebook page titled “We support Fatima Aboulouafa” in solidarity with her cause. Created on September 25, the page already has more than 2,000 likes. “It’s ridiculous that the whistleblower gets thrown out and the real culprits remain, and then at the police of all instances,” a sympathizer wrote today. “There is something deeply rotten in the State of the Netherlands.” On September 24, Aboulouafa received a call from a member of the national police force leadership. The member told her that her presence “caused unrest among unit leaders, sector leaders, and team leaders.” In a phone conversation with Aboulouafa about her stance, police chief Erik Akerboom ”emphasized the importance of diversity within the police force.” He added in a personal blog that it is “painful and unacceptable (…) that the directorate turns a blind eye to indiscrete behavior.” Aboulouafa’s firing seems to stem from an Instagram post. On June 6, the former police chief posted on Instagram a message complaining about discrimination in the police department. In response to the post, her colleague Marian Zaal said her message tarnished the image of the police department. “The image that you paint about our great company at insta seems particularly negative to me. A pity!” Aboulouafa’s stance received support from Monique Mos, head of operations at the National Police unit of the Hague. She wrote on the police intranet that discrimination and bullying by the police are “a persistent and difficult problem to eradicate.” She called upon executives to take “signals seriously.” Discrimination against Moroccan people is widespread in the Netherlands. In 2014, Dutch politician Geert Wilders asked a room full of supporters of his political party whether they want to see “more or fewer” Moroccans in the country. When the crowd shouted “Less!” Wilders replied, “We’re taking care of it.” In December 2016, Wilders was found guilty of inciting discrimination and the panel of three judges said Wilders’ comments were “humiliating and insulting to the Moroccan population.” The court, however, decided not to impose a fine or to sentence him, arguing that a criminal conviction was in itself a sufficient punishment.

Rabat – Karima Benyaich, Morocco’s ambassador to Spain since 2018, and the mayor of Malaga, Francisco de la Torre, signed a new cooperation agreement on September 30 to promote education and cultural exchange between the two Mediterranean countries. The development agreement came under the title of “Promoting Spain-Morocco Cooperation in the New Programming Period 2021-2027.” The agreement, signed at the Urban Environment Observatory or Observatorio de Medio Ambiente Urbano (OMAU), aims to strengthen relations between Malaga and 25 municipalities in Morocco, including Al Hoceima, Tangier, and Tetouan. According to Diariosur, de la Torre stressed the importance of the agreement, saying that it “is more necessary than ever.”  The mayor also called for the implementation of the cooperation through common development measures in both Malaga and the Moroccan municipalities. Welcoming this agreement with Malaga, Benyaich said that both countries “can congratulate ourselves on a very good relationship, which has been improving in recent years.” Recently, the European Union funded a legal migration project called “Young Generation as Change Agents.” The project targets Moroccan graduates and offers them the chance to study in Spain.  The Spanish Service for the Internationalization of Education, coordinating the program, said in a statement that “the project aims to establish a circular legal migration scheme with Morocco with a mobility phase for young Moroccan graduates who will study a one-year Master’s degree in Spain.”

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has found itself mediating another scandal after the Egyptian club Al Zamalek postponed their Champions League match against the Senegalese football club Generation Foot just 24 hours before the kick-off. The match was initially going to take place on Saturday, September 28. But Al Zamalek pushed it back to Sunday and informed Generation Foot about the schedule change only 24 hours before. Al Zamalek also changed the location from Cairo’s Petrosport Stadium to Alexandria in Borg El-Arab Stadium. Officials postponed the match for unspecified “security measures.” “The security reason presented by Zamalek’s management to support their request for postponing the game is not real,” said the Senegalese club’s communication director, Talla Fall. “We were supposed to train on Friday, 24 hours ahead of the game, as per the rules and regulations of the CAF. Surprisingly we received a letter on Friday, September 27 at 4 pm informing us that the game has been postponed to Sunday, September 29,” Fall explained. The Senegalese club decided to go to the Petrosport Stadium on Saturday anyway, assuming that CAF had not made the rearrangement. Despite negotiations to play the game, Generation Foot refused Al Zamalek officials’ proposals. “How can a game be postponed 24 hours before it starts. It is impossible for us to play the game in Alexandria. We have rights and if we have to go all the way to enforce the law we’ll do it,” he concluded. Al Zamalek’s postponement does not comply with CAF regulations, which require clubs to inform the opponent of any change at least 10 days ahead of time. Al Zamalek lost to Generation Foot (2-1) in the first leg of the Round of 32 in the CAF Champions League which took place on September 14, in Stade Lat-Dior, Thies, Senegal. CAF released a statement in light of the incident during the second leg of the Round of 32 of the African Champions League. “Caf has been closely following the situation … between Zamalek (Egypt) and Generation Foot (Senegal), which was due to take place over the weekend,” CAF said in a statement. “The relevant CAF bodies and representatives are currently examining the situation and further information and updates will be issued in due time,” it added. Generation Foot has said that it is considering reaching out to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if they are kicked out of this year’s CAF Champions League. The group stage draw will be on October 9. CAF must make a ruling quickly on the issue.

Rabat – Algerian army chief Gaid Salah has vowed not to back any candidate in the presidential polls due to take place in December in an attempt to encourage Algerians to vote. On Sunday, September 29, Salah said, “We affirm that only the people will pick the next president through ballot boxes, and the army will not support anyone.” Algerian citizens have been rallying on the streets of Algiers since February to condemn corruption and unemployment, as well as dysfunctions in the Algerian regime, led by elites from Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s era. Algerians have also been threatening to boycott the election expected to take place on December 12, according to interim President Abdelkader Bensalah. Gaid Salah accused members of the former government of attempting to disrupt the election. “The gang and its acolytes try to spread the idea that the army will support one of the candidates for the next presidential election,” Salah said. He added, “This propaganda and its purpose is to disrupt the election.” Salah, a de facto ruler in Algeria, also accused anti-election protesters of chanting “biased slogans” during the ongoing demonstrations. Under Salah’s leadership, authorities in Algeria arrested a number of elites for mismanagement of public funds and corruption, including the brother of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Said Bouteflika. Last week, a military court sentenced Said Bouteflika to 15 years in prison. The move comes as an attempt to regain the trust of protesters, who have been calling for all elites to step down, including Salah. To end the protests, Salah ordered security services to seize cars entering Algiers for protests. “We have instructed the gendarmerie to … stop buses and cars that are used to this end; to seize and impose fines on their owners,” Salah said.

Rabat – The questions and pronouncements of small children often have an innocent logic behind them and the power to provoke deep thought. My husband’s 6-year-old niece regularly asks me one such question. “What are you doing?” She asks. “Reading,” I reply. Then comes the supplementary question, a question to which I have never before had to consider and answer, as reading is second nature to me. The supplementary question is, “Why?” ‘There are many little ways to enlarge your child’s world’ One possible answer is simply that reading is fun. It opens up new worlds and possibilities. “There are many little ways to enlarge your child’s world. Love of books is the best of all,” according to Jaqueline Kennedy Onnasis. But, in a world where phones, computers, and screens are taking over every aspect of our lives how can we convince our children to willingly walk towards those worlds and possibilities? Having taught 16 year old boys in central London and pre-school and primary aged children in Casablanca, I can assure you that it isn’t an easy task. In London, constrained by timetabling and, of course, the national curriculum, I tried to enforce silent reading for my form group. I read to them, recommended books, offered texts in their native languages, but to no avail. They would stare blankly at the pages. “It’s boring.” “It’s difficult.” “I don’t like reading.” Despite an inspirational and committed English department, these boys were just too far gone. Helping in my husband’s school in Casablanca’s Derb Sultan, I had the opportunity to work with younger children. These little people happily sat at my feet and listened to a story, were thrilled to re-enact fairy tales, and immerse themselves in new ideas and places. Unfortunately, this excitement didn’t extend to when they were reading themselves. Several times, I gave a book to read as homework, and every time the book was returned unread. I then noticed that every Moroccan home I visited was entirely devoid of books. Even the houses of people I knew as intellectuals or successful business people held little evidence of reading. This trend is sadly becoming more widespread in homes in the UK. Increasingly, books are seen only as a necessity for school rather than a joy or a step to new possibilities. One of the little girls at our school, however, became very invested in reading. She would rush into the classroom every afternoon of the summer holidays, asking “Ou aujourd’hui?” Where today? While she was using the wrong interrogative and actually meant “what,” I found the question poignantly accurate. She was asking where reading would take her, and what adventures would she have through each day’s book or story. Trying to find a way to inspire more pupils to join the ranks of thousands of years of readers, I did a bit of background research on literacy in Morocco. The National Agency Against Illiteracy (ANCLA) reported in 2016 that 32% of Moroccans over the age of 10 are illiterate. The same report showed that 41% of Moroccan women cannot read. Meanwhile, a survey conducted by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) found that Moroccans over the age of 15 spend on average only 2 minutes per day practicing sports or reading. The report found that children spend only 1 minute a day reading. While the statistics for Morocco are not easy reading, Moroccan children are not alone in their lack of interest in reading for pleasure. The UK Reading Agency reports that; “Only 35% of 10-year-olds in England report that they like reading ‘very much’. This lags behind countries like Russia (46%), Ireland (46%), New Zealand (44%), and Australia (43%).” A world without legends I must admit that I found these statistics shocking and sad. I have always loved to read and, from being very little, have devoted much of my free time to books. I believe passionately that through losing our connection with words, the written word particularly, we will lose our connection to history, culture, and imagination. As author Ray Bradbury said “You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.”  Morocco has a rich and beautiful culture. Morocco is the home of the world’s first University, founded by Fatima Al-Fihiri. It is the home of the Al Moravids, the Al Mohads, and the Alouites and the center of one of the world’s greatest empires. Morocco produced Ibn Batuta, Merieme Chadid, Youssef ibn Tachfin, Yazami Rachid ; Imagine a world where these people did not exist. If our children and future generations do not read about them, they will, to all intents and purposes, cease to exist and their extraordinary impact on Morocco and the world will be forgotten. Some would argue that Morocco’s rich tradition of oral history would save its heroes from such a fate. I love hearing my husband’s grandmother or our neighbor in Casablanca share stories of life under French rule, Amazigh tribes, and the long history of Morocco’s native people. And, while oral traditions are important and a magical, enchanting window into Morocco’s past, if legends and histories are never recorded there is a danger that they will be lost forever. Afterall, if nobody reads, who will write? Scientific research Another possible answer to my niece’s pertinent question is science. Emotions aside, literacy and reading are key to the neurological development of small children. Research shows that a text rich environment can have a huge positive impact on the intellectual development of children, and adults. Child care quarterly states that, “Children with a foundation in literacy—language and listening skills, familiarity with books, and experience with scribbling and drawing—are more likely to succeed in all school experiences.” Reading does not only transport us to imaginary worlds but also serves as a door to real life opportunities.The UK Reading Agency states that; “Reading for pleasure is more important for children’s cognitive development than their parents’ level of education and is a more powerful factor in life achievement than socio-economic background.” The Moroccan government has recognized the importance of promoting literacy. The Social Economic and Environmental Council |(CESE) released a report earlier this year recommending that literacy and the promotion of reading should be integrated into public policy. Meanwhile, ANCLA has already put in place a national strategy that aims to reduce the illiteracy rate to 10% by 2026. When all is said and done, the honest answer to my niece’s question “why are you reading?” is because I always have. So, the problem then should be ‘how’ rather than’ why.’ How can parents, Moroccan, British, or any other nationality, support their children if they themselves do not or cannot read? Reading is a learned behaviour, it is a habit, and a culture. We must start our children looking at texts before they can talk and before they can walk so that it is as natural as breathing.

Rabat – Marrakech will host the International Summit for Water Security on October 1-3. The Moroccan Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water is hosting the event in collaboration with the International Network of Basin Organizations (INBO) and the Global Institute for Water, Environment and Health (GIWEH). More than 300 international decision-makers from 65 different countries, including 10 ministers of water, will take part in the summit. The participant list also includes heads of water management agencies and representatives from UN agencies, such as UN-Water, UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), and UNESCO. The summit, held under the theme “For Participative and Innovative Basin Management,” has multiple activities in its agenda. While the first two days have workshops and discussion panels planned, the last day will be dedicated for technical and cultural study visits to the Menara gardens and to the Water Museum “Aman.” The organizing committee of the international meeting picked Marrakech to host the event for different reasons. The “Ochre City” has one of the oldest water distribution and management plans in Morocco’s history. The city also hosted the 22nd Conference of Parties (COP 22), which dedicated a whole day for water, under the Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA). INBO will also hold their 11th World General Assembly (WGA) on the sidelines of the summit. The international organization, established in 1994 in Paris, works for sound and balanced water resources management all over the world. It is a non-profit organization with 200 members in 70 countries and has seven regional networks. INBO holds a WGA once every three years. The summit comes as water security is becoming a major issue affecting socio-economic development globally. Water resources are encountering increasing pressures related to economic activity, population growth, and urbanization. Additionally, the intensity and frequency of extreme hydrometeorological phenomena are increasing due to climate change. Morocco’s southern regions have majorly suffered from heavy rains and floods this year, resulting in many deaths. Morocco’s efforts to tackle the water issue are not recent. In 1967, the late King Hassan II launched a water management policy by building dams all around the country. Since King Mohammed VI’s ascendance to the throne, other water management policies were put in place, notably under the Green Morocco Plan that was launched in 2008. As Morocco is one of the world’s most water-scarce countries, King Mohammed VI ordered the construction of dams of different capacities throughout the kingdom, in October 2017. “Our constant concern to improve the general social situation and to meet the economic challenges is matched only by our active commitment to preserving and enhancing the strategic resources of our country. In this respect, water plays a key role in the dynamics of development and the preservation of stability,” said King Mohammed VI during his speech for the 19th anniversary of his ascension to the throne.

Rabat – Ghosts of the ES Tunis-Wydad scandal continue to haunt fans of the Moroccan club. Attending a game of African Champions League at the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca on Sunday, September 29, fans of Morocco’s Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) sent messages of frustration and disappointment to the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The Moroccan fans displayed a huge effigy of WAC’s valid but dismissed equalizer in the recent African Champions League final match against Tunisia’s Esperance de Tunis, suggesting the episode is still fresh among Wydad supporters.    If the WAC management has still not swallowed the pain of the recent, off-the-field defeat against Esperance de Tunis, the suffering is even more acute and much more unbearable for supporters.  As their team took on Mauritania’s FC Nouadhibou on Sunday (and won 4-1), Wydadi fans seized the moment to let out their undimmed frustration with CAF, the governing body of African football, for what the Moroccan fans see as an unfair, biased decision in the Wydad-ES Tunis controversy.  For Wydadi fans, the 2018-2019 Champions League Final against their Tunisian bete noire is nothing short of the extension of an unforgettable defeat, when the same team beat theirs 8 years ago in the same tournament. CAF recently decided that the Moroccan club was guilty of refusing to resume the match and had therefore no legal or footballing basis to claim victory.  But where CAF sees fairness and strict compliance with the rules of the game, Wydadi fans, judging from the atmosphere at the Casablanca-based stadium on Sunday and the palpable sense of frustration still driving most of the discussions on their social media platforms, see one of the most obvious cheating examples in the history of the African Champions League. Sophisticated subversiveness As the fans brandished an effigy of Walid El Karti’s dismissed equalizer (against ES Tunis) in the stands of the Casablanca stadium on Sunday, some sports outlets were quick to see in the display Wydadi fans’ subversive representation of one of the telling moments of the game against ES Tunis.  The pictures and the songs that accompanied them were an expression of discontent and disappointment with CAF’s final verdict, reports converged. Wydad fans set an example in artistry and “sophisticated protestation,” some Arabic news outlets argued.  But beauty and artistic sophistication were incidental to the message the fans wanted to highlight. At heart, the effigy of El Karti’s valid but dismissed goal aimed to convey a message of pride and pain. It said that, for all the controversy and conflicting reports that have surrounded the Wydad-ES Tunis fiasco, the erroneously dismissed goal is what Wydad fans will always remember from the game in Rades, on the outskirts of Tunis.  “What if this goal had been allowed?” the effigy appeared to say, according to some commentators. Commenting on the Sunday display by Wydad’s fans, Goal.com, a world-renowned website covering football, said that the effigy echoed the general mood about sophisticated subversiveness. It asserted the picture was a balanced blending of sophistication and subversiveness. “WAC fans hit the example of sophistication in protesting against CAF,” the website tweeted. By capturing the cancelled goal in an “elegant and artistic” way, the post added, “the public sent a message to African football authorities that this goal is a testimony to the manipulation and corruption that happened. It underlines Wydad’s right to win the title.” Missed revenge The commentary can seem like an over-interpretation, but it is backed by the general mood of revenge that filled Wydadi ranks as their team prepared to take on ES Tunis. In late May, while preparing to host the Tunisian club at Rabat’s Moulay Abdellah Stadium for the first leg of the controversial final, Wydad fans were eager for the opportunity to take revenge on an opponent that beat them in 2011 at the same phase of the same tournament. “We have not yet forgotten the match in Tunis,” one Wydadi said on the eve of the first leg. The supporters cited the ill treatment they faced at the hand of ES Tunis’s fans and the missed goals that could have changed the texture of the game. “This final is an opportunity for us to take a beautiful revenge,” he added. جمهور الوداد يضرب مثلًا في الرقي عن طريق احتجاجه على الاتحاد الإفريقي بهذا الشكل وهذه الطريقة 👏👏 الجمهور جسّد لقطة الهدف الملغي للفريق في نهائي العام الماضي أمام الترجي ووجه رسالة للاتحاد الإفريقي مفادها أن هذا الهدف شاهد على التلاعب والفساد الذي حدث وأحقية الوداد باللقب🙌 pic.twitter.com/MZEIj4dcXP — جول العربي – Goal (@GoalAR) September 29, 2019  With their team having been denied the revenge they craved, ES Tunis remains Wydad’s nightmare in the African Champions league. But while Wydadis have not really forgotten 2011, they will remember 2019 differently.  As far as Wydadis see it, they lost in 2011 because of squandered scoring opportunities. Meanwhile, they lost this year’s confrontation because of “corruption” and “extra-sporting complications.” They could have won in 2011, whereas they should have won this year.

Rabat – This week, experts on nuclear security will arrive in Morocco for the International Regulator’s Conference on Nuclear Security in Marrakech. Although Morocco does not yet have nuclear power, the Moroccan Agency for Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security (AMSSNuR), in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will host the conference October 1-4. Although Morocco does not have nuclear weapons or power, the conference goes in line with Morocco’s plans for future nuclear energy use. While South Africa remains the only African country with a nuclear power station, Morocco is aspiring to develop nuclear facilities for better energy consumption. Morocco’s plans for nuclear Twelve years ago, Morocco developed its first nuclear facility. The research reactor (RR) MA-R1 is located at Centre d’Etudes Nucleaires de la Maamora (CENM), approximately 25 kilometers north of Rabat.  The RR’s “construction culminated with the successful completion of full power endurance testing on 6 September 2007,” according to IAEA. However, Morocco has not yet connected its nuclear facility to the electrical grid. In its 2011 publication “Research Reactors in Africa,” the IAEA stated that some states with research reactors such as Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco “are seeking to use their experience as a stepping stone for a future nuclear power program for their people in order to take advantage of Africa’s vast uranium resources.” In her 2018 article in the UN’s Africa Renewal Magazine, Laura Gil noted that Morocco, being one of the African countries currently considering nuclear power, “have already engaged with the IAEA to assess their readiness to embark on a nuclear program.” Nuclear power in Morocco may be just around the corner, according to the general secretary of the Moroccan Radiation Protection Association (AMR), Abdelmajid Choukri. He mentioned in one of his works that the Moroccan government had announced, in January 2010, “plans for two 1000 MWe nuclear reactors to start operation eventually after 2020.” To achieve the country’s plans, “Morocco has signed a cooperation agreement with the United States of America, the African Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research, Development and Training related to Nuclear Energy (AFRA), as well as numerous treaties and conventions,” added Choukri. Morocco is a net energy importer and is in need of alternative energy sources. In 2016 alone, Morocco consumed 31.64 terawatts in electricity.  According to Reuters, Moroccan officials intend to use the uranium extracted from the country’s huge phosphate deposits as “feedstock for the planned nuclear power plants.” Morocco accounts for measured phosphorite resources of 85,000 metric tons, nearly half the world’s phosphate reserves. The third regulator’s conference  The conference in Marrakech will be the third such international event. In December 2012, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) organized the first conference on nuclear security. The conference “was born from the need to organize an international event on nuclear and radiological security for and by Regulators, with a view to increasing the awareness of the importance of a comprehensive national regulatory security program.” In 2016, the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN), hosted the second conference. The goal was to “promote international cooperation in nuclear security” and “enhance international nuclear security capacity building.” According to the third conference’s organizers, the AMSSNuR is planning the event “given the relevance of the nuclear and radiological security globally and especially for the African continent.” The conference’s prospectus indicates that “a broad range of experts and decision-makers in the area of nuclear security” will attend the event.

Rabat – The Spanish National Court in Malaga began the trial of a Moroccan man on Monday, September 30, who faces charges of funding the travel of two individuals, including his wife, to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The court identified the man only as “F.L.” According to the Spanish outlet COPE, the Spanish prosecution are demanding a 10-year sentence for “funding terrorists.”  In addition to the prison sentence, the prosecutor’s office requested a fine of €25,319, 20 years of disqualification, and seven years’ probation. The Moroccan allegedly made “constant contributions of money, amounting to a total of €6,329 euros, to cover his wife’s travel expenses to Syria through Turkey and join the armed jihad group.” He gave the money between March and November 2016. According to the Spanish daily, the defendant’s money transfers, believed to be around a dozen, benefitted a third party as well.  Having exceeded the quarterly limit for international transfers, the Moroccan national had allegedly asked an individual to send €500 to the same destination. The individual is “now a protected witness,” reports COPE.

Rabat – The Moroccan government and King Mohammed VI have stated their “clear position that all attempts to undermine the status of Jerusalem are unacceptable,” Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani emphasized in a new statement on the Palestinian cause. In a meeting with elected members of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), in Agadir on Sunday, El Othmani affirmed that Morocco has always supported and will keep supporting the Palestinian people.  During the meeting, the head of government said that Morocco supports the Palestinians’ right to self-determination. In letters and statements from King Mohammed VI Morocco has officially “expressed rejection for the deal of the century once for all,” El Othmani added. For Morocco, Jerusalem, also known as Al-Quds, is a red line, El Othmani said, emphasizing that the King cannot accept a compromise on it. King Mohammed VI wrote letters to both US President Donald Trump and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning against the US’ move its embassy to Jerusalem. Morocco, along with many other countries, strongly reacted to Trump’s decision to move his country’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In his letter to Trump, the King said: “The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all.” He recalled that the city of Jerusalem is not “only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism.” Repeating Morocco’s position is important Despite Morocco’s firm position, the government will continue to repeat its determination to support the legitimate rights of Palestinians, El Othmani said, as a matter of national pride “The positions of Morocco make Moroccans proud whenever they travel in the world.” El Othmani added that on Saturday, September 28, he met with the ambassador of Palestine to Morocco, who expressed his full appreciation for the King’s support in his messages to the General Assembly of the UN. El Othmani’s statement about Palestine and Trump’s “deal of the century” comes a few months after Trump’s son-in-law and advisor, Jared Kushner, visited Morocco. Kushner met with senior Moroccan officials and King Mohammed VI in May. Kushner’s visit raised concerns, especially as Morocco has long shown unwavering support for the Palestinian cause. In June, thousands of Moroccans rallied on the street in opposition to the “deal of the century.”

Rabat – One of the young men abused at a raided “Islamic school” in Nigeria has described the experience he and his companions lived as “hellfire.” Security services in Nigeria freed dozens of male students from an “Islamic school” on Thursday, September 26, in Kaduna, northern Nigeria. Nigerian local media reported that the children had been subject to physical abuse and sexual assault. One of the survivors, named Isa Ibrahim, said living in the school as “living in hellfire.” He told the BBC, “If you are praying they will beat you. If you are studying they will beat you.” He said that his family sent him to the place to correct his behavior. “I have many injuries. Almost all parts of my body have injuries,” he said. “Even if you are sleeping – they’ll use [a] cane to wake you up.” Police arrested seven people during the raid, including teachers. The BBC reported that security services will also investigate other schools suspected of similar behaviors. The male students, the majority of whom were children, were found chained and allegedly tortured. Photos of the children posted online show bruises on the backs of some students. Police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told AFP that the victims, both adults and minors, were held captive in “the most debasing and inhumane conditions in the name of teaching them the Koran.” Sabo added that they rescued around “100 students including children as young as nine in chains stuffed in a small room all in the name of reforming them and making them responsible persons.”

Rabat – A statement from the royal office announced on Sunday, September 29, that King Mohammed VI has contracted an “acute bilateral pneumonitis of  viral original.” The health condition of the King compelled his personal physician to prescribe a medical rest of a “few days for the monarch,” the statement added. The royal cabinet added that the King planned to go to France to offer his condolences to the family and relatives of late President Jacques Chirac owing to the “strong and deep relations that have always bound the two families.” Due to his sickness, the King will send his son, Crown Prince Moulay EL Hassan, to represent him  at the official funeral of Chirac. Chirac died on Thursday, September 26 at the age of 86.

Rabat – Authorities are expanding the rape investigation against prominent Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan. Earlier in September, French prosecutors asked the investigating magistrate to include new evidence from two alleged victims, France 24 reported on Sunday. The alleged incidents date back to 2015 and 2016. Authorities decided to include the new evidence after they took witness statements from the two women. Investigators identified the two alleged victims from documents detected on Ramadan‘s computers The alleged victims have not filed any criminal complaint against Ramadan. AFP quoted a testimony from one of the two women.
“It was something other than physical rape, it went beyond that … there was a moral rape,” she said. She added that Ramadan “had such a hold on you that you did everything that he demanded. But this relationship was consensual.” Police arrested Ramadan in February 2018, more than nine months after two women first came out with rape accusations in late 2017 and filed complaints against him for sexual abuse and rape. Last August, another woman accused Raman of rape. The latest plaintiff, a fifty-year old radio journalist, claimed that the ISlamic scholar raped her along with a member of his staff on May 23, 2014 in a hotel room in Sofitel lyon. The scholar refused the accusation against him emphasizing that it is baseless and part of a smear campaign against him.

Rabat – Moroccan director Maryam Touzani’s film “Adam” has received yet another accolade, this time with the film winning a Bronze Star at the El Gouna Festival. The El Gouna Festival, established in 2017, is an annual film festival held in Egypt. This year, the festival was held from September 19 to 27, and saw Sudanese director Amjad Abou win a Gold Star for his film “You’ll Die At the Age of 20.” The gold star comes with a $50,000 prize. In second place, winning the Silver Star and a cash prize of $25,000, was French director Jan Komasa’s feature film “Aid Al Korbane.” With “Adam,” her critically-acclaimed debut, Touzani won a cash prize of $15,000 for third place. The movie, which will make its debut in theatres in January 2020, spotlighted the controversial topic of unwed mothers in Morocco. The story was inspired by a pregnant woman who was going door-to-door asking for work in Touzani’s hometown of Tangier. “In a country like mine, it’s the biggest shame for a woman to have a child out of wedlock,” said Touzani. “She doesn’t want to disappoint her parents so she cannot tell the truth.” Touzani also explained her reasoning behind featuring taboo topics: “There is a facade that everything is alright on the outside even if people are tormented inside. It is good to let in some air and light, and people are relieved and happy things are being spoken about.” Adam has received praise from critics, and last month Moroccan Cinema Center (MCC) selected the debut movie to represent Morocco at the prestigious Oscar Awards. The film has been entered into for preselection in the category of Best International Feature Film.

Rabat – Moroccan political party the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) has brought the issue of hazing or “bizutage” to the Moroccan parliament. On September 27, the party addressed a question to the Moroccan Minister of Education, Said Amzazi, asking him on the measures in place to avoid internal issues at Moroccan schools and institutions, such as “bizutage.” “Some schools and institutes witness celebrations every new school season to welcome new students. However, some of these celebrations exceed the ordinary custom,” PAM wrote in its  note to Amzazi. The party said that such celebrations have become dangerous as they harm students both physically and psychologically. The party also condemned the intentional defamation that comes with hazing.    PAM said posting photos and videos of new students being subjected to bizutage can cause health complications and psychological disorders for these students. The move comes after several photos of students subject to bizutage went viral on social media, stirring public debate. The party concluded its statements with questions, calling on the minister to clarify whether the ministry would put in place measures to face such internal issues at Moroccan schools. The party also asked the minister to give clarifications about the “reality of behavioral violence within Moroccan schools, measures taken to face these problems, and means taken [by the ministry] to provide a healthy environment for students.” Whether the Ministry of Education will answer PAM’s question remains to be seen. The party’s inquiry addresses the concerns and consequences that “bizutage” might cause for students. Hazing Prevention organization  said that “the media is full of stories reporting one of the worst possible consequences of hazing: death.” The organization added there are other consequences with less severe impact than the loss of lives, but said they are still dangerous as they cause students physical, emotional and mental stability. The issue of hazing also might impact on students’ performances at school. Students in this category are often prone to a high, severe stress level, according to reports.

Rabat – Marriages between Moroccans and foreigners are becoming increasingly common in today’s globalized world. Unfortunately, the process can be quite complicated, frustrating, and stressful. Each country has their own specific procedures for their citizens who wish to marry Moroccans, but Western countries generally follow the same guidelines. The following steps specifically pertain to Americans looking to get married in Morocco to a Moroccan citizen.      Keep in mind that your future Moroccan spouse needs his or her own set of documents as required by Moroccan law. Some of these can only be obtained in the town of his or her birth.   If you do not live in Morocco, you must be sure that you have everything you need before you arrive.  You should also give yourself ample time to complete the process in Morocco. Some sources say that two weeks is enough to pull off a marriage in Morocco, but I think this is pushing it.  Places to go You only need to go once, if all goes well. You will spend a few hours there. Your future spouse cannot come inside with you.    You’ll have to go two or three times depending on your specific situation. The staff seems to only speak French or Arabic, so this may be intimidating for only-English speakers like myself. However, everyone working there was very kind. Your spouse cannot go inside with you but he or she can explain what you need to the guards.  You should only need to go once, but be prepared for multiple visits. Your spouse will do most of the talking here.  You’ll need to go at least three times. You will spend a lot of time here and your spouse will be responsible for almost all communication.    Information regarding religion He will need a certified and notarized copy of his conversion document from a religious/court notarial, also called an adoul. This is acquired at the Ministry of Justice in Rabat. Otherwise, the couple must be married in another country that does not have this law. France is a good option.   I am a Christian woman, and I had no problems marrying a Muslim man. I did not need proof of my religious denomination, but my experience may not be universal. What is an Apostille? The word “apostille” is French for certification. An Apostille is needed to verify the legitimacy of government-issued documents or certify authentic copies of these documents so that they will be accepted by foreign governments.  Documents that need an Apostille include birth, death, and marriage certificates. Court documents, administrative documents, and notarial acts may also require an Apostille. You do not need an Apostille for every document you intend to give to the Moroccan government.  Some foreign governments require American Apostilles to be issued by the US Department of State. Morocco does not require this, and state-issued Apostilles are satisfactory.   Apostilles can be obtained by mail for a $15 fee per document.  Throughout this marriage process, I needed an Apostille for my American birth certificate and my Moroccan marriage certificate. The latter was obtained in the family court where I got married.  If you intend to apply for Moroccan residency, you might need to get an Apostille for your criminal record. Experiences with the police vary, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.    Documents needed before traveling to Morocco Make at least five copies, especially if you are planning to apply for Moroccan residency or file form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) for your future spouse. You will need them at various stages throughout the marriage process. I brought my original birth certificate and an Apostille. In hindsight, this was not the most responsible decision.  I recommend ordering a certified duplicate of your birth certificate and an accompanying Apostille so you don’t gamble with the official document. The family court did not want to return my documents back to me even after my marriage was finalized, but luckily, they made an exception for the birth certificate. You will need a police record from a police department in the state where you last resided, or a criminal background check from the FBI. Both records require your fingerprints.     I got a criminal background check from the FBI. I mailed my fingerprint cards (which cost $20 to have done at a local police station) to the FBI along with a handwritten letter of intent describing what I need the report for. The application fee is $18 plus postage.  Different sources give you a variety of time frames as to when to expect your background check to be processed and mailed to you. I was expecting to receive the report 8 to 10 weeks after sending the fingerprint cards, but it was mailed to me just three weeks later.  If your file is lost in transit like mine was, you can handwrite a request for another copy, scan the request, and attach it to an email to [email protected]. I transcribed the handwritten request in my email for good measure. The FBI destroys your records 90 days after mailing your report. If you need another copy, make sure you request it within this time period, or else you’ll have to get your prints re-done. If you plan to apply for Moroccan residency (carte sejour), you should request and pay for two copies of your criminal record: One to give to the family court when getting married and one to give to the local police when applying for residency.  Keep the second copy sealed or the police will question its authenticity. The police may need an Apostille for this document as well.    If you do not live in Morocco, you will need to prove that you have stable employment in the country where you reside.    I didn’t need this because I moved to Morocco to live with my husband, and he is financially responsible for me.  If you are an unemployed woman, you will probably not run into any problems as men are expected to provide for their wives under Islamic law. Bear in mind that this is a different story when attempting to move your spouse to the US.   You will need an Apostille for any death certificates or copies. It’s better to get a certified copy in case the court does not want to return the original.    If you have been married before, you need proof that this marriage was officially terminated.  If you have never been married, you will need to prove it.  I had not been married before, so I asked for a single status letter from the Register of Wills and Clerk of Orphans Court from the county of my American residence. This document proved that I had never been married in the county. The fee for this was $65.  Documents obtained in Morocco Take your passport or residency card to the Ministry of Justice in Rabat. They will record your biographical information and give you a form to fill out.  Go outside and complete the form, then return it. They will give you a ticket that says when you should come back; usually this will be after a few hours. Make sure you go in the morning so they will not make you wait until the next day. If they try to tell you it will take weeks, insist that you’re leaving the country tomorrow. When it’s your time, take the ticket and your passport or residency card back to the office, and they will give you your Moroccan police record. There was no fee for this, in my experience.  Make sure to bring a pen with you, or simply borrow one from a nearby shop. This document is obtained from the US Consulate General in Casablanca for a fee of $50. Make an appointment online for American Citizen Services/notarial services, and print your appointment confirmation. Download the confirmation page because you will not be able to find it later.   You will need to bring your passport to the US Consulate. You may also need proof that you are eligible to marry (single status letter, proof of divorce, or death certificate). They will give you a form to fill out, and then you will take it to the cashier for payment. Take the receipt back to the desk where you got the form and wait for your name to be called.   Upon calling your name, an official will return your passport and other documents. They will give you the official affidavit and the documents listed in the next item.  This is done at the US Consulate General in Casablanca for a fee of $50 (not included in the affidavit fee). You do not need a separate appointment for this service. Please note that you need your most recent date of entry notarized. Before I could get married, I had to travel out of the country to renew my tourist visa, so I did not get any documents from the US Consulate until I returned to Morocco.  You should call a few offices and ask if they are familiar with this service as it specifically pertains to mixed marriages. When you find one, head in for a check-up, and they will give you the proper write-up. I did not need my medical records for the appointment but you may want to bring them just in case.  You and your significant other each need four for the marriage. The required size is 3 centimeters by 4 centimeters.  If you are going to apply for residency in Morocco, you will need another six of the 3 centimeter by 4 centimeter photos.  If you are planning to file form I-130 for your spouse, you will need two more passport-style photos of yourself and two of your significant other, measuring 5 centimeters by 5 centimeters.  I found it to be less expensive to have pictures taken and printed in Morocco than in the US.  The next steps You need to get all of these documents translated into Arabic, including your notarized passport pages (biographical and date of entry) and your birth certificate.  It is best to go to a government-appointed translator if you can afford it. The total cost for this was around MAD 2,300 ($230). You only need one original translation for each document. Ask the translator for at least four copies of each document and their translations. The translator may need a day or two to complete this.  They will review your documents, let you know if you are missing anything, and give you an envelope. This may take a few days.  You and your spouse will be interviewed about your relationship, your education, each of your families, and so on. The police will create a file for you and send it back to the family court. Again, this may take a few days.  Now is the time to request your original documents back, but do not be surprised if the court refuses. This is why it is important to get certified copies of any documents you may need in the future, such as your birth certificate or criminal record.   The adoul will handle your marriage application for a fee of $15.  The adoul will ask you a few questions, clarify some information, and draft your marriage certificate in Arabic. You and your future spouse should carefully review it to ensure there are no errors. You will have to write your name in Arabic in his record book, so start practicing! The adoul will issue your marriage certificate and you will be legally married. Feel free to ask for multiple copies if you need them.   You should also take it to a certified translator and have it translated into the official language of the country where you plan to reside.  If you are filing form I-130, you will need to include an English translation of your marriage certificate in your folder to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.  If you make it this far, the fun begins! You can enjoy your wedding and honeymoon stress-free knowing that if you and your spouse made it through this, you can make it through anything. This all may seem daunting, but do not let it scare you. Most of the process is going back and forth between buildings and waiting around.  If you come to Morocco prepared, you should not run into any problems. All you need is enough time and patience and you will have your happily ever after—plus, it makes for a great story to share with your friends and family!

Rabat – A Saudi man has shot dead a personal bodyguard of Saudi King Salman after a “personal dispute,” Saudi Arabia’s state-owned news agency Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Sunday. The victim, Major General Abdlaziz Al Faghem, was an established member of the Kingdom’s security services, having served for many years in close circles of the Saudi Royal Palace. A friend of the Al Faghem  shot him with a gunfire in the Red Sea city of Jeah, Saudi Arabia, the report noted. The bodyguard died of wounds in the hospital. The alleged “personal dispute” happened at another friend’s house.  A police statement quoted by SPA said that the tragic incident occurred after a conversation between Fagham and his killer, identified as  Mamdouh al-Ali, “escalated.” “Ali left the home, came back carrying a gun and fired at Fagham, injuring two others in the household.” Among the injured were a Filipino worker and  the house’s owner’s brother, the statement added. Police killed the shooter during a standoff in which five policemen were injured. The bodyguard was well a prominent member of the kingdom’s security services as he served both the current King and late King Abdullah. The bodyguard’s name is now trending on Twitter as many Saudis heavily condemn his death.

Casablanca – Recently there has been some talk regarding the inclusion of sex education in the Moroccan education system. Morocco must carefully consider what kind of sex education it promotes and should follow a comprehensive sexuality education. The talk comes as part of the “Covenant on the Rights of the Child in Islam” (CRII) which Morocco has signed. The convention, established in 2005, is pretty vague in language. However, it clearly stipulates that young Muslims must “receive proper sex education distinguishing between the lawful and unlawful.” So they must learn what is halal, permissible, and what is not. In other words, Morocco is about to embark on a quest to educate about religious morality and sex in the classroom. Some may cheer for such a “progressive” move toward educating young Moroccans about sex. Calls for sex education started long ago when Morocco signed a 1995 UNESCO convention, a much more comprehensive document. However, this move has risks. First, let us define the terminology. “Sex education,” as James Ponzetti states in his book “Evidence-based Approaches to Sexuality Education,” has a clear boundary in common discourse. In fact, it has been limited to “instruction on subjects such as sexual anatomy, reproduction, birth control, and disease prevention.” It is an education that focuses on biology, but it reinforces moral values through teachers’ inability to distance themselves from the subject, passing on their morality to students in class. A more comprehensive term is “sexuality education,” which Ponzetti says “is an inclusive descriptor that recognizes the interaction of historical, social, political, cultural, psychological, legal, ethical, religious, and moral factors.” What is abstinence-only sex education? Considering that in Islam as practiced in Morocco, only heterosexual, traditional marriages are allowed. Abstinence from sex before marriage is almost all that this halal sex education is going to be about. It is like saying: “Hey, kids. Don’t have sex until you’re married. Also, all other forms of sexuality are haram, forbidden in Islam, and possibly a mental disorder.” This form of education as proposed by the CRII is similar to what is commonly called “abstinence-only education.” It explicitly informs students that premarital sex is wrong and unhealthy and should be avoided. If the goal of sex education is to minimize the risks of immoral and unhealthy sexual behavior, in theory, abstinence-only is the perfect model. It promotes sexual inactivity and teaches abstinence and rejection of sexual advances from both sexes. It scares pupils by referencing the risks of premarital or extramarital sex, such as HIV/AIDS, a long list of other sexually transmitted diseases and infections, unwanted pregnancies, and most importantly, hell for all sinners. In reality, abstinence-only sex education fails in all of it. UNESCO has made it clear that there is no evidence abstinence-only actually works. Many report that such education raises more questions than it answers. Students are left to their own means to find these answers. A large portion of them prefers taking the risk. This is largely because it is futile to pretend that young people are not instinctively curious about sex. Is ‘abstinence-only’ working in Morocco? As part of the research for the author’s master’s thesis this year, a study found that 40.2% of 366 surveyed Moroccans, aged between 18 and 24, had at least one sexual relationship before marriage. Also, according to a 2014 High Commission for Planning (HCP) report, the average age of marriage among Moroccans is 25.7 for women and 31.3 for men, making it relatively harder to abstain from intercourse until the wedding night. Abstinence is even more problematic as new media make everything accessible, and young people are exposed to sex-related material more than before. A successful sex education program should not ignore such developments in society. Instead, UNESCO calls for the implementation of a comprehensive sexuality education program. This program is defined as “a curriculum-based process of teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physical and social aspects of sexuality. It aims to equip children and young people with knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that will empower them to: realize their health, well-being and dignity; develop respectful social and sexual relationships; consider how their choices affect their own well-being and that of others; and, understand and ensure the protection of their rights throughout their lives.” The first technical guide directed toward teachers and education professionals was published in 2009 and updated in 2018. Both reviewed multiple comprehensive sexuality education programs and found them to be mostly effective. For example, 37% of the programs successfully delayed initiation of sex and 53% of them reduced sexual risk-taking. Morocco’s only chance at getting ahead of the sex-related social problems that are growing every year is to implement a comprehensive sexuality education program. Neither the threat of prison nor society’s shame is keeping young people from experimenting with their sexuality. Consequences of risky sex The Moroccan Insaf Association estimated there were 30,000 new single mothers per year in 2015, a 70% increase since 2009. The number could be as high as 50,000 new single mothers every year by 2020. The UN program on AIDS reported that there are 22,000 adults living with HIV in Morocco as of 2017. The Moroccan Ministry of Health reported that there were 440,000 new cases of sexually transmitted diseases and infections in 2015. According to a study by the newspaper Economiste and Moroccan research group Sunergia in 2011, less than 3% of young Moroccans can name a sexually transmitted disease other than AIDS and syphilis. At the very least, a comprehensive sexuality program would help young Moroccans avoid premature marriages, unplanned pregnancies, abortions, single motherhood, child abandonment, and sexually transmitted diseases.

Rabat  – Morocco has been re-elected for a third term as co-chair of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. This move marks the culmination of Morocco’s leadership in the fight against terrorism, Italian media outlets reported on September 27. Agenzia Nova stressed that Morocco’s re-election to co-chair the World Forum for the next three mandates (2020-2022) shows the renewed confidence and appreciation that Morocco enjoys as an indispensable partner in the fight against terrorism both within the Forum and on a global level. The re-election represents the international recognition of Morocco’s main role in the fight against terrorism, the news outlet said. In an article by Domenico Letizia, the Italian newspaper L’Opinione Delle Liberta reported that Morocco has succeeded in developing a unique and pioneering experience that has been globally commended for its effectiveness.  Letizia added that Morocco’s experience is based on several axes combining security management and restructuring the religious field. Morocco also emphasizes the need to confront poverty and marginalization, which are thought to produce fertile ground for the spread of terrorism and extremism. Letizia wrote that Morocco’s leading position in the field is owed to its integrated strategy and the state commitment in this field. Morocco, Letizia asserted, has successfully established its name as an active partner in global initiatives to combat terrorism. Letizia pointed out that Morocco’s multifaceted approach has become an effective model for the world to immunize against the threat of terrorism. The US Department of State has commended “the multidimensional nature of the Moroccan strategy, which prioritizes the objectives of economic and human development, security vigilance measures, as well as firm cooperation at the regional and international levels,” Letizia stated. Insightful leadership The Italian News Agency (AGC) highlighted the insightful leadership of King Mohammed VI that has allowed Morocco to develop its experience in the field of combating terrorism, primarily by confronting the social and economic causes of its spread. Morocco has become a leader in this field and has set an example for other countries. AGC highlighted Morocco’s multifaceted commitment and continuous efforts to make a valuable and effective contribution to the fight against terrorism, stressing that the country is an essential pillar of stability, given its active involvement in global and regional efforts to strengthen capacities to combat this threat. For four years, the Forum’s joint presidency of Morocco and the Netherlands has set key priorities to promote a proactive approach while mobilizing efforts to provide answers to emerging threats, as reported by Italian news outlet Journali Diplomatico. Journali Diplomatico added that the two mandates in which Morocco and the Netherlands co-chaired the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum were “the most productive” since the Forum’s inception. Founded in 2011, the Global Counterterrorism Forum is an international body of 29 countries in addition to the European Union. The Forum’s primary mission is to reduce the vulnerability of people worldwide to global terrorism by preventing, combating, and prosecuting terrorist acts; and by countering incitement and recruitment to terrorism. The Forum brings together experts and practitioners from countries and regions around the world to share experiences and skills, and to develop the proper tools and strategies to effectively address the evolution of the terrorist threat.

Rabat – Iranian proxy,  Yemen’s Houthis, claimed new attacks near the border with the southern Saudi region of Ajran on Saturday, September 28, Reuters reported. The Houthis claimed they attacked several Saudi soldiers. They also claimed that they have captured “thousands” of others. Saudi owned news agency has not yet confirmed the Houthis attacks. The alleged attack comes a few weeks after Houthi rebels claimed drone attacks against two Saudi oil facilities on September 14. The Houthi rebels also threatened to widen attacks against Saudi Arabia. Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said after the attacks that the rebels “warn the Saudis that our targets will keep expanding.” The same spokesman added, “ We have the right to strike back in retaliation to the airstrikes and the targeting of our civilians for the last five years.” Several Arab countries condemned the attacks, including Morocco. Morocco reiterated its condemnation yesterday through a statement from Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. In an interview with  Sky News Arabia, Bourita has  said that the security and stability of SaudiArabia is an integral part of Morocco’s own security and stability. The minister also blamed Iran for the attacks, urging the international community to take a strong stand against its “hostilities against the countries of the region.”

Rabat – Israeli troops killed a Palestinian protesters and injured at least 63 others during demonstrations against Israeli occupation on Friday,  September 27. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that Israeli forces shot 32 injured victims during the protests. The Palestinian demonstrators rallied yesterday, September 27, as  part of weekly anti-Israel protesters known as the Great March of Return. The protest campaign has been running since March 2018. Israeli forces fired tear gas and live gunshots at the protesters to prevent them from reaching the fence of the borders. Israeli forces have killed more than 200  protesters, while thousands others have sustained injuries since March 2018. Several Arab states, including Morocco have been condemning Israeli violations against Palestinians. Earlier this month, Morocco’s government urged the members of the United Nations Security Council to take concrete steps to end Israeli violations against the legitimate rights of Palestinians. On September 15, Secretary of State to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mounia Boucetta said at the emergency meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) that the persistent violations by the Israeli authorities “undermine the two-state solution and hinder international efforts to revive the peace process.” Boucetta added that Israel’s violations against the legitimate rights of Palestinians constitute a “constant source of tension, extremism, hatred, and instability” in the Middle East.

Rabat – Security services found the bodies of seven Moroccan irregular migrants on Saturday, September 28,  on the beach of Ain Harrouda, near Casablanca. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has reported that the authorities found  the bodies after the sea washed them onto the beach. The migrants, including one woman, attempted to reach Europe from Morocco via an inflatable boat. Authorities also found three survivors, who were unconscious.  Security services transferred the rescued survivors to the Mohammedia Provincial Hospital for necessary medical care. Moroccan emergency services also deployed search operations to find other potential survivors from the boat-wreck. Police opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the case and to arrest the irregular migration network that organized the operation. In recent years, Morocco has been facing pressure of irregular migration due to the increase of the number of undocumented migrants seeking to use Morocco as a transit country to reach Europe. Last month, Morocco’s  spokesperson of the government Mustapha El Khalfi said that security services aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. The official added that  Moroccan police also managed to dismantle 100 irregular migration networks. Morocco’s government has long called for a shared responsibility with Spain to tackle border migration crisis. In August, director of migration and border surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali said in an interview with El Diario that “border security is the responsibility of all countries, all countries must contribute to make the fight against cross-border crime an effective fight.”

Rabat – Saudi Arabia announced, on September 27, the launch of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic reform program. The program will open the country up to tourists and aims to attract foreign investment in the tourism industry.  The Kingdom has launched a new visa program that will allow the entry of travelers from 52 countries and territories. The new visa regulations came into effect on September 28. Citizens of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and the UAE will not need to obtain a visa to visit the Kingdom.  Citizens of the following countries can obtain eVisas online or on arrival: Andorra Australia Brunei Canada China All European Union member states Hong Kong Iceland Japan Kazakhstan  South Korea Lichtenstein  Macau Malaysia Monaco Montenegro New Zealand Norway Russia San Marino Singapore Switzerland Taiwan Ukraine  The United States Morocco is excluded from this list, as is the rest of North Africa. Saudi Arabia has not released a specific explanation for their selection of included countries.  Morocco has historically maintained a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi monarchy recently reiterated its respect for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Saudi Arabia also celebrated Moroccan culture in August.   Most Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Israel, and Palestine are absent as well. Other Muslim-majority countries such as Pakistan and Indonesia have been left out, too.  Why visit Saudi Arabia? Although the holy cities of Mecca and Medina will remain off-limits to non-Muslims, tourists will be free to enjoy “five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture, and breathtaking natural beauty,” said Tourism Minister Ahmad al Khateeb.  Tourists can relax on beaches, hike volcanoes, and go camping.  Saudi Arabia’s historic landmarks, such as the ancient desert city of Madain Saleh, are also now open to foreign visitors.   Madain Saleh was once the second largest Nabatean city, second only to the famed archaeological site Petra, which is in modern-day Jordan. Madain Saleh was the first site in Saudi Arabia to join the UNESCO World Heritage list. Other sites include the historic city of Jeddah, the Gate to Mecca, and the 19th century Masmak Fortress in Riyadh. Tourists can also glimpse Neolithic art on the rock faces of Jubbah and Shuwaymis.  The once-secluded and oil-rich Kingdom now hopes to increase tourism from 3% of its GDP to 10% by 2030.  As part of its tourism-boosting initiatives, the Kingdom recently relaxed the dress code requirements for foreign women and will allow women to travel to the Kingdom unaccompanied.  The Kingdom also aims to increase the number of Muslim pilgrims visiting the country annually from 18 million to 30 million.  Since its official inception in 1932, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has retained an air of mystery. Access to the county has been largely restricted to Muslim pilgrims, business people, and expatriate workers—until now.  After years of human rights controversies and the media storm surrounding the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia is attempting to rebrand. It remains to be seen if the rest of the rest of the world will facilitate this endeavor.

Rabat – Averty, a marketing research firm, has released the results of a study on digital channels in Morocco. The study was conducted in collaboration with Maroc Numeric Cluster, whose mission is to bring innovative projects to the fore through aid and financing.   The survey responses from 700 randomly selected people to offer key marketing information to local businesses. The study’s respondents were primarily students, employees, and managers in Morocco. Brands can use the results to determine the best way to boost consumer engagement and settle on a direction for future advertising initiatives.  According to the study’s findings, advertisers must keep up with digitization while being careful not to overwhelm consumers.  The report finds that having a solid presence on social media and creating a high-quality mobile application appears to be more effective in attracting consumers. Sending commercial emails and promoting branded content with ads can discourage engagement, according to the research.  Advertising and consumer engagement is by far the most effective on social media platforms. 44% of the survey’s respondents interact with brands on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.  Although 40% do not engage with brands on social media, this medium still boasts the highest rates of brand-consumer interaction.  Commercial emails are far less successful in reaching a Moroccan audience.  Only 20.3% of respondents voluntarily subscribe to commercial or non-profit newsletters, while 45% do not open commercial emails.  Mobile applications could be a good investment for brands looking to boost consumer engagement, as 51% of respondents prefer to interact with brands through apps rather than websites.  Some of the reasons offered for this preference include receiving notifications from the app and having access to exclusive offers.  The study also finds that 49% of respondents are satisfied with mobile web browsing due to the increased protection of their personal data and the lack of storage space available on the phone for apps. However, two-thirds of respondents will give up on visiting a brand’s website if it is not compatible with mobile use.  Online advertising has taken over, but the influx of sponsored content isn’t universally appreciated: 39.5% of the survey’s respondents do not like to see advertising online.  The diverse results of the study ideally will allow brands to optimize their use of digital mediums in forging connections with consumers.

Rabat – Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, has renewed the country’s commitment to African causes. Bourita cited the “visible efforts” the North African has made in the past two years to promote “effective and coherent” intra-African initiatives. Bourita, who was speaking at a panel on “The Interdependence between Peace, Security, and Development” during a side event of the ongoing UN General Assembly, mentioned the long list of conflicts still affecting many African countries. From the convoluted crisis in Libya, the uncertain peace in the Central African Republic, and the worrying climate of terrorism in the Sahel, there emerges a view of the continent as a bleak and chaotic place, Bourita suggested. However, he hastened to add, the recently signed peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as the fragile but reassuring situation now prevailing the Central African Republic, are reasons to hope that the continent can find a way of solving its own problems. For Bourita, despite the wide range of complex challenges still hitting the vast majority of African countries, “concerted actions and a spirit of collective burden of sharing” can help the continent prevail and stand as bastion peace, security, and economic prosperity in a globalized world where the independence of those factors has grown more acute. “Insecurity is an essential impediment to economic and social development, and the lack of socio-economic development provides a fertile ground for instability and insecurity,” he said, pointing to the “fundamental interdependence” between economic prosperity and social challenges. “But if the prevailing picture in Africa is not particularly all roses in the current moment, we nonetheless have reasons for hope,” the Moroccan minister pointed out. Bourita cited a number of countries now recovering from the sequels of internal conflicts or civil wars. “These are some of the few recent steps that our continent has made in its march towards peace, stability, and economic development,” he noted. Bourita particularly stressed Morocco’s role in various African causes and AU-led platforms to come for the continent to terms with the wide range of pan-African challenges. “Morocco strongly believes that the response to all our challenges is concerted action and shared responsibility,” Bourita stressed. He added that Africa’s “emergence from its current challenges” calls for “frank mobilization” of African governments as well as “coherent and effective” continental policies. “Persisting issues of peace and stability in the continent cannot be divorced from governance and policy making problems,” he declared. He concluded by emphatically noting that Morocco, under the “enlightened guidance” and “clear vision” of King Mohammed VI will remain strongly, steadily committed to the advancement of Africa.

Rabat – UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has congratulated Morocco for its commitment to the UN-led process in the Western Sahara territorial dispute. Guterres lauded the “efforts and commitment” the North African country has shown in recent months to a politically negotiated, lasting settlement. Guterres made his comments during a meeting with Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, on the sidelines of this week UN Climate Action Summit and the ongoing UN General Assembly. During their meeting, Bourita and Guterres spoke about peace and security concerns in the MENA region, as well as Morocco’s growing role in a range of concerns of worldwide significance. Morocco’s state-owned news outlet MAP later reported that Guterres also “saluted” both Morocco’s commitment to UN peace-keeping missions around the world (particularly in Africa) and its noticeable and ongoing efforts towards lasting peace and a politically negotiated resolution in the longstanding Western Sahara dispute. “Guterres thanked Morocco for supporting ongoing reforms at the UN and for taking the lead in various UN peacekeeping missions,” MAP noted. The news comes amid speculation over stasis in the UN-led process for Western Sahara. Since the unexpected resignation of Horst Kohler as UN envoy for Western Sahara, the hope that the UN-led process had garnered in the past two years has given space to uncertainty, resurrected doubts, and ignited fears of a fall back to “business as usual.” Five months since Kohler’s resignation, the UN has been resoundingly silent on his prospective replacement. “The past 100 days have seen a breakdown in this [Western Sahara] matter. There is a crisis of perspective,” one expert recently told Moroccan outlet le 360. Next month, the UNSC will again meet to discuss the fate of the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara. With that on the horizon, it remains to be seen which direction the UN-led process will take in the coming months.

Rabat – Morocco is home to nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, one of them being the entire capital city of Rabat. With its unique blend of modernity and antiquity, Rabat is a must-visit for history-loving tourists. Overlooking the Oued Bouregreg, the red sandstone walls of Chellah are a formidable sight. Just past Bab Zaer, the ruins are easily accessible to those visiting Rabat. Upon entering, you’ll be immersed in a beautiful and well-preserved realm of ancient Moroccan history.    There is compelling evidence that the site, which was a natural port on the banks of the Bouregreg, was first occupied by the Phoenicians as early as the third century BC. The Phoenician settlement was known as Shalat. The site was later controlled by Carthage, modern-day Tunisia. Chellah was officially built by the Romans around 40 AD and was known at the time as Sala Colonia, or Sala. This major port city included key Roman architectural elements such as a forum, a triumphal arch, a temple, aqueducts, and a principal roadway.  Sala was also home to one of the Romans’ two main naval outposts on the Atlantic coast; the other was in the modern-day city of Larache. The Sala port was primarily used by commercial Roman ships heading southwest towards Casablanca.  During the reign of the Romans, Sala Colonia was a center of Christianity in Roman Africa.  Although the city fell to local Imazighen tribes around 250 AD, the Romans maintained commercial and political contact with Sala until the seventh century AD. Sala was a town of Christianized Imazighen ruled by a Byzantine governor until 683 AD, when the Muslim Arabs arrived. Uqba ibn Nafi was the first Muslim ruler to conquer the city. In 1031 AD, the Almoravids resettled Sala, erected new buildings in the town, and rebuilt the Great Mosque of Sala. They were overthrown by Amazigh Almohads by 1147 AD and the site became a royal burial ground.    Sala was abandoned in 1154 AD after its inhabitants moved across the Oued Bouregreg to Sale.  The Almohad dynasty used the site as a sacred cemetery, or necropolis, until the Marinid dynasty took power in the early 13th century AD. In the 14th century AD, the Marinids named the necropolis “Chellah.” This dynasty built the defensive walls and towers that guard Chellah today, along with the mosque, the Quranic school, and the royal tombs. A sudden wave of massive destruction  The 1755 Lisbon earthquake destroyed the structures that remained in Chellah at the time.  This 9.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Portugal on November 1 and triggered devastating fires. 40 minutes after the shocks, a massive tsunami further destroyed several Portuguese cities.  The earthquake was felt throughout Europe and shocks reached as far north as Finland and Greenland. Tsunami waves hit western Ireland and southern England. Tsunamis also swept across the Atlantic Ocean and struck Martinique, Barbados, and Brazil.  An estimated 10,000 people were killed in Morocco, as the earthquake’s shocks toppled structures, sparked fires, and sent tsunami waves along the North African coast. The earthquake killed between 10,000 and 100,000 people in Portugal alone, making it one of the deadliest in history.  Chellah’s lengthy history is tangible today despite the site being in ruins. Although it’s hard to imagine the true size of the ancient city and cemetery, you can still find key archaeological remains from the Roman and Arab eras.  Roman columns and arches are still standing, as is the Marinid minaret. The skeletal remains of the mosque, the Islamic school, and the royal tombs are open to exploration.  The ancient settlement, which was designated a World Heritage Site in 2012, is now inhabited by sizable colonies of storks and cats and is a venue for world-renowned music festivals such as Mawazine and Jazz au Chellah. According to the department of culture at the Moroccan Ministry of Culture and Communication, the Chellah necropolis welcomed 43,430 visitors between January and April of 2019.

Rabat – Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has issued a circular calling on all public sectors and institutions to adopt the new portrait of King Mohammed VI. The new photograph has been the official monarch portrait since its release on September 23. In his circular No.15/2019, El Othmani noted that the portrait is available exclusively at Barid Al-Maghrib (Morocco’s Postal Service). Public institutions have begun to display the new portrait following the release of the circular.  The Minister of National Education, Vocational Training and Scientific Research also sent a correspondence to the directors of the regional academies of education and training calling for the adoption of the new portrait. In this new portrait, the sovereign appears dressed in a black suit with a neatly trimmed beard. He is seated on the throne, the Moroccan flag standing next to him. The King last updated his official portrait when he ascended to the throne 20 years ago, in 1999.

Rabat – Climate change and human rights go hand in hand, a reality the world is recognizing at its 11th hour. Large-scale natural disasters now occur once weekly and forced migration is increasingly a part of international policy discussion. It is no longer possible to ignore climate change or label it a problem for future generations. Climate change already causes suffering worldwide, and its impacts will not be slowed without swift, robust action. “Although climate change has been on the human rights agenda for well over a decade, it remains a marginal concern for most actors. Yet it represents an emergency without precedent and requires bold and creative thinking from the human rights community” said UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights Philip Alston, who released a landmark report on June 25.  Regarding climate change outlook, Alston wrote in no uncertain terms, “We have reached a point where the best-case outcome is widespread death and suffering by the end of this century, and the worst-case puts humanity on the brink of extinction.”  Concentrated efforts may improve circumstances towards this “best-case outcome,” but outcomes will affect populations differently. Alston terms this the “climate apartheid.” “We risk a ‘climate apartheid’ scenario where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.” Alston continued, “Even if current targets are met, tens of millions will be impoverished, leading to widespread displacement and hunger.” The special rapporteur’s report chastises governments, other major actors, and even its author for ignoring the gravity of this emergency. Now, Alston writes, the time to dispute science is finished. Now is the time to act.  Human rights groups and major climate change actors came together September 18-19 at the People’s Summit on Climate, Rights, and Human Survival in New York, the first forum of its kind. Participants signed a declaration calling for acknowledgment and action from all stakeholders, especially to hear and protect those most vulnerable: “To achieve climate justice,” reads the declaration, “we must also recognize that although the climate crisis is a global problem affecting everybody, it disproportionately affects persons, groups, and peoples in vulnerable situations, who see their rights violated and who are subjected to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination. The climate crisis also impacts countries unequally.” The onus to act no longer lies on eco-activists. Problems for the environment are problems for people.  The summit preceded the annual UN Climate Action Summit. December’s COP25 in Chile will allow governments to agree on more rapid and stringent action against the climate crisis.  Alston’s report echoes scores of scientifically-based reports with undeniable evidence. Yet, the report misses one key point. Alston’s language is almost entirely framed in the future tense. His conclusion reads that “the group that will be most negatively affected across the globe are those living in poverty.”  Damages already affect the world’s poorest populations. Climate change is no longer an issue to address “for future generations.” Populations suffer today. A major manifestation is the displacement of vulnerable populations. The UNHCR reported that about 41.3 million people were internally displaced at the end of 2018. A total of 16.1 million of these IDPs were displaced due to “weather-related hazards” according to the International Displacement Monitoring Center. This figure predominantly comes from storm events such as cyclones and hurricanes but also encompasses issues such as droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures.  As of now, climate change is not a legally recognized reason to seek asylum. This creates legal barriers for people already suffering against great odds.  In Syria, “extreme droughts from 2007-2010 were made three times more likely due to climate change and caused 75 percent of the most vulnerable farmers to experience total crop failure, displacing 1.5 – 2 million people,” according to Caitlin Werrell, co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security. This massive displacement preceded one of the deadliest conflicts in the last several decades. In Yemen, lives on the Socotra Islands have been uprooted, causally linked to climate change. The archipelago was quite undeveloped and separated culturally and ecologically from mainland Yemen. Two cyclones hit the islands within one week in 2015. The cyclones wreaked havoc and uprooted about a third of Socotris. Climate change played a role in the unusual cyclones, according to researchers.  The UAE brought humanitarian aid to the islands and remained as a military presence. A recent report by Minority Rights Group International said, “Just as they have played no part in the development of the conflict on the mainland, so too the Socotri community has contributed little to climate change – and yet, like other communities on the frontline of global warming, they are now faced with its worst effects.” This climate apartheid is visible in Israel, MENA’s apartheid state. The environment inhabited by Israelis and Palestinians, both within Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, presents the same natural stressors. Rising sea levels and average temperatures are threats causally linked to climate change.  Israeli forces attacked water treatment plants in Gaza in 2014. Israeli restrictions generally do not allow construction supplies to reach Palestine, so Palestine cannot rebuild the plants. Palestinians must rely on polluted and disappearing groundwater. This water insecurity results in drought crises, food insecurity, and sanitation hazards. At the same time, Israel controls the Jordan River headwaters, a crucial water source. Israel ranks high for resilience to climate change, as an upper-income country; Palestine is absent in the same rankings. The UNDP deems Israeli occupation an environmental risk factor, as the Palestinian Authority is unable to manage its land and resources.  The same area of land faces a high risk for climate change impacts, but its poorer population is by far shouldering the brunt. The Israeli apartheid state exacerbates the climate apartheid in a tragic case of climate injustice.  Climate apartheid already plays out across the US. According to a study by the National Center for Climate Assessment, “Results at national, state, and county scales all indicate that non-Whites tend to be burdened disproportionately to Whites.” Senator Kamala Harris and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently introduced a proposal entitled the Climate Equity Act to support communities suffering from these uneven consequences. The bill would require environmental legislation to rate impacts on low-income communities. This comes alongside other climate justice proposals by Governor Jay Inslee of Washington and presidential candidate Tom Steyer.  The new plans “are timely and they are needed,” according to Obama-era EPA justice official Mustafa Ali. “And they help us to begin to think critically about the steps that are going to be necessary to protect people’s lives in the moment, and in these challenges that are rushing at us at a very quick pace.” Global inequality is on the rise, but two developing African nations show a feasible path to minimize climate apartheid. Morocco and The Gambia are the only two countries worldwide on track to surpass Paris Agreement goals, and to reduce carbon emissions to a 1.5°C warming scenario, according to Climate Action Tracker.  While these two countries tackle internal development challenges and did not create the climate apartheid, they show leadership in limiting its harm.

Rabat – Morocco welcomed one million tourists every month in 2018, and that number has only grown in 2019.  For prospective tourists, there are plenty of detailed travel guides out there and experts who are eager to share their knowledge of Morocco. But one list can’t include everything, so here are ten more tips for visiting Morocco. Weather forecasts for Morocco usually don’t give you an accurate idea of how hot or cold you will actually feel. It will usually be hotter or colder than you expect.  Winter inland travelers should be well aware of the frigid temperatures. But if you’re traveling to Morocco’s Atlantic or Mediterranean coasts between November and April, you may want to reconsider your packing list.  Daytime temperatures in Morocco’s coastal cities seldom drop below 50 F (10 C). If you’re living in a cold part of the world, you might think these are pretty nice winter conditions. Don’t let the numbers fool you. You will be cold.  Not every building has functioning heating systems, the air along the coast is very wet, and winds are strong. Each of these factors can make you feel colder than expected. Winter is also Morocco’s rainy season, so be prepared.  I suggest bringing a winter coat, rain boots, and warm pants, especially if you plan on going out and about at night. Taking the train is a great, inexpensive way to get around Morocco. However, trains can be unreliable.  To ensure you don’t run into any problems, you should plan to arrive at your destination about an hour later than the time posted on your ticket or the ONCF schedule, especially if you have to switch trains at some point.  Delays can set you back up to three hours for no apparent reason. Sometimes they can be even worse—I once took a train from Rabat to Tangier that was delayed for seven hours due to high winds.  If you’re trying to make a flight or check-in to accommodation, be sure to allow enough time for any train delays.   Morocco’s street food gets a lot of flack, and I totally understand why. I’ve had my fair share of food poisoning during my time here. But I don’t think it’s right to limit yourself to hotel breakfasts and dinners at fancy restaurants just because you’re worried about upsetting your stomach. The best way to avoid a severe bout of food poisoning is to steer clear of uncooked vegetables, even in sandwiches. Don’t get anything that contains lettuce.  It’s also important to not overdo it. Don’t eat street meat more than once a day as this might be pushing your stomach’s limits. However, desserts and bread should be fine in any quantity. It’s entirely possible for one meal to ruin the rest of your day, so if you do decide to take a chance on street meat, save it for the evening.   Above all, trust your judgment. If a place looks totally empty, extremely dirty, or the employees seem uninterested in serving you, look for another spot to eat.  If you don’t have a Moroccan family that is willing to share their meals with you, street food is the next best thing.  The tap water is a different story. You don’t gain anything from taking a chance on some questionable water. There are no amazing flavors to be experienced or memories to be had from tap water. Risking your bowels is just not worth it.  Do not drink any water that you have not seen come directly from a sealed bottle or filtration system. This includes the water jugs at casual dining spots and the glasses of water served with beverages at cafes. That water comes from the sink. Don’t drink it.  Bring your own bottle of water wherever you go. If you don’t have a personal filter, you can easily find bottled water at small stores or supermarkets.  I have an especially sensitive stomach, so some bottled water can still make me uneasy. I only buy brands with labels that feature a small picture of a baby and the accompanying phrase “idéal pour les bébés.” This ensures that I won’t have any problems.  Some areas in Morocco have tap water that won’t upset your stomach, but it’s best to play it safe. You should only be paying around 3 MAD ($0.30) per liter of bottled water. I once paid 15 MAD for two liters of Sidi Ali. Don’t be like me.  You will, without a doubt, see many standalone juice vendors while traveling in Morocco. All of this juice is fantastic and you need to try it at least once. Juice varieties include orange, strawberry, ginger lemonade, pomegranate, hibiscus, and sugar cane, to name a few. You’ll find even more options at restaurants and cafes.  My all-time favorite Moroccan street juice is sugar cane and lime; however, limes are usually hard to come by in Morocco, so most vendors use lemon. You can add ginger to this blend as well.                            Be warned: some vendors do not use filtered water in their concoctions, and it’s hard to tell when they do.  Fortunately, most juice blends don’t actually include water. You can ask the vendor for clarification on this matter.  Additionally, despite my dramatic warnings, a minor amount of tap water won’t do much damage to most people. Healthy adults will probably only feel slightly nauseous. Exercise caution with children, though.  Life is too short to not sample the delicious meats, juices, and desserts offered by Moroccan street vendors.  However, I fully understand that there is always a risk associated with consuming things that your body is not used to. And you can never be sure of the sanitary standards of restaurants, cafes, or food stalls.  This is why it is important to always carry medicine for any stomach issues that may arise. Although pharmacies are commonplace and tend to be well-stocked, you don’t want to take any chances or risk miscommunication.  It’s important to bring Imodium or Pepto-Bismol while traveling anywhere, so don’t forget to take these medicines with you to Morocco.  If you’re prone to experiencing stomach discomfort while traveling, invest in a bundle of dried figs. A kilo should cost you around 30 MAD, or $3. If you’re anything like me, this will be the best purchase of your trip.   Whenever you’re feeling blocked up, have a handful for a snack. You should feel relief in less than 20 minutes.   Unlike the US, most Moroccan cafes (and some restaurants) don’t require you to buy anything before using their restrooms. There are very few public bathrooms in most Moroccan cities, so don’t hesitate to go to a cafe and ask where the toilet is. The word “toilet” is easily recognizable, so there is no need to worry about not being understood.   That being said, some restrooms in cafes, restaurants, and train stations do not have toilet paper or hand soap. In some places, you may be obliged to pay a woman a dirham for a piece of toilet paper. To avoid any confusion or discomfort, you should always carry toilet paper and hand sanitizer with you.   Shopping in traditional Moroccan marketplaces, or souks can be both an exciting and intimidating experience.  Kindness in foreigners is sometimes mistaken for weakness. When shopping in Morocco, you need to forget your manners and sense of etiquette and learn to ignore or reject offers from salespeople.  Although many tourists have pleasant experiences, some have reported experiencing aggression from sellers in busy tourist areas, namely Marrakech. Shopkeepers may relentlessly pressure you to buy something from them. Men wielding hawks, snakes, and monkeys may thrust the animals in your face against your will. Even the ladies offering henna may grab you without your consent. In some big cities, people might give you unsolicited help with directions or forcefully carry your luggage and then demand a tip for their unwanted services. Female tourists may be asked out on dates by men in the street.   In each of these situations, it’s important to be firm and say no if you don’t want whatever is being offered to you, or simply ignore them. You will not hurt anyone’s feelings, I promise. They will move on quickly.  Morocco is a top tourist destination, and this industry is only further developing. With plenty of good reasons to visit and dozens of reputable travel agencies, Morocco will be the trip of a lifetime for families, friends, couples, and solo adventurists.

Rabat – The Moroccan government is increasing its scrutiny of individuals attempting to get passports with addresses near Ceuta, Moroccan police sources told the Spanish news outlet EFE on September 25.  Holders of passports with residences near the Spanish enclave  of Ceuta can traditionally enter Ceuta without a visa. This makes passports issued to Moroccans residing in the neighboring regions of Fnideq, Martil, Mdiq, and Tetouan valuable.  The possibility of visa-free entry, according to El Faro de Ceuta, backfired on the Moroccan government. The leniency of Spanish border police “caused many people from other Moroccan provinces to ‘unnaturally’ get passports issued in Tetouan.” The Moroccan police source told EFE that in order to “get registered in Tetouan or nearby regions, some rent small cheap places and register them as a place of residence.” Under the new heightened scrutiny, individuals who cannot prove six months of continuous residence in Tetouan or neighboring regions cannot register the area as their residence. Human ‘mules’ and trading activity in Ceuta Without specifying if the control measures were specifically related to smuggling, EFE’s police source explained that they are “a logical security measure” as the country “must know” where its citizens reside. One cause of the high demand for “northern” passports in recent years is the increasing interest in trading in Ceuta. The timing of the security measure raises again the issue of the human “mules” who have died in stampedes at Ceuta checkpoints. Every day, Moroccan women and men, in overwhelming numbers, cross the border into Ceuta to make a living from buying and selling contraband products.  In 2017, three stampedes occurred, killing four Moroccan women and injuring several others. In January 2018, two Moroccan women died and others were injured in similar stampedes. September 18 witnessed the tragic death of another “mule” woman. The woman was waiting on the Moroccan side of the Ceuta border to enter the city through the “Tarajal II” checkpoint.

Other partners of the event include local and international start-ups, artists, accelerator programs, and international banks.

Rabat – Moroccan flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) will add a flight connecting Sao Paulo to Casablanca, reported  Brazil-Arab News Agency (ANBA). RAM expects to launch the new flight in December or January. The new flight is the fourth flight from Sao Paulo to Morocco. Brazilians can also reach Morocco with two other flights from Rio de Janeiro. RAM’s new route will bring the total number of flights connecting Morocco to Brazil to six each week. The announcement comes as RAM is set to join the Oneworld airline alliance mid-2020. Along with other airlines, Royal Air Maroc participated at the Abav Expo for international tourism in Brazil on September  25-27. Cesar Alruiz, the sales manager for Royal Air Maroc, spoke with ANBA during Abav Expo about the oneworld agreement. “We have signed it, but now we must integrate the systems, the mileage, the data.… It takes time, but by June, everything will probably be connected,” he said. By joining the alliance, he added, RAM will add “connectivity to stopovers in Brazil and across Latin America.” The sales manager emphasized that the agreement will help the company grow “a lot.” “Clients will get the ease of checking in two 23-kg luggage items and carry one 10-kg handheld item, since the connection flight. For instance, it [sic] they depart from Porto Alegre (RS) to take the flight in Sao Paulo, the luggage will be included in the final, one-off ticket price. That will cut costs for passengers,” he said. ANBA said that the expo also featured other Moroccan tourism operations.

Rabat – A lawyer representing Dr. Mohamed Jamal Belkeziz, on trial for carrying out an illegal abortion on Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni, has presented evidence in support of her client’s claim that he did not perform the abortion. The lawyer, Myriam Moulay Rachid, presented the documents during the last hearing of the case on Monday, September 22, at the Court of First Instance in Rabat.  In her oral argument, the lawyer drew attention to the medical examination performed on Raissouni at Ibn Sina Hospital at the request of the judicial police. She claimed that at the time of examination, the blood test on Raissouni showed a level of 13,585.9 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU-mL) for the hormone Beta HCG.  The lawyer judged the HCG level as an “unavoidable proof that acquits all the alleged culprits of abortion in this case.” Moulay Rachid presented documents published from WHO which state that the HCG level should be between 30,000 and 160,000 mIU-mL during the 8th week of pregnancy. The prosecution claims Raissouni was 7 weeks pregnant when she underwent an abortion. According to the lawyer, the evidence is proof that “Raissouni was not pregnant when she visited the doctor, and therefore the latter did not perform the abortion.” Raissouni told police that she visited the doctor because she had “severe abdominal pain and bleeding that the doctor had to stop.” Moroccan public prosecutors charged Raissouni, her fiance, Belkeziz, and a medical team for being involved in an illegal abortion. After the arrest of the doctor, around 2,000 doctors signed a petition expressing solidarity with their colleague “who enjoys an honorable reputation, exemplary morality, and respects the code of ethics in the practice of his profession.”

Rabat – Manchester City’s striker Nabil Touaizi has chosen to play for the Moroccan national football team over Spain, the BBC reported on September 27.  The English news outlet said it “understands” that Touaizi has been included in the list of Moroccan football players who are set to play two friendly games, against Libya and Gabon, in October. The 18-year old football player had previously played for the Spanish Under-17 squad. Touaizi had the choice to represent Spain or Morocco. Both Touazi’s parents are from Morocco. Sports news outlet Goal reported that the new head coach of the Moroccan team, Vahid Halihodzic, and the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) have been in contact with the football player for months, trying to convince him to join the Atlas Lions. Both Goal and the BBC are expecting Touaizi to appear with the Atlas Lions in the Libya and Gabon friendlies, which are part of Morocco’s preparation for the 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers. Halilhodzic has not yet revealed the full list of the players he has selected for the two friendly games. Multiple Moroccan football players with dual nationalities have chosen to represent Morocco instead of playing with world football giants, including Moroccan-Dutch players Hakim Ziyech, Nordine Amrabat, Sofian Amrabat, and Oussama Idrissi. The choice of some Moroccan-Dutch football players annoyed several people in the Netherlands. Former international football player Ruud Gullit said that the Netherlands Football Association (KNVB) should reconsider its plans to invest in young Moroccan-Dutch football players. Dutch coach Ronald Koeman accused Moroccan-Dutch footballers—including Ziyech, Noussair Mazraoui, and Idrissi—of receiving bribes from Morocco.

Rabat – The African Development Bank (AfDB) has 35 projects in Morocco for a total investment of about $3 billion so far in 2019, making the country AfDB’s top recipient, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). AfDB’s funding in Morocco focused on the sectors of energy (31.5%), transportation (19.8%), water and sanitation (15.5%), and multi-sectoral and social development operations (12.7%). Some investment (11.2%) also went to the private sector and to agriculture (9.4%), according to the latest synthetic review of the bank’s results, unveiled Thursday, September 26, in Rabat. On a scale of 1 to 4, the performance of the bank’s portfolio in Morocco is “very satisfactory,” progressing from 2.6 in 2009 to 3.7 in 2018. The score improved because there are no high-risk projects, said Rudolphe Petras, senior results specialist at AfDB, who presented the review. The amount of annually approved funding increased from €607 million in 2009 to €733 million in 2018, Petras added. The official highlighted the progress Morocco made from 2009 to 2018 and the bank’s contribution to that progress. Petras stressed that 16 million people got better access to transportation infrastructure, and the loans connected 6.9 million people to the electrical grid for the first time. He added that about 8.5 million people, including 4.5 million women, got access to better health services. And 3.5 million people, over half of them are women, benefited from improved access to drinking water and sanitation. The review underlined Morocco’s significant progress in the areas of governance, business climate, and gender equality. It also approved of Morocco’s leading Africa in renewable energy and the fight against climate change. The AfDB has a mission of improving lives by fighting poverty and investing in socio-economic projects. The bank has been present in Morocco since 1970. The first projects it financed were to develop potable water and sanitation in 1978. Between 1978 and 2017, the AfDB approved 160 operations for a total of $10 billion, according to AfDB.

Rabat – Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita has reiterated Morocco’s solidarity with Saudi Arabia after Yemeni Houthis attacked two Saudi oil facilities on September 14. In an interview published on September 26 in Sky News Arabia, Bourita said that the security and stability of Saudi Arabia is an integral part of Morocco’s own security and stability. The minister blamed Iran for the attack, emphasizing that Tehran “unfortunately has not ceased hostilities in the region.” He said that the international community’s past strategy for dealing with Iran made it feel that “it can continue such acts and that regional leadership means attacks and hostilities against the countries of the region.” Subsequently, the foreign minister called for the world to adopt a more effective approach to handle Iranian threats in the region. “The international community must be more effective because it is not an issue between Saudi Arabia and Iran but a threat to regional security that undermines international stability,” he said. Bourita also spoke about Iranian interference in the domestic affairs of several Arab and African countries. Morocco severed diplomatic ties with Iran in May 2018 over allegations of such interference. On May 1 last year, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it would cut all diplomatic ties with Iran, saying Tehran supported the Polisario Front. The ministry accused Iran of training and arming the Polisario Front through its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. Bourita has said in several interviews that Morocco has evidence proving Polisario-Hezbollah collusion. In his interview with Sky News Arabia, Bourita called on the international community to standardize its actions and discourse on hostile moves from Tehran. He also emphasized the need for “collective” action to resolve the crisis, including the issue of the nuclear agreement. Bourita’s statement on the attacks echoed a message from King Mohammed VI’s latest message to Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month, the King condemned the Houthi drone attacks ina letter to King Salman of Saudi Arabia. In his letter, the monarch said that the attacks undermine the security and stability of the world. “I assure you of the absolute solidarity of the kingdom of Morocco with Saudi Arabia and its unwavering support against any threat that undermines the country’s security and territorial integrity,” the King said.

Rabat – Ceuta-based airline company Helity Copter, which provides regularly scheduled helicopter services, has announced it is launching a new line between Algeciras, a port city in the south of Spain on the Bay of Gibraltar, and Tangier. The company already operates lines between Ceuta and Algeciras, as well as between Malaga and Melilla. Border police have already installed booths at the Andalusian heliport so all the relevant immigration and customs checks can be made before each flight, but no exact date has been set for the flights to commence, reports local Spanish outlet Algeciras Minuto. The flight between the Moroccan and Spanish cities will only take 10 minutes, the outlet reported. Currently, the most common route between the two cities is via ferry, which takes approximately 1.5 hours.

Rabat – The Saudi Ministry of Tourism has announced that women tourists no longer need to follow a dress code while visiting Saudi Arabia. Traditionally, Saudi and foreign women must wear a long black robe, known as an abaya, when they go out in public. Saudi Minister of Tourism Ahmed al-Khateeb told Reuters that women tourists will not be obliged to stick to abayas. The announcement comes as the country is also starting a new visa program to attract foreign companies to invest in the tourism sector. Al Jazeera said that Saudi Arabia’s goal is to increase tourism earnings to 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. The visa programs, Al Jazeera added, stipulate that tourists can get visas for a fee of $80 (MAD 800) “with no restriction for unaccompanied women as in the past.” “Access to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina is restricted,” according to Al Jazeera. The tourism chief will provide more details on which countries can get the visas later on Friday, but he emphasized that Saudi Arabia is targeting Japan, Europe, the US, and China. Under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia has enacted several reforms. The reforms encouraged some Saudi women to defy the dress code. Earlier this month, Saudi Mashael Al Jaoud made news headlines for posing in an orange top and white with high heels, without covering up with an abaya. Al Jaoud was not the only Saudi woman to defy the dress code, as other women launched a campaign to encourage others to go out wearing “Western clothes.” Manahel Al Otaibi, a Saudi activist, said in an online post recently that she has been living in Riyadh for four months without wearing an abaya. The crown prince had previously hinted about a change in the dress code from during an interview broadcast in March 2018 by CBS TV. Mohammed bin Salman had said hinted his country might relax the dress code for women. However, he said, “The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of Sharia [Islamic law]: that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men.”

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has suspended the goalkeeper of the Atlas Lions and Wydad Casablanca, Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti, from playing with the national team for three months. The suspension comes after Tagnaouti faked an injury to avoid playing as a substitute for the national domestic team. Morocco’s Atlas Lions have both an international and domestic team. Houcine Ammouta, the Moroccan domestic team’s coach, had summoned the 23-year-old goalkeeper  to be part of the squad facing Algeria on September 21 in a qualifier game for the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN). On the day of the game, Ammouta picked Anas Zniti, Raja Casablanca’s goalkeeper, in the starting eleven. Unsatisfied with the coach’s decision, Tagnaouti faked an injury to avoid sitting on the bench during the game. Ammouta, displeased with the goalkeeper’s behavior, filed a detailed report to FRMF’s president, Fouzi Lekjaa. After a board meeting Thursday, September 26, FRMF decided to suspend Tagnaouti from playing with the Moroccan national team in any event for three months. The federation also condemned his lack of professionalism and discipline. The goalkeeper can still play for his club, Wydad Casablanca, during the suspension period. Tagnaouti was one of three goalkeepers summoned in August 2019 to play for the Atlas Lions by coach Vahid Halilhodzic. During his suspension, Tagnaouti will miss two of the Atlas Lions’ upcoming friendly games, against Gabon and Libya, on October 11 and 15, respectively. He will also miss the final game of CHAN eliminations against Algeria, on October 18. Finally, the player will miss the first two games of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) qualifiers, against Mauritania and Burundi, in November. This is not the first time that problems arise within the Moroccan squads. In June 2019, the striker Abderrazak Hamdallah walked out of Morocco’s 2019 CAN training camp. FRMF stated that he left because of an injury, but Hamdallah denied this statement, sharing a video of himself working out on his social media accounts. Several sport outlets suggested that Hamdallah left due to problems with other players on the squad. The player, however, did not publicly say why he quit the training camp.

Rabat – Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has introduced support units for women and girls who are victims of gender-based violence. The units, which will be within DGSN administrations, seek to provide psychological support and guidance for the victims of violence. DGSN announced the measure on Thursday, September 26, at the Royal Police Institute in Kenitra, a city north of Rabat. The Moroccan security body emphasized that the measure is part of the implementation of Law 103-13 against gender discrimination. The initiative, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), seeks to “leverage the success of the reception units created in 2007 at the level of judicial police services to receive women victims of violence.” DGSN introduced its new support units during a Canadian-sponsored “study day” on the intersectoral coordination of care for women and victims of violence. “The study was marked by the presentation on the new provisions of law 103-13 as well as on the setting up of cells for the support of women and girls victims of violence,” MAP reported. Morocco enacted Law 103-13 in September 2018 to criminalize sexual harassment, assault in public spaces, and cybercrime. Feminists and activists have long argued that the law contains loopholes. The US State Department’s annual report on Morocco’s Human Rights Practices for 2018, published in March, said that the law does not “specifically define domestic violence against women and minors, but the general prohibitions of the criminal code address such violence.” With increasing reports of rape and violent incidents against women, the Moroccan government has urged women to come forward and report such crimes. In July, the Moroccan minister for family, solidarity, equality, and social development, Bassima Hakkawi, unveiled a government-sponsored study that found 93.4% of sexual violence victims have not reported their plight to authorities. The data for the study came from January to March of 2019. As many as 54.4% of women had experienced gendered violence at the time of the survey. The survey stipulated that women aged 25-29 are more often the subjects of violence. The same survey showed that 12.4% of Moroccan women faced sexual assaults in public spaces in the past twelve months.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has sent a message of condolence to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, following the death of Jacques Chirac. In the message, the sovereign “salutes the memory of a great statesman who devoted his life to politics with determination.” King Mohammed VI said that the passing of President Chirac affects not only France, “which he served with fervor, but also the whole international community which saw in him a man of dialogue and conviction, deeply attached to the respect of international law and justice in the world.” “The Kingdom of Morocco will cherish the memory of a great friend who actively contributed to the strengthening of the relations of friendship between our two countries by establishing an exceptional partnership. This unique partnership is the reference of our cooperation,” the monarch said. Mohammed VI presented to President Macron and all of France’s people, his most saddened condolences and the expression of his sincere compassion, on behalf of himself and the people of Morocco. The former French president died today, September 26 at the age of 86.

Morocco in the World Championships In the previous World Championships, London 2017, Morocco won only one silver medal. The last gold medal that the Moroccan national team obtained in this competition dates back to 2005 in Helsinki, when Jaouad Gharib won the marathon. The most impressive performance from the Moroccan national athletics team was in the 1999 World Championships, in Sevilla. Morocco ranked fifth on the medal table, with two gold medals, two silver and one bronze. Hicham El Guerrouj and Salah Hissou won the gold for Morocco in the 1500m and 5000m competitions respectively. Major investments with no results Since FRMA’s Abdeslam Ahizoune became president in 2006, a number of projects were launched and significant money sums were invested in the sport. FRMA focused on improving infrastructures and sport facilities all around the country. Since 2009, FRMA has built 21 athletics tracks according to international standards, with a budget of MAD 283 million. The federation also allocated MAD 157 million to build five regional athletics centers, and MAD 122 million to build Mohammed VI Athletics Academy, in Ifrane. The federation’s budget also financed other smaller facilities, such as health centers. The aim of the construction projects was to allow Moroccan youth to practice athletics and discover hidden talents in different regions of the country. The investments, however, did not lead to any remarkable results for Moroccan athletes in international competitions. Doping scandals The lack of remarkable results from Moroccan athletes was coupled with doping scandals over the years. In 2012, four Moroccan athletes were eliminated from participating in the Olympic games in London having failed doping tests. IAAF also banned several athletes from its competitions. Amine Laalou, a middle-distance runner, was banned twice, in 2012 for two years, and in 2016 for eight years. Halima Hachlaf, who is participating in this year’s World Championship, was banned for four years in 2014, and Mariem Salsouli was also banned for eight years in 2015. Both athletes are middle-distance runners. In 2016, the IAAF decided to put Morocco on its “anti-doping watchlist,” in response to the recurring incidents. Morocco was removed from the list a year later, after FRMA put in place a program of regular doping tests for athletes, both on the regional and national level. In-fighting in the FRMA In July 2019, Hicham El Guerrouj, a former Olympic and world champion, filed an objection against Abdeslam Ahizoune’s candidacy for the FRMA’s presidency. El Guerrouj, who was running for the same position, based his objection on the fact that Ahizoune is applying for a third mandate. El Guerrouj said that this is against the association’s regulations. “There are violations of laws, Ahizoune is not respecting the law in a country ruled by a King who respects the law. In all of his speeches, King Mohammed VI urges [all institutions] to respect the law,” El Guerrouj told Moroccan media. El Guerrouj was also a huge critic of Ahizoune’s policies at the head of the FRMA. “We need to intervene fast to put Moroccan athletics back on the right track. If we continue with the same pattern, we will keep going backwards and we will waste everything Morocco has gained in different domains.” However, in a statement to the press, one of the most decorated Moroccan athletes, Said Aouita, blamed the poor performance of Moroccan athletes in international competitions on coaches and managers. “The problem that Moroccan athletics suffer from is not administrative, we have the best athletics federation in the world, it is purely technical.” The Federation, Aouita said,” provides the necessary infrastructure for the development of athletes, but there is some technical staff that doesn’t want to cooperate with the administration.” The contradicting statements from the two Moroccan legends reflect the internal conflicts within the administration of the FRMA. These conflicts could also be a factor in Morocco’s failure to achieve competitive results in the international athletics scene. Since the inauguration of IAAF World Athletics Championship, in 1983, Morocco has won 29 medals, including 10 gold, 12 silver, and seven bronze. Only three medals were obtained in the competition since 2006: two silver and one bronze.

Rabat – The Polisario Front has expressed frustration after Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani’s speech at the general debate of the 74th Session of the General Assembly on September 24. The president addressed a number of regional issues but did not make mention of the Western Sahara conflict. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara reported on September 25 that the Mauritanian president had “ignored”  the Western Sahara conflict. The Mauritanian president spoke about conflicts around the Middle East and North Africa, including the Palestinian cause,  and conflicts in Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. The president also paid tribute to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his efforts to ensure peace and security in the region. Strategies to fight the impacts of climate change took center stage in the president’s discourse. El Ghazouani also showcased Mauritania’s country’s approach to ensuring better education access, gender equality, and healthcare in his country. After speaking about his country’s efforts to ensure basic rights for the population and for refugees from Mali, the President reiterated his country’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause. “We would like to reiterate our tireless commitment to the rights of Palestinian people their rights for dignity and sovereignty in the context of an independent viable state with east  Jerusalem as its capital,” he said. He also denounced Israel’s violations against Palestine. After Palestine, the President expressed support for international efforts towards peace in Libya and to ensure territorial integrity. El Ghazouani then moved to reiterate his country’s position on the Syrian conflict, emphasizing the need for a political solution to end the conflict. The president concluded his speech to the UN General Assembly by expressing the need to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen. He condemned the terrorist attacks against Saudi Arabia as it undermines the security of the kingdom. Political poker The Western Sahara conflict was conspicuous only by its absence from the Mauritanian president’s speech. Futuro Sahara reported that, despite its proximity to Mauritania, the president, cynically, made no reference to Western Sahara and that this choice was politically motivated.   Futuro Sahara added that the Western Sahara conflict remains a “card” for presidential candidates in Spain and Mauritania, referring to the recent document published by Sanchez’s political party. The Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) published a document on September 3, to express support for the extension of the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, MINURSO. The document shows that PSOE wants the MINURSO to monitor human rights in Western Sahara. Sanchez is now looking for support to form a coalition government. According to Futuro Sahara, his party is showing support for PODEMOS, a Spanish pro-Polisario party by supporting the separatists’ claims over independence for Western Sahara. “Sahrawi people’s case, thus, remains an election ‘card’ used by Mauritanian and Spanish political parties during their campaigns.” The news outlet also accused the Mauritanian government of having a “ hypocritical” approach to dealing with the Western Sahara conflict. Futuro Sahara also said that Spanish and Mauritanian political parties ignored the Western Sahara conflict at critical points to avoid invoking “Morocco’s anger.”

Rabat – Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, known as MBS, has claimed responsibility for the killing of prominent journalist and Washington Post contributor, Jamal Khashoggi. MBS admitted that the execution operation ‘happened under his watch.’ “It happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility because it happened under my watch,” MBS told PBS’ Martin Smith, according to a preview of the documentary, entitled The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, which will be broadcasted on October 1.

The killing, which happened on October 2, 2018, sparked a global uproar, with the Saudi crown prince viewed as the main culprit in the killing. In a report conducted by UN extrajudicial executions investigator, Agnes Callamard, it has been found that Khashoggi’s death “constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the State of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible”. Released on June 19, the report provided a minute-by-minute account of the journalist’s execution and dismemberment. Hours after the report’s release, Saudi Arabia denounced the report with its Minister for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir saying in a Tweet that the report contains “clear contradictions and baseless allegations, which challenges its credibility.” Turkish investigators have not found the remains of Khashoggi’s body.

Rabat – A study carried out by the Moroccan General Delegation of the Penitentiaries and Reinsertion Administration (DGAPR) shows that 42% of Moroccan prisoners have committed the same crime twice. The study focuses on inmates’ tendency to repeat the same crime. The report reveals that cases, where inmates have reoffended, are the highest among people aged between 25-29, reaching 88% for male convicts. Mohamed Bouzlafa, dean of the Faculty of Judicial, Economical, and Social sciences of Fez supervised the study which involved a sample of 1,600 inmates. The study shows that reoffending is more common with unmarried inmates at 58%, while only 21% of married inmates reoffended. The DGAPR study underlined the correlation between education and reoffending. Only 2% of inmates with university-level qualifications reoffended, while 40% of inmates with only primary school education reoffended. The study also shows that inmates from semi-urban areas are more likely to re-offend. The DGAPR attributes this to “poverty and fragility” in those areas. DAPGR reports that 31% of repeated crimes are linked to theft, 23% to drugs, and 19% to violent crime. About 39% of inmates in the study said they reoffended due to family problems. The study also asked inmates why they committed crimes. Of the 1,600 inmates,  42%said financial problems led them to crime. A further 30% said drug addiction pushed them into crime, and 22% attributed their behavior to alcoholism.  Despite the high number of reoffending inmates, the study shows that only 6% of inmates received government assistance for reintegration. Around 94% of inmates said that they did not benefit from any government assistance before release. For Bouzlafa, the need to review the penal and criminal policy to reduce the phenomenon is a priority. He points out that this field study on cases of reoffending in prisons confirms that there are gaps in the criminal policy.  The Dean stresses that governance bodies, civil society institutions, and economic institutions are required to play a greater role in order to give decent living opportunities to prisoners post-release.

Rabat – In a meeting held in Rabat, the Interior Ministry launched a pilot project to set up an integrated system to assist with flood risk management on Tuesday, September 24.  The Minister Delegate to the Minister of Interior, Noureddine Boutayeb, introduced the Flood Risk Management Center.  The ministry plans to set up the operational center as part of a pilot project for monitoring, warning, and assistance to flood risk management. The center aims to anticipate and alert the at-risk population of flooding. The pilot project, financed by the Solidarity Fund against Disastrous Events, will initially be deployed in four areas suffering from flooding.  According to a statement from the Interior Ministry, the target areas include Mohammedia, Ourika valley (Marrakech), the Gharb plain (Kenitra), and a Saharan zone (Guelmim). The ministry added that each selected area will have a Provincial Coordination Center, located respectively at the Prefecture of Mohammedia and the Provinces of Al Haouz, Kenitra, and Gulemim. The Integrated Flood Risk Management System is a partnership approach between the various actors involved in flood risk management. The Interior Ministry, the Water Department of the Ministry of Equipment, and the Directorate of National Meteorology (DMN) are all involved in the project. “This pilot project would help, in the near future, to broaden the said system to all priority vulnerable zones in the national territory,” the ministry’s statement concluded. Widespread Flooding leads to loss of life The ministry’s decision to launch flood risk management centers comes in light of the recent devastating floods that have hit several regions across Morocco in recent weeks. The floods and heavy rains damaged numerous cities and caused significant casualties. Floods hit the province of Taroudant on August 28. Eight people died in Tizert village when the river overflowed onto the pitch during a football match. In the city of Tata (180 km southeast of Taroudant), heavy rains flooded and destroyed the homes of 200 locals. On September 8, similar floods caused a bus connecting Casablanca and Rissani, a town in Errachidia Province, to fall off the Oued Damchan bridge. The accident led to the death of 24 people.

Rabat – The Middle-East &amp; North Africa Business Aviation Association (MEBAA) Show Morocco kicked off yesterday, September 25, at Menara Airport in Marrakech. The two-day event provides a platform for business aviation suppliers and buyers to network and establish new relationships in North Africa, through exhibitions and conferences. More than 2,000 attendees and 70 exhibitors are taking part this year. The Moroccan Minister of Tourism, Air Transport, Crafts, and Social Economy, Mohammed Sajid, inaugurated the event, in the presence of officials and business aviation professionals from all over the world. The business aviation sector has seen “a clear evolution in the world in general and in the Kingdom [of Morocco] in particular,” said the minister. The aviation sector in Morocco has developed significantly since the signing of the “Open Sky” agreements between the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), allowing airlines from the EU and the US to fly freely between the two continents. The “Open Sky” agreement encouraged many major aviation companies “to operate in Morocco and serve our main tourist destinations,” added Sajid. Since the agreement signing in 2007, Moroccan airports saw an increase in traffic that keeps growing every year. According to the National Office of Airports (ONDA), Moroccan airports received more than 22,5 million passengers in 2018. The number increased by 10,43% compared to 2017. MEBAA is a non-profit association. It was established in 2006 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The organization aims to provide a platform for members of the business aviation industry in the MENA region to gather, understand, and communicate the needs and benefits of the industry.  Morocco is the only country to host a MEBAA show other than the UAE. Around 68 companies and organizations participated as exhibitors at the 2017 show. In addition to the MEBAA show, Morocco also hosts the biennial Marrakech Air Show. Since its inception in 2008, the International Marrakech Air Show has convened leading firms in the aerospace industry. The 2018 Marrakech Air Show took place between September 24 and 27, at the Royal Moroccan Air Force military base in Marrakech. The upcoming show will take place in 2020.

Rabat – Segula Technologies, a world-renowned group in the automotive engineering sector, has announced the opening of its automotive sector-dedicated “Center of Excellence” in Morocco. The center, which will be based in Agadir, one of the hubs of Morocco’s growing automotive industry, will be “entirely dedicated” to technological innovation and high quality research in mechanical engineering, the company said in a press release. It added that the center is expected to help sustain Morocco’s growing automotive sector by providing a pool of highly trained engineers equipped to predict market trends in the technology and automotive sectors and create products adapted to market demands. “This new center aims to respond to the growing needs of the local automotive industry,” the statement reads. The center seeks to “accompany” the efforts of investors in the Moroccan automobile industry by training a significant pool of local experts poised to fill vacancies requiring a highly qualified training in various automobile sector-related fields. Segula Technologies says the new center will be in tune with the state-of-the art developments in the technology and engineering sectors. This will include research and training in “artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing,” two of the French engineering company’s most acknowledged competencies. In terms of employment, the center also aims to become a leading employment destination for future Moroccan automobile engineers and technology researchers. While the current goal is to employ 300 full-time engineers and researchers by 2020, the long-term plans are far more ambitious. The group envisions reaching 2000 employees by 2025 and projects to establish itself as the region’s go-to center both research and training in a wide range of engineering fields. “The launching of this center testifies to Segula’s commitment to advancing Morocco’s automotive sector. Thanks to its world-renowned skills in the entire automotive channel, its innovation capacity and commitment to developing local capacity, the group  has all the potential to be a strategic partner” for Morocco, said Mikael Busbib, director of Segula Technologies’ Morocco branch. The news comes as Morocco seeks to consolidate its regional leadership position both an investment and innovation hub. The North African has largely reformed its investment policies in the past years to attract world-renowned investors. In June, world-renowned PSA Group opened in Kenitra, an hour drive from Rabat, its first PSA Peugeot African industrial complex. During the opening, both PSA leadership and the Moroccan government reiterated the notion that the launching of PSA’s Kenitra plants was part of a larger scheme to make Morocco Africa’s go-to destination for investment and innovation.

Rabat – Moroccan rapper French Montana has become the first ambassador for the “I stand with Immigrants” campaign. The campaign seeks to encourage US citizens to “celebrate the monumental contributions that immigrants have made and continue to make every day.” French Montana, whose real name is Karim Kharbouch, emigrated with his family to the US at the age of 13. Khabrouch has since become one of the biggest names in hip-hop music. In a new video, the rapper explained the struggle migrants can face in a foreign country. “It was more of a culture shock for me. Because you know, coming from Morocco, you know you’re not speaking English,” he said. “You’re trying to fit into this world that you knew nothing about Your parents don’t speak English. Your little brothers don’t speak English. You have nobody translate nothing for you.”  The rapper emphasized that immigrants in the music industry  “play a big part because like I said we all come from different cultures and we all bring different sounds to the entertainment business.” In August, French Montana announced that he wants to be the “voice of migrants.”  At the Video Music Awards (VMA) in New York, he said that he was “proud” to give an award “because as an immigrant, I feel like we are the people that make this country, and I feel like I want to be the voice.” “These nominees — and most of them are immigrants, too — are on top of the biggest movement in music,” he added.

Rabat – Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Stef Blok emphasized the importance of Morocco’s “excellent” approach in countering terrorism and extremism in the region. Blok spoke about the scourge of terrorism at the opening of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) on Wednesday, September 25 in New York. The Dutch official thanked Morocco for co-chairing the forum with the Netherlands over the past four years.

The forum convenes experts and practitioners from countries across the world to share experiences and expertise. In July,  Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ)  Abdelhak Khiame said that Morocco has been sharing its counterterrorism expertise with its European allies. Khiame also called for shared responsibility and joint efforts to fight terrorism in the region. “The fight against terrorism will take a long time, but if we work together with serenity and responsibility we can overcome the scourge,” Khiame told Italian news agency LaPressa. He recalled that Morocco is currently co-chairing the World Forum against terrorism with the Netherlands. Morocco’s counterterrorism approach receives support from world powers.

Rabat – Former French president Jacques Chirac died this morning, September 26, at his home surrounded by his family at the age of 86. “President Jacques Chirac died this morning surrounded by his family, peacefully,” his son-in-law told AFP. Chirac served two terms as president of the Republic of France from 1995 to 2007. His tenure as president was the 2nd longest after his predecessor Francois Mitterand’s 14 years of rule.  Under his term, Chirac launched several political reforms, including reducing the presidential term from 7 to 5 years through a referendum in 2000. The French National Assembly has held a minute of silence in homage to Chirac. Chirac was previously the Prime Minister of France from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988. He served as the Mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995. Chirac also occupied various ministerial posts including Minister of Agriculture and Minister of the Interior. The late former president was known for standing against the American-led assault on Iraq and recognizing the French government’s role in deporting Jews during World War II. In December 2011, the Paris court found Chirac guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence. He was convicted of a two-year-term suspended prison sentence. In 2005, he suffered from a stroke. The debilitating stroke affected the former president’s memory.  Born on November 29, 1932, Chirac pursued an educational career in political studies, graduating from the Paris Institute of Political Studies in 1953. After his graduation, he joined Harvard university’s summer school as an auditor. In 1957, he entered the Ecole Nationale D’administration (ENA) where he trained as a reserve military officer. After graduating from the ENA in 1959, he became a civil servant in the Court of Auditors. Chirac was known for his friendly relationship with Morocco. The former president’s first foreign trip was to Morocco when he was newly elected as the new President of France in May 1995.  After winning his second presidential race in 2002, Chirac’s first foreign trip was to Morocco again, fostering diplomatic relations between the two countries. Chirac’s relationship with Morocco was special, especially with late Moroccan King Hassan II. The former president used to visit the country every year accompanied by his wife Bernadette. During his travels to Morocco, Chirac frequently visited the southern provinces of Morocco, especially Taroudant and Agadir. He used to sit with the locals to learn about regional and local cultures and ways of life. When late King Hassan II passed away in July 1999, Chirac traveled to Morocco to personally present his condolences to the Royal family.

Rabat – The Moroccan Directorate of Medicines and Pharmacy of the Ministry of Health ordered on Wednesday, September 25, the withdrawal of ‘Ranitidine‘ medicines after tests showed that they contained the substance N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The directorate acted based on reports from foreign pharmaceutical agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said the Health Ministry in a statement on Wednesday. The reports indicated that the substance has carcinogenic effects. Ranitidine is often used in H2 blockers to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach of patients with conditions such as heartburn and stomach ulcers. The department added that it is conducting the necessary investigations into Ranitidine-containing medicines. The ministry aims to ensure compliance with international standards set by the National Medicines Control Laboratory, accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Health Care (EDQM). “NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) on the basis of animal studies,” said EMA in a statement.  “It is present in some foods and in water supplies but is not expected to cause harm when ingested in very low levels,” explained the statement. In the US, 14 batches have already been withdrawn, following a press release by Sandoz Inc, on September 23, indicating the presence of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in certain gastric drugs. In Morocco, Ranitidine is sold under the trade names ACIDAC, PEP-RANI-AZANTAC-RANIMAT, EFITAC- RANITIL-ZANTAC, NORMACIDE. It is commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. There is also tentative evidence of benefits for people suffering from hives. In the past few years, the cancer mortality rate has increased in Morocco, especially in cases of cervical cancer. In 2018, a total of 2,465 women died of cervical cancer, out of the 13.2 million women in Morocco.  The number of deaths from cervical cancer per year nearly doubled in the country between 2012 and 2018, increasing from 1,076 to 2,465, according to the MENA coalition for HPV Elimination and the Tunisian Center for Public Health.

Rabat – Rabat Court of Appeal in Sale decided on Wednesday, September 25, postponed the trial of the 24 suspects involved in the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists in Imlil (El Haouz province). The defendants will appear in court again on October 9. The Court decided to postpone the trial due to the lack of an interpreter. The court emphasized the necessity of ensuring the conditions of a fair trial and allowing each of the accused the right to a fair defense. Last July, the court handed sentences ranging from five years to the death penalty. The three main suspects received the death sentence, while the fourth defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. The defendants are accused of “forming a gang to commit terror crimes and intentionally assaulting the life of persons premeditatedly.”  They are also accused of possession of weapons, and “attempt to manufacture explosives with the intention to cause serious public harm, terrorism, and violence.” The mastermind behind the Imlil murder case, Abdessamad El Joud, admitted on September 19 that the cell plotted the murder of the two Scandinavian victims.  Moroccan police found the bodies of  Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland near Mount Toubkal in December 2018. Both victims were beheaded, authorities confirmed. During the last appeal court session on September 19, El Joud expressed regret but refused to apologize to the victims’ families, the defendants’ lawyer, Hafida Maksaoui told Morocco World News. “They [the victims] are only two, we are millions,” said the defendant, referring to Muslims worldwide who he sees as persecuted. The defendant’s defense team is calling on the court to give lighter sentences, while the victims of the families are determined that the accused should receive the death penalty. The victims’ families received sympathy from Moroccan citizens, who protested the murder in front of Norwegian and Danish embassies last year to show solidarity.

Rabat – A promotional banner for Rabat’s Art Biennial, an international art exhibition that will take place once every two years starting this year, has drawn attention for the wrong reasons. The banner is displayed on the facade of Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art and is written in Arabic.  It is the literal translation of another banner in English saying “As long as following our rules is more important than following our hearts, I will be a feminist.” Unfortunately, that’s not what the corresponding banner says in Arabic. The mishap has not gone unnoticed by the Moroccan public. The linguistic error was the result of a literal translation from English to Arabic. Museum director Abdelaziz Idrissi told Morocco World the “banner” displayed at the facade of the museum is an artwork by  Katharina Cibulka from Austria. “We cannot interfere in the artist’s work, that is why it was displayed as such,” he said. For the museum director,  there has been no serious linguistic problems. “It could be better if the word feminist was translated differently in the Arabic version.” A communication official at Morocco’s National Museum Foundation (FNM) told MWN that organizers are well aware of the mistakes contained in the banner, and that they are working on fixing it.  The official could not comment on the reasons why the banner was publicly displayed before the corrections. FNM is the organization responsible for managing the majority of Moroccan museums. They are also the organizers of Rabat’s Biennial , taking place from September 24 to December 18, 2019. Rabat’s Biennial  is an international exhibition dedicated entirely to female artists. It is set in different cultural sites across Rabat. This year, 63 artists from 27 countries and different disciplines are exhibiting their works at the event. The theme of this first edition of the biennale is “An Instant before the World.” The public display of linguistic mistakes comes only one week after a nameplate at Casablanca airport caused controversy.  The nameplate was riddled with grammatical and lexical mistakes and it sparked a public uproar, with critics asking how the airport personnel missed such a blunder. The nameplate, which appears to be advertising the newly announced initiative to ease traffic at the Casablanca-based airport, read: “Exit Moroccan passports stamped.” The writing came alongside its Arabic version.

Rabat –  Moroccan comedian Gad Elmalah has again responded to the plagiarism accusations that have been plaguing him recently. In an interview with daily French newspaper Le Parisien, Elmaleh said that the accusations are partly true, but have been blown out of proportion. “Oh, I was inspired by other guys, yes, I admit that. That’s when the stand-up came, with my generation, we were inspired by the Americans, … ” he said. “Perhaps I have been at ease, taking inspiration from the techniques and punchlines of Americans,” he admitted. “I took inspiration from them. OK, alright. What do I have to do? Is there a confessional for comedians?” “1 minute and 30 seconds of my show of the 20 or 30 hours of shows that I have done in my life does not summarize my career,” he insisted. He went on to say that the accusations that have been lobbied against him are “very aggressive, excessive and out of proportion to what is true. There was a base of aggressiveness, a desire to harm.” “Nobody wants to be displayed in the press as someone who has stolen,” he said. The accusations were first thrown at Elmaleh by YouTube channel CopyComic, which exposes plagiarism. The channel targeted Elmaleh multiple times this year, and on July 9, the comedian also took to the media to defend himself. Speaking to TV channel Europe 1, the comedian said: “I started my career in 1995 with a sketch called ”Monsieur Seguin’s Goat,” it was a ​​parody. I do not know who wrote it (laughs) but it was my vision,” the comedian said, yet again partially admitting “inspiration” was taken but stipulating that he added his own twist. Just two days after Elmaleh’s TV appearance to defend himself, on Thursday, July 11, French paper “Society” published a possibly damning article revealing the full extent of his supposed plagiarism. Society sought the testimonies of other comedians whose work Elmaleh may have pilfered. One of these comedians, who chose to remain anonymous and is described by Society as a “renowned humorist,” said that he already had seen two of his sketches stolen by Elmaleh, before a third was revealed by CopyComic. Marseille-based comedian Kamel Bennafla also came forward to claim that one of Elmaleh’s most famous skit characters, “The Blonde,” a goody-two-shoes who does everything right, was actually his idea. Bennafla alleges that two met at the Festival d’Avignon in the late 1990s when he was “already a star” and Elmaleh “was still a young comedian.” The two then appeared together on the radio show Europe 2 Avignon, where Bennafla told the story of “a nice blond kid, who does everything well and ridicules others” as part of a skit. Bennafla alleges that after the show, Elmaleh asked him for the tape so he could use it “to practice his budding comedy skills.” “Now, when I perform the sketch I thought of a decade ago, people tell me Elmaleh invented it first. I immediately understood how this happened,” said Bennafla. Elmaleh was born in Casablanca to a Jewish family and attended high school in Quebec. At the age of 21, Elmaleh moved to Paris to pursue his dream of acting. The 47-year-old comedian performed comedy in France for over 23 years and gained wide fame there. The stand-up comedian and actor has starred in several feature films, including “Coco” (2008), “Priceless” (2006), and “La Doublure” (2005). He was voted the “funniest person” in France, and France’s Minister of Culture named him Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. Elmaleh also became a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. The French-Moroccan’s career skyrocketed even further in recent years, with his own Netflix original show, “Huge in France,” having premiered in April. It remains to be seen whether the allegations will have a longstanding effect on his career.

Rabat – Egyptian authorities have arrested more than 1,000 people, on Wednesday, September 25, amid protests calling for an end to Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s presidency. The Egyptian Centre for Freedoms and Rights said that authorities have arrested 1,003 protesters, while the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights reported the arrest of 1,298 protesters. On Tuesday, September 24, authorities arrested two prominent academics, Hazem Hosny and Hassan Nafaa. Police arrested Hosny, a political science professor at Cairo University, in front of his home. The arrest was reported by his lawyer Tarek al-Awadi on Facebook. In recent days, the professor has been critical to Sissi on social media. The professor was a spokesman for former Egyptian military chief of staff Sami Anan, who was arrested after attempting to run against Sisi in last year’s presidential elections. Hassan Nafaa, another professor of political science at the same university, was detained at his home late on Tuesday, family sources told AFP. In a statement to AFP earlier this week, Nafaa said that “Sisi’s desired image as “Egypt’s saviour from Muslim Brotherhood rule… has been completely dismantled.” Protests broke out after Mohamed Aly, an exiled Egyptian businessman living in Spain, posted videos accusing Sissi of corruption and the military of wasting public money on building luxurious properties. Sissi has dismissed the allegations as “lies and slander.” Just last week, authorities arrested more than 600 Egyptian protesters.

Rabat – “Is Climate Change the New Economic Warfare?” posed the question used to convey the theme of a recent panel on current ecological disasters. The question posed the terms of the debate in the self-important kind of verbal acuity commonplace in intellectual circles. Its dramatic rhetoric and serious connotations  seemed enough to predict what the ensuing discussions would be like. The question also implied the type of panel that could best tackle it. There was apprehension in the air when, as visibly excited participants began filling the airy conference room at the irrepressibly elegant View Hotel in upstate Rabat, the moderator, Moroccan journalist Rachid Hallaouy, said, “I’m sure tonight’s panel will be enlightening, informative. But I mostly hope it’ll be entertaining, fun for you guys who have made it.” Enlightening is what a conference of this kind is supposed to be. But both entertaining and enlightening is a lot to ask from an academic-styled conference meant to discuss weighty, complex issues which require technical, sometimes esoteric language that no normal person would use in day-to-day conversation. The event took place on Wednesday, September 18, and started an hour away from the much-anticipated PSG vs. Real Madrid game in the European Champions League. It was clear the conference would take more than an hour. So the moderator’s point about hoping the event to be fun was self-explanatory: With many participants having potentially ditched that kind of match for this kind of exercise in intellectual pronouncements and painstaking policy recommendations, they deserved something beyond the usual tedium that most academic conferences turn out to be. But this was no usual academic conference. Human-induced ecological degradation makes for exciting, urgency-filled discussions. Inviting geopolitics in the debate elevates the feat even further, far beyond the typically anticipated stakes. So the Wednesday event was, at least so hoped the organizers, the soon-to-be established Rabat School of Economic Warfare, worth the attention-grabbing question that announced it. But would the audience be satisfied; would they not end up feeling rueful about missing some crucial minutes of an actually entertaining evening for a possibly fun one? “There is no certain starting point when discussing an issue as vast and far-reaching as climate change. In the scientific community, there is an overwhelming consensus over the fact that human-induced climate change will be the defining battle of our century,” began Christian Harbulot, one of the evening’s three speakers. As a founding member and current president of the Paris School of Economic Warfare, Harbulot’s wary introductory remarks stressed the merit of asking experts’ opinions on an issue as convoluted as the geopolitics of climate change. He began by admitting to the complexity of the journey he was about to embark on with the audience. He reassured, however, as if sensing the rising heats his introductory words had brought about, that the end result—his conclusions and recommendations—would be worth the wait. “So I suppose what I will be arguing today will be something that has to do with the necessity of changing our windows of perceptions and apprehension as we face an unprecedented set of challenges with unprecedented potential of dictating the terms of our future.” Harbulot had won his bet; the audience, hooked up by the faux humility lurking beneath the admission of complexity, was ready to bear with him, to sympathetically nod along as he navigated the perilous waters of the ecological dimensions of geopolitical divergences. Harbulot had built a good rapport with the audience:  They would cooperate by listening with attention, and he would keep his end of the bargain by actually simplifying the intricate geopolitical implications of human-induced climate change. “The entire planet is concerned,” he went on, subtly swiping at the climate denier-in chief, US President Donald Trump, whose refusal to sign the Paris Agreement he had referenced somewhere in between his promising introduction and his warily enthusiastic recital in defense of it. “Human history has been marked by our documented tendency to dismiss unmistakable, overwhelming evidence when the facts do not align with how we feel, when the figures are somber. We describe as aberrations evidence that do not fit with our expectations, our worldview; we chose resignation instead of changing our relation to the world.” Even as he spoke spontaneously, the French academic’s words seemed to have been carefully chosen in advance to fulfill their purpose: delivering a frontal assault on climate deniers, on those “who still look at the new realities through worn-out, old conceptual lenses.” At an ordinary panel, this would sound like a good moment for the public to chime in by applauding, suggesting that they—at least the prevailing mood suggested that most of them—seemed to be feeling the indescribable kind of joy that comes from external validation, especially an expert’s validation of one’s underlying assumptions. But this was no ordinary panel; the evening was barely starting. The second speaker, Lahcen Haddad, picked up from where his predecessor had left. Slightly different in his approach, Haddad, an “expert in strategies of development” and Vice-president of the Moroccan Parliamentary Network on the World Bank and IMF, nonetheless maintained the same rapport with the audience. Where Harbulot had spoken from the faux modesty of an expert striving to connect with the audience, Haddad spoke with the assured authority that comes with a sense of social mission. Where his predecessor had begged for attention, Haddad demanded it. He came with dense data, detailed specifics of not only the far-reaching, future implications of the climate crisis, but mostly the “enormous, visible consequences it is already carrying in the crises in Africa and most of the conflicts in the Middle East.” The Moroccan politician spoke with great panache, and the poetic fervor of his data-driven analysis soon transformed his apparent self-indulgence into what it was all actually about: A genuine, earnest commitment to making sense of the sea of geopolitical events by pointing to their hidden patterns, to the “invisible hand” moving it all. For Haddad, climate-linked challenges are set to define the type of wars and conflicts to emerge in the coming decades. Climate, then, he appeared to suggest, will be the “invisible hand” behind most, if not all, of “the conflicts to come.” He spoke about the “weaponization of water,” the “militarization of borders,” as well as “the instrumentalization of conflicts” meant to give ethnic and religious dimensions to hostilities that are fundamentally climate-driven. By way of illustration, he explained how the Syrian conflict finds its genesis in the severe drought that hit the country between 2006 and 2011; he traced the Darfur tragedy back to the Sudanese government’s mismanagement of resource allocation between Arabs and Blacks; he pointed to the “ecological origins” of most of the “seemingly ethnicity or religion-driven conflicts in the Sahel and the Corn of Africa.” In this, Haddad appeared to echo some of Robert David Kaplan’s analysis in “The Coming Anarchy.” In the celebrated 1994 essay, the American journalist made the point that this century would be a “bifurcated world” riddled with deep-seated ideological divergences and armed conflicts mostly caused by environmental degradation. “To understand the events of the next fifty years, then, one must understand environmental scarcity… geographic destiny, and the transformation of war,” Kaplan wrote. Haddad simplified that warning. “Water scarcity will be the number one driver of future conflicts,” he said. Now pointing out the interminable rivalry between pastoralists and farmers in the Sahel and the Corn of Africa, he drove home his sobering conclusions about the increased likelihood of conflicts in the coming decades. “The probability of conflicts is set to grow by 26% if we do nothing to reverse the current, dire ecological trends.” At this point, the audience needed to hear about hope, about survival, about what can actually be done to avoid the bleak picture Haddad had masterfully presented. That hope did come at the end, preached by the matter-of-fact rhetoric of the third speaker. Slightly diverting from the somewhat jargon-filled academic analyses of the previous panelists, the third orator, Said Mouline, the president of the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE), brought in the policymaker’s perspective. He recounted his experience in supervising the organizing committee of the COP 22 meeting in Marrakech. But he did not dwell on the story. His point lay elsewhere. He aimed to argue that there is a fundamental reason why, as recently witnessed with the Paris Agreement, some governments and multinational corporations are dragging their feet when it comes to committing to global actions on climate change. The deep-seated refusal—or denial—of a scientifically proven tragedy, he argued, was proof that governments and corporations would only act when, somehow, it dawns on them that the catastrophe that climate activists have been preaching is “not for the future.” That “the catastrophe is already here;” that it has been here a long time ago; that “we cannot escape.” It should perhaps be noted here that Mouline’s “hope” is not the sense we generally ascribe to the word. His was not hope driven by expectations that everything will be alright—faith in the future. It was hope born out of desperation, the fear that tragedy is certain rather than likely. The point is not about salvaging the future; it is about surviving “the tragedy as if it has occurred, as if it has already hit us.” He spoke about “resilience and adaptation;” about “attenuation and adaptation;” about “salvaging our destitute present” from getting any worse than it already is; about “the human tendency to only act when there are no choices left but to act.” Seen in this light, Mouline’s central point seemed to be that the certainty of defeat brings about the inevitability of action. An impending defeat breathes of urgency, of an opportunity to reassess, to reevaluate, and to manage the mess one has caused. Hope comforts, whereas fear galvanizes. In moments of audacious thinking, he profusely cited Jean-Pierre Dupuy, the French environmental engineer and philosopher whose 2004 book, “Pour un catastrophisme éclairé” (On Enlightened Catastrophism), laid the intellectual, theoretical groundwork for Mouline’s action-driven analysis during the panel. Dupuy’s book speaks of “the ambivalence of catastrophes,” arguing that the only way to deal with tragedies is to embrace a kind of hopeful, pleasurable pessimism that comes with resignation to “the certainty of tragedy.” Dupuy wrote: “Confronting a catastrophe requires projecting oneself in the after-catastrophe moment. Looking back on our present in that moment after the catastrophe has taken place, we see catastrophes as our fate ; but in this we see fate that we could have chosen to avert when it was still time.” The point, constructive fatalism, sounds a lot similar to the thought experiment in Alan Weisman’s “The World without US.” The driving principle is that being threatened with immediate extinction is much more likely to make us active than all the combined “this is what will happen if” arguments offered by the dispiriting catalogue climate activists have been putting forward for decades. On the whole, the entire performance was an enlivening experience, a fun foray into a usually tedious—academic—terrain. The event’s only gray minutes came when the moderator, appearing to reference Greta Thunberg, made a sincere but misplaced joke about “some Swedish teenage girl traveling the world to raise awareness about the climate.” Rachid Hallaouy, the moderator, was swiftly called out for the tasteless joke, and he immediately retracted. What he had meant to say is not what he had said, he fumbled. The apology was rickety, but the audience sympathized anyway. They—we—forgave him. They understood there was nothing particularly inexcusable about getting momentarily carried away by an immersive discussion on geopolitics and climate change. There were “great questions” asked at the end. To these, even greater, thought-provoking answers were provided. Harbulot, the French academic, talked about “changing our analytical and discursive paradigms in order to be pertinent in our analysis of mounting, surging challenges.” Haddad, the Moroccan MP and sustainable development specialist, mentioned “sustainability and responsibility;” he emphasized the “need to successfully complete the transitions ahead,” from fuel to green, environment-friendly energy. Mouline, for his part, stood by his belief in “the inevitability of tragedy” as the surest coping mechanism in the face of impending ecological chaos. But what should such an oxymoronic attitude to the climate crisis entail in practical terms? “The assessment is pessimistic, but the solutions should be borne out of basic optimism in the possibility of change,” asserted Mouline.   This story has been updated to correct a mistake in locating Darfur. An earlier version wrongly located Darfur in Somalia rather than in Sudan. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Rabat – A group of Moroccans with dual nationality published a manifesto, on September 24, rejecting their Moroccan nationality and requesting the support of the Dutch government in cutting ties with Morocco. The first lines of the manifesto read, “we, Dutch citizens with dual nationality, the Moroccan nationality, which we have not freely chosen, turn to Dutch society and the Dutch government to help us get rid of the fear and lack of freedom inevitably linked to our second nationality.” The signatories argued that, after living for 50 years in the Netherlands, they “want full Dutch citizenship, both in the Netherlands and abroad.” They expressed their wish to be free in choosing dual nationality and “to not be obliged by a foreign power to be a lifelong national.” The manifesto further noted that, since the 1970s, Morocco has “created a range of government institutions to spy on, intimidate, recruit, and corrupt Moroccans in the Netherlands.” According to the manifesto, such institutions include the advisory board of King Mohammed VI (CCME), the Ministry of ‘Moroccans Abroad’, and the Hassan II Foundation for Moroccans Abroad. The signatories further explained that the Moroccan state’s “ultimate goal” is to gain power and influence in Europe and to ensure a constant flow of money from the country’s diaspora.  “By placing the Moroccan law above the Dutch law, the Netherlands now allows nearly 400,000 of its citizens to remain under Morocco’s interference, control, and laws,” added the signatories. They stated that “the Dutch nationality of [Moroccan] citizens … turns out to be worthless” as they “do not feel free to openly express their opinions on freedom, human rights violations, and the failing rule of law in Morocco.” The manifesto signatories include Laila Ezzeroili (publicist), Asis Aynan (writer), Mohand Abttoy (artist), and Abdelhafid Akallouch (journalist).  The manifesto concluded with the citizens’ “hope that the Netherlands learns from our negative experiences with a compulsory second nationality and that foreign powers such as Morocco no longer hold any power over its citizens.”

Rabat – Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has reiterated his country’s firm position on Western Sahara. Spain views the United Nations as the only party with legitimate rights to help find an agreed upon political solution to the dispute over the conflict.  During a speech at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly in New York, Sanchez underlined his country’s stance on Western Sahara. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported today, September 25 that Sanchez defended the” centrality” of the UN to reach a “political, just, lasting and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict. The prime minister said that Spain wishes to contribute to “the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to achieve, in pursuance of Security Council resolutions a  just, lasting, and mutually acceptable solution” to the conflict. MAP reported that Sanchez, who has made no allusions to self-determination, has so far called for a fair, sustainable, and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.” Sanchez’s statement comes after a few weeks after  a document  from the Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE)  stipulated that the Spanish government “supports the  extension of the MINURSO mandate to monitor human rights.”  The suggestion to extend the MINURSO’s mandate is an unexpected move for Morocco as Sanchez has been a vital voice for Morocco’s interests, especially at the European Union. Sanchez has regularly stood behind Morocco in the fight against irregular migration and counterterrorism. Sanchez has described Morocco as Spain’s exemplary ally, reiterating his country’s determination to maintain strong diplomatic ties with Morocco.

Rabat – Pop icon Madonna has been spotted sporting the designs of Moroccan milliner Youssef Lahlou. Madonna wore a custom Youssef Lahlou hat during the opening night of her world tour in New York on September 17. The hat is from Lahlou’s “BOA Panama” collection, with a custom twist of added Xs coming out of the mouth of the snake. The addition of the Xs is an homage to Madonna’s latest album, Madame X, Lahlou told MWN. “I thought it would be a cool twist for her,” he explained. Last time Lahlou spoke to Morocco World News, he said that Madonna wearing one of his creations was one of his biggest goals, so for the star to wear one of his hats on the opening night of her tour is a big win for Lahlou, ”Having Madonna wearing my hats is a big accomplishment for me,” Lahlou said. “She is very selective on the designers she wears, so seeing her in my work made me proud!” Lahlou is Casablanca-born designer, still fresh on the fashion scene. He only launched his namesake brand in January 2017, making his list of accomplishments just two years into his fashion career especially noteworthy. Within three days of launching his brand of unique, high-fashion hats, Vogue Arabia dubbed it the “breakout brand to watch.” Since then the likes of Nicki Minaj, Usher, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gigi Hadid, have sported Lahlou’s creations.

Prices for Lahlou’s one-of-a-kind pieces start at $350.

 Rabat – Supporters of Raja Casablanca expressed their support for the Palestinian cause during their team’s game against the Palestinian team Hilal Al-Quds. Rajawi fans waved Palestinian flags and held banners against normalization with Zionists. The game that ended with Raja’s victory (1-0) was held in Casablanca’s Mohammed V stadium, on Monday, September 23. The match was part of the round-of-32 of Mohammed VI Arab Champions Cup. Before the start of the match Raja fans displayed a Tifo depicting “Handala,” a famous cartoon character portraying a 10-year-old refugee child. “Handala” was created by Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali, one of the most famous cartoonists in the Arab world, known mostly for his criticism of Arab regimes and Israel.  Throughout the game, more than 50,000 supporters chanted songs in support of Palestine. The fans also shouted “Palestine, Palestine” and “Gaza, we will never let you down” for more than 90 minutes. The Palestinian’s team goalkeeper, Rami Hamada, started chanting with the crowds for some moments in the middle of the game. “I would like to thank the Moroccan people for their welcoming. The atmosphere was amazing, I even chanted during the game,” Hamada said in a post-game interview. His teammate Mohammed Sammar also expressed his gratitude towards Moroccan fans: “Many thanks to the fans who chanted for the glory of Palestine during the whole 90 minutes.” الشعوب عصية على التطبيع مع الصهاينة القتلة… جمهور الرجاء البيضاوي أمس في مقابلة بين الرجاء وهلال القدس الفلسطيني. Posted by Noureddine Lechhab on Tuesday, 24 September 2019 Impressed with the support shown by the Moroccan crowds, Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, promised that the Moroccan team and their fans will be hosted for free during their upcoming travel to the West Bank to play the second leg of the game, on October 3. The solidarity expressed by Raja fans with the Palestinian cause is not the first time Moroccan people have declared their support for their Palestinian brothers. In June, 2019, thousands of Moroccans rallied in solidarity with Palestine. The crowds protested against the US proposed Middle-East Peace Plan, the so-called “Deal of the Century.” The Moroccan government is also known for its support for the Palestinian cause. King Mohammed VI was one of the first world leaders to warn the US and the United Nations after US President Trump decided to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. On September 15, during an emergency meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Secretary of State to the Moroccan Foreign Minister, Mounia Boucetta, delivered a speech reiterating Morocco’s unwavering position on the Israel-Palestine conflict. In her speech, the Moroccan official said that violations by the Israeli authorities “undermine the two-state solution and hinder international efforts to revive the peace process.” The secretary of state also highlighted the special interest of King Mohammed VI, Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, in promoting the Palestinian cause.

Rabat – The National Association for the Defense of Human Rights (ANDDH) has condemned, through social networks, the decision of the Minister of Education, Said Amzazi, to use disciplinary measures against a teacher.  The minister’s decision comes after the teacher posted a widely shared video depicting the deplorable state of the public school she works at. The president of ANDDH, Muhammed Rachid Chrii, described the ministry’s decision to Morocco World News as “arbitrary and authoritarian.”  The ANDDH also called on Said Amzazi’s department to “reconsider its decision” because the video’s content is “a striking example of the reality of most educational institutions in our country, especially in the rural world.”  The minister’s decision to suspend and deploy disciplinary measures against the teacher sparked nationwide controversy. The teacher posted the video to urge officials to take action against Morocco’s crumbling public education in general. However, Amzazi considered her behavior “inappropriate”  and argued that it only seeks to tarnish the image of the ministry and its efforts to improve school infrastructure. The minister also emphasized that the school in the video had undergone a number of renovation works recently, explaining its derelict state. Following the ministry’s decision, several Moroccan teachers expressed solidarity with their colleague. Internet users launched a campaign under the slogan, “Sharing the truth is not a crime.” Others started posting and sharing new videos and photos depicting the same dire state in their schools. Faced with the widespread support for the teacher, the minister “has recently withdrawn the decision,” the ANDDH president told MWN. Chrii added that “the ministry did not do her justice; it was the people who supported her.”  Chrii also told MWN that; “While international treaties guarantee activists the right to condemn and expose the terrible situations they face in their countries, the Moroccan State is still trying to silence them using administrative measures.”

Rabat – Algeria’s army chief Gaid Salah has been criticizing protesters. The protesters are refusing to participate in presidential election polls due to take place on December 12. On Tuesday, September 24 in Tindouf, Salah said that some parties “relentlessly continue to repeat biased slogans.” Since February, a wave of protests calling for radical change emerged in Algeria. Protesters meet every Friday in the capital of Algeria and call on all elites to leave the government, including Gaid Salah. Salah, however, is determined that an election can serve Algeria and its people. The army chief said that regardless of the slogans chanted during protests, “the army command maintained its consistent position that it has no political ambition but serving Algeria and its people.” Salah also  claimed that  some people, who held senior positions of management within the state’s various institutions “have intentionally conspired against Algeria.” “Unfortunately, history repeats itself. In fact, like there was a small group who betrayed the oath of our Glorious Revolution brave men, there are individuals, from this generation, who have held senior positions of management within State institutions and have intentionally conspired against the country with enemies, without regard for it,” he said. He also  claimed that the individuals “who betrayed their countries attempted to destroy what has been built thanks to the efforts of loyal men.” On Monday, September 24,  several senior officials appeared before the judge at an Algerian military court facing charges of plotting against the state. On Tuesday, September 24, the court sentenced the brother of former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to 15 years in prison.

Rabat – Morocco is hosting a training session on the video assistant referee (VAR) at the Mohammed VI Conference  Palace in Skhirat, near Rabat. The training session opened on Tuesday, September 24, with the participation of 39 referees and assistant referees, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation’s (FRMF) Deputy National Referee Director Mohamed Guezzaz said that the adoption of the VAR technique is “dictated by the evolution of football.” “FIFA has launched the VAR technology to offer referees a tool to reduce errors that have a direct impact on the outcome of the match and in particular on the approval or rejection of a goal or a penalty.” Guezzaz will supervise the five-day training session, which includes learning the logistical mechanisms required by VAR as well as its methods of use. The sportsman explained that the first phase of the training session includes the theoretical aspect of the use of the mechanisms and equipment necessary for the VAR technique. There will be a particular focus on the video projecting room of fixed or mobile cameras. The second step, which will take place in October, will be dedicated to complex arbitration cases, which require further examination to make the appropriate decision. Morocco has an unfriendly history with VAR, especially in the 2018 World Cup. FIFA referees at the World Cup deprived Morocco’s national team of the use of VAR in at least 4 instances in its match against Portugal during the 2018 World Cup. The decision caused Morocco to lose the match and be eliminated in the match against Spain. In addition to the national team, Morocco’s Wydad of Casablanca (WAC)  was also subjectto a VAR controversy. Referees at the Confederation of African Football (CAF) deprived WAC of VAR use after its player Walid Karti scored a goal during a match against Tunisian football club Esperance Tunis (EST) in May 2019. Gambian referee Bakary Gassama disallowed Karti’s header. WAC players protested to the Gambian referee, demanding that the VAR be used. To their utter dismay, the referee kept refusing to check the video technology. The team was then informed more than 20 minutes later that the VAR was not functioning. Commenting on the VAR training session for Moroccan referees,  Morocco’s international referee Redouan Jaid said that the use of VAR is in line with the general trend of world football. He said that Morocco is a “pioneer at the continental level in the adoption of this technology in the national championship.” He emphasized the importance of VAR in minimizing the mistakes made by referees. “These errors had in the past caused enormous damage to the national teams by impacting their results,” he said.

Rabat – An Algerian military court sentenced, on Tuesday, September 24, Said Bouteflika, brother of the former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to 15 years in prison. Bouteflika faced charges of “attacking the authority of the army” and “conspiracy against the authority of the state.” After two days of hearings, Blida’s public prosecution office requested a 20-year prison sentence for the defendant.  Said Bouteflika has been seen as the power behind the Bouteflika regime, following his brother’s stroke in 2013. Algeria also sentenced two former secret service chiefs and a political party head on similar charges. In a series of protests, which started on February 22, Algerians have been denouncing the widespread corruption amongst the country’s political elite. The protesters are calling for accountability and for an end to the impunity enjoyed by elites. The Algerian protesters demanded radical change for the whole “corrupt system,” including the dismissal of every official from Bouteflika’s era. The former president was in power from 1999 to 2019. Several other senior government officials have been placed in custody, including Algeria’s two former prime ministers, Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal. Despite threats to arrest protesters, Algeria flocked to the capital for another wave of protests on Friday, September 20 Last week, Algerian army chief Gaid Salah ordered the police to arrest protesters entering Algeria. “I have instructed the national gendarmerie to deal with these actions with firmness,” said General Ahmed Gaid Salah. Salah said that orders had been issued to stop “vehicles and coaches used” to bring protestors to Algiers by seizing them and “fining their owners.” The chief, regarded as Algeria’s de facto leader after the resignation of former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, is also insisting on the importance of an election before the end of this year. Interim president Abdelkader Bensalah has announced that the election will take place on December 12.

Rabat – The Guardian reported on Tuesday, September 24, that  15 European Union members issued a joint statement to condemn unlawful detention, the alleged use of torture, and unfair trials of activists and journalists in Saudi Arabia. The statement was presented at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Guardian reported that the meeting was the second of its kind in six months. The statement also explicitly refers to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The members of the EU have urged Saudi Arabia to reveal the truth behind the murder of the prominent journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The signatories of the joint statement include the UK and Germany. Canada, New Zealand, and Peru also appeared on the list alongside the 15 EU member states. Australia’s ambassador Sally Mansfield, read out the statement said, “We are concerned at reports of torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, unfair trials and harassment of individuals engaged in promoting and defending human rights, their families and colleagues.” Despite the reforms in place under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia continues to face backlash and condemnation over alleged torture and arrest of critics. Earlier this month, news on Saudi Arabia selling the consulate building where Khashoggi was killed went viral. An audio transcript, which provided more details about the murder of Khashoggi also went viral. Turkish news outlet Daily Sabah shared part of a conversation recorded before and during the murder of the journalist. The conversation documents a conversation between Maher Abdulaziz and Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy,  two people allegedly involved in the killing of Khashoggi. Next month will mark the first anniversary of Khashoggi’s violent death.

Rabat – The Spanish parliament has suspended four jailed pro-Catalan MPs ahead of critical European, regional, and local elections on September 29. The four lawmakers were elected to their now suspended parliamentary seats in the country’s latest elections in April. They were later jailed for their role in Catalonia’s failed independence bid in 2017. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s ruling socialist party, as well as the parliament’s recently increased faction of right-wing parties, voted in favor of the suspension move. Meritxell Batet, the speaker of the Spanish Congress and member of the ruling socialist party, explained that the move was motivated by a robust legal case against the suspended MP’s conduct. They stand accused of rebellion for their separatist views and pro-independence activism on Spain’s most devise political issue: The territorial crisis in Catalonia. “Based on all these legal elements, we have to automatically declare that their rights as lawmakers are suspended,” Batet told reporters after the decision. As the four MPs— Oriol Junqueras, Jordi Sanchez, Jordi Turull, Josep Rull—await their trail, along with 8 other separatist activists, Spanish prosecutors are reportedly pushing for a 25-year prison sentence for each of the defendants. They “are on trial on charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds relating to an independence referendum and subsequent unilateral declaration of independence by Catalonia in 2017,” Reuters detailed earlier today. “The Madrid government had banned the referendum and imposed direct rule on the northeastern region for a period.” Meanwhile, the suspended MPs and their supporters see political manipulation in the decision by the Spanish parliament. They deny all wrongdoing, arguing that the only motivation is to sideline the MPs and their known opposition to the current ruling party. The move comes at a highly sensitive moment in Spanish politics. The country’s political parties recently failed to form a coalition government following the April elections. On Sunday, Spain goes to the polls for the fourth time in four years, suggesting a climate of uncertainty and deep political fragility. With the Spanish parliament’s pro-Catalonia voice now silenced, some analysts predict an easier route to coalition for PM Sanchez. The ruling party is expected to more easily form a left-leaning coalition with Podemos.
Previously, Sanchez extended coalition hands to Podemos, incorporating a number of the leftwing party’s sticking points in a recent policy document. Among the document’s policy recommendations was an unprecedented, pro-Polisario shift—a signature Podemos move—on the Western Sahara territorial dispute. Amid heightened uncertainty about what’s next for Spain’s deeply fractured domestic politics, the suspension of the four pro-Catalan MPs is largely seen as a points-scoring, nationalist electorate-grabbing maneuver by PM Sanchez and his socialist party. Sanchez has consistently been accused by Spanish hardliners, nationalism preaching rightwing parties, of cozying up to Catalonian independence advocates. With the overwhelming fervor that has greeted the separatist MPs’ suspension in Spanish nationalist circles, it is to be seen how Sanchez’s Socialist Workers’ Party will fare in Sunday’s elections.

He made his statement during a meeting with Morocco’s Speaker of the House of Representatives Habib El Mali, who represented King Mohammed VI at the inauguration ceremony of the Turkish president in Ankara.

The news was first shared by Adult Swim, the US television network that broadcasts “Rick and Morty,” on their Twitter account. pic.twitter.com/htPBbqp4aT — [adult swim] (@adultswim) September 24, 2019 Mendel worked on “The Simpsons” since the animated series launch in 1989. He produced 207 episodes for the show between 1989 and 1999. He won three Emmy Awards for his work on “The Simpsons.” The producer collected the award for best animated program, in 1995, 1997, and 1998.

Rabat – The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) released an authoritative and actionable climate science report on September 22. A team of natural and social scientists prepared the report to inform policymakers at the UN Climate Action Summit, which opened Monday, September 23. United in Science examines gaps between climate science realities and current emissions trajectories. The report found that even though renewables have seen extraordinary growth, fossil fuel use and emissions increased in 2018 and peak emissions will not be reached by 2030, let alone by 2020. 2015-2019 are on track to be the hottest five years in recorded history, according to the report. Natural and social scientist authors highlight how major heatwaves, record-breaking fires, floods, drought, and tropical cyclones have devastated socio-economic development during this period. Climate records have marked the five year period within the MENA region. In June 2018, Quriyat on coastal Oman recorded a 24-hour minimum temperature of 42.6°C, possibly the highest such temperature recorded on a thermometer. Ouargla in the Algerian Sahara reported a maximum temperature of 51.3°C in July 2018, the highest ever reliably recorded on the African continent. Morocco has witnessed droughts and shifting seasons since 2015. The 2016 drought was the most severe in three decades, according to the Moroccan government. Its impact on Morocco’s key agricultural sector prompted King Mohammed VI, who inaugurated the Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex, the world’s largest concentrated solar plant, to issue a decree calling on the faithful to pray for rain. Climate policies in place to achieve the Paris agreement’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will not achieve their goals. Current ambitions must be tripled to meet the 2°C limit and increased approximately fivefold to meet the 1.5°C limit, according to the WMO report. Failing to meet these limits will result in catastrophic global conditions, climate scientists continue to warn. According to the report, if current trends continue, the world will warm by 2.9°C to 3.4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Humanity possesses the technical capacity to meet the 1.5°C goal, but doing so will require rapid and unprecedented shifts in all forms of society, according to the IPCC 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. “Only immediate and all-inclusive action encompassing: Deep de-carbonization complemented by ambitious policy measures, protection and enhancement of carbon sinks and biodiversity, and efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, will enable us to meet the Paris Agreement,” urged a WMO press release. Morocco is one of only two countries worldwide on track to meet the 1.5°C target, according to Climate Action Tracker. A global youth climate movement has spotlighted this week’s climate summit and inspired a concurrent Youth Climate Action Summit. The unprecedented call to action brings hope when many are discouraged by insufficient climate crisis legislation. An experienced international climate negotiator and former chair of the main committee of the UN Climate Convention told Morocco World News that science is taken seriously at negotiations: “The science on climate change has been getting firmer for years. And the observed reality on climate change is always toward the more dire projections. “Despite the posturing of some politicians, this science is not debated by the international negotiators seeking to find ways to mitigate humankind’s impact on the climate. This complex economic negotiation is producing results.” He added a call to action: “A great deal more, much more, needs to be done to minimize the worst impacts of climate change.” Princess Lalla Hasnaa, Chairwoman of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection, addressed summit members on behalf of King Mohammed VI. Hasnaa delivered a royal speech emphasizing that effective global climate policy requires “effective international solidarity, sustainable financing and a qualitative transfer of technology and know-how” to support countries in the global south. This statement echoes previous speeches made by King Mohammed VI. Hasnaa also announced the foundation’s launch of the African Youth Climate Hub, which aims to “showcase leadership and innovation, and to underscore the positive role of African youth.” She explained that the concurrent Youth Climate Summit “provides reasons for optimism, requiring us to respond positively and lend our effective support.”

Rabat – Spanish civil guard members intercepted today, September 24, 19 Moroccan irregular migrants. The group of Moroccans, including one woman, are all aged between 20 and 40. They left the settlement of Benzu, in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, on an inflatable boat. The migrants were heading to Cadiz, in the southwest of Spain, according to Spanish newspaper El Faro de Ceuta. The intervention of the Spanish civil guard took place around 3:15 a.m. The authorities noticed a boat going towards the Iberian Peninsula. The boat was in the water for more than two hours before being intercepted. The Spanish authorities transferred the intercepted migrants to the local Red Cross center in Ceuta. The Red Cross team members carried out medical checks on the undocumented migrants at around 4:30 a.m. After making sure that all the intercepted migrants were in good health, the civil guard of Ceuta transferred them to the police headquarters to start the procedure of sending them back to Morocco. The Moroccan man who owns the inflatable boat was also arrested on the same night. He will face charges of human trafficking at a Spanish court. Moroccans and irregular migrants from throughout Africa attempt to cross the Mediterranean sea to reach Europe on a daily basis. In August, spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi said that security services aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019.

Rabat – As Africa finds itself on the receiving end of a whirlwind of contemporary challenges, the need to spur South-South cooperation has never been this acute. Only through increased cooperation and genuine political will can Africa and the “Global South” at large meet challenges like food security and other aspects of sustainable development. The plea, a balanced blend of alarm ringing and optimism, was made by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, who spoke at a panel on the sidelines of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. Bourita addressed the promise of South-South cooperation, stressing the need for sustainable agriculture and intra-African cooperation amid anticipation of climate-caused crises expected to hit the continent in the coming years and decades if nothing is done to curb the current tide. “Only together can we tackle the challenge of food security,” Bourita said at one point is his address. He acknowledged the optimistic winds that have been coming out of Africa over the past four of five years. Since at least 2011, a host of African countries have jumped in the global rankings of GDP and business-friendly environments. The notable changes have significantly altered global discussions on Africa, ranging from “Africa Rising” stories in the mainstream media to suggestions that this century will be Africa’s. Even as these changes are notable and much-needed gains for the continent, Bourita warned, the celebratory mood should not push aside the fact that most countries on the continent are still battling to provide some of the most basic necessities for their populations. “The fight against famine is one of the most ambitious goals” for the majority of African countries still struggling to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, Bourita asserted. He went on to argue that, for all the individual ambitions and efforts in Africa and the Global South at large, the stakes of the current challenges call for strong and effective platforms of South-South cooperation.  “South-South cooperation is indispensable…. Our challenge is to work together, with the support of our multilateral and bilateral partners, to free Africa of famine and poverty by tackling the root causes of the food security challenge.” Bourita did not speak solely about Africa’s problems, however. As is now customary in African policy and decision-making circles, the Moroccan minister inevitably mentioned the perceptible winds of change that have marked the African story in the past three to five years. Bourita spoke at length about the recent discussions on the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) and the multiplicity of AU summits on spurring collective action on common challenges. The suggestion, according to Bourita, is that most countries across the continent are showing glimpses of genuine—and growing—commitment to collectively tackling shared challenges. “All these challenges should not cloud the fact that Africa has all the potential it needs to turn the tide. Africa is a big continent with numerous vital forces and resources, and it can become the world’s breadbasket. Moreover, our continent is currently experiencing positive dynamics, both on the socio-economic and the governance fronts.” Bourita concluded with the hope, widely shared by African policymakers and other, non-government advocates of the newly signed AfCFTA, that an African free trade area would “help stimulate intra-African exchanges for affordable agricultural products,” increase the disposable income of African entrepreneurs (including of local farmers), and “rekindle the food industry.” Morocco’s south-south advocacy and African visibility Bourita’s plea for a robust South-South cooperation and strengthened intra-African platforms comes as Morocco strives to lead the dance on both fronts. In the Global South in general, Rabat has been applauded for its visible efforts on global platforms such as transnational counterterrorism and the recently signed Global Compact on Migration. In Africa, meanwhile, the past two years (since Rabat’s admission to the African Union in January 2017) have been marked by Morocco’s rise in prominence in African affairs. With its growing investments in the banking and telecom sectors in sub-Saharan Francophone Africa, Morocco has emerged as an indispensable trendsetter in what some observers have described as a changing, new post-colonial Africa. Outside of French-speaking Africa, OCP Africa has been the torchbearer of Morocco’s growing continental significance. With currently signed agreements with the governments of Rwanda, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, among others, the Moroccan company is gradually establishing itself in the driver’s seat of African discussions about fertilizers, sound agricultural policies, and food security goals. Just recently, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari credited Morocco with the positive developments recently undergone by Nigerian agricultural policy in general and Nigerian local farmers. President Buhari tweeted that cooperation with Morocco is vital for Nigeria’s aspirations on the agriculture and food security front. Most significantly, perhaps, as Morocco gradually reaps the fruits of its Africa-focused, South-South promoting diplomacy, the country’s rhetoric is saturated with feelings of “African vocation” and “historic responsibility” towards the continent. As Morocco “realizes that its future belongs in Africa,” the speaker of the Moroccan House of Representatives recently argued, the country’s “African commitment” and “pan-African vocation” have become the central pillars of its diplomacy.

Rabat – Moroccan rapper French Montana has announced he will release his latest album, simply titled “Montana,” next month. He also teased the album’s cover and released an album trailer, both of which have already caused a stir on social media.  He shared the cover to his Instagram with the caption “You don’t have to change who you are. You can bring people into your own world,” likely alluding to the juxtaposition between his Moroccan roots and his induction into the American rap world.   You don’t have to change who you are You can bring people into your own world !! THIS MY ALBUM ARTWORK .. NOVEMBER ❤️🙏 A post shared by  French Montana (@frenchmontana) on Sep 23, 2019 at 7:00am PDT  The trailer and cover portray French Montana surrounded by women in burkas, wearing contrasting high-heeled red thigh boots. As the rapper probably anticipated, the choice to show burka-wearing women in a suggestive light has already got people talking. This Album cover is definitely gonna stir up some shit. Watch out. — Mazi Kelvinbagwell® (@kelvinbagwell02) September 23, 2019  Some have dubbed the cover “haram” or disrespectful to Islam for the choice to “sexualise niqabis.” One user commented on Instagram calling it “deeply offensive.” I think @FrencHMonTanA new album cover is disrespectful for the beautifull religion of Islam. — iamRFDO (@iamRFDO) September 23, 2019  frenchmontana is really out here sexualizing niqabis.

He would selll his religion for money fuck him! — Younas Hussain (@yunus_KadafiMob) September 24, 2019  However, not all the response to the album artwork has been negative, and it has received its fair share of praise too. One headline in particular, in sharp contrast to much of the album’s reception, said French Montana was “honoring his muslim roots” with the visuals. Fans have also been receptive. Two things that made my day 1) French Montana new album 2) French Montana new album w/ your non traditional cover #hijabae — -mary (@notyouravgsa) September 24, 2019  Not excited for this at all but that album cover is so freaking dope imma listen to it anyway. — Fade of the Internet (@scaifington) September 23, 2019  French Montana, whose real name is Karim Kharbouch, emigrated to the US from Rabat at age 13 and has since become one of the biggest names in hip-hop. He has always been vocal about his Moroccan roots and Muslim upbringing, making it a focal point of his public image. Last month, he used his platform as a presenter at the Video Music Awards (VMAs) to raise awareness about the plight of immigrants in the US. While presenting the award for Best Latin video, he said he was “proud” to present the award “because as an immigrant, I feel like we are the people that make this country, and I feel like I want to be the voice.” “These nominees — and most of them are immigrants, too — are on top of the biggest movement in music,” he added.

Hamdallah reportedly receives an annual salary of $9million from Al Nassr. Amarabat earns €3 million a  year. Amrabat joined Al Nassr in July 2018 on a three-year contract. Do not listen to any rumors . We need only your support 🙏🏻 and stay together. The players, technical staf, boardmembers and the fans. 💙💛 — Nordin Amrabat (@NAmrabat53) September 22, 2019  In a recent interview, Amrabat lauded Hamdallah’s football skills. Amrabat described his teammate as a goal machine. “Hamdallah’s strength resides in his technical qualities, his physical power, and his positional sense. This allows him to convert into goals some of the most difficult situations,” said Amrabat.

Rabat  – The Court of First Instance in Rabat postponed the controversial trial of Hajar Raissouni, a detained journalist. Raissouni has been in custody since August 31. The court postponed the trial to September 30  after several hours of hearings late at night on Monday, September 23. During the court session, the judge gave Raissouni the opportunity to talk about what she has experienced since her arrest at the end of August. Police arrested Raissouni for illegal abortion and premarital sex changes. They arrested her on her way out of a doctor’s office. During yesterday’s hearing, the journalist said that she suffered severe pain when she was forced to undergo an intrusive medical examination to determine if she had had an abortion. “The [medical examination] that was done to me without my consent was painful,” she said. She also condemned the publicization of the case on social media.  Raissouni also reiterated the public prosecutor’s statement denouncing the discussion of her personal life in media outlets. On September 5, the Public Prosecutor of the Rabat Court of First Instance issued his first statement on the case, emphasizing that the journalist was arrested for illegal abortion and that the arrest was in no way connected to her journalism. The prosecutor also said that he regretted having been urged to publish this clarification and does not want it to be considered normal practice. The prosecutor added that this is a case that should have been discussed, proved, or denied before the court. On September 19, the same court ruled against Raissouni’s request for a temporary release pending trial. The court’s attorney general reiterated at Monday’s hearing that the journalist’s arrest was not motivated by her professional activities, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. A debate emerged after the Raissouni’s arrest. Moroccan activists and feminists are now signing a Manifesto launched by Moroccan female writers and activists. Leila Slimani and Sonia Terrab posted a manifesto on Monday, September 23 to express solidarity with the journalist. The manifesto also seeks to criticize Morocco’s laws criminalizing sexual relations and abortion. “We are violating unfair and obsolete laws. We are having sex out of wedlock. We are suffering, enabling or being complicit of abortion. We learned to deal with it and pretend. But for how long?” reads the starting paragraph of the text. The 28-year old journalist, who writes for the Arabic-speaking daily Akhbar Al Yaoum, faces up to two years imprisonment. Morocco’s penal code criminalizes both sex outside marriage and abortion in cases where imminent danger to the mother’s life cannot be proven.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has called for more concrete action to tackle climate change, especially in Africa. Princess Lalla Hasnaa read out the King’s message at the Climate Action Summit in New York. The King emphasized that the “environmental degradation of our planet is a tangible reality.” He added that the threat calls for shared responsibility. “Africa, a continent which is suffering from the impact of climate change, must be a priority in our collective action,” the monarch said. In his message, the King also drew attention to some of Morocco’s policies to reduce the impacts of climate change. The King recalled that Morocco, “a country with low greenhouse gas emissions, has undertaken to reduce its emissions by 42%, by 2030.” He went on to say that the North African country is determined to continue to boost its energy transition, setting “the more ambitious goal securing 52% of its electricity production from renewable energy sources by 2030.” King Mohammed VI also said that the first Africa Action Summit, which took place in Marrakech, set off an unprecedented dynamic “in particular through the operationalization of two African climate commissions, for the Congo Basin and for the Sahel Region.” The King added that Morocco along with its African partners launched the African Agriculture Adaptation Initiative. Together with sister African nations, Morocco has also launched the African Agriculture Adaptation Initiative. The initiative seeks to reduce the vulnerability of Africa and its agriculture to climate change. The King explained that the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection established “African Youth Climate Hub,” in collaboration with partner associations.  The initiative seeks to raise awareness for the impacts of climate change among youth. “In this regard, the first ‘Youth Climate Summit’ provides reasons for optimism, requiring us to respond positively and lend our effective support,” the King added. He also reiterated that it is only through shared responsibility that the international community can face the challenges of climate change. “Our ambition with respect to tackling climate change requires effective international solidarity, sustainable financing and a qualitative transfer of technology and know-how. That is the true meaning of my commitment in this regard – towards Morocco, Africa and our planet,” the King concluded.

Rabat – Morocco is hosting this year’s Solar Decathlon Africa, a global competition that the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water, and the Environment and the Moroccan Research Institute in Solar Energy and New Energies (IRSEN) is organizing. Over 1,200 participants from over 20 countries compete to fully design and construct operational solar homes. Ben Guerir in Morocco’s central Rehamna Province is hosting the decathlon from September 13 through 27. Throughout these weeks, a team of jurors will evaluate the participants based upon ten events. Each event accumulates up to 100 points. Whichever team scores the most points will be the winner.  Passionate students and professors of the future of solar powered houses compete under the auspices of universities from around the world.  The contest aims to conceptualize low-energy consuming buildings that reach the bid of net-zero energy and to increase reliance on renewable energies, as outlined in the competition’s mission statement. Morocco World News travelled to Ben Guerir for a first-hand impression of Solar Decathlon Africa 2019.  Introduced to Morocco via the Silk Road, the hut-shaped Sunimplant is constructed largely of hemp. Throughout her career as a Germany-based architect, Monika Bruemmer regards hemp as a formidable building material apt for the Moroccan climate.  “We have constructed tamped hemp concrete walls. Not only is hemp well suited for the day-night cycle and subsequent differences of temperature, but because of its organic nature, we’re able to completely reconstruct the house after it has reached its durability limit. Right now this house can last up to several decades, but can be completely rebuilt out of the same materials,” as told by Bruemmer. Throughout the Central Rif region, the origin of Moroccan hemp, there is more than meets the eye. Sunimplant’s interior is based on Riffian decoration, as the particular layout of the house indicates.  Though the interior may be reminiscent of the Rif, the exterior calls to mind the design of archaic African architecture, such as that in ancient Somalia.  “The exterior design of the house is taken after the huts that were constructed in archaic times, but since we are striving for a sustainable future and modern requirements, the outer layers of the hut have been equipped with solar panels that provide the house with energy.” Per competition parameters, teams must construct the houses not only in a sustainable fashion but to appeal to inhabitants as well. Petra, the ancient southwestern city located in Jordan, inspires Neopetra design, though it caters to modern audiences.  “Since we are hoping that one day people will actually live in houses such as these, we realized we had to make them appealing and comfortable at the same time,” said Mohamed Amine El Marraki, project manager of Moroccan team Neopetra. Appealing to modern audiences who are in search of something fresh and new does not mean abandoning Moroccan heritage. “As you can see we have decorated the entire ceiling with wood, in line with the Moroccan style referred to as atawa,” added Marraki. The house’s design pays respect both to Moroccan architecture and to achieving a sustainable, solar-driven future. “The solar panels on the roof are facing an east-to-west position, to ensure the panels are exposed to the sun throughout the entire day,” Marraki explained.  “But a house is a place to socialize as well. This is why we have designed a place in the middle of the house, referred to as forstdar where people can meet, laugh, and make music.” Team Bosphorus represents Turkey with their villa-like house titled Reyard. “Reyard is a play on words by which we convey the strength of our house, namely: Recycle, reuse and reinterpret,” according to project manager Esra Kiygin.  “While doing research we learned that Moroccan houses usually have an inner-yard. This is something we incorporated by connecting every individual room to the courtyard. Hence the name Reyard.” “We have strived to go above and beyond with our design, not only incorporating solar energy but ensuring a self-sufficient, sustainable house that can be used for many years. Crucial for this approach was the use of our microalgae pond, that makes it possible for streams of waste water to be reconverted into reusable energy,” she said. “In this way the house can operate as an independent ecosystem, not reliant on any other power source,” explained Kiygin. Each house brings something new to the table. The team that built Interhouse wanted to ensure interaction between the inhabitant and the house.  “As you can see we have equipped each room with a smart device that can be operated by both the main computer and an app we have designed for your smartphone. By sliding my finger in a downwards position over the screen of my phone I can lower the sunscreens of the house, or with a simple tap turn on the lights,” explained team member Michael Blonsky. “Being an American-Moroccan team, we designed the house in both styles. Our front porch is a great example of American architecture, and as you can see, we have constructed black tinted, see-through solar panels above the porch.”  The team also worked to create something that was both Moroccan and unique. “We anticipated that other teams would go for a typical Moroccan riyad as well, so we approached it with an ‘interactive’ angle. Depending on the weather you can adjust the rotating beams that serve as the roof to heart’s content, by the mere flick of your finger,” explained Blonsky. Many team members feel confident that solar homes will be part and parcel of Moroccan society within the coming decades, but Romani Zaid, a professor at Tetouan’s National School of Architecture (ENA), expresses doubts.  “Though these houses are built with extraordinary passion and dedication by all the team members, we must not forget that there remains a big gap between the government and the industry in Morocco.”  It may be some time before solar homes will enrich Moroccan society, but trying to close the gap is part of the solar decathlon’s mission. While the solar village features the houses built by teams from all across the world, the congress hall provides team researchers with a platform to explain the progress they have made during the two-year design period.  Though solar homes may still be part of a utopian future, Zaid thinks solar energy in general has a viable chance for success.  “Naturally the enormous solar plant that was built by the government near Ouarzazate remains a formidable example, but there are other bottom-up projects throughout the country as well. Due to the rising levels of air pollution, Marrakech initiated a solar bike project to encourage people to leave their polluting scooters at home and take the solar bike as a sustainable alternative.”  “But,” he concluded, “whether Morocco will embrace solar homes indefinitely is up to the Moroccan people, industry, and government.”

Rabat – The former US President Bill Clinton and his wife, former presidential candidate Hilary Clinton, continue to make the most of their visit to Marrakech for the birthday of Moroccan billionaire Marc Lasry. This morning, the influential couple visited a traditional weaving cooperative. While there, they enjoyed a traditional Moroccan breakfast of msemen (Moroccan pancakes), black olives, and Morocco’s iconic mint tea. Just a few days ago, on September 20, the couple strolled through Marrakech’s iconic Jemaa El-Fna square, a staple for all visitors to the ochre city. They posed with a snake and later looked at traditional Moroccan wares in the souk. Larsy hosted the bash the Clintons attended at Marrakech’s most luxurious hotel, La Mamounia. The Clintons also attended Lasry’s wedding in 2017, among a host of other celebrities. More than 300 respected figures in finance and politics from across the world are estimated to have attended Larsy’s party. According to Moroccan outlet Les Eco, Marrakech’s security officials organized a meeting to decide how to best prepare for the event. Marc Lasry was born in Marrakech on September 30, 1959. At the age of 7, his family immigrated to the US where Lasry later rose to success. Lasry made his fortune as a pension and hedge fund manager. He is the CEO of Avenue Capital Group and co-owner of Michigan professional basketball team the Milwaukee Bucks.

Rabat – The High Representative of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAO), Miguel Angel Moratinos, is full of gratitude to Morocco for hosting the Global Summit of the 2020 Alliance of Civilizations.  The former Spanish foreign minister held talks with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Sunday, September 22  in New York on the sidelines of the UN Climate summit. “ I am grateful to the King [Mohammed VI] and Morocco for the confidence they have placed in the Alliance of Civilizations to hold this summit in the kingdom next year,” Moratinos told the press after his meeting with Bourita. Initiated in 2005, the UN Alliance of Civilizations seeks to promote intercultural relations across the world. Moratinos said that the major summit will not only focus on relations between the countries of the Arab and Muslim World and the West but “also Africa and Latin America.” The UN representative also said that his talks with Bourita touched on “Morocco’s excellent relations with the Alliance.” “We are working on all issues, including the prevention, mediation, and the fight against terrorism,” he said. This is not Moratinos’s first positive comment on Morocco’s role in promoting interfaith dialogue and intercultural connections.  Amid Pope Francis’s visit to Morocco in late March, the Spanish diplomat lauded Morocco’s efforts in fighting against religious intolerance. The comment comes after the visit of Pope Francis o Morocco at the end of the month of March. Moratinos described the trip as “historic” and a reflection of Morocco’s King’s commitment to interfaith dialogue and the peaceful cohabitation of different religions. “This visit is also part of the will of two great personalities, His Holiness Pope Francis and His Majesty King Mohammed VI, who both have a roadmap to show that belonging to a religion and to a culture should not be an obstacle, but on the contrary, an element of mutual understanding and respect for each other’s part,” Moratinos said.

Rabat – My college semester living with a Moroccan host family taught me much that I would have never learned otherwise.  It taught me how to bond with people despite a language barrier, how to communicate with only facial expressions and awkward noises, how to live out of a suitcase, and above all, how to leave my comfort zone—and embrace being uncomfortable.     These are all fairly cliché, of course, as are most study abroad life-lessons.  The most important thing I learned from my host family, though, was not how to break down cultural barriers and unearth our innate similarities as humans. Rather, the most valuable lesson I gained from my host family was how profoundly different we are; not only in terms of religion or values, but in terms of environmental sustainability—as obscure as that may sound.  I had always considered myself to be environmentally conscious. But after just one day with my host family, I became acutely aware of how much trash I was producing on a daily basis as an individual—and how little they produced as an entire family unit.   So little, in fact, that they didn’t even have a regular trash can. They had a single small bucket, about the size of a garbage bin you’d find in a private restroom, for food waste and the occasional plastic wrapper or scrap of paper.  Meanwhile, I was hoarding used makeup remover wipes, tissues, cotton balls, Q-tips, plastic dental floss picks, feminine hygiene products, and the plastic cases of my single-use contact lenses in my backpack until I could throw them away at school.  This personal inconvenience catalyzed a slew of observations of what I believe to be the everyday sustainable practices and customs of Moroccans that are overshadowed by the country’s poor waste management system. An eco-friendly way of life Living with my host family inspired me to rethink my water usage. After my host mom told me that each member of my host family only bathes once a week, I was not comfortable showering regularly at the apartment. She made it clear that I could shower however often I needed, but I simply did not want to disproportionately use up the family’s resources.  I showered at the apartment once a week and went to the hammam, or public bath, two or three times a week. As someone who used to take long showers every day in the US, sometimes multiple times a day, this new bathing schedule made a noticeable change in my water consumption.  I did not learn to appreciate the ingenuity of the Turkish toilet until very recently, when I went to Sefrou to visit my Moroccan husband’s aunts. The western toilet at their house was broken, and I had to manually fill the basin every time I wanted to flush. I was appalled when I realized exactly how much water is needed to flush a western toilet, and how comparatively little is needed to flush a Turkish toilet.  The souk is another site of Moroccan sustainability.  Although plastic has unfortunately become more common among vendors, most shoppers seem to prefer their large and sturdy reusable bags. Shopping in the souk also means buying fresh and unpackaged fruits, vegetables, and meats. Even grains and spices are not standarly packaged.  Souk shopping, while not completely environmentally friendly, ultimately reduces the need for plastic bags and food packaging that would end up in landfills or at local dumping grounds. The souk is also home to an unofficial recycling system. Plastic water bottles and jugs are repurposed to store and sell household cleaners, soap, oil, juice, honey, milk, and sauces. Discarded papers end up in hanouts where they are used to package small servings of nuts, dried fruits, candies, and spices.  Unwanted kitchen appliances, clothes, shoes, accessories, home decor, and electronics are collected and resold in Moroccan markets. You can find almost anything in the souk, and many of these goods are passed from owner to owner until they are no longer usable.  These systems are in place all over Morocco. No matter how small scale they may be, they make an impact and deserve to be spotlighted.  Perceptions of Morocco’s pollution While many Moroccans unknowingly engage in recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices, the country’s official waste management system leaves much to be desired.  I won’t sugarcoat it: There’s trash everywhere.  This presents a constant burden to locals, and it’s also unsurprisingly one of the first things Western tourists notice upon arriving in the country.  Travel blogger Allane Milliane pulls no punches when describing Morocco: “It’s dirty and lacks hygiene,” she says.  “Papers, plastic, dead rats and pieces of dead animals such as chicken heads, flies everywhere, feces (both human and animal), and trash, lots of trash, I mean plastic bags filled with trash just sitting in the middle of the streets,” she writes of the sights to behold in Marrakech and Chefchaouen. “On the road you will see trash everywhere, even in the desert and near beautiful waterfalls, to my disappointment,” she says of the Moroccan countryside.  “Can you blame it on the lack of education of the locals because Morocco is a poor country? Probably yes, but it’s hard to understand that the same locals that rely on tourism so much, are so careless with the environment. It’s simply sad.” While the same observations can be made of great cities in the West (looking at you, NYC), Milliane makes a logical but shallow argument.  Of course many Moroccans are careless with their waste, and it’s easy to blame this behavior on poverty and ignorance. But when you no longer have the perspective of an outsider, things become abundantly clear. It’s simple, actually. While it’s true that the general Moroccan public is not educated about proper waste management, trash piles up in public spaces because there are very few ways to appropriately dispose of garbage.  Public disposal sites: Few and far between You can scold a Moroccan child for mindlessly dropping his candy wrapper on the ground, but you’d be hard-pressed to find a suitable public garbage bin where he can properly dispose of his trash.  I will be the first to admit that I once judged my Moroccan neighbors for polluting the lush gardens of my apartment complex just outside of Rabat. But I quickly realized that comparing the sanitary standards of my small American hometown to those of my new urban dwelling was unproductive.      Picture a typical suburban American neighborhood. It’s trash night, and each household has put their two 96-gallon bins—one for recycling, one for the landfill—at the curb.  By 9AM the following morning, the bins will be empty, their contents whisked away to the proper sorting and disposal facilities; or, more likely, shipped off to the developing world to become someone else’s problem. Out of sight, out of mind.  Single-household recycling and garbage bins in the US state of Pennsylvania. These are emptied once a week by a private waste disposal company.   Now imagine an old Moroccan medina. Have you ever seen two 96-gallon garbage bins perched beside any of those gorgeous residential doors, waiting to be emptied to make room for next week’s waste?  No, you haven’t.  What about outside the medinas, in the newer neighborhoods composed primarily of apartment buildings? Does each household have those 96-gallon garbage bins? Well, of course not! They live in apartments! Surely each complex has a communal dumpster! Wrong again.    Apartment complexes do not have their own dumpsters, but most neighborhoods do. However, these dumpsters are pitiful, to say the least. They’re small, constantly overflowing, foul-smelling, and horrible to look at.   The worst thing about these dumpsters is that they are often inaccessible to most residents of any given neighborhood, especially in lower-income areas. Usually you can only find them every few blocks, and sometimes not at all.  Who wants to go on a ten minute walk just to take the trash out? Especially when the dumpster is probably full and you’ll just end up emptying your trash onto the ground next to it? Not me. A more practical option for some, it seems, is to dump household waste wherever there’s space, even if this means polluting the area around one’s own residence. Some might assume that the trash will be collected eventually. This is true in some places, like medinas and busy neighborhoods. Most of the time, though, the garbage is left to fester.     According to the World Bank’s latest analysis of trends in solid waste management, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), as a region, produces the least of the world’s waste at just 6%. More than half of this waste is organic matter.  However, the problem with Morocco, like most lower-income countries, lies in its dumping methods.  While middle- and high-income countries dump most of their waste in landfills, the lower-income MENA countries dump more than half of their waste out in the open.  Unfortunately, this is why Morocco’s everyday sustainability goes largely unnoticed. The public trash problem is only exacerbated by careless individual behavior, which earns Morocco a pretty nasty reputation.      Morocco: Greener than meets the eye I’m well aware that some (or perhaps many) of the aforementioned eco-friendly practices are simply features of poverty and economic underdevelopment. I’m also aware that the lifestyle I’ve described doesn’t apply to every single Moroccan.  However, since moving to Morocco, I’ve noticed a drastic change in my own water, gas, and electricity consumption; waste production; and use of plastic. This has not transpired through conscious choice but rather by adjusting to a stark change in lifestyle.   I now rely entirely on walking or public transportation to get around.  I shower once every other day rather than twice a day, and I only turn on the water heater when completely necessary.  I’m more careful about turning lights off and unplugging electronics.  I hang worn clothes in the sun to eliminate odor and bacteria rather than washing them after each use, and I dry my laundry in the window instead of using a machine.  I no longer drink beverages from paper or plastic cups. Instead, I enjoy coffee and juice in glasses even when I’m on the go.   Most of my food comes fresh from the souk, where I’ve also bought a used iPhone, clothes, home decor, and kitchen appliances.  I now have a four-gallon trash can in my kitchen, which my husband empties two or three times a week. My bathroom trash can is half the size, and gets emptied once every two weeks.  This means that my husband and I produce less than 15 gallons of household waste—most of it organic—every week.  At my college apartment in upstate New York, my roommate and I produced more than 15 gallons of waste—most of it paper or plastic—every two days.  My new Moroccan lifestyle is certainly not perfectly green, but it is a vast improvement from my wasteful habits at college and at my home in the Pennsylvanian suburbs.  However, Moroccans still have a long way to go in terms of individual sustainability. Moroccan households used about 25 billion plastic bags in 2016, making the kingdom the second largest consumer of plastic bags in the world. And although the Zero Mika initiative has been working to rid Morocco of plastic bags, the kingdom still has a visible trash problem.  Despite this, I don’t believe that the country’s littered streets and waterways accurately reflect the everyday sustainability that I’ve seen and experienced while living here. There is more to Morocco’s trash problem than meets the eye. We should reserve our judgement for the structural flaws in the country’s waste management, learn to appreciate the small-scale sustainability, and support the initiatives that will create a cleaner Morocco.

Rabat – Education Minister Said Amzazi announced, at a press conference held on September 20, that a teacher was suspended and will appear before a Disciplinary Committee.  The teacher had posted a video depicting the deplorable state of a public school in Sidi Kacem (31 kilometers east of Rabat).  The teacher posted the video, widely shared on social networks, to urge officials to take action against the derelict infrastructure at her school and Morocco’s crumbling public education in general. While several Internet users admired the teacher’s move, the Minister of Education, Said Amzazi considered the teacher’s behavior “inappropriate”.  Amzazi argued that the teacher’s actions only seek to tarnish the image of the ministry and its efforts to improve the country’s school infrastructure. The minister explained that the school in the video has undergone a number of renovation works recently.  Amzazi also denied the authenticity of several photos and videos shared on social networks and showing the state of a number of squalid schools in the kingdom. He said the pictures and videos were “unfounded” and shot in another country. Several Moroccan teachers expressed solidarity with their colleague. Internet users launched a campaign under the slogan, “Sharing the truth is not a crime.” Others are also planning a sit-in.

Rabat – British travel company Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest tourism operator, shut down all its operations Monday, September 23. The shutdown follows a failed plea for private investors to provide $250 million to save it from collapse. We are sorry to announce that Thomas Cook has ceased trading with immediate effect. This account will not be monitored. Please visit https://t.co/WWiKkzLYQJ for further advice and information.#ThomasCook pic.twitter.com/Nf1X3jn97x — Thomas Cook (@ThomasCookUK) September 23, 2019  The 178-year-old company announced the shutdown in a statement today. “This marks a deeply sad day for the company which pioneered package holidays and made travel possible for millions of people around the world,” said the statement. “Despite considerable efforts, those discussions have not resulted in an agreement between the company’s stakeholders and proposed new money providers,” the statement continued, referencing its plea to investors. “The company’s board has therefore concluded that it had no choice but to take steps to enter into compulsory liquidation with immediate effect.” The collapse of the company comes due to fierce competition from competitively priced travel websites, resulting in a loss of £1.5 billion in the first half of 2019. An estimated 22,000 people will lose their jobs, only 9,000 of whom are British. The shutdown will disrupt flights and services for tens of thousands of tourists, leading the UK to launch its biggest repatriation effort since World War II to bring back stranded passengers. The government has hired planes to fly home an estimated 150,000 tourists back to the UK, in an operation starting today codenamed “Operation Matterhorn.” The operation will involve planes chartered from other airlines including British Airways and EasyJet. #RIPThomasCook Nobody: Thomas Cook passengers: pic.twitter.com/Bpy3TcmaHe — ♥ Joe Tasker ♥ (@libbyxbarham) September 23, 2019  The operation will cost the UK government $746 million. Many commentators on social media have pointed out that the cost is significantly more than the $250 million it would have cost to bail the tourism group out and prevent its collapse. The effects of the shutdown will spread far beyond just the UK and instantly caused a ripple of worry throughout North Africa, as Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt are among Thomas Cook’s top travel destinations. The UK government will be repatriating the tourists currently in Morocco from September 25 to October 5 in a 4-part process. British tourists in Morocco aside, the shutdown will also affect Morocco’s tourism industry and businesses. Moroccan tourism authorities have already created a crisis unit to manage the negative effects of the shutdown. The shutdown also leaves dozens of hotels with unpaid bills from Thomas Cook. Experts in the industry told Le Matin an estimate 60-80 hotels will be affected, most of them in Marrakech and Agadir. The crisis team comprises representatives from Morocco’s Ministry of Tourism, the hotel industry, travel agents, and Morocco’s National Office of Tourism. The goal is to work closely with British authorities to monitor and supervise the repatriation of Thomas Cook customers back to the UK. The crisis unit immediately held a meeting, chaired by Abdellatif Kabbaj, president of the National Confederation of Tourism and also CEO of the Kenzi Hotels Group. In Tunisia, where Thomas Cook was sending 150,000 tourists annually, the hotel industry is expecting a loss of €60 million. However, in comparison, Morocco was receiving only 70,000 tourists annually, and Kabbaj reassured the industry that the loss will be far less in Morocco, although he did not give an exact number.

Rabat – The University of Bordeaux (France) has returned 20 archaeological objects to Morocco’s National Institute of Archaeological Sciences and Heritage (INSAP). The objects are human bones dating back to prehistory. The remains were discovered in the archaeological site of Rouazi cemetery, in Skhirat (26 km south of Rabat), according to a press release from the Ministry of Culture and Communication. The human bones were transferred to PACEA laboratory, at the University of Bordeaux for an in-depth study to determine their age and restore them. The ministry also announced a partnership to be signed between France and Morocco in the domain of prehistoric archaeology. The signature is set to be on Thursday, September 26, at the INSAP. The returned objects will help create a reference base at the INSAP for students and researchers who are interested in studying prehistoric Morocco. As part of these efforts to make archaeology more accessible, the ministry also announced the opening of a prehistoric park in Casablanca in the coming weeks. The archaeological site of Rouazi, where the returned bones were found, was discovered in 1979. It contains the most consistent collection of objects from the Neolithic era in Morocco.

Rabat – The case of Hajar Raissouni is starting to take larger dimensions. In an unprecedented act in Morocco, Moroccan female writers and activists Leila Slimani and Sonia Terrab published a manifesto today, September 23. The text stands in solidarity with Raissouni, while also criticizing Morocco’s penalizing out of wedlock sexual relations and abortion. The publication aims not only to defend journalist Hajar Raissouni, arrested for having premarital sexual relations and abortion, but also to defend individual freedoms in Morocco on a larger scale. The manifesto is directed against Article 490 of the Penal Code. The article stipulates that “… persons from opposite gender who are not legally married and have sexual relations, are punishable by one month to one year in prison.” At the moment of writing, the manifesto has been signed by 490 Moroccans, mostly public intellectuals and women’s rights advocates, who agreed to publicly declare that they are “outlaws,” and will remain “outlaws, until the law changes.” About three quarters of the signatories are women.

#khara3lal9anoun #moroccanoutlaws pic.twitter.com/paZvBIwVPQ — Sonia Terrab (@SoniaTerrab) September 23, 2019 “We are violating unfair and obsolete laws. We are having sex out of wedlock. We are suffering, enabling or being complicit of abortion. We learned to deal with it and pretend. But for how long?” reads the starting paragraph of the text. Statistics are also presented in bold in the manifesto. Last year, 2018, more than 14.500 people were prosecuted under Article 490. More than 3.000 people were imprisoned for adultery. “Every day, between 600 and 800 unsafe abortions are carried out.” The text concludes with questions aimed at sparking outrage among Moroccans, urging them to fight for individual freedom and bring about a political, social environment that ensures “progress in human development.” “How can we promote the fulfillment of our youth, how can we illuminate the right involvement of women in our society, how can we truly engage our country towards progress in human development, if our individual freedoms are not respected, if our dignity is knocked down, if we all remain nothing but outlaws?” Hajar Raissouni, the journalist whose case sparked this unprecedented act of public solidarity, works for Akhbar Al Yaoum, an Arabic news outlet. She was arrested on Saturday, August 31, on her way out of a doctor’s office and she is facing illegal abortion and premarital sex charges. Police also arrested her fiance, the doctor, and his two aides for illegal abortion. All the defendants remain in custody and are awaiting their trial. The trial is planned for today, September 23, after a previous deferral.

Rabat – Morocco’s Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan attended the King Mohammed VI Grand Prix on Sunday, September 22, and presented medals to the winners of the show jumping competition. The 20 competitions of the Grand Prix began Friday, September 20, and took place at the Temara Royal Cavalry School, according to state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The equestrian competition, which includes races for cadets, juniors, seniors, and amateurs, was the third King Mohammed VI Grand Prix. Equestrian Ghali Boukaa won the final show jumping competition for seniors on the horse Ugolino Du Clos. His time was 46.95 seconds. Boukaa also won the show last year, on the horse “Cool Running.” Moulay El Hassan awarded Boukaa the gold medal, MAP reported, and presented medals to the four runners up: Vincent Zacharias Bourguignon, Abdelkebir Ouaddar, Hicham Er-Radi, and Colonel Zacaria Boubouh. Before presenting the medals, the 16-year-old Moroccan royal reviewed a section of the Royal Guard. Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch, Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami, and the brigadier general inspector of the cavalry greeted Moulay El Hassan at his arrival. Earlier this month, the prince visited New York with his mother, Princess Lalla Salma, and 12-year-old sister, Princess Lalla Khadija. Moulay El Hassan often participates in official ceremonies as part of his royal duties: Welcoming dignitaries and foreign royalty; attending his father’s principal annual speeches, and occasionally presiding over events by himself, as he did at the Grand Prix.

Rabat – The 12th Fez Festival of Sufi Culture will take place from October 19 to 26, 2019. The Fez Festival of Sufi Culture aims to honor all things Sufi and “to make Moroccans discover or rediscover a culture that is theirs and offer them access to this artistic, intellectual and spiritual wealth.” Sufism is a mystical Islamic belief and practice in which Muslims seek to find the truth of divine love and knowledge through direct personal experience of God. The festival, which has been held under the patronage of King Mohammed VI since its first appearance in 2007, will follow the theme “Sufi culture, a spiritual humanism for our time” this year. The combination of spiritualism and humanism, a movement typically associated with Western atheism may seem strange to some, a statement from the festival points out. However, Faouzi Skali, the president of the festival, believes that “the unforeseen relationship between the two can indeed be fruitful at a time when religions also know the excesses of a desiccating formalism that comes to deny the most obvious values ​​of our humanity.” “It is the conjunction between these two dimensions that we would like to address during the festival through the culture of Sufism,” said Skali. As well as having a particularly interesting theme this year, the festival is offering a jam-packed program this October. The first day of the festival, Saturday, October 19, will kick off with a conference and the official opening ceremony at the Salle de Prefecture in the Fez medina. Following that is performances from a variety of international singers: French-Moroccan Francoise Atlan, Spanish flamenco singer Curro Pinana, Moroccan singer Marouane Hajji, and the Moroccan ensemble Al Shushtari. Moroccan Sufi singer Mostafa Amri will finish off the night. Day 2, Sunday, October 20, promises plenty of intellectual stimulation to get the brain going. The day will start early with a roundtable discussion of this year’s theme at the Merdesa Bouananiya. Afterwards will be a private showing and meet and greet with artist Sami-Ali and then a musical and poetic performance from Amal Ayouch. Sami-Ali will then be present at another roundtable. Organizers have not yet determined the location of both the private show and roundtable. Monday, October 21, promises yet more treats for anyone interested in Sufi culture. The day will start with a roundtable discussing how Sufi culture can revive the spirit of Fez, often referred to as Morocco’s cultural and spiritual capital. Later that afternoon, another roundtable will cover an equally fascinating topic: Societal and spiritual challenges in the face of transhumanism. Both roundtables will again be at the Bouananiya Medersa. The day will end on a musical note, with a performance from Moroccan Sufi singer Tariqa Sharqawiya at Fez’s famous Jnan Sbil Park. The next day, Tuesday, October 22, will begin with a roundtable on “the practice of
non-violence in daily life.” Following that will be a tour of Fez’s historical sites, in order to learn about the city’s great spiritual history. The day will end with a performance from Sufi singer Tariqa Rissouniya at Jnan Sbil Park. Day 5 of the festival, Wednesday, October 23, will kick off with another roundtable, this time on the relation between Islam and human rights. That evening, attendees will experience a poetic and musical Azzedine concert at the Glaoui Palace. The next day, Thursday, October 24, will begin with a roundtable on the spiritual interpretation of the Qur’an according to Ibn Ajiba. A musical performance will follow from Leili Anvar and Farzaneh Joorabchi at the French Institute, who will be debuting their act “The Tales of the Persian Sages.” Following that will be a performance from Tariqa Sqalliya and Tariqa Halvetiya Ussakiya at Jnan Sbil Park. Day 7 of the festival, Friday, October 25, promises an especially packed program. The day will begin with a roundtable on the subject of prayer, followed by a conference from Leili Anvar on “The musk of secrets: perfume and desire in Persian poetry.” After that will be a master class and workshop with master perfumer Abderezzak Benchaabane, location yet to be determined, and a performance from Tariqa Wazzaniya at Jnan Sbil Park. The eighth and final day of the festival, Saturday, October 26, will be equally packed full of enticing events. The day will begin with a particularly important roundtable, discussing the creation of a platform for Sufi culture. Then, that evening, the festival will finish with a bang with a well-crafted closing ceremony. The ceremony will focus on “The Secret Language of Flowers and Perfumes,” with performances from Moroccan singer Fatima-Zohra Qortobi, Iranian singer Farzaneh Joorabchi, and Turkish singer Ferhat Oguz Korc. A full pass to the eclectic festival is available for purchase online for MAD 1,000. Other ticket options are available if you only wish to attend specific events.

Rabat – The Spanish Ministry of Interior has decorated the head of Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), Abdellatif Hammouchi. On Monday, September 23  the Spanish official gazette announced that Royal Decree 549/2019 of September 20 granted the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Civil Guard to Hammouchi. Hammmouchi is one of the leading figures in Morocco’s security system. The head of DGSN and DGST positioned himself as one of the masterminds of Morocco’s successful anti-terrorism mechanism. He has been largely credited with the effectiveness of Morocco’s security apparatus, and the Order of Merit recognition from Spain is the latest in a long series of international validations the Moroccan officer has received in recent years.  A solid reputation Earlier this year, pan-African magazine Jeune Afrique joined several international publications in extolling the role of Hammouchi’s strong reputation for Morocco’s security stability. The magazine listed Hammouchi among “Africa’s most influential personalities in 2019.” Hammouchi and the names on the list, according to Jeune Afrique are “people who are impacting public opinion, and are capable of inspiring and inciting us to imitate them.” Jeune Afrique added that his African and European colleagues lauded his wok on counter-terrorism and other aspects of Morocco’s domestic security. The African newspaper also referred to Hammouchi as the nightmare of terrorists. Jeune Afrique is one of several other international outlets that have praised Hammouchi’s leadership in the security system. Last year in July, Italian newspaper II Post  described Hammouchi as the “super agent who never sleeps.” The Italian paper described Hammouchi as “powerful, respected, and controversial.” He is almost like “a movie character,” it added. In 2018, Spanish news outlet El Pais also paid tribute to Hammouchi’s “contributions to maintaining national security” in Morocco. The Spanish official gazette also shared royal decree 550/2019 stipulating that the Commander in Chief of Morocco’s Royal Gendarmerie, Mohammed Haramou, also received the Order of Merit of the Civil Guard. King Mohammed VI appointed Haramou as the head of Morocco’s Royal Gendarmerie in December 2017.

Rabat – After obtaining their high school baccalaureate and making their way through a long process, Moroccan students may feel finally successful after finding a place at universities considered “prestigious.” But unfortunately, the first day in their “dream university” can often be a roller-coaster of shock, humiliation, fear, anger, and even regret when they experience university hazing. The first day in some Moroccan universities is usually the day when older students haze new students. Older students intimidate the newcomers and make them feel tiny and vulnerable in many ways. Hazing activities include throwing eggs and/or flour at them; drawing on their faces and bodies; forcing them to participate in humiliating challenges, games, and activities that often require physical effort, like running while blindfolded. Hazing can even go further into assaulting, beating, or isolating a person. Hazing, or “bizutage” as it is called in Morocco, is considered a brutal initiation ceremony that has passed down through generations since French colonization began in 1912. At first, hazing was a well-known practice in the military, where veterans hazed recruits. Even then, the ritual had deviated from its original meaning. Instead of being a way of initiating, welcoming, and helping recruits to overcome their fears and hesitations by integrating them into the military, it became a practice of terror. Hazing was embedded in our culture a long time ago. The practice started in Greek times, when Plato’s academy school was founded back in 387 B.C. It was called “pennalism,” which is defined as “a system of mild oppression and torment practiced upon first year students” according to Collins Dictionary. An expert in psychoanalysis of Moroccan and Arab society, Dr. Jaouad Mabrouki explained to Morocco World News that this “system” was a stage that a person should go through in order to prove his strength to join certain groups or simply enter adulthood. But Mabrouki added, “Nowadays, a freshman is not forced to show his/her physical strength, as long as succeeding in the baccalaureate exams and being eligible to join that university is a solid proof of his/her strength and engagement.” But since mental strength is not taken into account by senior students, many Moroccan students have been victims of hazing. The practice has gone viral through universities and campuses, leaving horrifying and unforgettable flash backs. “The reason that had [caused] me to work so hard in my baccalaureate was actually in order to join a prestigious school, but unfortunately from day one I was so shocked and saw my dreams getting crushed in a glance,” said Imane, who is 23 years old. “I remember like if it was yesterday how a bunch of students throw eggs on me, to the point that a student actually slapped me while doing so. Also, I was isolated in an empty class, and forced to repeat humiliating words with a camera on my face. I felt weak and terrified,” she said angrily. Othman, 22, was another victim of this “intolerable” yet pervasive ritual practice. “Hazing can be a tough thing even for guys. I remember that I was humiliated and forced to take off my T-shirt while students were pouring water on me. I felt so uncomfortable,” he said. What people often do not take into consideration is the fact that this heritage phenomenon can usually impact terribly the well-being and psychological health of freshmen, who are entering a new stage in their life with plenty of hopes and expectations. Moreover, hazing can easily turn students from the same university into enemies, which can even make it a challenge to attend class on a daily basis, due to serious misunderstanding, communication issues, fights, feelings of hate and revenge, and other remaining issues. “I remember how hazing was a very childish event, even for the freshman I was. It was all about controlling and bullying a group of vulnerable scared new students. And these sordid actions made us enemies inside that university even after many years,” said FathAllah, 23. Mabrouki says of this “sordid” behavior, “The older students who often organize humiliating hazings are a product of their past experiences and can usually be suffering from psychological disorders. Also they are doing it as a revenge and to feed and satisfy their sadism in order to bolster their own sense of superiority.” He added “I consider often the hazing as a very dangerous practice, specially when the freshman is being humiliated, which can lead to serious psychiatric disorders. Therefore, these activities and rituals must be managed by the university’s administration to ensure the safety of new students.” Although hazing can be dangerous, many people notice that some of the latest hazing events in Moroccan universities have become less violent and more welcoming. It can even be a “bonding experience.” “After hearing terrible things about the hazing, I was expecting the worst. But it turned [out] to be so amusing, the students were very kind to us, they took us on a tour into our new university, then they put on some music and we started dancing around, they even made it looks (sic) like an Indian Holi festival. It was an experience that I would love for any student to experience,” said Amina, a new freshman. Indeed, hazing can often be a lovely experience when the student community is conscientious about its huge responsibility and impact on not only the well-being and psychological health of new students but also their interaction, coexistence, and even educational performance. Still, enforcing public policies to ensure a safe and respectful hazing is a must, in order to prevent any future humiliating hazing events that will leave horrifying and lasting flashbacks.

Rabat – When I was 16, a middle-aged man stopped me on a street corner, ostensibly asking for directions. It soon became clear that he had no interest in finding the nearest metro station. Calling me “beautiful,” he asked for my phone number, and when I refused, he literally chased me to the restaurant where I was meeting friends. At 18, I was groped by a stranger outside a nightclub, and at 23 verbally and physically harassed by a colleague in the school I worked at. At 26, a riot policeman grabbed my breasts and called me a w***e during a stop and search. And at 27 I was chased through a market by a stranger wanting to “talk.” I am not alone. According to Globalissues.org, 75% of women globally have experienced sexual harassment. It is a serious issue, not to be taken lightly, and it is a global one. The first incident took place in Madrid, the second two in London, the third in France, and the most recent in Casablanca. Have these incidents led me to believe that all Spanish, English, French, and Moroccan men are perverts? No, because that would be a gross generalization, and it would be xenophobic. You can imagine my surprise, then, when I heard a comedian in my favorite podcast saying that all Moroccan “men are so disgusting that even insects won’t land on them” and that a visit to Morocco was like a trip to “the patriarchy.” Sara Pascoe, a well known intersectional feminist comedian, told listeners of the Guilty Feminist that she could not sleep in her hotel in Morocco because she “was terrified one of these men was going to break into [her] room and murder” her. After my initial shock at hearing such statements on a podcast I have always enjoyed for its famously politically correct, intersectional stance, I discovered that Pascoe regularly uses this skit. On BBC Radio 4, she even referred to Moroccans as “hungry hippos.” So why would a comedian, known for her liberal and politically correct attitudes think it was acceptable to generalize about an entire population based on one brief experience? Pascoe recounted her experience on holiday in Morocco, where, she said, as a solo female traveler, she was harassed on the street, leaving her in tears. Now, this does sound like a truly unpleasant experience, and I do not mean to belittle it in any way. I just question whether this one experience can be used as a basis for a judgment on an entire nation. Statistics from Globalissues.org show that 60-69% of women in the UK, the US, and Morocco have experienced sexual harassment. The number for France is higher, at 70-79%, and in Spain, 50-59% have been harassed. The #Metoo movement also proves that this is a global issue. Sara Pascoe is not alone in her strange, and aberrational, statements about Morocco. For example, my sister recently proposed a girls trip to Morocco, but her friends rejected the idea out of hand. They, like comedian Pascoe, had decided that, because they are Western women, the Moroccan men would not leave them alone. Trawling through Trip Advisor and the Lonely Planet, I found countless posts about sexual harassment from “disgusting” Moroccan men. Personally I do not find that harassment in Morocco is much worse than in any other country. I did, however, experience some harassment in Casablanca but was always defended by male bystanders. To be fair, I also know plenty of Moroccan men who insects would be pleased to land on and who are extremely respectful to women. Wanting to get more perspective on the matter, I asked some of my female friends who have visited me here whether they thought harassment was particularly bad for tourists in Morocco. The responses were mixed, but Marakech got a very bad press. Anna, 32, a very tall, blond, and extremely English-looking woman, said that she had absolutely no problems in Essaouira and felt entirely safe and relaxed. However, she recounted her experience of being “hissed at” and asked “Why don’t you want to be my girlfriend?” while looking for a pharmacy in Marrakech. She added that it was “irritating” rather than “intimidating.” Anna’s unpleasant experience in Marrakech happened before I moved to Morocco, and it did not stop her from visiting again. She understood that one experience in one city does not define an entire nation. Meanwhile, Kerry, 29, from Edinburgh, who freely admits that she stands out as a “very tall, pale British woman in western dress,” said that she never felt “unsafe or threatened.” She said that sometimes she was looked at but did not think it was “creepy.” People just seemed “curious.” Kerry added, though, that she had expected to be harassed. “I’ve heard bad stories about Marrakech from other European travelers.” However, having heard these reports, she came with an open mind. She has visited Morocco twice and is planning a third trip this coming spring. Thomasin, 30, had an entirely positive experience. She said, “Essaouira is one of my favorite cities I have visited as a tourist, I felt really safe because there were a lot of women in the streets.” I asked her about the markets, which are supposedly “notorious” for harassment. “The salespeople left me alone and didn’t badger me and I didn’t feel stared at like I have in some European countries. Obviously I’m always wary as a traveler, but I loved Morocco. Wasn’t sure about the hammam though.” Thomasin added she had felt harassed in Rome, to the point that she did not enjoy it. “Tourist heavy cities are often a different kettle of fish than other places in the same country, and you can’t really make judgments about a place based on that.” A UK government report published in 2018 states: “Sexual harassment pervades the lives of women and girls and is deeply ingrained in our culture.” The report goes on to say that sexual harassment in the UK is “a routine and sometimes relentless experience for women and girls, many of whom first experience it at a young age.” I have never heard or seen advice not to visit the UK because of sexual harassment. Stop Street Harassment, a US NGO, released a report in 2017 which states that 81% of women in the US have been sexually harassed in some form. Have you ever been told not to visit the US because of sexual harassment? Statistics from Morocco’s National Observatory show that 73% of women in Morocco have experienced sexual harassment in public spaces. There is no denying that it is a high number, but it is no higher than the percentages in the UK, or the US. But apparently, even for liberal, politically-correct minded people, this means that all Moroccan men, in all Moroccan cities, are disrespectful, sexually aggressive, and “disgusting.” Everyone’s experience is different and valid, but it does not give anyone the right to generalize about an entire male population. While sexual harassment in any form is a serious global issue, and one Morocco desperately needs to address, I cannot help but feel that there is a certain level of unconscious racism in the generalizations circulating about Moroccan men. I am also surprised and disappointed that people like Pascoe, who pride themselves on their intersectionality and liberal views, cannot seem to see the double standard.

Rabat – The 2019 Social Progress Index has ranked Morocco 82 in a list of 149 countries with a score of 66.04.  The index shows Morocco slipping seven spots from 76 to 82nd, a notable change within a year mainly due to low scores in “access to advanced education” and “inclusiveness.” Morocco’s scorecard in the index 11 red dots, which represents the country’s performances in some measurement. The index listed Morocco in a low position in “the adult literacy rate” indicator with a  69.43 score. Morocco also scored low in access to quality education with a score of only 1.47. Other indicators in which Morocco scored low include freedom of religion with a score of 1.44, and political rights with a score of 14. Indicators such as “environmental quality” and  “inclusiveness” also show low scores for Morocco. With regards to Morocco’s approach with sexual orientation,  the index shows Morocco getting a score of 7.21 in the “acceptance of gays and lesbians.” Morocco also received a score of 1.47  in terms of “equality of political power by socioeconomic position.” In terms of quality  of education, the report shows that Morocco has a low score of 4.50 in the “women’s average years in school.” Yellow dots, which represents average performance in the examined indicators, are dominant in Morocco’s scorecard. Morocco has an average performance in undernourishment. It scored  3.90 in that category and 133.52 in maternal mortality. The country’s scores are average in almost all indicators, except for personal safety, homicide rate, corruption, and quality of electricity, as well as for access to electricity, in which it either performs comparatively well or slightly over-performs. Recent efforts and prospects Morocco ranked 76 in the 2018 Social Progress Index. The relatively bleak assessment suggests that, while political reforms efforts have been made, there is still a long way to go for Morocco to come to terms with its persisting social crisis. Recently, the government has vowed to end social disparities. In most of his latest speeches, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI consistently identified social disparities as the country’s number one priority. The King has called for the implementation of a new development model. The King acknowledged that the country has made significant progress in several areas, including  rights and freedom, infrastructure, and other sectors.” “We have taken a qualitative leap in terms of infrastructure: highways, high-speed train, big ports, renewable energy, and urban rehabilitation. We have also made significant progress in reinforcing and consolidating rights and freedoms, in giving a healthy and solid footing to our practice of democracy,” he said in his Throne Day speech in July. The King, however, has equally acknowledged that this progress is not enough. “We know that developing infrastructure is not enough, no matter how important that may be,” he said. In recent weeks, the monarch has followed up on his promise to inject new blood into the government. The monarch has insisted that this would entail inclusive decision-making, as well as trust-building with citizens. On September 21, King Mohammed VI received Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to discuss a prospective government reshuffle. During the meeting,  the monarch assessed the progress in the “implementation of the royal guidelines set out in the last state of the nation address.”

Rabat – Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, has said that Africa is growingly and “disproportionately” affected by climate change.   Speaking at a consultative meeting of the Climate Commission for the Sahel region at UN headquarters, Bourita emphasized the continent’s exposure to a number of climate-induced crises mostly caused by actors outside the continent.  “The Sahel region, like the African continent, is unduly and disproportionately affected by the consequences of global warming to which it contributes almost nothing,” he said. The minister noted that the meeting, organized on the eve of the Climate Action Summit, “is an appropriate opportunity to convey our messages to the United Nations and the world.” “Our region is determined to take up its environmental challenges,” said Bourita.  He also added that “the First Africa Action Summit for Continental Co-emergence, held on the margins of COP22, made it possible to enshrine this commitment.” Calling for a responsible and supportive commitment, urging the international community to honor its commitments in terms of helping the Sahel region tackle its growing climate-induced challenges. “If there is one promise to the Sahel today that should finally be honored,” Bourita stressed, “it is to help redress the imbalances caused by climate change.” The minister recalled that international partners expressed, at the First Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Climate Commission for the Sahel Region held in Niamey in February 2019, their commitment to finance the implementation of the Commission’s Regional Priority Programme with a budget of $3.41 billion. “This is an important step that should continue to provide this Commission with full bilateral, regional and international support for the implementation of the Climate Investment Plan (PIC-RS) in its entirety,” he added. Aziz Rabbah, Minister of Energy, also participated in pre-summit activities. The minister attended the Coalition on Energy Transition event organized by Denmark and Ethiopia. A Summit-related press release from the Ministry of Energy emphasized Morocco’s efforts on energy efficiency and other environment-friendly policies. “Morocco has succeeded, as part of its new model of development…to develop an energy model based mainly on the rise of renewable energies and the strengthening of energy efficiency,” said the statement. The ministry also noted that Morocco’s new, energy-efficient model “positions it today among the advanced countries that are really committed to this energy transition.” Several foreign ministers from African countries, as well as representatives of France, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations system, attended the Consultative Meeting of the Climate Commission. The Sahel Region Climate Commission brings together 17 countries from three African subregions: West, Central, and Eastern Africa. It includes, among others, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, and Chad.

Rabat – Judiciary police of Fez and Meknes arrested on Saturday, September 21, a gang of 11 individuals, including eight women. The group is allegedly involved in robbery, sextortion, and robbery with violence, according to a release from Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The criminal group operated in a planified way. One of the arrested women would act as a prostitute letting the victim take her to his apartment. She would then let the rest of the gang in to steal the victim’s possessions, in addition to taking indecent photos of him for extortion. The search operations led the police to find videos and recordings of crimes performed in the same way. The suspects are believed to have operated mostly in the cities of Fez, Meknes, and Casablanca. Some of the arrested members were already subject to national arrest warrants for fraud and physical aggression. Police in Fez and Meknes have launched an investigation to shed further light on the group’s crimes.

Rabat – Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) has announced the release of its latest edition of the best destination for investment in Africa.  The report, “Where to Invest in Africa,” shows how Morocco has emerged as the second most attractive business destination in Africa, outperforming South Africa that dropped one place in the report. Egypt tops the list. The North African country owes its performance to “a progressive increase in the investment from the private sector,” which boosted economic growth, according to How We Made it in Africa.  Part of Morocco’s rapid rise in the rankings it the increased visibility in African affairs. The country’s return to the African Union has allowed it to strengthen its leadership position in the continent. “Morocco’s return to the African Union in January 2017 and the launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) in March 2018 provide Morocco further opportunities to promote foreign investment and trade and accelerate economic development,” the report said. The ranking also showed Morocco displacing South Africa from its second position. Kenya is the fourth in the report followed by Rwanda, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Tunisia, which are among the top ten destinations for investment in Africa. This is not the first report that s emphasized Morocco’s growing importance as a promising investment hub. The  2019 Investment Climate Statements from the US Department of State lauded Morocco’s geographic location for attracting international investors. The report indicates that Morocco attracts the “fifth-most foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa, a figure that increased 23 percent in 2017.” The assessment comes amid efforts by the Moroccan government to diversify the country’s economic activities. The most promising sectors in Morocco are the automotive and aeronautical sectors. The aeronautical sector creates more than 11,000 direct job opportunities, a number that contributes 8.5% to Morocco’s total employment. In July, a South African paper called Morocco “the face of Modern Africa.”  “Where others have deliberated, Morocco has delivered,” argued the paper, as it backed the notion that Morocco is rapidly becoming a go-to destination for investors interested in the African continent.

Rabat – It has been over 100 days since the Polisario arrested three Sahrawi activists in peaceful protests at Rabouni near Tindouf, Algeria. The separatist group arrested Moulay Aba Bouzid, Fadel Braka, and Mahmoud Zidane in June. Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, a former leading member of the Polisario Front posted on Facebook on September 21 that “more than 100 days have passed since our brothers were kidnapped in the camps.” Although Polisario acknowledged it is holding the activists in prison, their fate is still “unknown,” according to Mustafa Salma.  The ex-Polisario member has also experienced detention by Polisario. “Today, nine years have passed since the Polisario Front kidnapped me on September 21, 2010,” Mustafa Salma recalled. Since then, he said, he has been living in exile. The activist also mourned the disappearance of Ahmed El Khalil, a Polisario member who has been missing for almost a decade. Algerian intelligence services along with Polisario members kidnapped El Khalil in 2009, two months after the Polisario had appointed him to monitor human rights in the Tindouf camps. The front claimed that El Khalil is alive after his family and activists put pressure on Polisario to explain where he is. Sahrawis and the family of El Khalil still condemn the disappearance of their relatives. They went to Rabouni, the desert landscape where the secretariat of the Polisario Front is located, to condemn the disappearance. In July, the family of El Khalil decided to stage a sit-in by the high commission of refugees in Rabouni near the Tindouf camps in Algeria.

Muscat – To meet the challenges of climate change, the world must unite to adapt, using diplomacy and technology as tools for change. Climate change became evident a decade ago, despite the doubts of a minority who still do not believe in it. That minority brings to mind the proverb that says, “There is no worse blind man than the one who doesn’t want to see.” More than 97% of the scientific community affirms that climate change is a reality and is dangerously accelerated by human action. Despite the vast scientific evidence, there is still a part of the population that denies climate change, relying on falsities and lies repeated over and over again. Geological records stretching back millions of years indicate a number of large variations in Earth’s climate. These have been caused by many natural factors, including changes in the sun, volcanoes, Earth’s orbit, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. However, research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that it is 90% likely that human activity has caused more recent global warming. Even the UN Security Council has unanimously recognized since 2011 that climate change is a reality and threatens global peace and stability. If we look at the Middle East and North Africa, a shocking number of 14 countries will face extremely high water stress in 2040. Such water stress is exacerbated by climate change. In addition, the dynamic socio-economic development of the region will require more water. In 2017, the World Bank predicted that water scarcity could cost the MENA region a drop of between 6% and 14% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year by 2050. Today, already 800 million people in more than 570 coastal cities worldwide are vulnerable to 0.5 meter of sea level rise by 2050. Given the rate of urbanization, the number of people at risk is expected to rise significantly. Therefore, coastal adaptation and disaster prevention are strongly recommended. On the other hand, the Global Commission on Adaptation’s “Adapt Now” report, launched September 10, is a clear call to action on climate resilience. It recognizes adaptation as critical in combating the impacts of climate change, especially for the most vulnerable in the world. It also recognizes the centrality of water to adaptation by referencing water in every one of the report’s themes. The World Economic Forum’s most recent global risk ranking estimated climate-related risks as the most likely and most impactful events to occur. The environmental risk category has become increasingly prominent since risks related to it started appearing in the top 5 in 2011. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our era. The repercussions for an international foreign policy agenda are substantial: Increasing water scarcity, more flooding, and extreme weather events threaten millions of livelihoods across the world. These circumstances sometimes force people to migrate or trigger violent conflicts as we witnessed in the Middle East in recent years. A stronger role for foreign policy in international climate policy has been called for—namely through climate diplomacy. But how does climate diplomacy actually happen? And how it will continue to shape the international effort to confront the issue far beyond Paris COP21? Technology, like renewable desalination, is a key to achieve successful climate change adaptation, but politics are important as well. Traditional inter-state diplomacy has a role in avoiding the negative social effects of the decarbonizing transition measures, especially in sensitive sectors, such as industry and agriculture. Stronger climate ambition relies on the creation of positive feedback between the real economy, political interests, and diplomacy. We need to mainstream the emergency of climate change into other policy areas. We need companies to move away from carbon-intensive activities and factor climate risks into their supply chains, while embracing the opportunities of low-carbon transformation. To sum up: We need efforts beyond the negotiation process itself, and we need the cooperation of all countries to overcome this challenge. As the former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said so well in 2015, “No country can meet the challenge of climate change alone. Climate change carries no passport; emissions released anywhere contribute to the problem everywhere. It is a threat to lives and livelihoods everywhere. Economic stability and the security of nations are under threat. Only through the United Nations can we respond collectively to this quintessentially global issue.” The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – These are interesting times to be African, so saturated is the air with discourses of “Africa rising,” or “the new scramble for Africa,” or even the ubiquitous public invocation (or shunning) of the “new justice warriors.” Africa, it has been said, will be the center of gravity of world affairs in the next few decades. When pushed on these unending ideological, intellectual interpretations of the “idea of Africa,” Rachid Ennassiri, a young Moroccan climate activist who was recently selected by the Obama Foundation for his inspiring work on climate consciousness and sustainable living, prefers to switch the conversation to safer terrains. As he spoke to Morocco World News on the heels of his participation in the Obama Leaders: Africa initiative, the young Moroccan seemed religiously invested in the idea of Africanness as both a feeling and a passionate interest in the betterment of the continent and its people. But Ennasiri’s preference for the known and tested, at least when discussing certain ideas of what it means to be African today, should not be mistaken as a refusal to engage with the challenges of our times. His, essentially, is a refusal to be distracted by unnecessary distinctions that often end in protracted discussions which cloud understanding more than they explain. So, to the question of “Who is really African?” the young Moroccan prefers that of “What does it mean to be African today?” Or: In these times of unprecedented political upheavals characterized by the unprecedented urgency of the climate crisis, how does Africa relate to the shifting world around? “Today, Africa is the victim of irresponsible behavior from other continents,” Ennassiri says, appearing to echo the established notion that the continent has become the theater of geopolitical and economic battles that benefit the interests of corporations and other third parties with no direct stakes in the outcomes of their “irresponsible behavior” in the continent. The Malian Aminata Traore has called this “raped imaginary,” referring to the overpowering feeling that one’s destiny is controlled by centripetal forces over which one does not have the faintest control. “And so,” Ennassiri continued, “policies and techniques of resilience and adaptability have become crucial.” The slight exaggerations in Ennassiri’s response speak of his activist’s proclivity to spur action. In the young Moroccan’s reckoning, activism comes with a dogged optimism in the future, an almost fanatical faith that, for all the seemingly irreversible odds, change is always a possibility. Fresh from his recent trip to attend the six-day leadership training organized by the Obama Foundation in Johannesburg in mid July, Ennassiri’s rhetoric seems to have taken an African dimension. But his is a subtle, almost globalist pan-Africanism that is more concerned with “the challenges facing us today” than with notions of cultural authenticity so pervasive in Afro-centrist circles. “I remember listening to Kofi Annan’s speech at the 2018 Young Obama Leaders  event. He said that the greatest challenge for our generation is tackling climate change and its devastating impacts on our lives,” Ennassiri said with unexpected gusto, almost delighting in having his profound conviction validated by a world affairs luminary. “The environment is deteriorating at a much faster pace than our current efforts to adapt. We need to find new ways to adapt and urgently rise to the challenges ahead, at the risk of finding ourselves in a complicated, irreversible situation.” At his age, 26, Ennassiri can easily—and understandably—come across as an overachiever. But what he is, or at least what he wants to be seen as, is a passionate lover of life who has understood that so messy is our world today that whatever is left of it calls for salvaging from those who cannot afford to idly stand by, uncritically consuming what the official narrative sells them. Coordinator of a sustainable tourism foundation in Morocco’s High Atlas, founding member of the Moroccan Youth Center for Sustainable Energy based in Morocco’s Ouarzazate Province, the young Moroccan is also the recipient of a series of national and international youth activism prizes. The prizes include, among others, the 2017 Outstanding Young Person in Morocco Award and the 2016 environmental poetry award organized by the International Human Dynamics consortium. But, even as he talked to Morocco World News amid the aura of these prizes, as well as the prestigious validation that comes with being picked among the anointed few to crowd the 200 spots annually offered by the Obama Foundation for young African leaders, Ennassiri spoke entirely from a place of an activist’s humility. For him, activism supposes an elemental undertaking that we are never the center of gravity of the causes we espouse, even when we are the central actors. That is, the very essence of our singular lives goes beyond the confines and needs of the self. You can imagine Ennassiri approvingly smiling along as Greta Thunberg recently told members of the American Congress that she and her peers are not in this fight for attention or some delusion of grandeur about being more, or as important, as the cause one claims to defend. On a very practical level, Ennassiri’s participation in the Obama Foundation-organized event has added new layers to his commitment to issues of climate and youth, from broadening his notion of community to enlarging his passion for empathy. If anything, spending days in the close proximity of youth from all corners of Africa has positively nuanced his perception of Africa and Africanness. This is most evidenced in his acute fervor for social justice and “collective, regional platforms for action” when speaking of Africa and its place in these tumultuous times of ours. Activists are bound to bond and network, he said. This reflects a certain understanding that effectiveness is more likely to come through “concerted efforts.” But also implied in this tendency towards collective capacity building is the pointed optimism in the transformational energy of human warmth, collaboration. The promise of youth leadership, Ennassiri argued, comes perhaps in the notion, deeply felt among the young leaders he has so far met, that there can only be change when determined kindred spirits agree on laying out new grammars or pathways to impact the thinking of those in the decision-making seat. At heart, activism, at least as the young Moroccan sees it, passes through coming together with people who feel the same pain and urgency on given social topics. The point is at once to raise awareness and garner a visibility that can enact palpable changes. As he recalls the fond memories of the six immersive and transformational days spent in Johannesburg in the company of “inspiring young Africans,” Ennassiri speaks of pan-Africanism today as some kind of enlightened activism for Africa. One of the most memorable things he took away from his time in the South African city is the need to come up with an expansive and fluid sense of Africanness. Instead of asking, as typical intra-African prejudices go, whether countries like Egypt, Morocco, or Algeria are truly African, the question should be asked as to how concerned these countries feel about Africa. As globalization renders many borders meaningless or irrelevant, genuine “passion for common causes” is more valuable than a certain feeling of genealogical entitlement. As Ennassiri sees it, it is no longer a question of White or Black Africans, or circumstantial and authentic Africans. The question, rather, now has to do with who is doing—or ready to do what it takes—to help the continent meet the relentless challenges thrown in its way by neoliberal globalization. In the world of the young Moroccan, palpable efforts to come to terms with migration, food insecurity, and climate catastrophe, among others, should be the new markers of pan-Africanism. Being a pan-African is no longer about chanting throaty slogans of self-affirmation or ostracizing those deemed not Black enough to be deserving of Africa. “For me, being a pan-African today means to invest in finding ways of working collectively to mitigate the common challenges we face. It is to ensure regional cooperation platforms between young Africans, in such a way that they are adequately equipped to be leaders and prepared for the challenges to come. It is about being an effective actor for change.” In a recent article on an African-type Green New Deal, Carlos Lopes argued that the violent Cyclone Idai which recently hit southern Africa, affecting thousands in Mozambique, was a stark reminder of Africa’s vulnerability to the intensifying consequences of climate change. Lopes proposed an African coalition to tackle the deepening impact of climate change-induced drought and floods. He called for “meaningful, coordinated actions that put the entire continent on a more inclusive and sustainable path.” Overcoming the array of challenges facing the continent requires, he continued, “moments of collective focus and clarity.” Ennassiri agrees. Africa’s recurrent clime-induced crises point to the shaky foundations of the current economic model throughout most of the continent. In much of Africa, he insisted, there is a need to replace the prevailing consumption-based model with one of caring for life and community. Ennassiri’s, then, is a sense of a strikingly acute hope engrained in a fundamental belief in the unimpeachable value of collective action. “As President Obama emphasized,” he said, citing a video message the president sent to this year’s Obama Leaders cohort, “we are the first generation to feel the unmistakable impact of climate change; but we are also the last generation to do something to prevent the coming tragedy.”

Rabat – The video went viral on social media with many venting their anger and denouncing the behavior of the Palestinian with his baby girl.  The video caught the attention of Saudi police who launched an investigation to identify the man. Saudi Gazette reported on Sunday  that Saudi security services had arrested the Palestinian man.  A police spokesman said that “the man, a Palestinian national in his 40s, has been identified as the culprit and he was arrested from the Casablanca neighborhood, south of the Riyadh city. We will provide necessary care to his four children, in coordination with the concerned authorities.”  In an attempt to justify his action, the Palestinian man claimed that his wife left him and his children for two weeks, without them knowing where she could be.  He said that the mother used the video against him. “I would like to apologize [for the act].” He said the motive was to teach my daughter how to walk.  “Look at her now, she knows how to walk alone,” he added. He claimed  that he has been taking care of his four children by himself for more than two weeks. “Their mother left them and they are not subject to any violence.”

Rabat – A new video has emerged on social media showing three Moroccans hiding in the gangway of a ferry connecting the Spanish enclave of Melilla and Malaga. Spanish news outlet Malaga Hoy reported that an employee at the ferry noticed the three Moroccan individuals hiding on the ship’s gangway. The three Moroccans attempted to jump to the  ground after the ship docked at the port of Malaga. The Spanish news outlet said that the three Moroccans were aged between 16 and 18. Malaga Hoy added that they were held abroad the ferry until members of the national police joined the ferry to take them to the police station  for investigation. The video is one of many others documenting the risky journey some irregular migrants take in attempt to reach Europe. Earlier this week, El Faro de Ceuta posted the video of the youth taking a risk to reach Europe, in search of better opportunities. In the video, one of the young men said, “we are leaving for Spain. Everyone wants to go to Spain.”  Malaga Hoy reported in August that 13, 326  irregular migrants have arrived in Spain this year, “almost 9,000 fewer than in the previous period.” Frontex said that the Eastern Mediterranean remains the “busiest” route in Europe with nearly 5,800 irregular migration attempts detected in July.

Rabat – Moroccan security services have arrested two brothers in Meknes for their alleged involvement in the illegal transfer of funds to Moroccan fighters in conflict zones. Police arrested the two suspects on Wednesday, September 18, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said on September 21. Investigation showed that the two suspects opened bank accounts to receive funds and transfer them to fighters in Syriaand Iraq after having converted them into virtual currencies. One of the suspects was in connection with an Iraqi citizen who had been arrested in Casablanca earlier this year for his involvement in similar suspicious financial activities. On February 6, the National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ)  arrested the Iraqi national, who was residing in Morocco. He was also arrested for alleged involvement in financing terrorists in the Syria and Iraq conflict zones. Police placed the two suspects  in custody custody in Meknes on September 18 pending the completion of the investigation. The operation is part of the ongoing efforts of the Moroccan security services to monitor suspicious funds and dry up the sources of terrorist financing. Throughout the year, Morocco’s security services arrested have suspects involved in terror-related crimes. In January, Moroccan security services arrested a French-Algerian national wanted in France for financing terrorism. The French judicial police had put out an international arrest warrant for the dual national on April 22, 2016.

Rabat – Hundreds of members of the Moroccan Jewish community came from across the world on Thursday, September 19 to celebrate the Hiloula of Rabbi Haim Pinto on the anniversary of his death in the Jewish Cemetery of the city. The event is a religious meeting which takes place annually in September in Morocco’s coastal city of Essaouira. Traditionally, the four-day event convenes Jews from America, North America, Latin America, and all of Europe. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the event is an opportunity  for the members of the Jewish Moroccan community to express attachment to their motherland, Morocco, a “haven of peace, and land of tolerance.” Speaking at the event, Rabbi David Pinto said, “Morocco is our homeland. It is our country that we all love and cherish more.” He added, “I am so happy and so proud to meet again this year in Essaouira.” The rabbi said that each member of the Jewish community in Morocco is an “ambassador for Morocco and elsewhere. Many people came only out of curiosity to hear, discover, and appreciate this beautiful and blessed country.” The event attracts  more than 1,500 Moroccan Jewish pilgrims annually. In addition to the Moroccan Jewish community abroad, Morocco is still home for 2,000 Jews. Of the 14.7 million Jews in the world, 2,000 Jews live in Morocco, statistics from the Jewish agency said in September 2018. Morocco’s government has long reiterated its commitment to coexistence and tolerance between religions in Morocco. King Mohammed VI echoed this commitment during Pope Francis visit to Morocco in March 2019. In a speech in front of the Pope and hundreds of attendees, the King spoke about coexistence and the “exceptional” rich diversity underpinning Moroccan civilization. “It is reflected by the mosques, churches, and synagogues which have coexisted in the cities of the Kingdom since time immemorial.”

Rabat – Guatemala has joined an expanding cohort of Latin American countries to extol the merits and legitimacy of Morocco’s Western Sahara stance.  In remarks following a working visit to Morocco this week, Guatemala’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luis Fernando Carranza Cifuentes, said his country supports Morocco’s autonomy proposal and its commitment to territorial integrity. “The government of the Republic of Guatemala supports Morocco’s efforts to find a political solution to this regional dispute and considers that the autonomy initiative presented by the Kingdom of Morocco in 2007 constitutes the realistic, credible and serious basis for achieving a negotiated outcome between the parties, in the context of respect for Morocco’s territorial integrity and national sovereignty,” the minister said at a joint press conference with Morocco’s Nasser Bourita on Friday, September 20. Cifuentes lauded Morocco’s “credible” and “serious” efforts for a negotiated settlement in the longstanding conflict. Guatemala joined a growing trend of countries in its region supporting Morocco’s position in the decades-long conflict.  The past months marked a wave of Latin American support for Morocco’s territorial integrity in its southern provinces.  Pro-Morocco messages from countries like Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Peru ignited suggestions of a Moroccan “diplomatic remontada” in Latin America. Morocco’s diplomacy has made notable gains, securing the region’s trust and support. Latin America was formerly known as a bastion of pro-Polisario sentiment. At the joint press conference on Friday, Cifuentes was also full of praise for Morocco’s commitment to South-South diplomacy as well the kingdom’s role in various global initiatives.  He spoke of Morocco’s visible role in promoting South-South Cooperation and driving international discussions on topics of global significance, such as migration and counter-terrorism.  “The Republic of Guatemala commends the efforts of HM King Mohammed VI for peace and stability throughout the world,” he said.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI received the Moroccan Head of Government in the royal palace on Saturday, September 21, according to a statement by the Royal Office. During the audience, Saad Eddine El Othmani informed the king about “the state of progress in the implementation of the Royal Guidelines set out in the last State of the Nation Address,” according to the statement. The royal instructions to El Othmani include the Head of Government’s submissions to the king regarding the “renewal and enrichment of executive positions, both within the government and the administration,” the statement added. King Mohammed VI’s Throne Day speech delivered July 29 highlighted many of Morocco’s advancements during his 20 years leading the kingdom. It also gave significant weight to development challenges still facing the Moroccan people.  The king expressed regret that “the effects of the progress and the achievements made has not, unfortunately, been felt by all segments of the Moroccan society.” The sovereign announced plans to form an ad-hoc special committee to advise on development issues.  He also alluded to reshuffling in the country’s legislature this October: “I ask the Head of Government to submit to me, after the summer break, proposals to fill executive posts in the Government and the civil service with high-level national elites chosen on merit and competence.” The king’s speech lauded efforts by the current government and expressed that bringing new life into the Moroccan government “is not an end in itself. Rather, it is a gateway to the new era–one into which, with God’s help, I intend to take Morocco. Following the speech, Moroccan government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi told Morocco World News that “if any reforms are to be undertaken, it will be solely the decision of the head of government.”

Rabat –  US President Donald Trump appointed Robert O’Brien as his newest National Security Adviser Wednesday, September 18.  Trump announced the appointment via Twitter. The civilian lawyer was serving as the State Department’s Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. O’Brien was selected from a short list of five choices, according to sources. The hostage negotiator assumes the position as several global tensions mount to critical mass.  “We’ve got a number of challenges but there’s a great team in place,” O’Brien said. “I look forward to working with them and working with the president to keep America safe and continue to rebuild our military.” I am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O’Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor. I have worked long &amp; hard with Robert. He will do a great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019  O’Brien is Trump’s fourth appointment for the position since assuming office in 2017. O’Brien follows John Bolton, HR McMaster, and Michael Flynn in this top security position, which requires only a unilateral presidential appointment.   O’Brien’s appointment was met with support from Trump adviser Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Sources describe O’Brien as an affable non-threatening replacement for the hawkish Bolton. O’Brien’s relative lack of experience in foreign policy has raised concerns with some critics.  “I think the greatest challenge he will have is his relative lack of experience inside the U.S. government, and with the interagency process, given that a gigantic part of the job is coordinating the interagency process,” explained Richard Fontaine, Center for a New American Security CEO. O’Brien has expressed views questioning the UN, and voiced criticism over the Iran nuclear deal. He has called Iran “the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.”  President Trump sent the hostage negotiator to Sweden to negotiate the release of rapper ASAP Rocky in August. The rapper was pending trial and was later found guilty of criminal assault charges. A California native, O’Brien received his law degree from UC Berkeley, then joined the Army Reserve Judge Advocate General Corps. O’Brien built on his civil law career as a member of the California Bar Association. Over the course of his career, O’Brien has served both Republicans and Democrats in several State Department positions. He has also advised on foreign policy for Republican presidential campaigns, including for Mitt Romney and Scott Walker. “I think we have a very good chemistry together, and I think we’re going to have a great relationship,” President Trump said. “He is a very talented man.”

Rabat – The General Directorate for Territorial Security (DGST) categorically denies the validity of two documents, allegedly issued by the directorate, recently circulating on social media. A statement from the DGST mentioned that “some foreign social network pages have been sharing two blatantly falsified documents.”   “The pages misleadingly claim that the documents had been issued by the DGST in an alleged case concerning the identity of an Egyptian citizen of Moroccan origin who converted to Judaism,” added the statement. The DGST denies the authenticity of the documents, both in form and content, stressing their falsification and forgery. “The Directorate also affirmed that it will conduct the necessary investigation in order to reveal the documents’ source.” The DGST statement comes as a result of recent posts and videos which went viral on Egyptian social networks, media sites, and talk shows.  The videos show exiled Egyptian contractor Mohamed Ali claiming that the mother of President Sissi, Malika Titani, is a Jewish Moroccan and that the president’s uncles are all leaders in the Israeli military.

Rabat – Following her announcement that she was leaving Morocco for a new experience abroad, prominent Moroccan feminist Asma Lamrabet has provided more details about her new adventure. Some news reports and critics voiced speculations that her departure was motivated by a string of obstacles tied to her political and intellectual orientations. Lamrabet rejected the speculations, saying her decision was “voluntary” and based on her desire to experience a new culture. Taking to Facebook yesterday, the Moroccan scholar wrote, “My last post has generated many questions and even some speculations in the media. This is why I am providing some precisions today.” Lamarabet explained that she had requested an early retirement from the Ministry of Health. She said she requested relief of her remaining years of duty as a practicing medical doctor in order to “join my husband who is serving as a diplomat in South Africa.” Lamarabet continued, “I did not want to provide details about my destination or my reason for leaving Morocco simply because I have always striven to preserve my personal and family life, but also out of respect for the official [diplomatic] duties of my husband.” Lamrabet said she hopes to have more time for her intellectual pursuits. As well as the opportunity for a new cultural experience, the post suggested Lamrabet is working on some projects and needed a new environment to stimulate her thinking. “My departure is therefore voluntary and it will allow me, at least I hope so, to have more time for my work and writings, as well as for discovering the amazing country that South Africa is.” As for those who reached out to her, worrying that her departure may have been motivated by forces she had not mentioned in her post, she thanked them for the warmth and the love they showed her in their supportive words. “I hope this short message will reassure them, and I sincerely apologize if my previous post was a bit confusing.” Lamrabet ended her post with a touch of national nostalgia. “Having said all this, I insist that Morocco is in my heart and I miss it already.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Nordin Amrabat is full of praise for Abderrazzak Hamdallah, his countryman and teammate at the Saudi football club An-Nasr. In a recent interview with An-Nasr’s online news outlet, Amarabat called Hamdallah a “goal machine” with an incredible sense of positioning and movement. According to Amrabat, his Moroccan teammate has a killer instinct in front of the opposing goal and is better than many of the strikers he has played with, both in European leagues and on the Moroccan national team. “Hamdallah’s strength resides in his technical qualities, his physical power, and his positional sense. This allows him to convert into goals some of the most difficult situations,” said Amrabat. Amrabat added, in comments that may come across as a plea in favor of Hamdallah’s return to the Moroccan national team, that his An-Nasr teammate is one of the best and most reliable strikers he has played with. “He is one of the best I have played with so far, be it in the Netherlands, in the Spanish league, or even in the national team.” The comments come amid controversies between Hamdallah and the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF), and unsettled questions between the player and the national team. Hamdallah unceremoniously left the Moroccan squad for the recently concluded Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) in mysterious circumstances mere days before the start of the tournament. FRMF said the player was gravely injured a few days ahead of CAN and needed replacing. But there were suspicions that Hamdallah, who was new to the Herve Renard-coached squad, had been made to leave because of his cold relationship with the then-coaching staff and some of the group’s established players. In a recent video, however, Hamdallah complained about the unfriendly atmosphere that forced him out of the group. He felt unwelcome and unwanted, he said. With Morocco’s new coach purportedly in a reconstruction mood and ready to “give each player his chance,” it remains to be seen whether Hamdallah will finally get a lasting spot in the Moroccan squad.

Rabat – The 18th Marrakech International Film Festival (FIFM), to be held from November 29th to December 7th, will pay tribute to Australian cinema. This year’s festival will celebrate artists and films from around the world. Like previous editions, it will be “a major event in the world of cinema attracting professionals and film lovers alike,” according to a statement published on the FIFM website. Renewing a tradition initiated in 2004, the 2019 festival honors Australian cinema, “considered to be one of the oldest in the world,” the statement said. Australia famously produced the first feature-length fiction film in history.  It has entertained the world with remarkable films such as “Dead Calm,” “Muriel,” “Ballroom Dancing,” and “Animal Kingdom,” as well as major box-office successes like “Mad Max” and “Crocodile Dundee,” the same source added. Australian landscapes are ever-present in these large-scale productions. Backdrops like mythical Ayers Rock, deserts stretching to infinity, and exotic bushland provide inspiration, soul, and a powerful screen presence. Australia is an extraordinary source of talent for Hollywood, and home to some of the brightest stars of English-language cinema, according to FIFM organizers. A distinguished delegation of Australian actors and directors will travel to Marrakech for the tribute.

Rabat – Videos of anti-government protests in Egypt have gone viral. Egyptians gathered on Friday, September 20 demanding the departure of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sissi. The small-scale protests took place in Cairo and other cities such as Alexandria, Al-Mahalla, Damietta, and Suez. Police quickly dispersed the demonstrations, arresting several protesters.  AFP journalists witnessed five arrests in Tahrir Square in Cairo, where a 2011 revolution led to the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak. The protests echoed calls for change spread on social networks. According to AFP, Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian businessman exiled in Spain, published several viral videos calling for the overthrow of Sissi and the military and accusing the president of corruption. Following the military coup d’etat in which Sissi overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, anti-government protests have outlawed.

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture and Communication conducted a complete inventory of buildings and architectural monuments in the commune of Agadir. The inventory is part of a ministry program dedicated to the protection and rehabilitation of historic buildings and sites. The ministry carried out field investigations, the first of their kind, resulting in the inventory of more than 80 historic buildings, according to the ministry’s statement. The inventory includes public and private buildings, zaouias, shrines, cinemas, and hospitals. It also lists banking and educational institutions, bridges, and other geologically significant sites. Several inventory experts, architects, students, and researchers in the field of cultural heritage participated in the inventory. For the inventory’s successful completion, experts used advanced techniques, including a geographic information system (GIS), aerial images used to create maps and atlases, and a comprehensive database containing building plans and recent photos of each building. The inventory aims to study and share the heritage components of these buildings so that “all stakeholders take them into consideration in the maintenance and urbanization work.”  The content of the inventory can also serve the implementation of tourist routes, strengthening the attractiveness of the city as well as the sites’ registration files on the national heritage list.”

Rabat – A raging fire is burning in the jungle. It’s such an overwhelming disaster that all of the animals are watching the conflagration in shock.  A hummingbird says, “I’m going to do something about the fire.”  It flies to the nearest stream and takes a drop of water. It races back to the fire, where it drops the water onto the flames. Back and forth it goes, over and over, while the larger animals — like the elephant whose trunk could deliver so much more water — stand watching.  Eventually, they ask the hummingbird, “What do you think you can do? You’re too little!”  Without pausing, the hummingbird answers: “I’m doing the best I can.” The Moroccan government reports that two-thirds of the country’s oases have disappeared over the last 100 years. Halim Sbai tells me the story of the hummingbird as he describes the situation facing his native desert oasis city M’Hamid El Ghizlane. Founder of the internationally famous Taragalte Festival, Sbai now focuses on promoting conservation and education through responsible tourism. Sbai is proud to be the President of a local music school. Joudour Sahara Music School This Playing For Change Foundation (PFCF) project connected with Sbai and other locals in 2015, and opened a music school for 15 children in 2016. Stakeholders saw the importance of education in promoting change. Sbai shares a strong consensus human capital is the oasis’s greatest asset in development.  Local teachers and an international staff now provide musical education to 20 students, an equal grouping of girls and boys. Like the hummingbird, every person has their part to play. The school’s students play their part on instruments from a variety of traditions, all long part of the diverse Saharan city’s cultural fabric. They attend regular classes and participate in special events. Each April, Earth Day enthusiasts can listen to guitar tunes amplified on solar-powered speakers. They can also enjoy students’ poetry and songs about the importance of environmental preservation. Students, locals, and visitors plant trees in the threatened oasis, accompanied by desert rhythms.  The Joudour school does more than teach music. It harnesses the universal power of song to address desertification. Sbai first channeled local change through music in 2009. He organized the Taragalte Festival, set to celebrate its tenth edition in November. He organized the early editions to preserve natural and cultural heritage by bringing music and life to this city on the desert’s edge. Sbai saw the festival as a platform to address critical issues like climate change.  When I ask him directly, “why music?” he points out that I contacted him because he “made some noise.”  “When you travel across the desert, and you feel very small,” he explains, “you need to make some noise.” To experience music, he enthuses, involves joy. Two people may share a space, speaking different languages and keeping their distance. When music starts up, they begin to dance, they begin to laugh, and they connect through the world’s strongest, universal language – music. It is such a powerful experience that the festival now draws attendees from all corners of the globe.  A Struggling Landscape There is more than enough reason for M’Hamid’s people to sing loud and clear, calling for attention. The oasis, like so many in Morocco and across the Sahara, is severely threatened by desertification. The population’s ancestors farmed, herded, and flourished, but water scarcity has taken its toll. Where date palm and fig trees once covered a lush landscape, the desert encroaches ever closer.  Morocco is widely lauded for its environmental development initiatives. Home to the world’s largest concentrated solar (CSV) plant and building the world’s largest desalination station, the kingdom is making clear strides.  Sbai sees this national development narrative fail at the community level. He emphasizes that King Mohammed VI’s development vision and passion align with people’s needs. But as policies trickle down from Rabat to community levels, profit-seeking and corruption disrupt progress. One famously failing initiative involves watermelons. Morocco’s government provides funding for agricultural development, but profiteers invest in the water-intensive fruits and further desiccate Morocco’s south. They take M’Hamid’s water for profit, says Sbai. And when they have depleted water, they move on to the next place, and they kill it.  Sbai is passionate about properly constructing dams, harvesting rainwater, and drawing on reservoirs to supply the area’s water needs. Water falls from the sky to the sands, but like the “parachute policies” he describes from Rabat, water isn’t successfully harnessed.  Instead, desert water from the High Atlas Mountains is woefully mismanaged. Sbai is hopeful that involving the right actors in development projects can make the king’s and the community’s shared vision a reality. This requires officials who are familiar with local culture and local challenges. Sustainable water management through dams and reservoirs can reverse the Daraa Valley’s desertification and once again support a thriving community. Reviving an Oasis Generation  Approximately 7,500 people now populate M’Hamid. Despite well above replacement level birth rates, population has steadily declined from around 9,000 since the ‘70’s. Environmental pressures continue to stall agriculture and other traditional activities. Sbai envisions turning this trend around and inspiring immigration from the big cities to the oasis.  He describes how M’Hamid is now composed largely of an older generation and their grandchildren. Working-age residents have left to major cities to find gainful employment and support their families back home. Without anything to do, locals can’t be expected to sit idly by, and working-age residents are scarcely half of the current demographic.  Higher levels of education have also shifted the community dynamic. The city requires different livelihood opportunities for an educated base. Many of today’s younger generation work in tourism, on the same lands where their grandparents farmed and herded, or perhaps freely roamed as desert nomads.  Degradation and a lack of employment opportunities are two major drivers for out-migration. Proper water management, promoted by a musical platform and responsible tourism, can help to reverse the rural-to-urban migration trend.  According to a common Moroccan saying, “when your stomach is full, it tells your head to sing.” Here, music can promote water policies, and water can bring song. Beyond M’Hamid, Beyond Environment Music driving development isn’t unique to M’Hamid. The annual Global Citizen Festival draws tens of thousands of socially active music lovers to a New York concert with the biggest names in American pop music. The festival is broadcast around the US, and 2018 also marked a special edition in Johannesburg to celebrate Nelson Mandela’s memory.  The festival aims to promote the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using a musical platform. Egypt’s Citadel of Music festival follows the same SDG-focused approach. The SDGs involve environmental action, but also social development. Empowering girls and women (SDG 5) draws focus from these platforms.  Today, only 15% of Moroccan musicians holding a professional card from the Ministry of Culture are women. Despite adopting the Government Plan for Equality (ICRAM) from 2012-2016, which helps promote women’s participation in creative industries, the discrepancy persists.  Sbai’s voice rings with pride as he speaks of providing opportunities for Joudour’s female students. When he attended school 40 years ago, his fellow classmates were exclusively boys. Now the community school and the music school educate and empower both girls and boys. “Music isn’t a miracle,” Sbai tells me. A hummingbird can contribute one drop at a time, a child can click one set of castanets at a time. But music can open a door for development and warmly invite the world to join in.

Rabat – 33-year-old Yassine Morabite is a perfect example of an innovative designer bringing Moroccan influences to the world. His distinctive brand, under his own name, has spread far beyond the streets of Jemaa El Fna, where he has a boutique, to other fashion capitals of the world such as Paris, London, and Dubai. Yassine’s strong Moroccan influences are evident in his most recent collection, a series of jackets inspired by the Moroccan cartoon superheroes he grew up watching. The previous collection, entitled “Amazigh Power,” was also full of national pride. The jackets were made from carpets weaved in Chefchaouen, and each piece was unique, representing a different Amazigh warrior. Yassine confided in Morocco World News that he is currently working on a collection that pays homage to the city of Casablanca. The concept has been brewing within Yassine for 5 years but has just recently ripened to reach the execution stage. Yassine teased that he will be revealing more about the collection imminently. For Yassine, a career in fashion was always a given. “Everyone finds their vocation in life after a few attempts in the areas they’re inclined towards,” Yassine told Morocco World News. “But for me, it was more or less easy from the start. I took a shortcut in life thanks to my surroundings and the culture I grew up in, which introduced me to design at a very young age,” he explains. Yassine’s father, who was in the fashion industry himself and who always took him under his wing, is to thank for that shortcut, as Yassine puts it. “My father, peace to his soul, was a tailor and often took me with him to the studio while he worked, reminisced Yassine. “He thought he could keep my mind busy by giving me scissors and pieces of cloth so I would leave him alone to his work.” “That’s where it began. He is the reason why I took this path, since he introduced me to design and made me take this work and this passion seriously,” explains Yassine. He not only cites his father as the man who brought him into the industry, but his biggest influence today. “It is, first and foremost, thanks to him that I developed this interest and passion,” he said. He also finds inspiration all around him, in the country that shaped him.”I find inspiration in the Moroccan culture, in our heritage, in all that makes us unique and authentic,” explained Yassine. As for other designers, he cites the famed Moroccan contemporary Hassan Hajjaj, Jean Galiano and Alexander McQueen as his biggest inspirations. Yassine explained that he designs his unique clothes for other artists, but his definition of an artist is broader than the commonly accepted definition. “I mean, a painter, pianist, architect, and a sportsman are by definition an artist, strong in creativity. We evolve in the same sphere, but everyone lives in his own element,” explains Yassine. “When I work on a collection, these are the people I imagine wearing my creations. The reason is simple: They are creative, they have a sense of art, beauty, and they value the work of their peers.” In closing, Yassine had a few words of advice for other young Moroccans who want to delve into the fashion industry but may be anxious to do so. “Everything starts with an interest, which is transformed into passion and then profession,” he explained. “If you are attracted by a certain trade or the elements of a trade, you must try and see where it leads you.” “Uncertainty plays tricks on us at first, but the only way to evacuate it is to trust the process and follow the path others have taken,” Yassine assured.

Rabat – Bordeaux Football Club’s attacking midfielder Yassine Ben Rahou has declared himself available for a spot in Morocco’s national football team. The decision means the 20-year-old player, born of an Algerian mother and a Moroccan father, is formally closing the doors to Algeria’s request that he play for the Algerian Desert Foxes. According to reports in the Algerian media, Rahou has been on the radar of the Algerian football federation for months. It is also understood that the player’s mother wanted him to play for the Algerian team. But Rahou’s decision will only be effective and irreversible once he actually plays for Morocco. According to FIFA regulations, a player can switch allegiances whenever he wishes, unless he has played in an official match for a given country’s national squad. Rahou’s decision comes as Morocco’s newly appointed Bosnian coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, is in a teambuilding mindset. In his first press conference as Atlas Lions coach on September 5, the Bosnian complained about the lack of intensity and drive in Morocco’s recent performances in major tournaments. Halilhodzic said he will be calling players to the team based on their shape at the time of selection rather than on past performance or familiarity with other players on the team. There have been suggestions that the Bordeaux midfielder has already caught Halilhodzic’s eyes and is on the Bosnian’s agenda for the two upcoming friendly games against Libya and Gabon in October. After losing to Algeria in the scramble for rising AC Milan and African football star Ismael Bennacer, who was also born of a Moroccan father and an Algerian mother, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has been relentless in its new strategy to convince players to choose the Atlas Lions. The past weeks have also seen a feud between the Moroccan and Dutch federations in their quest to win the heart of Dutch football sensation Mohammed Ihattaren.

Rabat – This weekend, former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hilary Clinton, who ran for president in 2016, are in Marrakech to celebrate Moroccan billionaire Marc Lasry’s birthday. The powerful couple could be seen this morning in Marrakech’s iconic Jemaa El-Fna square, a staple for all visitors to the ochre city. The couple posed with a snake and later looked at traditional Moroccan wares in the souk. Lasry will host the bash the Clintons are attending at Marrakech’s most luxurious hotel, La Mamounia. The Clintons also attended Lasry’s wedding in 2017, among a host of other stars. More than 300 respected figures in finance and politics from across the world are expected to attend Lasry’s party. According to Moroccan outlet Le Esco, Marrakech’s security officials organized a meeting to decide how to best prepare for the event. Marc Lasry was born in Marrakech on September 30, 1959. At the age of 7, his family immigrated to the US where Lasry later rose to success. Lasry made his fortune as a pension and hedge fund manager. He is the CEO of Avenue Capital Group and co-owner of Michigan professional basketball team the Milwaukee Bucks.

Rabat – Today, millions of students and workers are striking worldwide to demand legislative action on the climate crisis. First rising to public attention in the 1980s, global warming and climate change have since become a topic of contentious political debate. Young people and workers who will suffer greater climate impacts are demanding that politicians address the emergency in an unprecedented wave of climate action. Fadoua Brour, president and founder of the Moroccan Youth Climate Movement (MYCM), kindly granted me an interview in between meetings at New York’s Bard College, where she is pursuing a dual MS/MBA in environmental policy and sustainability.  Brour founded MYCM in 2012 to introduce youth to the climate debate and to build an understanding of climate change and its impacts. During a time of political upheaval in the Arab world, many climate activists hoped to harness popular political will to address the human rights challenge of our times. MYCM is a member of the Arab Youth Climate Movement, an independent international body representing voices from over 15 Arab countries.  The organization’s main goals are to raise climate awareness, support climate action capacity building for local communities, and provide educational support on climate issues.  MYCM addresses climate change from a social justice perspective. That is what matters to the young movers and shakers in this activist community. Brour explains that the strategy entails a focus on human impact. She feels that mega-projects like the Noor power station should be evaluated by their impact on local communities. Market concerns and Morocco’s ambitions to take Africa’s renewable energy lead are less telling than real impacts, according to Brour.  Properly addressing these impacts and their root causes will take enormous ambition. “We need a generation that is fully committed, that understands the climate challenges, and that is passionate about taking action,” she tells me.  Personally, Brour focuses on two levels of intervention. As far as networking goes, she connects with regional climate actors to build synergies and link to capacity-building programs. In advocacy, she engages in conferences and conversations to deepen the youth climate dialogue with policy makers.  She also creates educational tools to simplify an issue as complex as the climate crisis. MYCM’s educational outreach spans from providing high schools and universities with climate curriculum tools to producing engaging podcasts. Brour discussed how fundraising is, unfortunately, a necessary activity. Money is not action, but resource optimization is necessary to support the group’s mission. Funds are often hard to come by, and the Moroccan government is not contributing. When funds are available, Brour elaborates, a main MYCM priority is supporting Moroccan member NGOs in real-world, community-based projects and trainings. I explained MWN’s participation in Covering Climate Now, and asked Brour for the most important foundational messages the world should address when delving into the climate conversation with youth. Her first response was “employment.” Climate change is strongly linked to employment opportunities, and high rates of unemployment plague Morocco’s youth.  Climate impacts human interests, she tells me. Talking about the science is important, but there is a concurrent need to talk about real-world impacts on human wellbeing.  As our conversation shifted to Moroccan women in climate justice, Brour described a striking insight from field visits to the Taza and Tata rural areas in Morocco’s Ouarzazate province. “We found that women are incredibly involved, naturally,” she recalled. The rural women did not participate in official capacity-building to tackle climate issues. They participate in the family’s survival.  Many rural men have migrated to urban centers for gainful employment. “These women were left responsible for raising their families, and responding to their needs.” Women have great potential in climate justice, especially on a local level. Unfortunately, Morocco’s top-down dialogue doesn’t engage this potential, nor does it compel local authorities to take real action, Brour explains. I had to ask about operational challenges. I have been following the global youth movement led by Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion. The protest movement has gained incredible traction, especially in the West.  At the same time, the governments that these protestors are calling on for climate legislation are generally those of developed countries, major polluters. As a young American, I empathize with these activists’ concern for their future, as they are forced to appeal to a political machine powered by corporate funding and gridlocked by divisive dialogue.  Morocco is significantly impacted by climate challenges, yet Morocco is not a historic polluter. The kingdom’s official development narrative emphasizes sustainable development and renewables. The country also holds an important position in maintaining stability within a volatile region. Youth activism here must involve a vastly different approach. Brour maintained her no-nonsense stance as she addressed systemic operational challenges for MYCM. The activist mainly highlighted a lack of funding opportunities, closed doors to dialogue with policy makers, and insufficient media engagement. As far as she is concerned, MYCM’s work can only be truly efficient if all stakeholders collaborate with civil society. Brour’s frustration was as audible as her determination. “I’m talking to you honestly. The movement did a great job, and I think there are still many chapters of the Arab Youth Climate Movement doing a great job…. But it’s not really how a youth climate movement should be.” She emphasized the need for capacity-building for youth members, pointing out that an essential part of the challenge lies in enhancing competencies that enable creative action based on advanced knowledge. Without that, she said, sounding rueful, the movement loses its spirit. It all circles back to engaging lawmakers and community actors: Meeting the top-down drive with bottom-up dynamics and merging big ideas with implementation procedures that respect local realities and local voices. Brour explained that this is the key to manifesting efficient, sustainable policy.  Brour was late to a meeting at this point, but stayed on the line with me to underscore sincere concern. She referenced the recent floods in southern Morocco. “You know, people died. That was not a simple flood. It was like the whole system—transportation system, infrastructure—was not designed to cope with climate disasters.”  Morocco is not a major emitter and strongly requires adaptation and resilience measures. That means placing climate strategies in all policy discussions, in all sectors, at all levels.  Brour mapped this out for me and concluded on two points: “Education and community resilience. This is my hope, and this is why I continue.”

Rabat – A group of Moroccan children from a migrant detention center for minors in Melilla moved the entire audience, including the judges, with their audition for the television show “Spain’s Got Talent.” Their coach, who came on stage with them, explained the 14 children’s tragic circumstances. “We came from Melilla … these are minors who live in a detention center in the city,” the coach told the panel of judges. “They are abandoned children,” the coach said, with tears in her eyes. “They used to live in Morocco with their families, who were forced to abandon their kids near the borders.” The children crossed the border to Spain alone, seeking a better life, according to the coach. After arriving in Melilla, police transferred them to detention centers. “They are faced with many difficulties, including the language barrier … and bullying,” continued the coach. Dance, for these children, is both an outlet and a possible pathway to a better life that they have found through Spain’s Nana Association, a migrant outreach program which the coach works with. With their dance piece, the children tried to represent their struggles as unaccompanied minors in Spain. “Theater, music, and dance helps us to be better people, we have come to show that we are good people even if we are born in another country, we all have the right to fight for our dreams and to realize them,” said one of the children before the performance began.  The moving performance brought the judges to tears and received a standing ovation from the crowd. The children received a “golden buzzer” from the judges, meaning they will go straight to the semifinals of the competition. The children appeared overjoyed as golden confetti rained down and the judges ran on stage to hug them.

Rabat – Police in Oujda, eastern Morocco, opened a judicial investigation on Thursday, September 19, into a criminal network allegedly involved in irregular migration. The investigation comes after security services arrested irregular migrants, two Moroccan women and 90 sub-Saharan nationals, on Thursday. The list of migrants included 7 women and 15 minors. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement that the suspects they arrested are involved in organizing irregular migration to Europe. Police also seized travel documents, some of which belong to the arrested individuals and migrants. Police put the suspects in custody to question them about their involvement in irregular migration. Investigators are also seeking to determine possible links with other criminal networks, the statement added. Morocco has been under pressure to reduce irregular migration and has dismantled several irregular migration networks. Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said on August 29 that Moroccan security services had stopped 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. He added that authorities also dismantled 100 irregular migration networks. The Moroccan government also emphasized the importance of shared responsibility in tackling migration and border issues. On August 23, the acting Spanish government approved a €32 million grant to back Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration. The grant is in addition to financial aid from the European Union estimated at more than €140 million.

Rabat – The Moroccan Airports Office (ONDA) has granted the Chinese-owned aviation services company Swissport International a license to operate in 15 Moroccan airports, reports Aviation Pros. The seven-year license allows Swissport to manage the airports of Agadir, Al Hoceima, Casablanca, Dakhla, Errachidia, Essaouira, Fez, Laayoune, Marrakech, Nador, Ouarzazate, Oujda, Rabat, Tangier, and Tetouan. “We are delighted with the trust that ONDA has placed in us,” said Christophe de Figueiredo, Swissport Morocco’s CEO. “Since 2012, our service agents and ramp personnel have all been working with great dedication to exceed the high expectations of our airline clients in Morocco.” As a provider of airport ground services, Swissport manages “ramp services” like moving, fueling, and cleaning planes and “passenger services” like security, check-in, and gate services. Figueiredo noted, “This license renewal was earned by all of our staff. At our Moroccan locations, we will continue to invest in highly trained staff and deploy state-of-the-art equipment, many of which will be electrically powered to further improve our carbon footprint.” The company aims to convert most of its ground support equipment (GSE) at Marrakech airport to electric propulsion by 2021. Swissport will invest over MAD 200 million in the renewal of its equipment. “Morocco is of great importance for us. Our commitment is reflected in our sizeable deployment of state-of-the-art electric GSE in Morocco,” said Luzius Wirth, the executive vice president of Swissport International in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The company also recently announced its goal to make 50% of its vehicles in its global fleet be electric by 2025. Swissport is the second largest airport ground services company in Morocco after Royal Air Maroc. It serves a total of 22 airline customers, including Air Arabia, Air Canada, British Airways, Easyjet, Lufthansa, Ryanair, and TAP Air Portugal.

Rabat – The European Union has funded a legal migration project called “Young Generation as Change Agents”  for Moroccan graduates to study in Spain. The Spanish Service for the Internationalization of Education (SEPIE) is coordinating the project. “The project aims to establish a circular legal migration scheme with Morocco with a mobility phase for young Moroccan graduates who will study a one-year Master’s degree in Spain,” SEPIE said in a statement.  The project has three main phases. The first is a “pre-departure” phase when organizers identify key socio-economic sectors and select candidates. Next is a “mobility” phase in Spain, when 100 Moroccan graduates will go to Spain for a one-year master’s degree for an end-of-master’s project, likely to be implemented as an entrepreneurial project in Morocco. Finally, the students will go through a “reintegration” phase with a prize program to help implement the best final project. The program will teach students “the implementation of business and entrepreneurship projects at their return to Morocco after getting their master’s.” The European Commission will pay for 95% of the  €2.5 million project. The funding will mostly pay for the mobility phase in Spain and the entrepreneurial projects during the “reintegration” phase in Morocco. A ceremony presenting the project took place at the residence of the Spanish ambassador, Ricardo Diez-Hochleitner, in Rabat on September 19. Speaking at the ceremony, the EU ambassador to Morocco, Claudia Wiedey, described the project as “exemplary,”  underlining the “special” importance of this initiative of the European Commission’s Instrument of Association for Mobility (MPF). “This project does not consist of a classic scholarship program, it is a very special initiative, first of all, because it reflects a very strong partnership between Spain and Morocco in education and migration,” said the ambassador. The undersecretary of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Pablo Martin, said he was impressed by the “extraordinary” profiles of the young students that the Ministry of Education selected. “This project will allow these 100 agents of change, who have an extraordinary curriculum, to be trained in Spain, to return to Morocco to apply the knowledge acquired and thus contribute to the progress of society,” added Martin.

Rabat – Moroccan academic Mustapha Fahmi has won the 2019 Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Book Fair prize for his work “The Lesson of Rosalinde” (“La Lecon de Rosalinde”).  The book is a collection of literary philosophical reflections, in which the author questions the people’s presence in life and whether they have duties, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The book also includes references to world-class thinkers, including Nietzsche, Spinoza, Aristotle, Badios, and Shakespeare. “If the world is a scene, can one choose its role?” the writer asks. The author has several books in his repertoire, including scientific pieces and poetry. A specialist in Shakespeare, Fahmi has given lectures around the world, including in the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, MAP added.  In a Facebook post, the Moroccan academic expressed pride over winning the prize. “Honored and touched,” Fahmi said, thanking the members of the jury panel. The Moroccan author will receive the prize at the 55th Annual Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Book Far in Quebec, which will take place September 26-29. MAP reported that 272 authors will attend the event.

Rabat – Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has shared its 2019 statistics on the arrests of people for theft, drug trafficking, and fraud. On Thursday, September 19, the wali (governor) of the judicial police, Mohamed Dkhissi, said that police security services arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking from January 1 to September 15. Out of the total number of suspects arrested, 331,252 have been arrested when found in possession of drugs, while 89,096 were arrested after public prosecutors put out arrest warrants. Dkhissi, who spoke about DGSN’s outcomes in the first nine months of 2019 in a press conference, said that there has been a significant increase of 40% in the number of drug trafficking cases. He said that security services have been successful in stopping drug trafficking attempts. “There was a similar increase in the number of people arrested [for trafficking drugs] by 50 percent, with 94,010 people arrested, including 308 foreigners, while 62,839 people were arrested in the same period last year.” During the same period, police seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives. He added that police also seized 1,161,000 psychotropic pills. Security services also seized 44 kilograms of cocaine and 6 kilograms of heroin. He said that DGSN seized nearly twice as many psychotropic pills as in the same period last year, having seized 554,390 more. Dkhissi lauded the cooperation of all of Morocco’s security services, including the DGSN and the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGSN). Violent crimes Dkhissi said that violent crimes that threaten safety, including sexual assault and violent theft, represent only 8.9% of all crimes. He said that police gained more intelligence from crimes committed with violence than last year, gaining intelligence on 72.14% of cases,compared to 70% last year, Dkhissi said, as quoted by Moroccan television channel 2M. The director added that violent thefts fell by 5.24%, especially armed robberies. Police managed to dismantle 332 criminal networks that were active across Morocco. Police also arrested 652 people in criminal networks, seizing 102 knives, and 33 vehicles.

Rabat – The Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca, Morocco’s main international airport is once again at the heart of a public uproar. This time around, however, the public irritation does not stem for a passenger mistreatment that went viral or even the airport’s typical overcrowding problem. This time, the problem is with an eye-catching nameplate whose authors managed to turn both English and Arabic on their heads, producing a sentence that is as confusing as it is laughable. In a strongly-worded Facebook post earlier today, communication specialist Ali Hassan Eddehbi, who brought the matter to public attention, vented his frustration with what he called a “vulgar” and unforgivable blunder whose very presence at Morocco’s leading airport is a “disgrace” to Morocco’s image as a nation. The nameplate, which appears to be advertising the newly announced initiative to ease traffic at the Casablanca-based airport, read: “Exit Moroccan passports stamped.” The writing came alongside its Arabic version. Both versions, Eddehbi quipped, constitute a slap in the face of effective, professional communication. “The initiative is indeed laudable and I would like to congratulate those responsible for it,” began Eddehbi. “However, neither the [sentence’s] assignee nor the airport personnel (and I guess in this case the guys at ONDA’s communication department are the ones concerned) were able to spot two serious mistakes [in the message].” (ONDA stands for Moroccan Airports Authority, and is the body in charge of administrative and logistics operations at Moroccan airports.) While the policy advertised in the sentence, saving passengers the endless waiting time and the interminable queues, such a communication mistake stains Moroccan national image, pride. Morocco being a country where Arabic is widely spoken, Eddehbi suggested, it is unacceptable to have such meaningless Arabic sentence in a respectable public space. The problem with the sentence, as Eddehbi lamented, is the message it sends to foreigners who land at said airport. As far as first impressions go for countries, airports are often vital in the image we associate with countries. With sentences as the one at the Casablanca airport travelers would easily associate the country with sloppiness and unprofessionalism. Eddehbi went on to describe the “grammatical mistakes” in both versions as a total disgrace to Morocco’s image and an “infringement of its official language.” While the Arabic version was confusing, he noted, the English translation of it was even more bafflingly unprofessional. The grammar is “lame” whereas the meaning is ludicrous. “When it comes to the English, it is obvious that that he sentence was naively translated from Arabic. The right formulation should have been something like: exit reserved for stamped Moroccan passports.” Critics may debate whether Eddehbi’s proposed formulation is the most ideal. Some would perhaps argue that the “for” in his version is unnecessary and could be left out for more direct, effective communication. Others may propose a new formulation altogether. But that would miss the central point of his criticism of the “unforgivable” mistakes in the formulation used by the airport personnel and put on display in an unmissable spot at the country’s foremost international airport. The point here is the sense of national shame that comes with having an advertisement board read “passports stamped” at the country’s top airport.

Rabat – According to the Moroccan Ministry of Industry, Moroccan households consume about 25 billion plastic bags a year (2016). The ministry’s chart of plastic bags’ yearly consumption ranked Morocco second after the United States and ahead of Australia. Morocco accounts for 900 plastic bags per person.  After use, the plastic waste ends up dumped in the countryside as the country lacks a waste management system for recovery and recycling. Figures presented at the “Ecocean” seminar held in Tangier on June 27, 2019, showed that Morocco produces a massive amount of plastic waste leaking into the ocean. The figures place the country in the top twenty countries for ocean pollution. 51% of the waste that is found on Moroccan beaches is plastic waste. To rid Morocco of plastic bags, the Moroccan government has opted, since July 1, 2016, for a radical solution: the prohibition of plastic bags within six months after the publication of the corresponding law.  The new law came only a few months prior to COP22, the United Nations Climate Change Conference organized in Marrakech, Morocco.  The prohibition campaign was named “Zero Mika,” mika being the equivalent of plastic in Darija, the Moroccan dialect. No more plastic! Article 2 of Law n°77-15 prohibits the production, import, export, marketing, use, and even free distribution of plastic bags. The ban applies only to single-use bags known as “suspenders” usually given to customers at local markets or grocery stores.  Plastic bags intended for industrial or agricultural use as well as freezer bags, garbage bags, and other categories remain authorized. The law, however, stipulates that these bags should be marked either according to their intended use or category. The new law did not specify any alternatives for consumers. Moroccans were left confused as many of them did not know how they’ll be carrying their groceries home.  Zero Mika on a smaller scale As soon as the law came into force, Morocco’s major supermarkets all showed readiness to abide by it. Marjane, Acima, Carrefour, and Bim started offering ‘legal’ plastic bags at the cashier’s desk.  Customers, unlike in pre-Zero Mika times, are now required to pay for the bags (another profitable situation for supermarkets!). So instead, those who plan their shopping adventures ahead now bring their own bags or supermarket bags they have previously bought.  Other Moroccans opted for the straw-based “koffa”, a long-gone traditional shopping basket.  Unlike the supermarket giants, grocery shops and small businesses gradually adapted to the ban. Not having any clear alternatives, shopkeepers feared supermarket competition.  “We feared that this would encourage more people to do their shopping in supermarkets,” a shopkeeper in Hassan district, Rabat told Morocco World News. While some offered reusable shopping bags, others favored paper bags. Butchers specifically opted for white polyester trays for packing meat. What becomes of plastic manufacturers? With the enactment of Law n°77-15, Moroccans nationwide wondered what will become of the plastic industry manufacturers. While consumers were hardly adapting to the lack of plastic bags, it was unclear where plastic manufacturers stand in light of this ban. However, the Ministry of Industry soon affirmed its willingness to help investors and production units to look into the production of alternative solutions.  For manufacturers in the formal sector, the Moroccan government implemented a conversion plan of MAD 200 million (about 20 million euros) to allow them to continue to exist and preserve jobs.  The plan aimed to support companies to start manufacturing non-polluting packaging products. The non-woven bags, made from polypropylene, are now found in almost all stores. Any flaws?  In June 2018, two years after the enactment of Law n°77-15, the Zero Zbel NGO published a survey on the use of plastic bags in Morocco and their alternatives.  The survey was conducted between March and April 2018 on 235 people (consumers and merchants) in eight markets in Casablanca, Agadir, and Tetouan. In the survey, the NGO reported that “8% of those surveyed consider that the consumption of plastic bags has increased since the law came into effect, and 41% consider that it has remained at the same level.” The NGO also reported that 60% of merchants surveyed say that “80% of their customers ask for plastic bags, while 65% of customers say they use 5 to 15 plastic bags each time they shop.” 66% of merchants surveyed say they “rarely” or “never” have customers who use alternatives to plastic bags. According to the people interviewed, the 3 main barriers to using alternatives are their high price, the difficulty for consumers to change their habits, and the fact that the available alternatives are not practical enough. The non-woven polypropylene bags offered as an alternative to plastic ones may be recyclable and reusable, but they are not biodegradable.  Since there is no recycling system for such packaging in Morocco, the problem persists, especially as the bags are consumed in mass without being collected or recycled, and as Moroccan citizens “rarely” reuse them. “Ideally, these (non-woven) bags should also be banned, because they are not recycled and reused, it is not a real solution,” Lotfi Chraibi, activist and president of the Moroccan Association for a Sustainable Environment (AMED), told the Moroccan daily, TelQuel. Several Moroccans criticized and expressed disappointment with the failure of Zero Mika awareness campaigns. The campaigns “did not succeed in targeting the real problems,” says Chraibi.  “For the citizen to understand the seriousness of the situation, we need a shock-communication approach that would emphasize how plastic has a direct impact on our health first and not only on the environment,” he added. “We must act directly on the behavior of the citizen and instill in him the good reflexes needed.” While in 2016, the Ministry of Industry’s first Zero Mika awareness campaigns focused on the environmental aspect of the plastic crisis, especially with the video “Kayn Ma Ahssen” (There is better), the campaigns started tackling the health risks in following videos. One of the latest videos posted on the Ministry of Industry’s Facebook page gives the floor to biologist Abdelaziz Al Masfar, who explains from a scientific point of view the dangers of using recycled plastic bags on the human body. This shift in perspective was paramount, especially as plastic is a serious factor in climate change. Plastic production requires the use of fossil fuels, whose combustion raises temperatures.  As a result, the world’s temperature balance is disrupted causing ice meltdowns and rising sea levels. This, in turn, leads to tangible challenges facing Moroccans, such as more frequent and more intense natural disasters. What are the possible solutions? In its survey results, Zero Zbel recommended developing “reusable alternatives that are  truly respectful  of the environment, which would not  be made of plastic (unlike the nonwoven polypropylene bags currently sold on the market).” It also recommended developing suitable containers adapted to wet products sold by the kilo and in bulk (meat, poultry, fish, olives, oil, etc.). Zero Zbel had also suggested opting for the “koffa” (the straw-based traditional shopping bag) with the campaign “Koffa my love.” In an explanatory video of the project, Mamoun Ghallab, president of Zero Zbel, presents the “koffa” as “the symbol of alternative solutions to plastic bags”, particularly because of its belonging to the Moroccan cultural heritage. It’s still being produced! In order to enforce the new law, control is a major focus in Morocco’s new strategy. The implementation of the law required the involvement of three administrations, the Ministry of Industry for factories, the Ministry of the Interior for traders and the Administration of Customs for imports. The law itself stipulates heavy penalties in case of infringement. The fines vary from MAD 200,000 to 1 million for producing plastic bags, and from MAD 10,000 to 500,000 for possession and intention to sell the plastic bags.  Nevertheless, fines are not always as deterring as required. Tracking contraband bags and clandestine production units is not an easy job. Customs of the Oriental Regional Directorate intercepted seven tons of plastic bags in May 2019 during a customs control operation carried out at the Barrio Chino substation (Nador). The contraband was seized in a van coming from Melilla. Two days later, the Ministry of Industry decided to suspend the polyethylene supply authorizations granted to seven industrial units in Casablanca. The ministry justified its decision by a statement revealing that the “units supplied polyethylene to clandestine units manufacturing banned plastic bags.” The Ministry was able to identify the seven units by tracing the trail of origin of the polyethylene.  The polyethylene traceability is carried out through an import licensing system in which importers are obliged to keep a record of buyers. This way the ministry manages to avoid the use of polyethylene in the manufacture of banned plastic bags. In the span of two years (2018), the Ministry of Industry reported the seizure of 89.9 tons of bags at the border posts. Revising the law Three years after its enactment, Law n° 77-15 was not able to eradicate plastic in Morocco as intended. The use of plastic by citizens, the clandestine production and distribution of plastic bags, and the large scale seizures of contraband plastic products have all shown how limited the law is.  In 2019, the Moroccan government decided to introduce amendments to the law. On January 3, the Governing Council adopted Bill n°57-18 in order to further strengthen plastic-related regulations.  The amended law provided new definitions of plastic raw materials and better control of industrial work. Manufacturers are now required to fill in a declaration to inform the Ministry of Industry of the nature of the activity carried out. In addition, the law toughens sanctions against producers and importers and increases the deadline for legal recidivism from 6 months to 5 years. The new fines range between MAD 2,000 to 500,000 for the possession of plastic bags intended for sale or distribution; MAD 200,000 to 1 million for the possession of raw materials dedicated to the manufacture of plastic bags; and MAD 10,000 to 100,000 for the production of plastic bags without respect of the imposed criteria. Bill n°57-18 also introduced new articles defining the tasks of the control officers with regard to the inspection, the seizure, the report, and the writing of minutes. With all these amendments, Morocco hopes to be able to finally put a stop to the plastic waste that has been plaguing its lands and oceans. Although at the moment, there are hardly any serious solutions or practical alternatives to the issue, Morocco should bet on its human resources. Moroccan citizens should be the focus of this shift; they are in full need of sensitization and awareness campaigns.  A no-plastic Morocco needs no-plastic citizens who feel responsible for the environment and our natural habitat.

Rabat – The mastermind of the Imlil murder case, who has initially been sentenced to death, revealed important new details during the case’s third appeal. Abdessamad El Joud admitted that he planned the slaughter of the two Scandinavian volunteers, “Maren” and “Louisa”, together with Rachid Afatii and Younes Ouziad. El Joud pointed out that the fourth main defendant, Abderrahman Khayali, accompanied them but returned before committing the crime and that the remaining 20 defendants have no links to the crime. El Joud added that he had held meetings with the other three defendants to discuss Islam, jihad, and immigration to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He also mentioned being arrested in 2013 for his intention to join ISIS. The main defendant explained that, since 2011, he watched videos of  “Christians” killing women and children in hospitals and nurseries with phosphorus gas, and bombing mosques as well as other sites that are not related to the Syrian conflict. The online content provoked El Joud’s desire for “revenge, and a conviction to join Syria to defend Muslims.”  The defendants’ lawyer, Hafida Maksaoui, told Morocco World News that “El Joud expressed regret but refused to apologize to the victims’ families.”  “They are only two, we are millions,” the defendant said, referring to Muslims facing persecution worldwide. On July 18, the Criminal Chamber in charge of counter-terrorism cases in the Court of Appeal of Sale handed down sentences for the murders, ranging from five years in prison to capital punishment. The main defendants are accused of “forming a gang to commit terror crimes and intentionally assaulting the life of persons premeditatedly.” They are also accused of weapons possession, and “attempt to manufacture explosives with the intention to cause serious public harm, terrorism, and violence.”

Rabat – Security services in Algeria killed two civilians on the night of Wednesday, September 18. The killings came during clashes between demonstrators and the police at Daira police headquarters. The clashes erupted following a road accident, after a security service vehicle and a civilian motorcycle collided. The accident claimed the life of the motorcycle driver, a 15-year old Algerian citizen.  The driver’s friend, 24, sustained “serious injuries,” according to a statement from the public prosecutor at the Court of Oued  R’hiou. The statement added that the road accident resulted in “vandalism,” with many people protesting the incident.  The prosecutor also blamed the protesters for vandalizing public facilities and attempt to enter the police station of  Oued R’hiou to “get the police officer responsible in the road accident.” “After the police intervention, two people were injured which resulted in their death.” The public prosecutor said that an investigation was opened to determine the case’s circumstances. Wednesday’s incidents came after threats from Algerian army chief Gaid Salah, who ordered police to arrest protesters entering Algeria. “I have instructed the national gendarmerie to deal with these actions with firmness,” said General Ahmed Gaid Salah. Salah said that orders had been issued to stop “vehicles and coaches used” to bring protestors to Algiers by seizing them and “fining their owners.” The chief, regarded as Algeria’s de facto leader after the resignation of former president  Abdelaziz Bouteflika, is also insisting on the importance of an election before the end of this year. Interim president Abdelkader Bensalah announced that the election will take place on December 12.

Rabat –  Following deliberations, this Thursday, September 19, the Court of First Instance in Rabat decided to refuse Hajar Raissouni’s request for temporary release, as reported by several Moroccan news outlets. The Court justified its decision to keep Raissouni in detention on the gravity of the charges against the young journalist, as well as the insufficiency of guarantees presented for her possible release. Read Also:  Rabat Court Postpones Raissouni’s Trial to September 23 The trial is expected to resume on Monday, September 23. The court intends to examine the requests for “defects of form” presented by Raissouni’s defense team. Raissouni’s lawyer Saad Sahli, present in court, denied the court’s decision, saying that “the hearing will not start before 2 PM and the court has not yet decided on the request of the defense of my client.” “We are waiting like everyone else for the outcome of the deliberations. I do not know where they are holding this information,” he told Moroccan news outlet H24.  The 28-year old journalist, who writes for the Arabic-speaking daily Akhbar Al Yaoum, faces up to two years imprisonment. Morocco’s penal code incriminates both sex outside marriage and abortion without imminent danger to the mother’s life. Police arrested Raissouni in Rabat on August 31. They also arrested her Sudanese fiancé, the gynecologist who oversaw the alleged abortion, a nurse, and a secretary. All defendants stood court at the same time.

Rabat – The number of young Moroccan women seeking asylum in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla because of their sexual orientation is on the rise. Since the start of 2019, more than 300 young Moroccans, identifying as lesbians, have applied for asylum because they feel threatened in Morocco. While Spanish authorities analyze every application minutiously, the increasing numbers make the situation more complex. The authorities, in collaboration with social workers, perform extensive background checks and investigations for each case before granting asylum. The asylum-seekers, often aged between 15 and 20, explain that their sexual orientation causes them distress in Moroccan society. They are often harassed and threatened, which endangers their lives. Moroccan newspaper Assabah states that these asylum-seekers are not only applying to these Spanish enclaves but also to some other European countries. Many European NGOs are encouraging Moroccan homosexuals to cross the Mediterranean, even illegally, to reach Europe and present their case at the European Union Court of Justice in Luxembourg. This institution can provide asylum for LGBT individuals if they face persecution in their home countries. In October 2016, the case of two Moroccan girls, aged 16 and 17, who were arrested after a passerby caught them kissing on a Marrakech terrace, went viral. An online petition in support of the two girls gathered more than 85,000 signatures from Moroccans and foreigners. The court announced that the girls are innocent of all charges two months after their arrest. Same-sex relations are illegal in Morocco. Article 489 of the Moroccan penal code stipulates six months to three years in jail for anyone involved in such activity. In addition to laws forbidding homosexuality, many incidents have been reported where homophobic Moroccans harass and even beat homosexuals in the streets because of their sexual orientation. In August 2017, Moroccan internet celebrity Adam “Adouma” Lahlou was publicly assaulted. The group of attackers hit him in the head, eyes, and neck. They also tore his clothes, insulted him, and threatened to kill him.

Rabat – Michal Kurtyka is President of the UN Conference of Parties (COP) 24, responsible for overseeing international cooperation on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in its 24th year. Kurtyka organized and oversaw COP24 in Katowice, where 196 countries agreed on the Katowice Rulebook to concretely implement the 2015 Paris Agreement’s principles. Kurtyka will apply his leadership at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23. He will take part in sharing a Just Transition report, developed following the “Solidarity and Just Transition” conference in Warsaw this July. The COP24 Presidency will also work alongside the Secretariat of the UNFCCC to organize a 25th anniversary event for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A week before the summit, Kurtyka agreed to sit down with me at the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises’s (CGEM) second annual Universite d’Ete (Summer University), focused on entrepreneurship, in Casablanca. Secretary of State for Poland’s Ministry of Environment, the high-ranking technocrat’s approachable, kind demeanor invited a meaningful exchange. I explained Morocco World News’s participation in Covering Climate Now, and asked for Kurtyka’s insight on environmental and social development issues through a developing country lens. This interview has been edited and condensed. Morocco is not an historic polluter. Morocco is set to suffer some of the greater impacts of climate change. Many Moroccans are unfamiliar with the term ‘climate change’ and its implications, at least through this terminology. As we start communicating these issues, what are the three most important messages to convey on climate change? M.K. Sometimes speaking about climate change, it’s useful not to use the term climate change. What touches people is lack of water, shrinking fisheries resources, droughts, hurricanes, and health problems linked with pollution. It’s useful to give examples which touch everyday life. When I speak with my Moroccan friends and colleagues, we immediately focus our attention on the issue of waste. That is a visible example of how our civilization is wasting resources, and contributing to pollution. We have to imagine that there are other substances that we don’t see, which are equally or even more polluting. Through this, we can both mobilize communities around local challenges, give a sense to their action, and slowly raise awareness of the challenges of a global change. The second issue would be water. 16 million hours are spent everyday by African women going for water. The world’s water is becoming scarcer and scarcer. How much time will African women, Moroccan women in many rural areas, spend going for water? There is then a practical challenge on how to mobilize government and local communities, how to engage businesses, to make water more available. Last but not least in this first round of discussion is urban air pollution. We have solutions available in terms of ecological mobility, which is polluting less and which is opening completely new chapters in resource use. I think it also questions the way we live. For example, switching people from individual transport to public transport is very impactful in terms of both air pollution in cities, and climate. King Mohammed VI’s COP24 speech argued for concrete, proactive measures, and constant mobilization from the developed world to help developing countries in technology transfer and honoring financial commitments. How did COP24 successfully address those priorities, and how should the conversation shift so these issues can receive better justice at future summits? M.K. In Katowice, we achieved a historical milestone in global climate policy. Agreed in Paris in 2015 was a set of 29 articles, the golden rules of the coming climate policy. The problem was rules lacked implementation guidelines. In Marrakech, Fijiain COP, and then in Katowice, we successfully closed the Katowice Rulebook. Global climate policy will have a fresh start from 2021 replacing the Kyoto Protocol, providing top-down guidelines from the international legal perspective. We are opening a completely new chapter. Now that we have the legal framework, the question is how to fill this framework with concrete actions. I think the king is completely right saying now we need concrete technologies and financial resources–“means of implementation” in the Paris Agreement–to enable the transition. We detailed the meaning of technology transfer in the Kawotice Rulebook. We also detailed the financial process to take place between developed and developing countries every two years, to link needs with fresh resources coming from developed countries. There’s a strong consensus that to meet Nationally Determined Contributions, national governments need to seriously engage the private sector. What kind of policies will allow corporate activity to play a role in this without further harming people in the global south, and to be part of the solution to the climate apartheid? M.K. I think again what we need is to complete this top-down approach with a bottom-up approach. When I travel in Africa, I see a lot of communities, a lot of engaged people, who look around them and see deficits of public services and infrastructures. It provides them with food for thought. I would like that this food for thought enable Morocco, and other African countries, to fight for the future, to create new companies. We are talking here about “l’entrepreneuriat,” entrepreneurship. It is extremely important for Africa to transform these NGOs and these people looking around and seeing contaminated water and droughts, into new business solutions close to their hearts. And it is possible. A quickly developing sector for Morocco is photovoltaic (PV) pumps – pumping water with PV electricity. This new sector is enabled by technology transfer. A major part of such a system’s value added is at the local level, where installers place these PV pumps, then take care of them to make sure they function properly in the long run. There is a very important local dimension of this technological transfer which needs to be exploited by people from Morocco and from Africa. There is also concern on the organization of the global climate progress. Until now, until Katowice, we spend a lot of time discussing between governments. Starting from COP25 which is approaching in Santiago, we will meet progressively to speak more and more about the bottom-up, linking many different actors – companies, cities, regions, etc, so that concrete solutions can be applied when they are most needed. You were part of the first UN Security Council talk involving climate migration. How would you like to see the climate migration narrative develop at future environmental summits? M.K. Sometimes people do not realize there are more environmental refugees than there are economic refugees. A lot of them are intrastate, but a lot of them are going out from their country of origin. This number is only growing in time. Increased pressure from changing weather patterns, from climate changes, will increase migratory flows. Whatever we do, this issue will be part of the conversation. Right now, at the level of the security council, there’s not unanimity. There are countries which do not want this link to be deepened. I think that the right governance to speak about this subject will be more and more present in the debate. A lot of people get frustrated with inaction when they don’t see results from intergovernmental talks at a community level, and dismiss the value of international summits. What can you share from your experience to show Moroccans, people in the region, young people, that there is reason to have faith in the system? M.K. I spent a lot of time negotiating between 196 parties in order to get them to an agreement. I can assure you that I understand when people say that they are frustrated. I was frustrated many times during this process. There are things in life we know are not optimal, but all others are even worse. I think of having a consensus at the level of our planet earth, of all countries agreeing that something should be done. The Katowice Rulebook was accepted by unanimity. That’s a hard job, maybe it isn’t bringing the immediate results people expect, but it’s a necessary step. This is why it’s so important to complete this top-down framework with bottom-up dynamics. What keeps you going? At this point in our conversation, my recording cut. But, where technology failed, the proverbially mighty pen persisted. It turns out that this dilemma was timed well – Kurtyka answered my final question highlighting a shift from technology to people. I mentioned my own frustrations studying and working around climate issues, and the overwhelming feeling that sometimes comes from facing seemingly insurmountable odds. I asked, “What keeps you going?” After his first sigh and long pause of the interview, he replied, “That’s a good question.” Kurtyka explained that as an engineer and physicist, he first saw climate challenges through a technical lens. Working on solutions such as renewable energy technologies, Kurtyka was drawn further into the realm of climate change. Inevitably, his engineering mind connected to real people suffering, and the struggles of those most vulnerable to a global challenge. Ultimately, he attributed the inspiration that keeps him focused, that helped him negotiate gridlock between 196 countries, that drives his leadership efforts everyday, to “learning what it means to be a human in the 21st century.”

Rabat – Moroccan news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) shared statistics from the Spanish Ministry of Labor, emphasizing that Moroccans top foreign communities covered by social security in Spain. The statistics highlight an estimated 244,358 Moroccans covered by Spanish social security at the end of August 2019.  Nearly 1,270,675 foreign workers covered by the Spanish social security system come from outside the Euro Europe, while 862,231 people come from Europian Union countries. The Spanish statistics, according to MAP, show that Moroccans are establishing themselves as the top foreign workers contributing to social security in Spain, followed by Italians at 133,460 people, and Chinese at 107,540.” The statistics from the Spanish ministry estimated the number of Moroccans legally established in Spain at 692,379 as of July 1, 2018. DataStatistics from Statista.com shows Moroccans leading the list of the foreign population residing in Spain in 2018.  These statistics show the number of Moroccans living in Spain estimated at 682,515, followed by Romanians (675,086), UK citizens (285,698), and Italians(221,781).  China ranks fifth with a population of 183,387. Spain’s overall population was estimated at 46,72 million in 2018. The World Atlas reported in July that Moroccans and Romanians comprise make 1.7 % of the total population in Spain.

Rabat – Chariot Oil &amp; Gas has made new gas discoveries in its ‘Lixus’ Offshore License in the Mohammedia-Kenitra region.  In the Competent Persons Report on Additional Prospects, published on September 18 by Netherland Sewell &amp; Associates Inc. (NSAI), the company stated that the research carried out on five gas wells proved conclusive. Research revealed a strong gas exploitation potential. NSAI tests, conducted on behalf of Chariot Oil &amp; Gas, affirmed the potential of the “Anchois Discovery” and “Anchois Satellite” wells, as well as five other wells, which far exceed the British company’s expectations. According to the report, these gas resources “contribute towards an audited total remaining recoverable resource in excess of 2 Trillion Cubic Feet (Tcf).” Chariot Oil &amp; Gas CEO, Larry Bottomley, said in the report, “the combination of the Anchois Discovery, the Anchois Satellite prospects, and these five Additional Prospects defines a strategically significant resource.”  Bottomley stressed how important it is in a “fast-growing energy market with high gas prices and a need for increased supply.” The report also indicates that a third-party analysis of the Moroccan gas market “demonstrated a growing demand for energy with attractive domestic gas prices which, in combination with excellent commercial contract terms, underpins a commercially attractive project.”  “The Anchois Discovery offers the potential for a material, high-value project that is likely to be of strategic importance,” the report added. Chariot Oil &amp; Gas Limited and the ‘Lixus’ license Chariot Oil &amp; Gas Limited is an independent oil and gas company focused on the Atlantic margins. It holds exploration licenses covering two blocks in Namibia, three blocks in Morocco, and four blocks in the Barreirinhas Basin in offshore Brazil.  Chariot Oil &amp; Gas holds 75% interest and operatorship of Lixus, while the Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONHYM) holds a 25% carried interest in the framework of a “strategic” partnership.

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien de Phosphates (OCP), the global leader in phosphates production, experienced an encouraging return on investment in the first half of 2019 despite severe market conditions, according to a recent OCP statement. The company says it registered a positive turnover in the first half of this year, with its sales revenues standing at MAD 27.582 billion. In terms of sales growth, the numbers indicate an increase of 4% in the company’s turnover, compared to figures recorded during the same period last year. Significantly higher output, as well as an increase in phosphoric acid prices, helped the company mitigate the hampering effects of its diminished output in the rock and fertilizers sectors. This helped the company maintain its worldwide leadership position in phosphates-related products, the statement noted. Despite a positive and highly profitable global market price for rock in the first half of this year, a decline in production levels as well as lower exports limited the company’s benefits. The inverse occurred for fertilizers during the same period, though with the same effects on overall benefits. While OCP’s production levels were at a record high for fertilizers, notable declines in prices had a negative impact on turnover. In Asia, where India experienced an increased production in local fertilizers, OCP was the main exporter of phosphoric acid. This means that the Moroccan giant strengthened its leadership position in the Asian market over that period, the company’s statement explained. Reflecting on the group’s encouraging performance against all odds, the group’s CEO, Mostafa Terrab, argued that the company may have punched above its weight in the face various of market constraints. “Thanks to the group’s competitive advantages and in spite of less favorable market conditions, OCP has registered above-average results in the first half of the year,” he said. Terrab explained that OCP relied heavily on its “industrial flexibility” and “commercial agility” to meet the requirements of a mixed global demand in the first half of 2019 As some sectors were more profitable than others in the global market, the company devised a working formula to ensure overall positive performance. “Our cost leadership has allowed us to maintain our margins in this context of overall price declines,” explained Terrab. The CEO added, “At the end of the first half of 2019, the operating cash flow increased significantly compared to the same period of the previous year, thus enabling the group to reinforce its growth strategy and its cost leadership. Investment spending at the end of June 2019 is in line with our development program and we continue to realize savings thanks to the success of the completed projects.”

Rabat – Former Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has died at the age of 83. Ben Ali assumed the Tunisian presidency in November 1987 in a coup d’état.  Mounir Ben Salha,  the former president’s lawyer, confirmed his death to Euro News. Ben Ali was ousted after a popular movement erupted in Tunisia in 2011, sparking the so-called Arab Spring. Ben Ali’s death comes on the heels of the July death of Beji Caid Essebsi, Tunisia’s first democratically elected head of state. The former president fled to Saudi Arabia after Tunisia’s 2011 revolution. He was subsequently found guilty in absentia for several serious crimes, including embezzlement of public funds. A Tunisian court sentenced him in absentia to a 35 year prison sentence in 2011. In 2012, a military court handed Ben Ali a life sentence, in absentia, for “murder and looting.” After 23 years in power, Ben Ali passed the remainder of his life in exile in Saudi Arabia. The former president failed to fulfill his vows to make Tunisia a more democratic country.   Ben Ali won elections during the first two presidential pools in 1989 and 1994, the BBC reported. Ben Ali won other elections after two separate changes to Tunisia’s constitution allowed him to run for more terms. “He won his final five-year term in 2009, with his share of the vote dropping just below 90%,” the BBC said. Despite downturns during his rule, Ben Ali’s reforms in the economic sector and women’s rights received applause. A scourge of unemployment and social disparities, however, led to protests across the country, calling for radical change and a fair regime. Ben Ali was born in 1936. He completed his studies in the US and France. He rose to his first high level political position in 1980 as Tunisia’s ambassador to Poland.

Rabat – Following the publication of pictures and videos depicting bruised and wounded presumed victims of recent assault, the Directorate-General for National Security (DGSN) posted a statement on its Facebook page to clarify the issue. Boubker Sabik, provincial police chief and spokesperson for the security services, said that a technical investigation revealed the footage as “old videos” documenting “restraining acts not all crimes.” Speaking to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Sabik stressed the DGSN’s commitment to combat fake news and attempts to undermine the citizens’ sense of safety.  Sabik also pointed out that “the dissemination of violent, fabricated content harms people’s feeling of safety and drives them to identify with such content to the point of believing it… This sometimes makes the citizen victim of fear more than the criminal threat itself.” The official correspondingly added that the DGSN tries to quickly react to any violent content published, subjecting it to technical expertise and field investigations in order to address incidents of fake news. The DGSN follows a communicative approach based on systematic statements issued whenever such violent content is disseminated, in order to dispel confusion and fear. According to Sabik, the first picture was first published in May 2014, more than five years ago. It was related to a physical assault that a juvenile committed against a schoolgirl in the Casablanca’s Hassani district. “The second one portrays a Syrian victim who was physically assaulted in Jordan and has nothing to do with Morocco,” said the DGSN. The Directorate pointed out that all the photos were old.  On the other hand, Sabik stressed that national security services seriously address all pictures and recordings of alleged crimes, and consider published photos as serious reports on possible crimes. This digital content is subjected to technical and field investigation in order to verify its authenticity, determine the location and time of its occurrence, and identify victims and perpetrators. Sabik called on all citizens who have records documenting criminal acts to refer them first to police, who can use them as evidence. He explained that posting such content directly on social media can work against policing efforts.  Judicial police are required to verify the footage or photos before acting in response, giving perpetrators time to escape and evade criminal responsibility.

Rabat – A photo of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface makeup at a party held at a 2001 Arabian Night’s party went viral on social media. Time Magazine shared the photo of the prime minister with brownface. The photo was also in a school yearbook from Trudeau’s days as a teacher. In a statement to the press after the photo’s emergence, the Canadian official apologized for wearing the controversial makeup. Trudeau said, “In 2001 when I was a teacher out in Vancouver, I attended an end of year gala where the theme was Arabian Nights.” He said that he dressed up in an Aladdin costume and “put makeup on. I shouldn’t have done that. I should have known better, but I didn’t, and I’m really sorry,” he said. “I should have known better, but I didn’t, and I’m really sorry.” Photo of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at 2001 party published by Time Magazine: https://t.co/V9ZVrlLYdj pic.twitter.com/NirFQFYe03 — ABC News (@ABC) September 19, 2019  The image stirred debate among social media users, who heavily commented on both the photo and his choice to wear brownface to the party. One Facebook user wrote, “OMG! Trudeau is not in Brownface, but Blackface at the age of 29, as a teacher at a private Vancouver school, around the same time as Gropegate. This was 2001. Trudeau did not think it was racist then. It was racist then. It is racist now. Wearing blackface by white people is demeaning and disrespectful to black people. It is racism. ” Another Facebook user commented, “Trudeau has become great at giving apologies.” Others insist that Trudeau’s costume was not racist.  “OK, fight me on this… But I don’t think he needs to apologize. I wish he would stop. This was 20 YEARS AGO, and he was in character at an ARABIAN KNIGHTS themed party. Maybe there are other reasons he’s not fit to lead, but this is not one of them. I’m not even Canadian, but people need to lighten up,” one Facebook user wrote. Another Facebook user commented, “I don’t think Trudeau is a racist. I just think he is a very, very silly man. Still, doing this in 2001? I thought Canadians knew better.Also, a thought question: what’s more offensive, the term “mankind” or brownface?”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has spotlighted the role human development will play in Morocco’s future in a message sent to participants of the first National Conference on Human Development, which opened on Thursday, September 9. The conference is being held under the theme “Early childhood: a commitment for the future.” In his message, the North African King emphasized how important early childhood is, not only for individual development, but for the nation. “I am sure you realize that investing in the intangible aspects of human development – of which early childhood is a key stage – constitutes a solid basis as well as the proper starting point for building a country for the future,” he said. “This is one of the main challenges which we are seeking to meet so as to open up promising prospects and offer job opportunities to upcoming generations,” the King added in the message, read at the event by Morocco’s Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit. Although Morocco has implemented steps forward regarding early childhood issues by reducing mortality rates among children and pregnant women, improving nutrition, and widening access to primary education and healthcare, the King pointed out that there is still a long way to go. According to the King, some issues “remain l because of a lack of coordination when laying down public policy and an absence of convergence and coherence in terms of action on the ground.” He also pointed out that remaining issues are worsened by regional, economic and social disparities. “Given this chronic situation, and considering the horizontal nature of the actions carried out under the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), and the role the initiative plays as a key driver of social development, it stands out as a model to be emulated,” said the King. The INDH is a development project whose main objective is improving economic and social conditions for the poor. The project officially launched after a royal speech on May 18, 2005. The initiative is based on three main goals: To address the social deficit for urban slum and rural communities most in need, to encourage income-generating activities and creating jobs, and to respond to the essential needs of Moroccans in difficult situations. “The aim is to pool efforts, consolidate participatory mechanisms at a regional level and coordinate public policies within the framework of a multi-pronged, well-defined strategy with integrated economic, social, educational and cultural dimensions,” the King said. “Carrying out the early childhood development plan properly–a stage of critical importance in any person’s life–will help address inequalities by carefully targeting the groups concerned in needy communities,” stressed the King before reiterating his conviction to the “new vision” of the INDH. The King added that the initiative makes investing in human development “the top priority, given that it is the starting point for reforms and lays solid foundations for building the future.” He then emphasized the need for the initiative to play an integral role in formulating public policies. “This is the most appropriate way to come up with viable solutions to the real problems of the citizens, and to choose the best methods and devise the most effective ways to overcome the hurdles impeding comprehensive human development,” insisted the King. He also stressed the need to improve the healthcare system by attaching “greater importance to maternal and child health, thereby ensuring fair and equitable access to social services.” Another important development factor for the King is equal education opportunities. “There should also be a homogeneous offer regarding early childhood education, especially in rural areas, in order to combat school dropout,” he said. The King finished his message to the conference by reminding attendees what their aim should be: “To rise to the challenge of early childhood – which is a crucial stage in a person’s life – and to make sure our children are open to the future in a balanced environment where justice and equity prevail, and where poverty and social exclusion do not stand in the way.”

Rabat – A German court sentenced yesterday, September 18, a 42-year-old Moroccan truck driver, who killed a 28-year-old German student, to life imprisonment. The Moroccan man, charged with injuries leading to death against Sophia Losche, killed the student after offering the hitchhiking traveler a ride in Leipzig. On June 14, 2018, Losche wanted to travel hitchhiking from Leipzig to Nuremberg. She was going to take a train from Nuremberg to join her family in the nearby town of Amberg, but she never made it to her destination, according to her brother Andreas Losche. On June 23, 2018 the student’s body was found in Spain. The truck driver was planning to return to Morocco, but Spanish police arrested him. He was then extradited to German police custody, and his trial started in July 2019. The judges explained that the driver was sexually harassing the victim during their trip. When they stopped at a gas station, the young woman reacted aggressively and “gave the driver a punch that made him furious,” according to German newspaper Passauer Neue Presse (PNP). In response, the driver “took a wrench and hit the victim with it, at least four times, until she lost consciousness.” He then proceeded to hit her one last time on the head. The final strike was fatal. After killing his victim, the driver wrapped the woman’s body in a cover and cleaned the scene of the crime by burning the drops of blood on the asphalt. The killer was arrested in Spain nine days after his crime. In court, the driver pled guilty to his crimes hoping for a reduced sentence. He also said that he “didn’t mean to kill her, only punish her.” The victim’s family isn’t considering appealing the court’s decision.

Rabat – Algeria’s military has ordered police to ban protesters demonstrating outside the capital from entering Algiers, reported France24. After months of mass protests, the Algerian army chief announced the blockade today, September 18.  “I have instructed the national gendarmerie to deal with these actions with firmness,” said General Ahmed Gaid Salah, who is seen as de facto leader after the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. According to the news outlet, Gaid Salah said that orders had been issued to stop “vehicles and coaches used” to bring protestors to the Algiers by seizing them and “fining their owners.” Mass protests demand political reforms and the removal of the former president’s circle of loyalists, including Gaid Salah, before organizing an election. Despite this, the army chief has led the push for polls to be held by the end of the year. Gaid Salah accused “certain parties” of using “freedom of movement as a pretext to justify their dangerous behavior” and of “falsely claiming to be the voice of the Algerian people.” In spite of Gaid Salah’s accusations, the protests persist. The people are demanding a full overhaul of the regime and demand constitutional changes and other reforms before a legitimate election can be held. Presidential polls originally planned for July 4 were postponed due to the lack of viable candidates. This dragged the country into a constitutional crisis due to the fact that the 90-day mandate for Bensalah expired in early July. The army’s high command rejected any solution to the crisis other than presidential elections “in the shortest time possible.”

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture announced yesterday, Wednesday 18, the launch of renovation works on the Marinid medersa (Marinid school) and Chellah necropolis in Rabat. The Minister of Culture, Mohamed Laaraj, gave the renovation projects the green light in the presence of the Wali (governor) of Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region, Mohamed Yaacoubi. The project of restoring the Marinid medersa is under supervision by the Ministry of Culture and the Italian Agency of Cooperation and Development (AICS). The budget allocated for this first project is MAD 4 million. It aims to preserve the decorations inside the medersa, along with restoring its minaret, walls, and entrance. The second project, costing MAD 7 million, concerns Chellah necropolis and its facilities. This includes its mosque, mihrab, minaret, and the mausoleum of Abi Al Hassan.

Rabat – Moroccan project, Integration of energy efficiency in the building sector, has received a €20 million fund from the Nama Facility, an international climate finance program that seeks to encourage “ambitious action on climate change.” The project earned financial aid as part of an international contest. Commenting on securing the fund, Minister of National Territorial Development and Urban Planning Abdelahad Fassi Fehri said that the selection of the Moroccan project confirms Morocco’s “pioneering” role in the fight against greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. According to the Ministry of National Territorial Development and Urban Planning, the building sector is “one of the major energy-consuming areas in Morocco, it represents 33% of the final energy consumption and records a strong growth of the annual energy consumption.” Morocco suggested the national energy efficiency strategy to achieve energy savings of around 20% through “better use of energy in all areas.” The ministry added that the integration of energy efficiency in construction is “one of the levers that will help to meet the kingdom’s energy challenges and achieve its objectives in the fight against climate change.” Fassi Fehri said that Morocco is “strongly committed, in accordance with the guidelines of King Mohammed VI, to a worldwide movement to fight global warming and limit greenhouse gas emissions.” Morocco’s project was selected after an evaluation of all projects submitted. Experts from the NAMA Facility carried out assessments on the projects. “This project was carried out in partnership with the Ministry of Energy and Mining and the Al Omrane Group,” he said.

Rabat – As Moroccan energy companies and concerned observers await the report of the Competition Council (CC) on monopoly and anti-competition tendencies in Morocco’senergy market, news articles have circulated about the supposed existence of “secret pact” between some companies.  According to the reports, a fraudulent pact between “three major actors” in the Moroccan energy sector has been the source of most of the pricing crisis as well as other disruptions the Moroccan market has witnessed of late. The three major actors are Afriquia, Total, and Vivo Energy. In an article published in July on the contentious topic, Medias 24, a leading Moroccan economy-focused publication, appeared to suggest that the Competition Council has already reached its conclusion as to whether the three companies have breached the market’s governing regulations in terms of market competition and pricing.  “Today, we know a bit more” about the controversial topic, the article said. It went to detail, citing “sources close to the dossier,” how the council has uncovered the links between the three fraudulent companies and what the body plans to do to ensure that all three companies are severely punished. “The council has already notified the concerned companies of its findings and has accorded them two months to respond” to the findings, according to Medias 24.  In another article on September 17, the paper revealed that, when confronted with the damning evidence against them, all the three companies acknowledged the existence of deal and said they are ready to cooperate with the council. The companies want to “negotiate” less painful sanctions on the basis of “non-contestation” whereby they plead guilty in hopes of alleging the council’s punitive measures, according to the article. Building on this narrative, Moroccan outlet Le desk ran an article that pointed fingers at Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s Agriculture Minister and a shareholder in one of the companies, for his alleged involvement in the anti-competition pact at the heart of the system ailing the Moroccan energy sector. The pact, the article indicated, as it went on to lambast Akhannouch for having a hand in the “secret pact,” has been the source of the pricing instability witnessed of late in the Moroccan energy sector. The reports garnered strong reactions on various social platforms.  Many commenters have vented their frustration at the existence of such a “ruinous” and “shameful” pact between three leading companies in the Moroccan market. Most commenters were particularly angry with Akhannouch, pointing out that his status as a minister comes with a principled commitment to promoting the public good. One commenter, Youssef Chaoui, citing Medias September 17’s report, said yesterday in a Facebook post: “Afriquia, a subsidiary of Akwa Group, a company owned by Aziz Akhannouch, has just been found guilty in an ongoing investigation into anti-competition practices and pricing. The companies have recognized the facts and are opting for a non-contestation procedure. Now, the question everyone should be asking is: Is it acceptable to have a minister be involved with a company that cheats on the people?” In response to the rumored findings and the public outrage against Akhannouch and his alleged accomplices, the council was quick to issue a statement to clarify where it currently stands with the ongoing investigations.  The statement, published earlier today, emphasizes that the investigation is still ongoing. While it suspects the existence of anti-competition practices in Morocco’s energy sector, the council noted, it has not yet reached any conclusions and cannot therefore give conclusive details on the identity of the companies or officials involved in the fraudulent practices. In the statement, the council firmly “washed its hands of responsibility” in the findings and figures contained in the news reports that have been circulating.

Rabat – Security services in Asilah, a city in northern Morocco seized nearly two tons of cannabis resin on Tuesday, September 17. Security services in collaboration with members of the Gendarmerie seized 68 large bundles of cannabis resin with a  total weight of two tons, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security said. Police opened an investigation to identify all possible suspects involved in the drug trafficking network.  The investigation seeks to also determine the possible ramifications at the national and international levels. The operation is part of Morocco’s strategy to fight drug trafficking and criminal networks. In Morocco’s southern province of Laayoune, Moroccan security services also seized two tons of cannabis on Tuesday, September 17. Moroccan customs said in a report in May that they seized 19.2 tons of cannabis resin in 2018, 14.7 tons less than the number of cannabis resin seized in 2017 (33.7 tons). The customs seizures are in addition to the large quantities of cannabis that other Moroccan security services seize across Morocco. Police and customs services at the Ceuta crossing point have seized 10 kilograms of cannabis resins last weekend. A customs source told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Monday, September 16, that the security services seized the cannabis which was concealed inside a car. A Moroccan man living in Spain was driving the car. Last year, Morocco’s Spokesperson of the government Mustapha El Khalfi said that the country’s primary focus is to tighten security and surveillance against drug trafficking. He said that in the first nine months of 2018, security services seized 700 kilograms of hard drugs, 51 tons of cannabis resin, 90 tons of cannabis, and 600,000 psychotropic pills. He also emphasized Morocco’s strategy to put in place programs to fight drug addiction. Rehabilitation centers in Morocco increased from five centers in 2015 to 12 centers in 2018. Morocco seeks to have 20 centers dedicated to rehabilitation within two years.

Rabat – The High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) has sanctioned the TV channel CHADA TV and has decided to suspend the broadcast of its program “Kotbi Tonight” for a duration of three weeks.  The suspension comes as a result of singer Adil El Miloudi’s statements encouraging violence against women on the July 3 “Kotbi Tonight” show. HACA reported receiving several complaints from individuals and associations active in the field of women’s rights. At its meeting on September 17, the Higher Council for Audiovisual Communication (CSCA) also ordered the TV channel to broadcast the Council’s statement on the sanction at the usual time of broadcast of the “Kotbi Tonight”. The CSCA considered El Miloudi’s statements as infringements of the audiovisual legal and regulatory provisions, in particular, those relating to violence against women.  The CSCA described the singer’s misogynistic remarks “an apology for violence against women, an explicit incitement to violence, positively portrayed as an attribute of virility and a manifestation of affection, or even a recommendable behavior for the consolidation of conjugal bonds.” “These remarks also undermine women’s dignity, dehumanize her, and make her a “property” and a submissive being that man can treat as he pleases,” added CSCA’s statement. The Council also considered El Miloudi’s remark, “the woman always attacks the man, she always belittles him” as stigmatization of the woman. “It devotes a stereotype affecting the human value and the social role of women,” says the Council. The Council pointed out that the show’s host, Imad Kotbi, “did not react firmly and resolutely; he adopted, on the contrary, a playful and joking tone and left the guest free to repeat his assertions calling for violence against women.”   El Mildoui’s controversial remarks During the conversation that sparked the sanctions,  the popular Moroccan singer El Miloudi, confidently stated that “he who does not beat up his wife is not a real man.”   He also indicated that he still beats his wife and that he was arrested for it once in Spain. “She told the cops that I did not do anything to her; they released me 24 hours later,” he explained.  The singer further stated that “this is normal in Morocco; everyone can do whatever they want with their wife, hit her, kill her….” The singer is known for his sexist and threatening remarks. In July 2015, he threatened director Nabil Ayouch and actress Loubna Abidar after the release of their controversial movie “Much Loved” in his song “Kifach Houma Mahadrouch” (“Why didn’t they talk?”).  “Loubna Abidar, today, you are in danger. Everyone knows what you did, it will bring you only misfortune,” sang El Miloudi referring to Abidar’s sex scenes in the movie. The song continued, “Nabil Ayouch will be arrested, and we will see what “Much Loved” means then.” In March 2018, El Miloudi went live on Facebook defending the singer Saad Lamjarred, who was, at the time, suspected of rape for the second time in two years.

Rabat – A Spanish court in the city of Valencia sentenced yesterday, September 17, Moroccan athlete Jaouad Tougane to three months in prison for repeated theft. The athlete has been arrested many times for theft, the last arrest was made by Spanish police last Monday, September 16, according to Spanish newspaper Las Provincias. The athlete had accumulated a number of arrests and complaints for robbery, since June 2019. On September 11, a Spanish court handed Tougane a suspended sentence, on the condition that he did not reoffend. Tougane has since been arrested again for the same crime. On the day of his arrest, he was caught in the act of stealing at a shopping center in Benimaclet, near Valencia. However, since the value of what he tried to steal didn’t exceed €400, security guards only took notes of his personal information before releasing him. A few hours later, police arrested him in a different shopping center. A security agent of the center detained the athlete for stealing a robot vacuum cleaner and two ‘walkies-talkies’, valued at €430. Tougane stole the devices on Sunday, September 15, after outwitting security systems, but his escape was recorded by a security camera. When he returned to the shopping center the next day, Tougane was recognized and arrested by the guard. Police also charged the athlete for stealing from his interpreter’s car at the previous court hearing. Immediately after being given a suspended sentence on September 11, the Moroccan athlete stole a laptop, a cassette, and glasses from his interpreter’s car. In an interview with Las Provincias, the athlete acknowledged that he uses drugs and asked for help to beat his addiction. He also said he was going to stop stealing. Police suspect Tougane steals merchandise to sell for a lower value in order to buy drugs. In July, Playas de Castellon Athletics Club expelled Tougane following his arrests. Born in Morocco, the 27-year-old athlete has lived in Spain since his childhood. He participated in many athletics competitions. Tougane was the champion of Valencia’s Marathon in 2018. He also participated with Morocco’s national athletics team in the 5000m competitions at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Rabat – In response to the wide-range of complaints from customers, Morocco’s Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has announced that it will be reducing the number of seats on its Boeing 737-800 flights to increase passenger’s comfort. The operation, a response to the sustained criticism the company has received in the past months on various social media platforms, is designed to appeal to passengers in the economy class, some of whom have often complained about the company’s dismal treatment of economy passengers. 35 flights will be affected by the measure, according to the company. It added that the decision will be implemented gradually so as not to disrupt the company’s daily program of departures and arrivals. RAM’s Boeing 737-800 flights current consist of 159 seats in the economy class and 12 in the business class. The planned operation seeks to remove 12 seats in the economy class, so that after implementation every RAM Boeing 737-800 will have 147 seats in the economy class and still 12 in the business category. Following his trenchant criticism of RAM, whose flights he has consistently used in his latest trips between Casablanca and London, the British ambassador to Rabat, Thomas Reilly, has been widely credited with impacting the move by RAM. The British diplomat is extremely active on social media and the visibility of his repeated complaints—he has a large following on Twitter, for example— about the comfort level in RAM flights meant the company could no longer ignore its customers’ reported irritation, according to some reports. In a tweet on June 26 last year, Ambassador Reilly complained about his London-Casablanca RAM flight taking “more than an hour late.” In the same tweet, the British official also lamented that, upon landing in Casablanca, they had to wait for “nearly an hour” before the flight started unloading their luggage. “It is not surprising if people get irritated,” he said. On June 12 this year, complaining about another London-Casablanca flight, Reilley fumed at how a dismal and “uncomfortable” experience onboard a “cramped” flight. He tweeted, “Just landed in Casablanca after a really cramped and uncomfortable flight on RAM. Is it just me or have they reduced the leg-room between the seat rows?”

Rabat – Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF), has pointed fingers at the “deep-seated” corruption and “other dysfunction” at the heart of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Lekjaa’s comments came during an FRMF meeting on September 16 in Skhirat, a coastal town between Rabat and Casablanca. In his speech at the meeting, the FRMF president vented his frustration at CAF for the “unfair” and “biased” treatment Moroccan clubs have faced while participating in African tournaments. Amid the still unsettled Wydad-ES Tunis scandal, the Moroccan official’s statements reflect the feeling, widely reported in news outlets and expressed among some CAF officials in the past months, that Moroccan club Wydad was victim of a deliberate VAR-rigging by its Tunisian opponent. The VAR system at the Rades stadium in Tunis was defective on match day during the second leg between Morocco’s Wydad and Tunisia’s Esperance. The game was later stopped halfway through when Wydad players requested that the referee use VAR to confirm an equalizing goal. Only after the match did Wydad learn that the stadium’s VAR system had broken down shortly before the game. Without giving names, Lekjaa reiterated his earlier comments at the latest CAF executive meeting on reforms, saying that a “rich man” who has made his fortune in the energy sector is currently pulling the CAF strings from behind the curtains. This, he contended, is reason enough to argue that almost all of CAF’s most critical decisions in the past years have been made in a way that favors the unnamed energy mogul’s agenda. “Some teams have been benefitting” from CAF’s currently rotten management system, he claimed. Other than the “biased” ruling which he says helped deny Wydad its “legitimate right” to be the winner over ES Tunis, Lekjaa spoke of the age problem in junior African football competitions for national teams. He complained about many countries getting way with age falsification, when the ages of much older players are reduced to make them eligible for their countries’ U17 or U23 teams. A recent age falsification occurred at the latest U17 CAN in Morocco’s group, where both Guinea and Cameroon were suspected of using ineligible players. Cameroon succeeded in brushing off the accusations, showing birth certificates and other documents that helped settle the debate. But the proof against Guinea—including former passports of the two players whose age was disputed—was damming. Guinea’s U17 squad was later revealed to have indeed used two players in their twenties. But only after the tournament, whose final Guinea played and lost against Cameroon, was the West African country punished. Lekjaa also said that Morocco has provided enough proof that the U23 teams of DR Congo and Mali, both of which recently defeated and eliminated Morocco’s U23 squad from continental tournaments, used “false ages” for some of their players. But, Lekjaa blustered, CAF never punished them. The Moroccan’s indignation comes as CAF undergoes reformist winds at FIFA’s request. Recently, FIFA appointed its secretary general, the Senegalese Fatma Samoura, as a special supervisor for CAF. The Senegalese comes with a special mandate to cleanse the African footballing body of the pile of scandals its senior officials, including its president, have been associated with in the past months. Lekjaa, who was recently appointed to be part of the special committee that will be working with Samoura to root out CAF’s deep-seated corruption, finally called for “profound reforms” of CAF management. He suggested that, despite a large pool of talented players, corruption and favoritism in the highest echelons of African football are some essential reasons why the continent is still battling to reach the level of other confederations.

Rabat – A porter, also known as a human mule, died around five o’clock in the morning of September 18, while waiting on the Moroccan side of the Ceuta border. She was waiting to enter Ceuta through ‘Tarajal II’. According to El Faro de Ceuta, the incident occurred when the woman, standing on the edge of the road, fell on the breakwaters, hitting a stone. The woman died from her injuries.  “The women who knew the deceased lamented what happened,” reported the Spanish media.  Describing the porters at Tarajal II cross point, El Faro De Ceuta said, “they wait with their carts, they sleep outdoors afraid to leave their posts for other porters to take. These are third world and inhumane conditions.”  The Spanish daily pointed out that “Morocco will have to open an investigation into the facts.” Ceutaactualidad, on the other hand, reported that Morocco had already opened the investigation. The incident has again highlighted the circumstances surrounding these women ‘mules’ who wait for long hours for a chance to get a ticket to cross the ‘Tarajal II’ border. Previous incidents at Ceuta crossing checkpoints Thousands of Moroccan women cross Morocco-Ceuta border posts every day to sell their merchandise in Morocco and provide for themselves. Often, they carry up to 70 kilos and are forced to make several round trips during the day to be able to make a living. They sometimes face inhumane treatment from Spanish authorities at the crossing points. In recent years, crossing to Ceuta has caused several stampedes among porters, leading to deaths and injuries. Three stampedes occurred in 2017. The first incident occurred in March when a woman tragically lost her life in a stampede.  The second happened in April when a 50-year-old woman died under the same circumstances.  The third tragedy took place in August when two Moroccan women died while several others suffered injuries. In June 2017, Spanish authorities agreed with the Moroccan government to prevent the so-called “human mules” from crossing through Ceuta’s El Tarajal II checkpoint on the same day. The agreement allowed women to cross the border only on Mondays and Wednesdays, while men were allowed entrance on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, on January 15, 2018, another two Moroccan women died while several others suffered injuries in a stampede at one of the Ceuta’s crossing borders. The same week, on January 22, several Moroccans were injured when another stampede broke out at the Barrio Chino crossing point in the Spanish enclave of Melilla.

The statistics added that both Agadir and Marrakech recorded an increase of arrivals, 3% and 8% respectively.” Tangier also recorded a good performance with an 11% increase in arrivals. The statistics continue to show tourists’ attraction to Morocco.   Morocco’s leadership in tourism helped Morocco gain 76 of votes to host the upcoming 24th General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 2021.

منقول Posted by ‎أخبار المغرب‎ on Tuesday, 17 September 2019 The video shows the security guard screaming “You don’t have the right to enter the administration,” to a Moroccan woman. She asks “Who are you to stop me?” to which he answers loudly “I am the King!” After the guard’s angry declaration, bystanders try to calm him down, while the woman repeats, “Listen everyone, he said he is the King.” In the footage the woman explains that she was waiting for service at the ministry, she had been waiting since 8 a.m. However, the official who was supposed to receive her arrived at the office at 10 a.m. Legal office hours at the ministry begin at 9 a.m. After the official finally arrived, the woman tried to access the office. The security guard stopped her by grabbing her by the arm to which the woman reacted angrily. The video footage covers the rest of the incident. In the footage  the security guard threatens to “beat the woman against the wall,” and insults her. The situation de-escalates when other officials at the administration intervene, pulling the security guard away from the scene and trying to calm down the woman. Moroccan Internet users have shared the video on a large scale. The footage continues to garner comments and shares. “This guard should be pursued by justice for what he said,” commented one Facebook user. “The way officials in administrations treat normal citizens should be reviewed. Officials have to show some respect to other citizens because they get paid from the citizens tax money,” added another Facebook user. Over 24 hours after the initial release of the video, the official secretary at the Ministry of Education, Khalid Samadi, released a statement on Facebook. Posted by ‎خالد الصمدي – Khalid Samadi‎ on Tuesday, 17 September 2019 Samadi started the document by stating that the incident is unprecedented. “The ministry receives a large number of citizens everyday… No inappropriate behavior towards citizens has ever been recorded before,” says the release. The secretary also blamed the woman for the start of this incident. “According to witnesses, the woman was agitated… She started insulting officials and employees because the document she needed took some time to be prepared,” explains the release. However, Samadi also condemns the reaction of the security guard. “We assure [citizens] that the ministry considers the security guard’s reaction inappropriate and unacceptable, it is also incompatible with the ministry’s aims to improve its services. The guard is suspended from work, and measures will be taken to prevent incidents like this one from happening again,” announces the release. On February 26, 2019, King Mohammed VI reminded the National Forum on Senior Civil Service that, as a part of the “new development model”, his vision of a more “efficient” civil service, that civil servants must uphold principles of integrity and fairness, and ensure accountability in Moroccan public service. “Government agencies, at both central and local levels, are at a crossroads today. This means civil servants are expected to be actively involved in the country’s economic and social transformation process and support public policies and development projects in the country,” the King said. The King also emphasized what the goals of such a responsive and accountable civil service should be: “The aim is to meet citizens’ growing needs, promote social justice and guarantee a dignified life for all.”

Rabat –  Saudi Arabia has sold its consulate building in Istanbul Turkey. The building was the scene of the violent murder of where prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Turkish television channel Habturk TV, according to Al Jazeera, reported that Saudi Arabia sold the building more than a month ago. The television channel said that “a new building for the consulate had already been purchased in Sariyer district, which also hosts the US Consulate.” The news came less than a month before the first anniversary of the killing of Khashoggi in the consulate of Saudi Arabia in October 2018. Saudi Arabia has not yet confirmed the sale. The sale follows the release of an audio transcript, which provided more details about the murder of Khashoggi. Earlier this month, Turkish news outlet Daily Sabah shared part of a conversation recorded before and during the murder of the journalist. The conversation documents a talk between Maher Abdulaziz and Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy,  two people allegedly involved in the killing of Khashoggi. During the conversation, Mutreb asked Al Tubaigy if a bag would fit the body. “No. Too heavy, very tall too,” Al Tubaigy answered. He added,  “I’ve always worked on cadavers. I know how to cut very well. I have never worked on a warm body though, but I’ll also manage that easily. I normally put on my earphones and listen to music when I cut cadavers.” Upon his arrival, Khashoggi was received by Mutreb who asked him to “sit.” “We have to take you back,” Mutreb told Khashoggi. The senior Saudi intelligence officer said that there was an order from Interpol to return Khashoggi to  Saudi Arabia. “Interpol demanded you to be returned. We are here to take you,” Mutreb said. Khashoggi answered that there were no lawsuits against him. The hit squad then drugged the journalist. His last words in the audio were to ask the murderers who were trying to drug him to let him go. “I have asthma. Do not do it, you will suffocate me.” Al Jazeera quoted the Turkish television channel emphasizing that Saudi Arabia is also attempting to “sell the consul general’s official residence, which is located very close to the consulate. But they can’t yet find a buyer.”

Rabat – Police in Tangier arrested on Tuesday a 23-year old Danish national of Somali origin who was the subject of an international arrest warrant. Danish authorities issued the arrest warrant against the suspect for illegal possession of a firearm. Danish security services issued the arrest warrant against the suspect on May 24, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said on September 17. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation, pending an extradition procedure. The operation is part of the DGSN’s cooperation mechanism against cross-border crimes. Police in Marrakech also arrested in May a Danish national who was the subject of an international wanted person notice. Interpol issued the notice against the 30-year old Danish national for his alleged involvement in a criminal network and a serious assault in Denmark. In May, DGSN announced that security services in Marrakech had arrested 13 international suspects between May 16, 2018, and May 2019. The Moroccan police also carried out 16 international arrest warrants during the same period. Moroccan security forces regularly carry out operations, similar to the case of the Danish national, to arrest suspects under international search warrants. Morocco’s security services are working with international bodies on operations including tracking suspects involved in undocumented migration networks,  and the fight against illegal psychotropic drug traffickers, terrorism, and extremism.

Rabat – Morocco’s Wydad Athletic Club is not happy with CAF’s final verdict in the controversy with Tunisia’s Esperance de Tunis over the second leg final of the African Champions League. On Sunday, September 15, CAF, the governing body of African football, sided with ES Tunis’s appeals in its final verdict. CAF declared the Tunisian club the rightful winners of the trophy. This was supposed to be the end of long off-pitch battle between the two clubs. But in a surprising move after CAF’s final verdict, the Moroccan club has said it plans to file yet another complaint to contest CAF’s ruling. Wydad is taking advantage of the fact that it has 10 days to protest the ruling before the decision becomes binding and irreversible. “We will fight for our rights until the very end,” Wydad chairman Said Naciri has been quoted as saying just hours after CAF’s verdict was made public. Naciri said that his team “has been fighting for more than two months” to expose the “oppression” and other outrageous treatment they were subjected to before, during, and after the second leg at the Rades stadium on the outskirts of Tunis. “Esperance does not deserve to win if we take into account the way things unfolded in Rades,” the Wydad president argued. But the surprise, even irony, in Wydad’s resolve to “fight until the end” means the club is determined to rush into taking its final complaint to an entity, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which has already ruled that ES Tunis should be the champions. After the controversial second leg match in May, CAF initially opted for a rematch. But both Wydad and EST felt they had been wronged. The two clubs took the matter to CAS, each arguing that it should be the rightful winner. CAS then overruled CAF’s rematch decision but declared EST as more legally deserving of win. Other than Wydad’s complaint about CAF’s rematch ruling, CAS said then, its case for winning the match was not legally compelling. CAF’s latest verdict was a confirmation of CAS previous ruling, which raises questions as to what Wydad really hopes to get from yet another complaint with yet another body that has already delivered in favor of the opposing side. But Wydad’s Naciri does not see the matter this way. He sees neither irony nor contradiction in Wydad’s resolve to file a complaint with CAS. In his statement, he appears to evince confidence that maybe this time CAS, suddenly realizing that its previous ruling had missed some elements of the controversy, will give Wydad’s indignation the support and validation it deserves. “Our next step will be to bring the case to CAS,” Naciri said, adding that he expects the court to deliver in a spirit of “equity.”

Rabat – The planet Earth does not belong to us, and education that promotes global citizenship through green schools may be the only thing that can save it. Earth is an exceptional habitat, handed down to us from our parents and grandparents to live on and to pass on to future generations intact. Unfortunately, for decades we have almost criminally over-exploited this legacy to satisfy our destructive instincts of wealth and power. We unscrupulously burn forests, our own vital lungs. We pollute our rivers and oceans with plastics. We poison the air with toxic gases. In short, we methodically murder our mother Earth, without flinching. Today, our mother Earth suffers, and, like any sick body that sounds the alarm by breaking out with fever, it is calling us to order before it is too late, by the means of global warming. Will we show responsibility and stop the carnage? I believe education is our only hope for survival: Educating people in schools, in streets, in factories, in political parties, in civil society associations, etc., to be global citizens. Global citizenship aims to help us achieve the kind of world we dream to live in by valuing ecological harmony, pacifism, solidarity, and democracy. Sharing a single planet with limited resources and space, we need to learn to live better together, in peace and harmony with nature. Living together means embracing the values ​​of solidarity and democracy. To live in peace is to defend pacifist values. Living in harmony with nature is at the very heart of ecological values. To become a green citizen is to promote a greener, more peaceful, more united, and more democratic world. Becoming a green citizen and educating others to do so means to strive to educate young people and adults to reflect on the world around us and the values ​​that drive it. It is also to train critical and responsible citizens to take action so that this world lives up to their aspirations. Faced with the important human challenges in today’s world, we urgently need education! Ecology proposes a certain vision of the world. It is thinking globally by acting locally. As a science, ecology relies on knowledge of the relationships between species, individuals of the same species, and their environment. Applied to the human being, ecology critiques the mechanisms that manage human activity. Ecologists study the impact of this activity on the environment and, in return, the modifications that these changes bring about in nature. To aspire to an ecological world is to learn to recognize one’s responsibility towards one’s physical environment and to learn to live in symbiosis with nature. Pacifism is a commitment to achieving one’s goals through non-violent means. On the individual level, it is to recognize that every human being has the right to live in safety and to meet his fundamental needs. It is to oppose any action that deprives others of these inalienable rights. Collectively, it means ensuring respect for human rights and ensuring universal access to water, air, food, medical care, and social justice. Pacificism opposes violence and war between human groups, whether for ethnic, religious, cultural, ideological, gender or resource ownership reasons. It strives for the establishment of a permanent international peace. Being united means taking into account the ties that bind us to our peers and to our social, ecological, and cultural environment. It is, also, to realize that there is a reciprocal dependence and a mutual responsibility between human beings. What happens to one affects the others. This solidarity is also exercised between the generations. Our generation has both a debt towards those who preceded us and a legacy to transmit to the generations who will follow. We must also recognize the existence of a common good to be shared equitably among all the beings that populate the planet. Solidarity is defending the systems that distribute the common wealth and protect the poor. Democracy is about providing people with means to live together in a way that benefits everyone. It is a system where individuals can change leaders peacefully and the government has the right to govern because the people have given it that right. Proper democracies function based on the principle of equal rights, opportunities, and treatment, and respect for a number of fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of thought, expression, or association. To fight for a democratic world is to oppose arbitrariness, injustice, corruption, inequality, competition, and the power of money. Learning rights and responsibilities, participating in society, and shaping the common good are essential to the exercise of citizenship. Environmental education for sustainable development is one of the best ways to hope that our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren can inherit a healthy planet and flourish in it. Across the globe the environmental, social, and economic challenges are enormous. Along with promoting the values of ecological harmony, pacifism, solidarity, and democracy, there are five things mankind must do to succeed. First, everyone must become aware of the state of the world, both in its beauty and in its injustices. Second, everyone must acquire fundamental knowledge about the environment and our links to it. Third, we must develop a sense of belonging to our environment, reverence for the Earth, and motivation to improve the world. Fourth, we must gain the skills to, observe, analyze, and transform our own realities. Finally, everyone must contribute individually and collectively to solving environmental, social, and economic problems. The best school involves action and participation. You may have heard othe slogan “reduce, reuse, recycle.” I want to add restructure, redistribute, and re-evaluate to that list. If we have a hope to leave a better world to future generations, teachers cannot wait to act until they have mastered all the knowledge related to sustainable development. They will have to act according to their common sense by trusting their personal knowledge. School has always been, along with the family, one of the main places to pass on the values ​​of society. In the current context, it must do more. It must become a place of social transformation, a place where we make the future possible. This certainly involves educating, but above all it includes acting. We learn really well in action. There are six main principles that structure action within a green school. The first five are: Reducing the consumption of resources like wood, water, and paper; recycling products; restructuring our economic systems through community development, cooperation, equitable exchanges, and fair trade; redistributing resources by sharing and supporting the poor; and reusing products by maintaining, repairing, and recreating them. The final principle of a green school is re-evaluating our value systems by resolving conflicts peacefully, reaffirming the importance of human relations and solidarity, and preferring “being” over “having.” In short, a green school is an institution where we think globally and act locally to foster a sustainable future. It is a place where concrete, ongoing actions can be taken to help build a greener, more peaceful, and more democratic world. Green schools value ​​the commitment of young people and adults by making their efforts known and recognized socially. It is an institution that opens up to the community and the world and proudly displays its achievements and actions, however small!

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani reportedly dismissed the secretary general of the Ministry of Health, Hicham Najmi, on September 17. The news went viral on Moroccan media this evening. Morocco’s news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has not confirmed yet the official’s dismissal. Najmi has been at the center of a controversy over the last two months after a woman, who was allegedly with him in a hotel room in Agadir, jumped from a window in an alleged “suicide attempt.” Local media reported earlier this month that the professor is facing charges  for his involvement in the incident. He may be charged with making “false statements,” and not helping a “person in danger.” The now-former secretary general claimed that the accusations against him are “rumors.” He claimed that he was accompanied by his wife when the accident took place. He said that the woman who jumped was in a nearby room at the second floor. Najmi told French speaking news outlet Le360 in August that he went to the room to help, but he found that the girl had fallen after she slipped from the window. The Ministry of Health appointed the official as a Secretary General  in April 2018.

Rabat – Morocco has urged the members of the UN Security Council to take concrete steps to end Israeli violations against the legitimate rights of Palestinians. Secretary of State to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mounia Boucetta, delivered a speech on Sunday, September 15, at the emergency meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In her speech, the official said that the persistent violations by the Israeli authorities “undermine the two-state solution and hinder international efforts to revive the peace process.” She added that Israel’s violations against the legitimate rights of Palestinians constitute a “constant source of tension, extremism, hatred, and instability” in the Middle East. Boucetta also reiterated Morocco’s strong condemnation of the recent statements from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the “annexation of the Jordan Valley and the northern part of the Dead Sea.” “These statements constitute a dangerous escalation, foreshadow a further violation of international law, and resolutions of international legitimacy, and undermine all efforts to find a just and comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.’ Boucetta also reminded the attendees of the symposium of Morocco’s unwavering support for the Palestinian people. “The Palestinian question and Al-Quds Al-Sharif will remain at the heart of the Middle East conflict and at the center of the attention of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which was established to defend the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” she said. The secretary of state also highlighted the special interest of HM King Mohammed VI, Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, in promoting the just cause of the Palestinians.

Rabat – The training ship and official flagship of the Colombian Navy, “ARC Gloria,” docked yesterday, September 16, in Casablanca.  The ship will remain in Morocco’s economic capital until Thursday, September 19, as part of an initiative aiming to strengthen Morocco-Colombian relations. The visit of the 51-year-old ship coincides with the bicentenary of Colombia’s independence, along with the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Bogota, the Colombian capital, and Rabat. “This anniversary is an opportunity to reaffirm our exceptional friendship and cooperation ties,” said Maria Del Pilar Gomez Valderrama, the Colombian ambassador to Morocco. The Colombian diplomat also announced the signature of several agreements between Morocco and Colombia. The agreements aim to develop activities in different sectors of common interest, including education, culture, sport, trade, and tourism. The ARC Gloria set sail from Cartagena, Colombia on June 7, 2019, to start a world tour. The ship stopped over Boston, United States (from June 21 to 24) and then travelled to Saint-Malo, France (July 16–19). The ship also docked in Lithuania, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands. Before sailing to Casablanca, the ARC Gloria also docked in Liverpool, United Kingdom (August 30-September 2). Casablanca is the ship’s last stopover before going back to Cartagena, on October 18. The ARC Gloria is a three-masted ship. It is 65 meters long and has 23 sails. The ship’s crew is composed of 165 sailors. The ship is considered a “floating ambassador” of Colombia, according to Gomez Valderrama. The ARC Gloria also serves as a training ship for the Colombian National Armada officers.

Rabat – Proma, an Italian group specializing in the design and manufacture of sub-assemblies and metal components for the automotive industry, inaugurated a factory in Kenitra today, September 17. The factory was built in just 6 months, which Morocco’s Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment Moulay Hafid Elalamy said is a “record in Morocco.” He added that Proma, in collaboration with the Ministry of Industry, intends to top their own record and are already both hoping to soon build a factory in only 5 months. Proma invested a total of MAD 320 million in the project and plans to invest as much in future ventures in Morocco, said the minister during a speech at the opening ceremony of the factory. Elalamy also added that “the Ministry of Industry will ensure that the plant fills with orders from both PSA and Renault.” “Facilities and machines with the best technological tools have been put in place to adequately meet the quality and competitiveness requirements demanded by the global market,” he said. Construction of the factory began in the third quarter of 2018. Extension works are already scheduled and will start at the end of 2020, in order to meet an increased demand in production from the group in Morocco. Proma already has a factory in operation in Casablanca’s Renault Somaca industrial park, where the group assembles and delivers seats for Somaca, a Moroccan car manufacturer currently owned by Renault. The factory is expected to create 121 direct jobs and an annual turnover of MAD 250 million in export, making it the latest boost of many the automotive industry has given to Morocco’s employment industry. In May, the Ministry of Industry and Trade reported that the automotive industry recorded the strongest job creation between 2014 and 2018. During that time, sector created a total of 116,611 jobs.

Rabat – The trial of controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders hit the headlines last week with speculation that the Dutch Ministry of Justice has been involved in the case. According to RTL nieuws, the Public Prosecutor and the Ministry of Justice have been collaborating in the trial. Geert Wilders was convicted of inciting discrimination in 2016, as a result of his controversial pledge for “fewer Moroccans” in Holland during his election campaign of 2014. Throughout the five years of his trial, Wilders has always maintained the position that his trial was politically motivated, not in line with the principles of the rule of law.  While the Public Prosecutor did not seem convinced initially, top-ranking civil servants of the Ministry of Justice described Wilder’s remarks as “malevolent” and “racist” in a highly confidential message.The ministry subsequently recommended that the Public Prosecutor proceed with the trial in 2014, according to RTL nieuws.   Wilders has strongly condemned the recent developments and has filed an official complaint against the Public Prosecutor. The Prosecutor however maintains the position that the decision to initiate prosecution was not influenced by any other parties and was enacted in accordance with the rule of law. Prime-Minister Mark Rutte has refused to comment, he says that since Wilders’ case is still in process at the court of The Hague he is not in a position to comment.  After the conviction in 2016, Wilders made an appeal to the court for a dismissal of the case. Despite his appeal, the court at the Hague ruled in favour of proceeding with the trial last Friday.

Rabat – Moroccan diplomacy continues its efforts to garner support for its position on Western Sahara. On Tuesday, September 17, in Rabat, Britain’s Secretary of State for International Development, Middle East, and North Africa Andrew Murrison reiterated his country’s full support for the UN process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara. The British official said, “It is important to reaffirm the position already expressed by the United Kingdom, that we fully support the UN process.” The minister added that his country also backs the “serious and credible efforts made by Morocco” in the political process to end the dispute over Western Sahara. Murrison made his statement after talks with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs  Nasser Bourita. The British official visit to Morocco is part of a visit of a UK delegation in the framework of the second session of the Morocco-Great Britain Strategic Dialogue, held in Rabat today, September 17. Good trade partners Morocco maintains strong diplomatic ties with the UK. Speaking at a press conference, Bourita commented that the Moroccan-British relations are “moving towards the establishment of a true strategic partnership.” Bourita also spoke about trade between both countries, emphasizing that there has been a positive trend in business over the last two years. He announced that several meetings will take place next year to strengthen the bilateral economic and trade cooperation between Morocco and the UK. During the UK-Morocco Strategic Dialogue, Murrison expressed his satisfaction at being part of the meeting. “I was delighted to attend the second UK-Morocco Strategic Dialogue in Rabat this week. This important meeting demonstrates the depth and breadth of the friendship between the UK and Morocco,” he said. The official also expressed hopes of seeing the UK and Morocco’s relationship “go from strength to strength.” The UK is among the top six foreign investors in Morocco, according to the UK government. “UK links to Anglophone Africa and Morocco’s Francophone African links create a platform for new business relationships. UK exports of goods to Morocco £573 million in 2014. Bilateral trade in goods and services is worth around £1.8 billion,” the government website said. UK exports to Morocco include vehicles, iron and steel, mineral fuels, aircraft and spacecraft, and man-made staple fibers. UK Trade Policy Minister, Conor Burns said during the 2nd UK-Morocco Strategic Dialogue that  both countries’ “economies have a lot to offer one another, and today’s Strategic Dialogue clearly shows the growing opportunities for great British companies to do business in Morocco.” Morocco and the UK also expressed determination to reinforce education partnerships. Representatives from the UK education system visited Morocco in July for potential partners and investors with the goal of opening more British schools in Morocco. “I would like to see more British education here in Morocco: there is so much the British and Moroccan education systems can achieve together,” British Ambassador to Morocco, Thomas Reilly, said in a statement. “The visit this delegation of British educators offers is a magnificent chance to take that leap forward together.” Statistics from  Studying-in-UK.org indicates that the number of Moroccan students enrolled at UK universities increased by 13% between the 2014/15 and 2017/18 school years.

Rabat – The penetration rate of contraband cigarettes in the domestic market has reached 5.23% in 2019.  At a meeting of the National Commission Against Cigarette Smuggling, held on September 12, the commission presented the results of its 6th study on the prevalence of contraband cigarettes. The meeting was held at the headquarters of the Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII).  According to the study, this rate increased compared to 2018, where it was only 3.73%. However, the rate decreased compared to 5.64% in 2017 and 7.64% in 2016, according to a statement from the ADII. Representatives of the ADII, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Presidency of the Public Ministry, the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), and the Gendarmerie Royal, all attended the meeting. The meeting was “an opportunity to open a debate about the evolution of cigarette smuggling and joint measures to put in place to counteract this phenomenon,” concludes the statement. ADII measures to fight against contraband A 2010 ADII publication says that in recent years, Moroccan Customs started a process of reforming the control of production and importation of certain goods subject to internal consumption taxes (ICT). “The objective is to prevent fraud and smuggling and improve its results while optimizing its human and material resources through the adoption of less intrusive and more efficient control methods,” says the ADII. Since 2010, the administration has undertaken two major initiatives. The first is the adaptation of a legislative and regulatory system to provide for dematerialized control, and extend it to all the goods concerned (alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages and manufactured tobacco). The second is the establishment of an integrated and secure tax marking system called “Automated Integrated Marking System in Customs” (SAMID).  The new tax marking system can be used in real-time and remotely on both locally produced products and those imported. After the 2019 Finance Bill established an increase in the domestic consumption tax on certain cigarette brands. The new prices of cigarettes came into effect on January 1. Marlboro is now sold for MAD 35 instead of MAD 32 and Marquise for MAD 21.5 instead of MAD 20. While the Moroccan Company of Tobacco (SMT) agreed to support the government’s decision to increase the tax on cigarettes, some tobacco companies in Morocco reportedly doubted the seriousness of the  2019 Finance Bill. The tobacco companies predicted that the tax increase will aid in creating a market for smuggled tobacco.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Health announced yesterday, September 16, the reduction in the price of nine different medications. These reductions aim to minimize the medical expenses of Moroccans, explained the ministry in Morocco’s latest official bulletin. The drugs with the largest price reductions include Epotin 2000 and Epotin 4000, both used in the treatment of anemia caused by kidney diseases. The first had its price reduced from MAD 2.500 to MAD 1.951, the second was discounted from MAD 4.132 to MAD 3.432. The price changes and names of each medication can be found on the table.  The Ministry’s decision to reduce prices comes as part of the implementation of the national drug policy, specifically decree 2.13.852, issued on December 19, 2013. The decree aims to make it more difficult for companies to sell essential medicines at extortionate prices. Since putting this policy into effect, the ministry has been reducing the cost of drugs in groups. So far, over 3.000 pharmaceutical medicines are now more affordable for the public. The medicines chosen for reduction are mostly those used to treat chronic illnesses including cancer and mental illnesses.

Rabat – Media coverage is taking climate change by storm this week. It makes sense – the climate crisis affects us all, and real-life challenges such as rising sea levels, freshwater scarcity, and increasing natural disasters force the challenge into the discussion. But let’s be real. The media, especially from my native U.S., has not done justice to the most important story of our time. A scientific story, a human story, has often been presented as a political story. Climate deniers have long been granted equal voices to the 97% of scientists who agree on climate change. Morocco World News is taking part in Covering Climate Now, a global initiative including over 250 news outlets who have pledged a week of solid climate coverage leading up to the September 23 UN Climate Action Summit. Everyone at MWN is taking on a role, and we’re proud to be part of solution-based journalism, raising awareness. We understand our responsibility to use our voices to accurately cover the climate crisis and are committed to doing our part for humanity’s habitat. Journalists are not the first to say “enough is enough.” The climate strike movement led by Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion has amassed millions of participants from every corner of the globe. Youth voices, from Thunberg’s native Sweden, to Jerusalem where Israeli and Palestinian teens have protested side by side, have forced the international community to turn their faces towards the stark reality of the climate crisis. Youth, alongside older generations, will participate in the movement’s climate strike kicking off this Friday in over 1,000 cities worldwide. As sea levels rise, the tides of climate justice turn. This begs the question, why is everyone making so much noise? In my 20 years of climate activism, I’ve noticed that people usually address ‘the environment’ as a separate entity. In reality, we are all part of a complex ecosystem. Climate change isn’t just about planting trees and preserving coral reefs. It’s about ensuring a prosperous future for humanity and all life on Earth. Let’s look at the science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the intergovernmental body whose reports inform policymakers on climate science. IPCC publications informed Paris Agreement negotiations on the critical need to curb fossil fuel emissions and limit global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Inaction’s consequences were dire enough to bring 196 countries to a consensus on climate change. The world acknowledged that the climate crisis is an imminent threat, and that it’s caused partly by human activity. Following a request from governments, a 2018 IPCC report explored projected consequences between limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C – a non-binding goal from the Paris agreement – and the pledged 2°C cap. Some differences in a future of 1.5°C vs 2°C:
– 10 million fewer people would be forced from their homes due to rising sea levels.
– 117 million fewer people would experience water scarcity.
– 23% less of the world’s population would be exposed to severe heat waves at least once every five years. One point to absorb like a healthy Amazon drinking in CO2: Scientists involved in the report agreed that science, technology, and funding can allow the world to meet this goal. The task will be nearly impossible, but with enough political will, we can succeed. This science also shows that climate change is a human rights issue. So does response by global leaders. Earlier this week, Kumi Nadoo, Secretary General for Amnesty International, released a request to 30,000 schools worldwide. He asked that they allow youth participation in the September 20-27 climate strike, highlighting climate change’s weight in human rights: “The climate emergency is the defining human rights issue for this generation of children. Its consequences will shape their lives in almost every way imaginable. The failure of most governments to act in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence is arguably the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history.” Climate change doesn’t discriminate based on borders, but reports increasingly highlight vast inequalities in climate crisis’s effects. Climate change will have–is already having–a more severe impact on the world’s most vulnerable people. This includes demographics such as island nation residents, those already living in poverty, and women and children. A UN Special Rapporteur recently released a report detailing the climate crisis as a “climate apartheid.” Climate change has also been termed a “threat multiplier” for conflicts. The Pentagon, even under a climate-denying President, places great importance on national security in a changing climate. Climate change does not cause conflict, but it can exacerbate contributing factors to shape devastation. Many experts have strongly linked Syria’s civil war and the rise of ISIS to resource shortages exacerbated by climate change. Increasing numbers of people are displaced both internally and beyond borders due to climate-related challenges. In 2019, for the first time ever, the UN Security Council discussed the threat of climate change on increasing migration pressures. They did so because this challenge is only growing in magnitude. Without peace, there can be no development. The climate crisis isn’t just about protecting endangered species and preserving coral reefs. It’s about adapting, mitigating, and shifting the way we live, consume, and govern to safeguard the future of human prosperity. The climate crisis may seem overwhelming and insurmountable. Recent stories show how people around the world, especially children, are facing anxiety and depression in the face of an existential crisis. It’s true that we’re facing an unprecedented global challenge. But many scholars and professionals across all fields and sectors see opportunity in climate crisis solutions. If ignored, the climate crisis will have catastrophic impact. If addressed properly, the climate crisis could fuel a transition to an even more prosperous world than we enjoy now. Impact investing increasingly shifts how the world’s wealth is entrusted to enterprises and projects that protect our natural environment and prioritize human well-being. The Green New Deal outlines how a radical sustainability shift will provide jobs, social services, and improve quality of life for all Americans, and for those around the world affected by our consumer behavior. The Global Commission on Adaptation recently released a report on the “triple dividend,” explaining how investment in disaster risk management can yield major financial gains by avoiding economic losses, encouraging innovation, and providing social and environmental benefits. We’re talking trillions between 2020 and 2030. The climate crisis is an opportunity to review the way we live and to improve strained systems. Humans face an unprecedented challenge. As of 1880, temperature patterns and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were in sync with hundreds of thousands of years of historical fluctuations. In the blink of an eye in the course of human civilization, industrialization altered the fabric of human activity. Over thousands of years, humans weren’t traveling the world by airplane, harnessing the power of plastics in advanced medicine, able to turn a dial to heat their homes during winter. When I asked my 93-year-old grandmother what, in her lifetime, has improved, I expected a romanticized answer. As someone who grew up on a farm and rode a horse to school, I thought she might be upset by encroaching urban jungles and political hatred spewing on TV. But she responded, “Everything.” We’ve benefited from industrialization in almost every facet of life. The industrial shift now requires another unprecedented systemic change. I strongly believe that our globalized community – people innovating medical care via smartphones, people on track to explore Mars – is up for the challenge. This week I spoke with COP24 President Michal Kurtyka, and with President and Founder of the Moroccan Youth Climate Movement, Fadoua Brour. I explained the Covering Climate Now challenge, and asked what they thought I should highlight in terms of introductory climate discussion. Neither answered “emissions projections.” Both told me it’s important to look at climate change in light of the issues we see on the ground. Linking climate and employment was Brour’s first reaction. Kurtyka emphasized waste, water scarcity, and urban air pollution. Morocco is not a historic polluter. Yet Morocco, and the MENA region at large, is set to suffer some of the greatest effects of climate change. Desertification, rising temperatures, and water scarcity are already affecting agricultural production, Morocco’s biggest source of GDP and employment. It is very likely that climate change contributed to the recent floods in southern Morocco that claimed at least 25 human lives. Morocco faces a major challenge adapting to a changing climate, and placing emissions mitigation measures within its rapid development. Per international consensus, developed countries, who built their success on exploiting fossil fuels – often extracted from the developing world and leaving devastating legacies in their wake – have a responsibility to help developing countries progress sustainably. This means enabling technology transfers, and it means honoring financial commitments. This is called North-South differentiation. King Mohammed VI has repeatedly called for greater follow-through with these responsibilities. Morocco is a leader in addressing climate change through a renewable energy shift. The kingdom ranked second worldwide in the 2019 Climate Change Performance Index for its trajectory to curb emissions. According to Climate Action Tracker, it is one of only two countries on Earth on track to curb emissions to the 1.5°C limit urged by the IPCC. But there is still a long way to go. The struggle will require combining top-down approaches with bottom-up approaches. It will require overhauling the global energy system. All humans are stakeholders, and all stakeholders will need to engage. It is widely argued that one of the best things to do about climate change is talk about climate change. On behalf of Morocco World News, I invite all readers to join this conversation.

Rabat – “‘I’m very pro-Israel, myself, so I was on these forums, having these discussions, and then all of a sudden here’s this guy with an Arabic name talking about Zionism and how the Jews are the real inhabitants of the Land of Israel,’ Rettig said.” Arab hegemony The quote is from a recent article by the Times of Israel  on the supposed historical and religious links between the Jews and Amazigh. The two peoples are said in the article to have shared interests or common goals in the fight for political recognition and cultural emancipation. The report, shining a light on the poor living conditions of Mohamed, an English major at the Moulay Slimane University of Beni Mellal, presents the Amazigh in Morocco as struggling for autonomy and socio-cultural emancipation from Morocco’s Arab elite. Martha Rettig, the woman quoted at the beginning, is presented as some kind of savior whose online advocacy to collect solidarity funds has helped Mohamed and his family get through the harsh weather of the High Atlas Mountains. Mohamed’s family’s—and hometown’s—utter lack of resources is due, we are told, to the Moroccan government’s perceived lack of interest in marginalized and ostracized Berber villages. Mohamed’s village and his last name are not revealed because, the Israeli paper writes, his university teachers and friends—and even perhaps his neighbors—will surely harm him if they knew that he is pro-Israel or his family and education is sustained by Israeli generosity. “Some people here are crazy and I’m afraid for my safety. Please don’t use my pics or family name I beg you, because it’s serious here,” Mohamed  told the newspaper shortly before they ran the report. What is “serious,” the piece comments throughout, is both the unbearable lives of the village-dwelling Amazigh and the supposed Arab supremacy under which they live. They have been “Arabized” and “Islamized” and are denied access to Morocco’s most visible jobs and government positions, the kinds of promotion that bring political and economic clout. Rettig and Mohamed met on Facebook and the Israeli woman was immediately “touched” by his life story. But implied in the larger narrative of the story is a supposed historical affinity between Jews and Berbers. This is based on the claim that Islam and Arabs somehow constitute an existential threat to the survival of both peoples. According to Rettig, while Jews have relatively stood the challenge (mainly after the creation of the State of Israel), the article implied, Amazigh are still living under Arab religious and socio-political hegemony. The report claims that Amazigh identify with Israel’s fight for legitimacy, which they equal to their own long standing struggle against Arab supremacy. “There are huge natural resources, and the [Arab] leadership has all the control over it. They have not at any time invested in infrastructure for the Amazigh population,” Rettig told the Israeli newspaper. “Many Amazigh have become so Arabized through an intentional move by the Arab leadership over the last 60 years or so.” At some point in the report, Mohamed is also presented an activist for Amazigh rights and Amazigh self-determination. The movement seeks, according to the report, an Amazigh awakening in Morocco. It wants to force its tribesmen out of the alleged identity slumber in which they have been plunged by Morocco’s state-sponsored Arabization and Islamization policies. So pervasive and entrenched is Morocco’s Arab and Islamic identity, Rettig said, that “a large number of Amazigh don’t speak the language nor feel the need to reanimate the culture.” More still, the report commented, some Moroccans “of Amazigh heritage who no longer identify as such, can be hostile, and even violent, to people involved in the [Amazigh autonomy] movement.” Uncertain diplomatic relations The article comes amid rickety relations between Israel and Morocco. While there are reports of unofficial warm relations between the two countries—mainly through economic developments—Morocco has remained a staunch advocate of the Palestinian cause in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. When President Trump announced, in the early days of his presidency, that the US was moving its embassy to Jerusalem, tens of thousands took to the streets in Rabat and Casablanca to protest against the move. Moroccan demonstrators sang songs of Palestinian liberation and expressed brotherly solidarity with the Palestinians. The article claims that for Mohamed, however, the demonstrations smelled of hypocrisy and willful ignorance of Morocco’s own problems. Instead of fighting for Palestinians, he suggested in comments to the Israeli newspaper, Moroccans should look much closer home to the squalor of the Amazigh people. “We’re struggling, and meanwhile, people just go out and hoist a Palestinian flag because Trump said Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,” he said. “But it’s fine. Because the [Moroccan] government does whatever it wants, and nobody ever says a word about the people living in the high Atlas Mountains.” But Mohamed and his family are not the only beneficiaries of Rettig’s Zionism-flavored generosity. By her own admission, Rettig is an ardent defender of the Jewish state and her online activism is mainly designed to advance the cause and aspirations of the state of Israel. But her Amazigh-directed activism is not always financial. She says that with some other Amazigh acquaintances not as needed as Mohamed, her relationship is focused on shared ideas and feelings in terms of religion, the state of Israel, and what she sees as the historical right of Israel over the vast majority of the disputed territories in the Israel-Palestine conflict. “She is the friend and confidant of an Amazigh man in the northern Moroccan city of Nador who is seeking to convert to Judaism,” the Times of Israel’s piece said of Rettig. “Rather than financial assistance, she provides moral support. But Mohamed, and a few others like him, hold a special place for her.” In the past months, there have been talks of normalization between Israel and Morocco. But Rabat has brushed off the suggestion, repeatedly “reiterating” its “principled” and “unwavering” commitment to the “Palestinian cause.” Most recently, the Moroccan government “firmly condemned” Israel’s Prime Minister’s annexation plans for the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, again reaffirming its uncompromising support for Palestine. In such a context, the story of Israeli humanitarian activism in the High Atlas has been widely interpreted in Moroccan publications as an Israeli-government-sponsored move to hit back at Morocco. “Israel will stop at nothing to force the sympathy of Morocco and Moroccans,” Maghreb Intelligence wrote recently, as it reported the Times of Israel story. According to the report, Rettig’s politically motivated humanitarianism is a case in point of how “Israel exploits the suffering of rural Amazigh” to score political points. Rettig said she will continue her humanitarianism and pro-Israel activism with other contacts in Morocco. Meanwhile, Rabat has been silent on the issue. The Moroccan government’s silence appears to stem from a profound conviction that, given the number of recent reforms, the radical movement described by Rettig is a tiny drop in the country’s Amazigh population, and utterly unrepresentative of how most Amazigh Moroccans feel towards their country.

Rabat – Senegalese Foreign Affairs Minister Amadou Ba has reiterated his country’s commitment and ongoing support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. Morocco submitted the plan to the United Nations in 2007 as a way to reach an agreed upon and mutually acceptable political solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara. The Senegalese official made his statement on Monday, September 16, following a meeting with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita. “I would like to reiterate in this regard the strong and constant support of the Republic of Senegal for the Moroccan Sahara, a position that Senegal has been defending for a long time,” said the official. Ba is in Morocco as part of an official two days visit, the first of its kind since his appointment in April 2019. The Senegalese official also reaffirmed Senegal’s determination to support the  UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. During a joint press conference, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita expressed his satisfaction with the strong diplomatic relations between the two African states. He added that Senegalese diplomacy has always been an ally to Morocco in its fight for territorial integrity. “The kingdom will always be grateful for this strong and active position expressed regularly at regional and international meetings,” he added. Counterterrorism In addition to Western Sahara, the meeting’s agenda also touched on Morocco’s efforts to fight extremism and terrorism in Africa. The Senegalese official said that Morocco has developed expertise in the fight against terrorism. He added that this expertise could “help African countries face this scourge.” The Senegalese minister added that “Senegal and Morocco have dynamic and strong” ties strengthened through the special relationship between HM King Mohammed VI and President of the Republic of Senegal, Macky Sall.

Rabat – Moroccan biologist, author, and prominent Islamic feminist Asma Lamrabet announced her decision to leave Morocco  for an “indefinite period.” Lamrabet announced the decision on her Facebook account on Sunday, September 15.  The post, which was met with a range of different reactions reads, “I am leaving Morocco for a destination far away for an indefinite period.” “A new experience to live for what left in my life span,” said the feminist as she expressed hope for a positive experience. One of her followers commented: “We are going to miss you Mrs. Asmae Lamrabet… Morocco has lost a new pearl.” “This is the best thing you did in your life, never look back … Goodbye,” another Facebook user wrote. Lamrabet has not shared further details about what pushed her to leave Morocco, but last year was not her best. In 2018, the feminist made news headlines in Morocco after she decided to resign from the Mohammedia League for Scholars or Rabita Mohammedia of Oulamas due to disagreements over equality of inheritance between men and women.  In a statement to Morocco World News last year, the feminist said, “I would say that my action, as a volunteer in the Rabita, for almost ten years had no other ambition than to serve my country and to promote this third way, that of a peaceful Islam, contextualized and in tune with universal humanist values compatible with our cultural values.” She also called on Moroccans to support “the legitimate rights of women for a Morocco of justice and equality.” In Islam,  a son inherits twice as much as a daughter, and similarly, a brother inherits twice the share of his sister. (However, in cases of uterine brothers and sisters, their shares will be equal.) Equality in inheritance has been a hot topic in Morocco. Moroccan activists and feminists are demanding reforms of the traditional inheritance system, and have continued to show determination in defending their stance. Born in 1961, Lamrabet is the founder of a working group for women’s issues and intercultural dialogue, and a major contributor to “Third Way” feminism, a movement that questions religious patriarchy and fights sexism in Islam. She is also the author of “Women and Men in the Qur’an,” in which she refutes and explains preconceived Islamobohic ideas about topics such as the treatment of Muslim women.

Rabat – Influential Moroccan businesswoman Salwa Akhannouch has opened her fourth Yan&amp;One store, and the second one in Casablanca alone. The new store, which is located on Casablanca’s Massira Al Khadra Boulevard, was decorated by Placebo Studio, a collective of young Moroccan street artists, in order to give it a “New York” vibe. Yan&amp;One Massira is geared to give customers an “experience” and allowing them to test products. And the range of products to test is unprecedented in Morocco: 170 different brands, 70 of which are exclusive to Yan &amp; One. Both makeup and skincare products are on offer. Unlike the other three stores already open across Morocco, the new addition includes a hair salon, as well as a nail bar, barber services, and a makeup station so visitors can get glammed up on the spot. The official opening took place on Saturday, September 14, and was a grand affair. Moroccan celebrities such as singer Zouhair Bahaoui, actor Said Taghmaoui, and the dancer, model, and actress Nora Fatehi were in attendance. Ever since Yan&amp;One opened its flagship store in 2017, the brand has rapidly expanded. That is not her only success: she is also the founder and CEO of the Aksal-Morocco Mall Group. The group owns 50% of the Morocco Mall, where Yan&amp;One’s first store opened. The mall is the second-largest in Africa, built at a cost of more than $240 million in 2007. She also holds exclusive rights to distribute various international fashion brands in Morocco, such as Zara, Banana Republic, and Gap, and has built an impressive real estate portfolio. Her business prowess received an accolade in August 2018, when she was ranked second on a list of the 50 Most Influential Business Women in Africa. In 2015, she also ranked 8th on a list of the 100 Most Influential Arab Women, compiled by UAE website Arabian Business.

Rabat – French police arrested Abdelfatah Jawadi on Saturday, September 15, in the city of Grenoble. Jawadi is suspected of raping a young French woman. According to Moroccan news outlets, French authorities have seized Jawadi’s passport and car. The comedian is under exit restrictions and will remain in Grenoble pending his first trial in October. After his initial arrest, French authorities placed the Moroccan comedian at a detention center for illegal migrants in Grenoble, says Hibapress. Alyaoum 24 reported that the comedian was temporarily released on the eve of Monday, September 16. Jawadi has not yet made any official statement on the accusations. The comedian, winner of the Moroccan Comedy TV show “Comédia”, left Morocco a few months ago to settle permanently in Switzerland. Last year, Jawadi was sued in Morocco by comedians Mohamed Khiari and Rachid Allali for defamation.  Jawadi is not the first Moroccan figure to be accused of rape and sexual assault in France. In October 2016, Singer Saad Lamjarred faced rape charges in France. French police arrested the singer for the sexual assault of a woman named Laura Prioul. Police arrested the singer once again in August 2018 in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France, after another young woman filed a rape complaint against him. Lamjarred has a long history of allegations. He was first accused back in 2010 in New York. The charges, however, were dropped when the plaintiff withdrew the complaint.

Rabat – Local police in the municipality of Rota (south of Spain) and civil guards intercepted yesterday, September 16, a small boat near the beaches of Costa Ballena. The boat came from Morocco and was carrying 17 Moroccan irregular migrants. All the migrants are adults, aged between 20 and 30 years old, except one minor, aged 17, according to Spanish newspaper Andalucia Informacion. After making sure that none of the migrants were injured, Spanish authorities transferred them in a Red Cross bus to a refugee center in Algeciras. Moroccans and irregular migrants from throughout Africa attempt to cross the Mediterranean sea to reach Europe on a daily basis. In August, spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi said that security services aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. In the recent days, a video documenting Moroccan minors attempting to cross the sea in inflatable boats went viral. The footage shows the dangerous adventure of four minors, in three inflatable boats. The four would-be migrants filmed themselves hiding inside a cave to wait for the dark. “We will start our attempt at midnight,” said the one recording the video. It is not yet known if the group succeeded or failed in their attempt.

Rabat – Spanish news outlet Periodistas published on Monday, September 16, a news report on Morocco’s wine production and the consumption of wine in Morocco. The report indicates that Moroccans consumed 38 million bottles of wine in 2018. Morocco’s production constitutes 77%  of Moroccan red wine, 6.6 % of white wine and  16.4 % of rose and gray wine. The gray wine is only produced in Morocco. The Spanish source indicates that in Spain Moroccan wine is a token import. Only  10 or 15 % of Moroccan wine is for export. Moroccan wine reaches Europe and other continents, including the US, Japan, and China. In Europe, the wine is also exported to the Netherlands, France, and Belgium. In addition to exports in Europe, Asia, and America, Morocco is also the second-largest exporter of wine in Africa after South Africa. The news report also mentioned some of the most notable regions for wine production.  Periodistas indicates that the Meknes region is notable for wine production, bottling 60% of all Moroccan wine. The Moroccan winery map also includes the eastern region of Berkane, where 75% of the harvest is concentrated at the “Domaine des Trois Cavaliers winery.” The news report indicates that the eastern region is also a home for vines “grown in greenhouses, especially in the Bouark plain, in the province of Nador.” The Spanish outlet also listed some of the fine wine in Morocco including Tandem from Thalvin. Perodistas indicates that the brand was awarded a medal at the Bordeau Fair in 2017. Volubila wine is also among the best Moroccan wines, according to the Spanish news outlet. Sharing statistics, the news report indicates that Moroccan wineries employ 20,000 people across three large companies, including Les Celliers de Meknes, Castel, and Thalvin Group. Consumption The Spanish report also gave statistics about alcohol consumption in Morocco, indicating that in addition to wine, 310 million liters of beer were consumed in the last three years. “That is about  103 million liters per year, in addition to 14 million bottles of other alcoholic beverages.” The news report emphasized that Moroccans consume more beer than wine. “The best-known beer brands are Casablanca, Flag, and Stork,” the report said. The news report also emphasized the increase in alcohol since the Justice and Development Party (PJD) came to power in 2011. “The price of wine has increased more than 20% and beer 12 % since the arrival of the PJD.” The news report added that the Ministry of Agriculture under the leadership of “the non-Islamist” Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch, “promoted the Green Morocco Plan Program, with the aim of boosting productivity and organizing the entire agricultural sector and it has included vineyards and wine production.” The sector of production of wine and alcoholic beverages, according to Periodistasts, benefited from “several programs, including the equipment of 95% of the areas dedicated to the vineyard of localized irrigation systems  and the use of hail protection nets, with the support of the Agricultural Development Fund (FA).” Alcoholic beverages are the 3rd most widely used drug in Morocco, according to a 2017 study conducted by the National Observatory of Drugs and Addictions (ONDA). Between January and May 2017, Moroccan consumers drank 7% more compared to the same period last year.

Rabat – It seems that prominent French Moroccan comedian, Gad Elmaleh, has been feeling nostalgic as of late. The comedian, who is in Casablanca to shoot Karine Lemarchand’s TV series “Ambitions Intimes,” stopped by his former high school, Lycee Lyautey, on Friday, September 13. His unexpected visit to the school gates was a welcome surprise for the students, who instantly recognized the high profile comedian. A crowd of excited teenagers soon formed around the comedian. Elmaleh seemed to enjoy interacting with his young fans and documented the moment on Instagram.   ❤️🇲🇦 A post shared by  GAD (@gadelmaleh) on Sep 13, 2019 at 2:45am PDT  Elmaleh was born in Casablanca to a Jewish family but attended most of high school in Quebec. The comedian attended Lycee Lyautey in Casablanca for only one year before being expelled. Years later, after he had made his name in the entertainment industry, the school invited him back to talk to students about his success, something Elmaleh told media he finds ironic. That makes his most recent visit back to the school his second, suggesting Elmaleh remembers his short time at the Lycee Lyautey fondly. After completing high school, Elmaleh moved to Paris to pursue his dream of acting. The now 47-year-old comedian has performed comedy in France for over 23 years and gained wide fame there. He was voted the “funniest person” in France, and France’s Minister of Culture named him Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. Elmaleh also became a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.

Rabat – If you drive east of Marrakech for several hours on the N9 highway, ascending into the High Atlas Mountains and then descending into the Sahara Desert, you will soon see a dazzling sight. Sixteen kilometers north of where the highway runs through the town of Ouarzazate, a pillar of light rises from the desert floor. The Noor III Ouarzazate tower shines so brightly your eyes will hurt to look at it. And, if you did not already know what it was, you may briefly wonder if what you are seeing is real. The tower is part of Morocco’s plan to combat climate change by ambitiously increasing renewable energy sources as a share of the energy it produces. As of July 2019, the Noor Ouarzazate solar complex, which includes Noor I, II, and III, is the largest of its kind in the world. It produces 580 megawatts of solar electricity.  Unlike popular solar panels, which provide electricity only when the sun is out, the Noor complex is a thermal solar plant. Noor uses concentrated solar power (CSP) by storing heat, allowing it to continue to produce electricity for hours after sunset. Hundreds of thousands of mirrors arranged on the desert floor reflect light to the tower and heat tubes of liquid salt, allowing the plant to store energy. Noor III can store power for 7.5 hours. That storage time is crucial, because the peak hours of electricity use happens in the evening, mostly after the sun has set. Insufficient battery storage for the more popular photovoltaic solar is argued as the technology’s biggest shortfall. CSP is one way to tackle this challenge. “What is special about this CSP is what we call the thermal energy storage systems … CSP is like a power plant with huge batteries,” said Youssef Stitou, a project manager with the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN). Morocco has plans to build a fourth section on the Noor Ouarzazate complex and a second 800 megawatt CSP tower near Midelt, 200 kilometers south of Fez. Yet, solar power only makes up 2% of the electricity Morocco produces, according to the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE). Including the energy Morocco imports, solar power makes up an even smaller portion of the energy Moroccans consume. Even though the country aims to source 42% of its “installed energy capacity” from renewables by 2020, that does not necessarily mean Morocco will shift its actual electricity production to 42% renewably-sourced. By the end of 2017, ONEE reported that renewable sources made up 34% of Morocco’s ability to produce electricity, or installed capacity. But according to ONEE’s 2017 annual report, renewable sources made up only 16% of the electricity Morocco actually generated. Morocco did not fully exploit its promoted renewable capacity in actual production. A large part of Morocco’s installed energy capacity comes from fossil fuels like coal and oil, which it imports. In addition, Morocco is still an energy-dependent country and imports 90% of its energy needs, the Moroccan energy ministry noted.  Electricity is not the only kind of energy Morocco uses. For example, the country also consumes oil for transportation needs.  But electricity is an important part of Morocco’s energy use because as the population becomes wealthier, their electricity demands increase. People install lights, use electricity to charge cell phones, and buy kitchen appliances that run on electricity. Annual electricity consumption continues to rise in Morocco, growing 7% per year between 2004 and 2014. The average Moroccan, in 2012, also consumed 2.8 times as much electricity as the world’s average person, according to figures from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The high consumption highlights the benefit that producing more electricity from renewable sources would bring. The country is turning to renewables at a time when they are becoming increasingly cost effective. When Morocco awarded the contract for Noor III, it was paying $0.15 per kilowatt hour. However, when Morocco found a contractor to build its solar plant in Midelt, the project cost only $0.07 per kilowatt hour, according to Solar Power and Chemical Energy Systems. “It is now cheaper to build renewable energy power plants than those based on fossil fuels, and this is increasingly evident in the Middle East and North Africa,” said Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of Masdar, an Emirati firm working on the Midelt project. As Morocco aims to increase its renewables production capacity, it will look not only to solar, but to hydro and wind energy as well. MASEN’s operations director, Abdelkader Himdi, noted that “the government does ‘not care’ which technologies go into making up the overall renewables mix, and is focused only on solutions to Morocco’s problems of being overly reliant on the importation of fossil fuels.” In order to reach its goal of renewables making up 42% of its installed capacity by 2020 and 52% by 2030, Morocco plans to increase its solar energy, hydro energy, and wind energy capacity to two gigawatts each. According to ONEE’s 2018 figures, solar has the furthest to go to reach that goal. Morocco had the capacity to produce 0.7 gigawatts of solar electricity, 1.2 gigawatts of wind electricity, and 1.8 gigawatts of hydroelectricity in 2018. Only time will tell how soon Morocco will reach its renewables goals and if it will ramp up its production of renewable energy in line with its capacity. In the meantime, Morocco’s rhetoric sets the country as one of only two worldwide that will reach the suggested 1.5 degree Celsius emissions cap per the Paris Agreement suggestions, according to the  Climate Action Tracker’s June update.

Fez – Last year, hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East and North Africa, including Morocco, faced the worst water shortages in decades. More than 60% of the population in this region is concentrated in places affected by high or very high surface water stress, which means that water resources are heavily exploited at an unsustainable rate. I have argued previously that “multiple factors have contributed to the current situation, including climate change, desertification, water pollution, and misuse of natural resources. Inadequate information, education, and communication exacerbate many of these challenges, as it reinforces a lack of awareness of – much less commitment to – environmentally friendly practices. Add to that inadequate disaster-risk reduction and management by governments – many of which are dealing with other conflicts and crises – and the situation has become truly dire.” According to government statistics, Morocco’s water resources are among the weakest in the world, with the lowest amount of water per capita due to climate change. Water resources are estimated at 22 billion cubic meters per year, equivalent to 700 cubic meters per person per year. The water issue is complex because it touches on geographic challenges, the problem of governance, climate change, and the demographic problem: Tourism is developing, agriculture and industry are growing, and cities are expanding. Water shortages in Middle East and North African countries could also help cause destabilization, according to a recent report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank. Because of repetitive droughts in the last three decades, each summer, a number of Moroccan areas suffer from lack of drinking water. Last August, many people suffered from the lack of drinking water when taps ran dry on Eid al-Adha. Solutions exist, especially in the area of good governance. Water resources and distribution are everyone’s responsibility because everybody uses it on a daily basis. Water concerns must also be part of our education system. We also need proactive thinking, sensitizing the population, and involving all sectors, especially agriculture. Morocco has developed experience in water management, but the pace of work must be accelerated. While some policies for better management of water are being implemented, there have been delays in disinfection and desalination projects. The UN and World Bank report, titled “Water management in fragile systems: building resilience to shocks and protracted crises in the Middle East and North Africa,” notes that effective water resources management can be key to growth and stability. “Instability combined with poor water management can become a vicious cycle that further exacerbates social tensions,” the UN and World Bank experts stressed. The report urges countries in the region to move from policies focused on increasing supplies to long-term management of water resources. It also recommends relying on new technologies to support sustainable growth rather than ineffective policies that make people vulnerable to the effects of water shortage, exacerbated by the increasing demand and climate change. In a press release associated with the report, the UN warns that “climate-related water scarcity is expected to cause economic losses estimated at 6 to 14% of Gross Domestic Product by 2050, the highest in the world.” Economic losses in the region mean high unemployment. The impact of water problems on traditional livelihoods, such as agriculture, is likewise exacerbated by climate change and bad governance, according to UN experts. The report also points to the danger of food insecurity, which may lead to forced climate migration, as well as to growing frustrations with governments unable to guarantee basic services. Morocco has begun a number of initiatives that attempt to prevent droughts and handle water challenges, including plans to install more than 100,000 solar pumps for irrigation by 2020.  But unless water resources are managed with extraordinary care, the consequences could be devastating. The international community should encourage countries like Morocco to embrace strong cooperation by creating financial instruments that make concessional and preferential funds available. The global cooperation that has emerged since the Paris climate change agreement is certainly welcome. But while teamwork is critical to success, so is recognition of the distinct responsibilities of governments in the industrialized and developing worlds. As the Marrakech declaration emphasizes, success in mitigating climate change will require political commitment at the highest level. Moreover, climate action must take into account the special needs and context of developing countries, especially the least-developed economies and those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. With this in mind, the declaration demands greater efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security, and meet the agriculture challenges posed by climate change. It also calls for greater support for climate projects, including through capacity building and technology transfer from developed to developing countries. Of course, the responsibility for mitigating climate change does not fall only on government. NGOs, for example, are already having a major impact, implementing educational programs and even staging protests to raise awareness of the environmental challenges we face. However, in many ways, government is critical to enabling such contributions. While tackling climate change effectively will be virtually impossible without civil society organizations’ participation, their impact has often been undermined by politics. Governments may, for example, favor incumbent energy suppliers over green alternatives in order to preserve existing jobs. Some governments have already implemented important measures to support the shift toward more environmentally-friendly practices, including financial and market incentives. Only with more such initiatives, as well as a commitment to follow through on the Marrakech declaration and to support the goals of the Africa Action Summit, can governments put their countries, and the world, on the path toward true sustainable development.

Rabat – The  Court of Appeal in Fez sentenced today, September 16, four members of the Justice and Development Party (PJD). The court sentenced the PJD members  for their alleged involvement in the murder of student Mohamed Benaissa Ait El Jid in 1993. The court handed out sentences of three years in prison to Taoufik El Kadi and Abdelouahed Kerioul. PJD members Kassem Abdelkebir and Ajil Abdelkbir received sentences of three months in prison. Leading PJD member Abdelali Hamieddine is expected to appear before the court tomorrow.  Hamiddien’s trial, which was postponed several times, will resume on September 17 for his alleged “complicity” in the murder of  Ait El Jid. The case dates back to February 1993 when a group of masked people beat Benaissa to death with sharp objects as he was leaving Dar El Mehraz University in Fez. In December, the Fez Court of Appeals postponed Hamieddine’s trial to February 12, 2019. The reason given was to allow for the preparation of all documents for the high-profile trial.

Rabat – The Court of First Instance in Rabat has postponed the controversial trial of Hajar Raissouni, currently being held in Al-Arajat prison, to September 23. Al Yaoum 24 reported on Monday evening that Raissouni’s  defense team asked for the trial to be postponed due to the health conditions of the detainees. Raissouni, a journalist at Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper, is facing illegal abortion and premarital sex charges.  On Saturday, August 31, Police arrested Raissouni on her way out of a doctor’s office, accusing her of undergoing an illegal abortion.  Police arrested the journalist along with her fiance, the doctor,  and his two aides for illegal abortion. If convicted, Hajar Raissouni will receive two years in prison. Following her arrest, Raissouni refuted all police accusations. She told the court that she had been married to her fiance in a religious ceremony, and was only waiting for documents from the Sudanese embassy to formalize the union. The official marriage was expected to take place two weeks after her arrest. Five days after Hajar Raissouni’s arrest, new evidence emerged. A medical report, signed by Dr. Samir Bargach from Rabat’s Ibn-Sina Hospital, confirmed that Raissouni had undergone an abortion. The medical report also claimed that this was not Raissouni’s first pregnancy and abortion, a statement from the Public Prosecutor at the Court of First Instance said on September 5. The journalist’s arrest  is related to acts that are “considered criminal offenses under the criminal law, namely, the practice of abortion on a regular basis,  and accepting medically induced abortion,” the prosecutor stated.

Rabat – Supported by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and other allies, Morocco is pushing for the adoption of a UN resolution on World Anti-Islamophobia Day, Moroccan parliamentary sources have told Moroccan outlet le 360. In line with the project, the Moroccan parliament is convening ambassadors from Muslim-majority countries on September 18. The meeting is set to discuss the scope and possible content of the prospective resolution. Morocco is planning to introduce the resolution at one of the coming UN general assemblies. According to the sources, the move dovetails with Morocco’s newfound identity as a promoter of inter-religious dialogue and interfaith connections both domestically and worldwide. They suggested that the move seeks, in the long term, to go beyond the sole goal of countering mounting Islamophobia worldwide. Also implicated in the hope to tackle Islamophobia is the wish to establish more connections and spaces for peaceful dialogue for different religious faiths. It is understood that Morocco already received a tacit approval seal from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (IESCO), as well as its Western allies. The move has been on Morocco’s agenda for months, according to the news report. At an OIC meeting in July in Rabat, Morocco asked support from member states, as it announced that it was preparing to submit to the UN general assembly a proposal for the adoption of a World Anti-Islamophobia Day. Rabat said its proposal aims at raising awareness about Islamophobia and celebrating religious tolerance. “We envision making that day about internationally celebrating tolerance and religious coexistence, as well as moderate Islam. This will serve as a tool to refute the heinous rhetoric against Islam and Muslims [Islamophobia],” le 360 quoted the Moroccan representative at the July meeting as saying. Islamophobia, the Moroccan representative went on to assert, “has become a fully-fledged ideology with the aim of demonizing Islam.”

Rabat – Only a few days after Netflix released one of their newest series, “The Spy,” Moroccans noticed some editing mistakes made by the famous production company. “The Spy” is a series set during Syria in the 1960s, however some scenes showed some Moroccan money transfer agencies, including “Wafacash,” which was not founded until 1991. و من هذا المقطع ديال المسلسل الجديد (The Spy) من انتاج (Netflix) يتضح لنا بأن العاصمة السورية دمشق في ستينيات القرن… Posted by Aimane Cherragui on Sunday, 15 September 2019 “In this scene from the new series “The Spy” produced by Netflix, we can see that the Syrian capital, Damascus, had Wafacash, MoneyGram, and Western Union agencies since the 1960s,” said  a Moroccan Facebook user sarcastically. The series was filmed in Morocco, mainly in Casablanca. Editors, however, were not able to completely metamorphose the decor from that of a Moroccan city to a 1960s Damascus. This small detail was not the only thing that Moroccans noticed. In one of the scenes, extras were shouting “we are in Morocco” in Moroccan dialect. Producers did not notice until the series were already online. Je viens de finir The Spy, si on met de côté le côté propagande “les israéliens c’est les plus intelligents, les syriens étaient débiles”:

Other internet users, from different countries, also found many inconsistencies in the decor used in the series, including the use of the wrong Syrian flag, the use of incorrect maps, or the use of Malaysian coins.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has addressed a letter to King Salman of Saudi Arabia to condemn Houthi drone attacks on two Saudi oil facilities. In his letter, the monarch said that the attacks undermine the security and stability of the world. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation quoted the letter in which the monarch expressed solidarity with Saudi Arabia. “I assure you of the absolute solidarity of the kingdom of Morocco with Saudi Arabia and its unwavering support against any threat that undermines the country’s security and territorial integrity,” the monarch said. The King also reiterated Morocco’s determination to further strengthen diplomatic ties with its Gulf ally. He emphasized that the two countries share bonds of solidarity and “sincere brotherhood.” He added that “the security and stability of Saudi Arabia is an integral part of the security and stability of Morocco.” Several other countries have condemned the attacks against the Saudi oil facilities, including the UK and UAE. On Saturday, September 14, the UK condemned the drone attack in a statement from Andrew Murrison the British foreign affairs minister responsible for the Middle East and North Africa.  The minister described the attack by Houthis as “totally unacceptable.” Murrison added that Houthis “must stop undermining Saudi Arabia’s security by threatening civilian areas and commercial infrastructure.” “Totally unacceptable attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia this morning,” said Murrison. Al Jazeera reported on Monday, September 16 that the Houthis are threatening to “expand” their Saudi targets.

Rabat – US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has lashed out at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that the politician’s very existence is a hindrance to peace in the Middle East. Omar, who was speaking on the Face the Nation show on Sunday, September 15, days after Netanyahu made headlines for proposing the annexation of the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, reiterated her support for the two-state solution in the Israel-Palestine conflict. With her comments coming on the heels of Israeli general elections to be held  on Tuesday, September 17, the American congresswoman also said she hopes Israelis vote Netanyahu out of the premiership. “I certainly hope that the people of Israel make a different decision and my hope is that they recognize that Netanyahu’s existence, his policies, his rhetoric rally is contradictory to the peace that we all are hoping that that region receives and receives soon,” the Democratic freshman said. Squarely addressing Netanyahu’s annexation proposal, Omar echoed a  belief widely shared among Middle-East observers and analysts that such a move would kill all hopes of dialogue or peace between Israelis and Palestinians. When Netanyahu spoke of annexing most of the West Ban if given the proper mandate to do so by Israeli voters, the overwhelming reaction in the international community was that the Israeli Prime Minister was poised to “torpedo” the future of Israel-Palestine peace. Omar reiterated that assessment. “Just right now, if you look at the annexation that is taking place, for many of us in Congress, there has been longstanding support for a two-state solution, and this annexation now is going to make sure that that peace process does not happen and we will not get to a two-state solution,” she pointed out. The congresswoman added, more poignantly perhaps, that Prime Minister Netanyahu’s very political existence is a major stumbling block to the legitimate aspirations of numbers of Israelis and Palestinians to put behind them decades of lingering hostilities. “Netanyahu’s existence as the leader of Israel has diminished any hope for a two-state solution and we can’t be expected to be silent about that!” Omar later wrote on Twitter, sharing the video of her interview and reaffirming the interview’s sticking points.

Rabat – Algerian Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah announced that the presidential election will take place on December 12. Bensalah said  on Sunday, September 15 that “the date of the presidential election will be Thursday, December 12.” The announcement comes after powerful military chief Gaid Salah emphasized that elections should take place by the end of this year. In September, Salah announced that it was “appropriate to summon the Electorate on September 15th.” “I have spoken about the priority to seriously launch the preparation of the presidential elections within the coming weeks, and today, based on our missions, prerogatives and our compliance with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic as well,” he said. The announcement comes amid continuous protests in Algiers. On Friday, September 13, protesters rallied after Algerian parliament adopted bills, “paving the way for the announcement of elections,” France 24 wrote. A  strong contingent of security officers was deployed to the villa of General Salah in the Annaba neighborhood in Algiers when demonstrators attempted to storm the General’s residence. Demonstrators, who are seeking a radical change, are calling on all elites from Bouteflika’s government to step down. Protesters have also been calling on Salah to resign.

Rabat – Since her arrest on charges of abortion on August 31, Hajar Raissouni’s name has been in every media publication in Morocco. The case became known internationally when both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called for the immediate release of the journalist. Raissouni is appearing before the judge at the Court of First Instance in Rabat on  Monday.  The journalist, who works for Akhbar Al Yaoum newspaper, is facing charges of “illegal abortion and premarital sex.” The story so far On Saturday, August 31, police arrested the journalist at the entrance of a building they were monitoring. A statement from the prosecutor said that a clinic suspected of conducting illegal abortion is located in the building. Following Raissouni’s arrest, the electronic version of Akhbar Al Yaoum, Al Yaoum 24, published an article questioning the motives behind the arrest. The news outlet also published a medical statement from the gynecologist who allegedly performed an abortion for  Raissouni. The doctor, who is also under arrest for his alleged role, denied having performed any abortions. The doctor claimed that he had performed an “urgent intervention.” Moroccan news outlet Hespress quoted a source close to the case, stating that Raissouni paid MAD 3,500 upfront for the procedure, which cost an estimated MAD 4,200. The same source added that  Raissouni’s fiance paid MAD 700 to complete the operation fees. The journalist told the investigating judge that she is married to her fiance, who is of Sudanese nationality. She explained that they were married in a religious ceremony. The couple planned their official marriage to take place on September 14.  Both abortion and sex outside marriage illegal Both abortion and traditional marriages without getting an official marriage are illegal in Morocco. Penal code 454 stipulates that sexual relations outside marriage are punishable by arrest and imprisonment for up to two years. Article 453 of Morocco’s penal code stipulates, however, that abortion is not punishable if it is practiced to preserve the mother’s physical health.  In this case, abortion can be openly practiced with the spouse’s authorization. Hajar Raisouni’s case caused a nationwide debate, with some media divulging the journalist’s intimate life and attacking her for the alleged abortion and her informal marriage. Defending herself, the journalist maintains her innocence. She has provided medical certificates from the Souissi Hospital in Rabat, affirming that she had not undergone an abortion. The case was widely publicized with different narratives from one media to another.  After the emergence of several media reports, the public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of First Instance issued a statement on September 5 amid the rumors and speculation surrounding the case. Prosecutor regrets publicization of case The public prosecutor regretted the need to issue the statement, saying that the case should have been discussed and proved or found false in the court and not on social media. The prosecutor also denied rumors that the journalist’s arrest was linked to her work. On September 6, Amnesty International wrote that the journalist recently conducted a set of interviews with Ahmed Zefzafi,  the father of Hirak Rif activist Nasser Zefzafi. The NGO added that some of Raissouni’s work was critical of Moroccan authorities. The prosecutor said that the journalist’s arrest “has nothing to do with her profession as a journalist.” According to the press release, police arrested the journalist because of acts that are “considered criminal offenses under the criminal law, namely, the practice of abortion on a regular basis,  and accepting medically induced abortion.”  The public prosecutor also said that that the medical certificate which Raissouni used as evidence she had not undergone an abortion was only a “preliminary check-up by a  doctor in the emergency room on August 31.” The official press release from the prosecutor indicates that Raissouni has “acknowledged that she had an abortion before in another clinic at the seventh week of pregnancy,” an allegation that Raissouni denied. Today is not the first time Rassouni has appeared before the court. The first session in her trial was on September 9. If there are no more postponements, the court will today decide whether Raissouni is guilty or not guilty. Raissouni, along with her fiance, the doctor, and two aides, are facing charges for an illegal abortion. Raissouni risks a sentence of two years in prison if convicted.

Rabat – A delegation from the US embassy in Morocco traveled to the Moroccan  southern city of Laayoune on September 13. The delegation was in Laayoune to meet with the head of UN peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara, MINURSO, Colin Stewart. A diplomatic source told Moroccan television channel 2M that the US delegation held a meeting with Stewart to review the ongoing peace operation’s work in the region. The meeting was also an opportunity to discuss ways to help promote MINURSO’s missions and to implement the provisions of the Security Council resolutions. The meeting comes a month and a half before the vote on a new resolution to renew the mandate of the MINURSO in Western Sahara. In April 2019, the Security Council adopted Resolution 2468, extending the mandate of MINURSO for six months. The current mandate will expire at the end of October. The Security Council renewed the mandate of MINURSO  for six months three times in a row since April 2018. The mandate had previously been renewed by one year.  The Security Council will meet again at the end of October to vote on a new resolution to extend the MINURSO’s mandate.  The meeting comes at a time when the UN agenda does not include the Western Sahara conflict.  The UN noon Briefings and the Security Council agenda has not discussed the conflict since the resignation of Horst Kohler, former Special Envoy to the UN Secretary-General in May. The UN has not yet discussed an alternative for Kohler, who managed to bring the parties to the conflict to one table during his suggested-roundtables in December 2018 and March 2019. The US delegation’s visit to Laayoune also comes a week after President Donald Trump fired John Bolton, the former national security adviser. Bolton was an anti-MINURSO figure who questioned the efficiency of the UN mission to end the conflict. Bolton said last year, “Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force[MINURSO], 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?”

Rabat – Times Higher Education magazine published last Wednesday, September 11, the World University Rankings 2020. Four Moroccan universities were part of the 1400 universities, from 92 countries that appeared on the list. However, none of them made it to the Top 500. Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, in Fes ranked first on the national level. Internationally, however, the university ranked in the 601-800 section. Hassan II University in Casablanca, Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech, and Mohammed V University in Rabat all ranked in the 1001+ section. The University of Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah made a steady progress from ranking 1001+ in 2018, to 801-1000 in 2019 and then 601-800 in this year’s rankings. Meanwhile, Mohammed V University and Cadi Ayyad University went down the ranking ladder through the years. Rabat’s University went from Top 800 in 2017 to 1001+ in 2020, while Cadi Ayyad University made an alarming decline from 301-350 in 2015 to this year’s ranking. Times Higher Education takes five criteria into consideration for their rankings: teaching, research, citations, industry outcome, and international outlook. On the global ladder, the University of Oxford remained in first place, followed by the California Institute of Technology, the institute leaped from number 5 last year to second place. The University of Cambridge came third, followed by Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the MENA region, two universities from Saudi Arabia ranked first and second. King Abdulaziz University (201-250 globally) and Alfaisal University (251-300), respectively. The third best university in the MENA region is the United Arab Emirates University (301-500). Other universities in the MENA region that made it to the Top 500 of the rankings include Khalifa University (UAE), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), Jordan University of Science and Technology (Jordan), Qatar University (Qatar), Aswan University, and Mansoura University (Egypt). Back in June 2019, Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), an annual publication of university rankings, published the 2020 edition of the 1000 top universities in the world. No Moroccan university made it to the list.

Rabat – Almost since the day he was born, my son has loved to spend time outside. As a tiny baby, the sound of birdsong calmed him. Now, at nearly 6 months old, he is mesmerized by flowers and leaves as Essaouira wind gently moves the bougainvillea in our garden. He loves to watch sheep trot down our lane and to listen to the European turtle doves singing outside the window.   Naturally, as a new mother, I cannot help but worry sometimes about my child’s future, imagining what he might be when he grows up. Sometimes I worry about politics and how my little half-Moroccan boy will fare in an ever more nationalistic Europe. Sometimes I wonder what the state of the earth itself will be when he is my age.  Will he be able to sit in a garden somewhere, listening to the call of the birds and watching the trees bend in the wind? Will he be able to see elephants, giraffes, rhinos, and lions as I have been lucky enough to do? Climate change is calling this future into question. Henry Bailey is a conservationist and consultant with nearly a decade of experience managing habitats and ecosystems in East and Central Africa. He gave me an insight into the effect the climate crisis is having on wildlife in Africa and how we can we can preserve the earth’s natural resources for the next generation. Honestly, I expected Bailey to talk to me about baby giraffes, lions, and the amazing big game I saw when I visited Kenya. However, he did not talk about his night-time anti-poaching operations or the time he rescued an elephant calf from a well dug by trespassers. Nor did he concentrate on flashy stories, like the time he had to wrestle a buffalo. Bailey mostly wanted to talk about grass.  Speaking from a national park in Chad, Bailey explained that man-made climate change is nothing new. But, further contributing to the climate crisis, we are now using the earth’s resources faster than it can replenish them.  Even through the patchy internet call, I could hear the beeping of a Chadian frog and the calls of a choir of native birds. Over the birdsong, he told me how humanity’s unsustainable use of the earth’s natural resources is leading to a rate of climate change faster than nature can adapt.   The conservationist explained, with infectious enthusiasm for his subject, that wildlife and plants have an innate ability to adapt to change. But, with man-made climate change, sometimes they cannot keep up.  “As long as their habitat remains intact, some species like insects and mice, which reproduce regularly, adapt and evolve rapidly and may be able to go step for step with some of the demands of man-made climate change.” Meanwhile, “trees and megafauna like elephants are not able to adapt to the rapid change. In a longer time frame there may be extinction.”  Here’s where the grass comes into it Grasslands and the soil they grow from are an important habitat for many African animals, but they are under threat from bad land management.  We were talking to each other shortly after Earth Overshoot Day. Bailey explained that while nature has “an insurance policy,” the speed of man-made climate change has caused this policy to backfire against humans who depend on natural capital. The insurance policy works like this: When nature is overused and depleted, it fights back, making the land less productive for humans as nature attempts to replenish itself. Extreme overuse, therefore, leads to desertification. So, our exploitation and poor management of natural resources is “squeezing what is left of wildlife habitats into smaller and smaller areas, and our mismanagement of the landscape is exacerbating man-made climate change.”   What he said next really made me sit up and listen. I had been thinking conservation was about preserving endangered species. However, I was beginning to see that it is not only animals who benefit from conservation. We are very much all in it together. “The other day I was talking to a nomadic pastoralist,” Henry Bailey recounted. “Their way of farming is completely reliant on the cycle of nature. The sun’s energy is harnessed by grasses, eaten by cattle, and then converted by cattle into milk, which is then consumed by humans. They’re essentially consuming the energy of the sun.”  Nomadic pastoralists allow their cattle to graze, and when they have eaten all they can and left their manure and urine, they move on. The manure fertilizes and revitalizes the land, and the grass is replenished. Due to a growing human population trying to graze more cattle in the same limited area, the grass and soil no longer have time to replenish. This causes desertification, which contributes to a harmful cycle by shrinking the available grazing land. “When the model of nomadic pastoralism was initially adopted it imitated nature and was entirely appropriate. But that model, and also modern farming techniques, are now not working within the system of nature. They are imposing upon it. And, it is from there that many of humanity’s problems stem,” he explained.  The nomadic farmer told Bailey that the Sahara desert is encroaching further and further on their traditional grazing lands. As the grasslands disappear, pastoralists are turning to protected conservation land to graze their cattle. This in turn encroaches on and damages the habitats of native wildlife. “The precarious balance of man’s interplay with nature is destabilized.” Looking for a solution He went on to explain that as the population grows and humanity “mines” the earth’s resources, this destabilization will only worsen. “Animals will die out if they don’t adapt or change their location; this is where they may come into conflict with people who are also migrating to find a food source.” At this point the conversation was interrupted, allowing me to more easily imagine Bailey as a sort of Indiana Jones-style conservation hero.  Over the crackling connection I heard several park rangers, asking their boss in a mix of Chadian French and Arabic when he would be ready to set off to take provisions to the team monitoring the rhino population. The car would not be able to access the difficult terrain, rapidly flooding during the rainy season, so, they explained, they would have to go on horseback. He told them to saddle the horses.  A few weeks later I caught up with Bailey again in London. I asked him if there is a solution to this seemingly irresolvable conflict between the needs of man and those of nature. “Community has to be at the forefront of all conservation efforts,” he explained. For conservation projects to be lasting and effective, they have to work in partnership with local communities and address not only the needs of the animal population, but also the plant life and human population, he added.  “Our relationship with nature needs to be symbiotic,” he said. As an example, Bailey told me about Mugie Conservancy in Kenya, where all conservation projects are rooted in collaboration with local communities and pastoralists.  In 2017, desperate for grasslands to graze their cattle, pastoralists turned to conservancies like Mugie. The increased pressure on the environment from the unmanaged influx of cattle, combined with drought, led to the deaths of hundreds of buffalo and other wildlife including lions and Jackson’s hartebeest. There was not enough food and water to go around.  This desperation also led to instability and insecurity within local communities. Criminal elements seized upon this instability to exploit natural resources and take advantage of local communities. Poaching of elephants and other big game and attacks on conservancies ensued.  Responding to the crisis In response to the crisis, Mugie Conservancy offered to manage the cattle for the pastoralists. The new management system meant that the pastoralists had fattened cattle and that no area was over-grazed. It also ensured that the local community was invested and engaged in the conservancy and its security. This in turn helped to control big game poaching.  The conservancy’s response to the crisis was led by a deep understanding of the communities and the human and animal habitats affected by it.  Josh Perret, general manager of the conservancy, told me, “The future existence of these wild areas is in the hands of those living and working on the ground. Too often people living in developed countries or urban areas get too emotional about what they think is right, but can consequently have a negative effect on the development or accelerate the deterioration of an area or local community.” Speaking to the two conservationists gave me reassurance that, if humanity can try to live in “symbiosis” with nature, our children and our children’s children may still be able to see the wonders of the African landscape and its ecosystems. It is essential that we listen to experts like Bailey and Perret and the communities they work with and realize that climate crisis conservation is not only about the environment. It is about everything. Bailey assured me that people like me can take meaningful action to protect and preserve our habitat—planet earth. From installing a bug hotel in your garden to limiting your use of single-use plastics, wherever and whoever you are: If you do one little thing you can make a difference to our planet. One thousand small actions like yours can lead to one big change.

Rabat – A statement from President Donald Trump has confirmed that a US “counterterrorism operation” has killed Hamza bin Laden following earlier reports of his death. Hamza bin Laden was the son of Osama bin Laden and a leader in his father’s Al Qaeda terrorist organization. In a statement on Saturday, September 14, the White House asserted the younger bin Laden’s death “deprives al-Qa’ida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father.” In July, officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the US killed bin Laden in a strike sometime in the previous two years. Trump’s statement said the attack occurred in Afghanistan or Pakistan but was sparse on details and did not say when the strike happened. The White House claimed bin Laden was “responsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups.” In February, the US State Department announced a reward of $1 million for information on Hamza bin Laden’s whereabouts. The department’s Rewards for Justice Program described the younger bin Laden as “an emerging al Qaeda leader” who “has threatened attacks against the United States and allies.” The US has classed Hamza bin Laden as a terrorist in 2017. The confirmation comes 10 years after the US killed Hamza’s brother Saad in a drone strike and more than eight years after US Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden and another son, Khalid, in Pakistan in May 2011.  It also comes the same week that New York commemorated the 18th anniversary of the September 11 attacks carried out by Al Qaeda.

Rabat – The trial of Brenton Tarrant, the terrorist who conducted mass shootings on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, will take place on June 2, 2020. The court moved the date from May 4 of the same year to avoid concurrence with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, reported the New Zealand Herald. The New Zealander news outlet explained that many victims and members of their family “could still be abroad on a pilgrimage bankrolled by the Saudi king.” The terrorist’s defence team had no objection to the change of the date. Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, is facing 92 charges, 51 of them for murder, 40 for attempted murder, and one for terrorism. On March 15, 2019, the terrorist engaged in two consecutive mass shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday prayer. The attacks began at Al Noor mosque, at 1:40 pm, and continued at Linwood Islamic Centre at about 1:55 pm. Tarrant live-streamed the first attack on Facebook. The attacks left 51 people dead and more than 40 injured. Days before the attacks, Tarrant shared a manifesto entitled “The Great Replacement.” In the 74 pages of the manifesto, the terrorist explains his reasoning for committing the attacks and invites other “ethno-nationalists” to join him in his fight against “the immigrants invading [their] lands.” Tarrant’s xenophobe theory claims that “the white race” will become a minority because “the immigrants” have high fertility rates. The terrorist also explains that New Zealand “represents diversity,” which is why he chose it as the scene of his crimes.

Rabat – In light of the upcoming 24th General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which Morocco will be hosting in 2021, Morocco’s National Tourism Office has shared a video showcasing the beauty of Marrakech.  The UNWTO is the United Nations agency that oversees the promotion of responsible, sustainable, and universally accessible tourism. It promotes tourism as a driver of economic growth, inclusive development, and environmental sustainability. The video, which was selected from a number of submissions following a voting process, shows Marrakech in its full glory: camels being led across arid plains, snow-capped mountains, and hot air balloons drifting through the sky Aside from the landscape of Marrakech, the video also showcases the luxury of the city: the iconic black and white riad in La Mamounia, the Selman’s famous horses, among a host of other beautiful riads and hotels the city has to offer.  With shots of decadent tagines and high-end restaurants spliced in, its no wonder that this video was chosen to encapsulate the tourist potential of Marrakech. According to the Moroccan Minister of Tourism, Mohammed Sajid, the chance to host the UNWTO is a great opportunity for the country, and further cements Morocco as a leader in world tourism.  “This victory is aligned with the strategy outlined by King Mohammed VI to achieve sustainable and inclusive development in all areas,” the minister told MAP on September 12.  “It also demonstrates the Kingdom’s privileged position in the field of tourism, thanks in particular to its development and stability,” he added. The numbers back up his comments about Morocco’s prowess. A 2019 report analyzing Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness, published by the World Economic Forum, ranked Morocco as first in the Maghreb region, and second in North Africa. In the worldwide index, Morocco came 66th with a score of 3,9 exceeding the average in the MENA region, and surpassing the global average.

Rabat – After what looked like an unending saga between Tunisia’s Esperance de Tunis (EST) and Morocco’s Wydad, the Board of Appeals of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has finally decided to declare EST the winners of the 2018-2019 African Champions League. “The Board underlined the fact that the absence of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) has no legal effect whatsoever and that its sole purpose is to aid the referee to take the correct decision,” CAF said in a statement on Sunday, September 15. This comes to put an effective end to what has been a sporting whirlwind in the EST-Wydad controversy. As far as Wydad is concerned, the harshest blow in CAF’s final verdict is the notion—deep-seated among EST fans and supporters from the outset—that Wydad is the primary culprit for the early stoppage of the second leg match. For CAF, with the score at 1-0 in favor of EST when Wydad’s protestations led the referee to stop the match, the only logical decision would be to declare EST as the rightful winner of the match. The statement said, “The Appeal Board has noted that the stoppage of almost 90 minutes was due to the Wydad Athletic Club’s players’ failure to resume the match, the players were then instructed to resume play by the referee who has seen his attempts fail to no avail. Therefore the Appeal Board confirms that the match was forfeited by Wydad Athletic Club because their players refused to resume the match.” While the strongly-worded rebuttal to Wydad’s protestations will definitely end the four-month-long sporting rollercoaster between the two teams, CAF critics will likely be emboldened in their longstanding criticism of the organization’s lack of leadership and character. The whole controversy came about—and lasted this long—because of CAF’s decision that the second leg match had been mired in unforgivable irregularities and that the sole way to be fair to both teams would be a rematch in a “neutral” stadium somewhere in Africa other than Morocco or Tunisia. In the days following the match, there were embarrassing reports of influence peddling and corruption coming from CAF offices, with some critics (including frontbenchers in the CAF hierarchy) accusing EST of deliberately  neglecting to repair its stadium’s VAR system before critical matches. For CAF to now come out and say that the controversy was a false debate from the get go is a striking confirmation of the body’s lack of coordination and cohesion in the way it operates, critics may point out. The controversy between the two clubs started in mid-May in Rabat, when their 1-1 draw was marked with unmistakable refereeing errors that favored the Tunisian club. But the scenes of the second leg in Tunis in late May were even more confusing. At 1-0 in favor of ES Tunis, Wydad’s Walid El Karti scored an equalizer which the referee wrongly ruled out for offside. Wydad protested and asked for the VAR to be used. After more than an hour of heated discussions between players and the referee, and then between match officials and CAF officials, the referee ended the match. Minutes later, CAF declared ES Tunis were the winners, only to retract two days later and announce a rematch. The two teams then took the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), each arguing that they deserved the trophy because of the second leg’s gross irregularities. But CAS sided with EST, saying that the Tunisian clubs’ arguments were, from a sporting point of view, more grounded than Wydad’s. CAS left out room for debate, however, as it ruled that the final verdict in the case should be rendered by CAF’s “competent bodies.” Wydad seized that opportunity, yet again protesting against CAS’s decision that their Tunisian opponents should be the rightful winners of the trophy. As it upheld CAS’s verdict in its latest statement, the CAF Board of Appeals pointed out that, while Wydad’s VAR appeal had carried a certain weight of legitimacy, rules are that the referee’s verdict—with or without VAR—is the ultimate decision. VAR, CAF argued, is there only to help the referee make his decisions. And once the referee has made up his mind, the statement emphasized, no disciplinary or appeals boards can overrule it. “The referee is vested with the power to have the final decision on the field of play since the start of the game, and his decision is not up to review by the Appeal Board,” it stressed. “The match officials’ reports were very clear that the Wydad Athletic Club’s players refused to resume the match even after several attempts conducted by the referee, to the point that the referee waited almost 90 minutes before he whistled the end of the match.”

Rabat – A video of several Moroccan teenagers trying to reach Spain on inflatable boats has gone viral. El Faro de Ceuta posted the video of the youth taking a risk to reach Europe, in search of better opportunities. “In Morocco, there is no future for the youth, that is why they escape and that is why they risk everything they have to reach Spain,” the news outlet wrote. In the video, one of the young men said, “we are leaving for Spain. Everyone wants to go to Spain.” Filming a rocky cave at sea, the Moroccan man said that he and his colleagues will stay in the cave until the night to take the route to Spain. Both Spain and Morocco are facing irregular migration issues. In August, Malaga Hoy said that 13, 326  irregular migrants arrived in Spain, “almost 9,000 fewer than in the previous period.” European Border and Coastguard Agency Frontex said that the “number of detections of illegal border crossings on Europe’s main migratory routes rose 4% from the previous month to around 10 500.” Frontex said that the Eastern Mediterranean remained the “busiest” route in Europe with nearly 5,800 irregular migration attempts detected in July. On August 23, Spanish acting government-approved €32 million to back Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration. The €32 million is in addition to the €148 million aid approved by the EU. Morocco has long called for a shared responsibility to ease the flow of irregular migration on both sides. In an interview with El Diario, Director of migration and border surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali said in August that “border security is the responsibility of all countries, all countries must contribute to make the fight against cross-border crime an effective fight.” In August, spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi said that security services aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019.

Rabat – The Ministry of Education has denied all rumors of hiring Senegalese teachers to end a shortage of human resources at Moroccan schools. The rumors claimed that the ministry will resort to hiring teachers from Senegal to teach maths, English, and other scientific subjects. The ministry shared a statement with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), in which it described the rumors as “baseless” news. The rumors came amid the continuous strikes of contractual teachers, whose principle demand was to be integrated as public employees. The government started hiring teachers under contract in 2016 to meet a shortage of teachers in public schools left by 70,000 teachers who retired. The educators, who describe themselves as “the Forcibly Contracted Teachers,”  have been protesting since February 20. The protestors called for the abolishment of fixed-term contracts, demanding the end of “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers. After a few months of protests, the teachers decided to suspend the strike on April 29, for the sake of their students’ education. The teachers, however, returned to the streets to protests just four days before the academic year began on September 1, pledging to continue the strikes.

Rabat – In its 2018 annual report, published Wednesday, September 11, the Moroccan Court of Auditors criticized the budgetary and accounting management of the Ministry of Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water. “The Ministry does not have a clear policy or written measures defining the responsibilities and the annual qualitative and quantitative objectives for the rationalization of expenditure at the administrative level,” says the report. The Court of Auditors also made numerous observations on the ministry’s overestimation of prices in purchase orders. The ministry has apparently purchased “32 GO Kingston USB” storage devices for MAD 720 per unit.  The devices are sold on the market for MAD 200 maximum. The Court also pointed out the purchase of “HP Color Laserjet Toner CP52255” at a unit price of MAD 16,800, while its market price does not exceed MAD 2,000.” In the same report, the ministry replied to the Court’s observation on the purchase of printer toners at MAD 16,800, saying that “this price concerns 4 cartridges per lot in A3 format and not in A4 format; the A3 cartridges’ unit price is MAD 3,500.” The ministry’s response added that “ the prices included in the order form have been especially adopted after consulting three suppliers.”  As for Kingston 32 GB USB storage devices, the ministry explained that the price paid, estimated at MAD 720 (MAD 600 Tax-Free), is “the price of a high quality storage memory made of unbreakable metal and not that of normal storage memories with a limited lifespan.”  The ministry again mentioned that “the order forms were adopted after consulting three suppliers.”

Rabat – The Directorate General of National Security (DGSN) has announced that it will no longer require travelers to fill in exit and entry forms cards at Moroccan airports from Monday, September 16 onwards. The change not only applies to airports but also the land borders at Ceuta and Melilla, a source told Moroccan outlet Medias 24. No longer requiring travelers to fill in the forms will streamline the process, as well as reducing human traffic. The soon-to-be phased out forms currently require travelers to find a pen and fill out dozens of details such as profession and maiden name, among others. The form must be handed to border police before proceeding to baggage collection or customs. The change comes as part of efforts to increase efficiency in Moroccan airports as traffic through them continues to increase. On August 26, the National Airports Authority (ONDA) announced that 2,394,773 passengers passed through Morocco’s airports in July 2019. This is an increase of 14.24% from July 2018.

The victim, whose husband took her to the hospital, survived the aggression after she received intensive medical care. The victim’s  health status is no longer a source of concern, according to reports. The victim suffered stabs in the neck, back, and chest. Security services managed to arrest the suspect after using an electric impulse gun fire. “The individual was still threatening with his knife when the gendarmes arrived,”  said the public prosecutor in Saint Etienne, David Charmatz on Thursday. The aggressor is said to have suffered from regular depression episodes.  Commenting on the incident, director of the Institute of International and Strategic Relations, Pascal Boniface strongly criticized the media for not showing enough sympathy with the victim.   L’agression de la mère de famille voilée poignardée devant ses enfants ne suscite pas une mobilisation solidaire très forte des médias et responsables politiques . Comme si cela n’était pas si grave de poignarder une femme parce que visiblement musulmane — Pascal Boniface (@PascalBoniface) September 13, 2019  He suggested the woman’s religious identity is the primary reason why her case did not provoke waves of indignation or public pronouncements of solidarity.  “The aggression of the veiled mother stabbed in front of her children does not provoke a strong solidarity mobilization of the media and political leaders. As if it was not so bad to stab a woman because [ She is ] obviously Muslim,” Boniface wrote on Twitter. He added in another twee, “So no reaction on the aggression but a reaction to criticize its denunciation.” Boniface’s comments did not sit well with some quarters of the French public opinion, however. One woman attacked him on Twitter for “trading” in alarmist, false solidarity narratives for his own career. “Always busy catering for your small clientele,” the woman said, appearing to point out Boniface’s supposed Muslim-supporting left-leaning audience.  Donc aucune réaction sur l agression mais une réaction pour critiquer sa dénonciation .Quand au petit commerce souffrez madame que j ai payé -chèrement -pour mes idées alors que vous vivez des votres et de votre fond de commerce électoral https://t.co/C4JEk1h9Ay — Pascal Boniface (@PascalBoniface) September 13, 2019

Rabat – The Senegalese community in Morocco has denounced the murder of one of its members, Mouhamed Thiam in Casablanca. Four suspects allegedly stabbed the 29-year old victim while he was going back to his house in Casablanca on Friday, September 13. Sory Kaba, the head of Senegal’s direcotrate for Senegalese residing abroad, reassured his compatriots that justice will be served in the murder case.  Kaba said in an interview with Senegalese radio RFM that Moroccan police are doing their best to arrest other members involved in the murder. He said in the interview that the Senegalese man was murdered by “a drunkard.” While condemning the heinous act with the same vigor as his countrymen residing in Casablanca and in Morocco at large, Kaba asked them to “stay calm” while police investigate the murder.  The community marched on Saturday, September 14 to mourn their deceased compatriot and condemn the murder. A video posted by  the Association of Senegalese Citizens Residing in Morocco showed the Senegalese community was shocked by the incident. Police were at the scene. Kaba said that police are doing their duty to put all suspects involved in the murder in custody.  “We just ask our compatriots to stay calm. Marches are not the answer in a foreign country. All that needs to be done on this issue, will be done, “he reassured the community. Senegalese news outlet Le Ral later reported that  “almost all suspects” who committed the heinous crime have been arrested.

Rabat –  Leon Buskens visited Morocco in 1984 as a student for the first time. On September 9, 2019, he welcomed a new group of enthusiastic students from the Netherlands as director of the Netherlands Institute Morocco (NIMAR). When NIMAR faced an uncertain future in 2015, the oldest university of the Netherlands, Leiden University, had the courage to make the institute part of its infrastructure. In 2017 the institute was officially reopened by the then Minister of Education, Jet Bussemaker in the presence of the president of Leiden University Professor Carel Stolker and the mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb. Under the aegis of Buskens, NIMAR has not only maintained a steady course but has safeguarded its future by being granted official funding by the Ministry of Education in early 2019. What is the role of NIMAR in contemporary Morocco and what do this year students hope to achieve during their four months stay? “Naturally, education is our main goal. Any student that is registered at a Dutch university or university of applied sciences, can participate in our education program. In addition, NIMAR not only aims at facilitating but also strengthening the collaboration by both Moroccan and Dutch scientists. The research fields encompass a variety of landscapes, but mostly focus on the humanities, social -and political sciences.” Buskens stresses that students do not only remain within the academic confinements of NIMAR, but are given many possibilities to sink their teeth into Moroccan society as well. “Students frequently stay with host families who are more than happy to teach them about customs, traditions and Moroccan culture in general. This creates a proper place for interaction, in which both Dutch and Moroccan students not only increase their knowledge, exchange lively opinions and widen their horizons, but grow out to be young adults who look beyond the limits of their comfort zone as well.” “Being an anthropologist, I have an enormous interest in the way how people live in different cultures around the world. During my studies, I learned that Morocco can be observed in many different ways. Among else it is part of ‘Dar al-Islam’, it lies within the Arabic sphere of influence and is geographically located in North-Africa. However, what sparked my interest most, was the way how Morocco was regarded as part of the Mediterranean. “In a different day and age, The Netherlands and Morocco functioned as the opposite, outer borders of the Roman empire and later shared, let’s put it diplomatically, a certain annoyance with respect to the Habsburg dynasty in Spain. In other words: History shows us that Morocco, as part of the Mediterranean, has functioned as a cradle for cultural exchange throughout the centuries.” Though Buskens had studied the history, culture and art of Morocco, the first encounter with the country left a memorable impression. “I grew up in a small village in the south of the Netherlands, and I can tell you it was quite a shock when I arrived in Morocco for the first time in 1984! What you have to realize is that back in those days, young Europeans with full beards were often regarded as tourists in search of the finest Moroccan hashish. Though I can safely say I did not come to Morocco for Sex, Drugs and Rock ‘n Roll. I came in the humble capacity of an academic and wanted to know in what ways I could conduct my research.” But a lot has changed since 1984. Now we live in turbulent times where distrust, fear, and anxiety flourish. During the official reopening of NIMAR in 2017, Jet Bussemaker as the then Minister of Education stressed the importance of NIMAR in a world dominated by increasing Islamophobia: “NIMAR can bring the worlds of the Netherlands and Morocco closer together by sharing knowledge about Morocco, the Arab world and Islam. Studying these topics in their own context is crucial if we want to really understand one another.” Buskens suggests that looking back at shared history is the antidote for the West’s growing Islamophobia: “Don’t forget, The Netherlands colonized Indonesia for over four centuries and thereby forcefully conjoined with the most populous Islamic country in the world! Once again, it is very worthwhile to study history in order to see what parallels can be drawn. Have people in the past expressed similar fears compared to today? What was the tone of public opinion with respect to Islam back then? Questions worthy of asking in our post-colonial world.” Though shocked by the attacks on two Scandinavian tourists in 2018 Sara, a 22-year-old German-Moroccan was determined to come to Morocco. “Naturally it was very shocking to hear this dreadful news. It has definitely changed my perception of traveling alone as a woman in Morocco, but the solidarity that was expressed by Moroccans in the aftermath of the attack was heartwarming.” Sara has come to Morocco to properly discover her own identity, shaped by her Moroccan father and German mother. “There has always been a rather undefined part of me rooted within Morocco that I have always considered part of my identity. In the upcoming months, I hope to get more clarity on this.” Those who are laboring under the misapprehension that NIMAR is only playing host to young, adventurous students in search of their own identity, are mistaken. At the age of 69, Anne-Marie has seen quite a lot of the world and is not nearly ready to put away her traveling shoes. “I have always been very keen to properly learn Arabic, but never seemed to get around to it. NIMAR is providing me with the possibility to not only study Arabic extensively at the institute, but I get to practice Arabic on a daily basis by staying with a host family in the Medina.” Whereas Anne-Marie has traveled around the world and regularly stepped out of her comfort zone, Cemal thought it was high time to he did so too. “Up till now, I have dedicated much of my life to studying and thought it was high time for a change! I was born in the Netherlands, but have a Turkish-Moroccan background. Understanding Darija is therefore not very difficult for me, but I still have a lot to learn before I can properly bargain in fluent Darija with the better merchants of Rabat.”

Rabat – In a belated response to the high rate of home accidents caused by electronic gadgets and related products in Moroccan households, the government has announced its determination to curb the Moroccan market of low-quality, cheap, and high-risk products. The announcement, published by the Ministry of Investment and Industry on Friday, September 13, stressed the urgent need to “protect Moroccan consumers” from hazards linked to low quality home appliances, especially telephone chargers and batteries. The recommendations and policy measures contained in the ministry’s announcement mostly read like an organized assault on cheap, low quality electronic gadgets putting Moroccan lives in danger, especially in low-income households where these low-quality, cheap gadgets find themselves a home. The ministry suggested the measure comes as an “urgent” response to a number of sad incidents in the past months. Implied in the ministry’s announcement is the notion that the recent wave of tragic events caused by cheap household appliances, and which took a number of Moroccan lives call for a robust camping to keep Moroccan households safe. The aim of the resulting “quality control campaign” is to “protect Moroccan consumers from accidents stemming from chargers and batteries which have often had dramatic consequences for Moroccan families,” the statement noted. In addition to protecting Moroccan families, the ministry added, the campaign also hopes to raise awareness among sellers of the targeted products. The goal is to “remind them of their legal duties and obligation” towards both the authorities and their fellow citizens. The announcement is part of the government’s resolve to effectively implement the national plan for quality control launched in early 2019. The statement indicated there have been some encouraging results since the launching of the campaign. It explained that, in the first six months of 2019, more than 300,000 high-risk, low quality chargers and other appliances were prevented from reaching Moroccan markets after “drastic border controls” established they would pose threats to Moroccan consumers. However, the need to invest more efforts in upholding the plan has become even more pressing in recent weeks as a result of a number of tragic incidents. The latest such tragedy was the death of 7-year old girl in a house fire. The 7-year-old girl, Hiba, lost her life in a blaze caused by a low-quality telephone charger in her room in a low-income neighborhood in Sidi Allal Bahraoui, a small town in the Khemisset Province in the Rabat-Kenitra-Sale region. Also targeted by the government’s quality control camping are household appliances other than chargers and batteries. These include gas products and equipment, replacement parts (for cars and electronic devices), textile products, as well as school and home furniture.

Rabat – Police seized one ton and 630 kilograms of cannabis resin, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security said. During the operation, the security services arrested two suspects aged 41 and 46, believed to be involved in the drug trafficking operation. Police also seized a vehicle used for drug trafficking and a considerable amount of money from previous drug trafficking operations by the suspects. DGSN put the suspects in custody for further investigation to determine the circumstances of the case and to arrest other suspects involved with the network. A report published in March by  the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) shows that the largest quantities of cannabis were seized in Morocco in 2017. That year alone, Moroccan authorities seized 117 tons of cannabis resin and 283 tons of cannabis.

Rabat – As part of the Royal Initiative ”1 Million School Bags,” running across the 2019-2020 school year, 113,664 students in Fez have received school bags from the government, according to MAP. A further 112,934 children in the province of Al Haouz have also received their school bags, an increase of 5 % compared to the previous year. According to MAP, a total of 4,463,000 children will benefit from the program this year. The initiative, which has a budget of MAD 484 million, was launched by King Mohammed VI in 2008 and has since been renewed every year. It is the largest government program to support school enrollment and is funded by the Social Cohesion Fund. Primary and high school students in rural areas benefit the most, receiving 63% of the donations. The goal is to prevent students from dropping out, and to ensure equal opportunities and provide support to families in need. King Mohammed VI kicked off the initiative himself this year, personally handing over textbooks and school bags to students from the Othmane Ibn Affane School and Sidi Yahya Zaer Collegiate High School, both in the Skhirate-Témara Prefecture. He also inaugurated the school year by visiting the training Centre for Hotel and Tourism Professions in Temara on Thursday, September 12. While there, the Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research, Said Amzazi, presented King Mohammed VI with results from an assessment of the education system and the reforms that are currently underway. He reassured the King that the programs and measures in place are running smoothly, according to MAP.

Rabat – Storms, heavy rains, and flooding are all part of mother nature, but the earth’s climate has changed at dangerously high rates over the past two centuries. Flooding and rain are becoming common phenomena, even during the dry season. Just last month, Morocco’s southern provinces experienced a series of dramatic flash-floods, resulting in death tolls and severe property damage. In Taroudant, a city in the Sous Valley in southern Morocco,  heavy rains caused flooding that killed eight people. Imlil in the Atlas Mountains and Khenifra in northern central Morocco also experienced floods, resulting in the death of two people in Khenifra. The last incident, which spread fear among citizens in southern provinces was the overturning of a bus because of flooding in the Errachidia province on Sunday, September 8. The incident killed at least 24 people. The Ministry of Mines and Energy indicates that the “geographical position of the North African country makes it naturally vulnerable to the ever increasing impacts of man-made climate change, including desertification, floods, and water scarcity.” The ministry  said that Morocco’s vulnerability  is due to the “increase of arid and semi-arid zones, hence worsening the desertification phenomenon and impacting water resources.” Human-accelerated climate change touches every country in the world.  Its effects have led countries across the globe to adopt policies to tackle the causes and consequences of the climate crisis.  Despite challenges, Morocco is among the countries making significant progress in the right direction. As Morocco World News is the solo media in the Maghreb to participate in the Covering Climate Now journalism initiative before the September 23 UN Climate Action Summit in New York, the news outlet prepared a list of policies that have helped Morocco to establish itself as a climate justice leader,   both in the Maghreb and MENA region. Green Morocco Plan Did you know that Morocco launched the Green Morocco Plan (GMP) in 2008 to help cope with its climate change threat?  According to the Moroccan government, the plan targets “reducing the impact of climate change and preserving the natural resources.” The plan also seeks to boost the exportation of agricultural products as well as to promote Moroccan soil products. Morocco’s economy relies significantly on agriculture. The plan received a nod from international NGOs as well as the World Bank. “It represents a triple win, as it involves both adapting the country to the reality of climate change and taking steps to reduce its impact on its people and environment,” noted Francoise Marie Nelly, former World Bank Group Country Director for the Maghreb. The GMP also aims to make Morocco’s agriculture sector more resilient, sustainable, and adaptable to climate change. “This strategy [GMP] is included in the continuity of several major projects at the national level such as creating jobs, fighting poverty or protecting the environment,” the Ministry of Finance and Economy said. Water Management Morocco acknowledged that it is facing the threat of limited water resources. Droughts are “one of the most important obstacles to the development of national agriculture because of poor and irregular rainfall.” Hence, the GMP Initiative also includes a strategy for water management, a subject of crucial importance in Morocco. The North African country is among the world’s most water-scarce countries due to its dependence on rainfall in its agricultural industry, not to mention the droughts that have plagued the country since 2015. To cope with the water challenges, Morocco’s Green Plan prioritizes water management. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, their strategy preserves natural resources in “view of insuring sustainable agriculture through.” Several steps are involved, including  the “support for the water conservation irrigation systems (from the current 154,000 ha to 692,000 ha).” The ministry added that the “under-valuing and overuse of surface and groundwater is due to the inefficiency of the irrigation system.”  To remedy this, Morocco’s plan proposes new policies for the management of water supply, irrigation water, and the use of water for high value-added crops. Renewable Energy Morocco has a clear objective and is competing to become a world leader in the renewable energy sector. The North African country’s advancements in renewable energy are a source of pride for the government. Morocco’s renewable energy law 13-09 focuses on, “promoting energy production from renewable resources.” As the world continues to inch closer to the catastrophic effects of climate change, countries are increasing their measures and paving the way toward a more sustainable future. The Moroccan government is poised with a goal to increase national renewable electricity production to 52%  by 2030. In the short term, Morocco aims to generate 42% of its electricity from renewable energies by 2020. The country’s electricity production has increased by 25.1 % since 2019, according to the Direction of Studies and Financial Forecasts (DEPF), part of the Ministry of Interior. Morocco heavily invests in solar energy through the world’s largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, the Noor Ouarzazate project and Noor Midelt I. Morocco ranked 13th in Global Renewable Energy Attractiveness Index, making it a hotspot for renewable energy investment despite falling one spot. Zero Plastic  Morocco’s government has been combating the use of plastic bags nationwide, despite its persistence in the market.  Morocco ranked one of the largest consumers of plastic bags at 26 billion units, or 800 bags per person each year, a situation that urged the government to adopt its 2016 landmark law banning the production, import, sale, and distribution of plastic bags countrywide. Security services have encouraged the abolishment of plastic bags through campaigns labeled “zero mika” or zero plastic bags. In a further crackdown against plastic bags, Moroccan authorities have seized tons of banned plastic products. In  March 2018 alone, authorities seized almost 2.96 tons of plastic bags in Tangier. Last But Not Least Despite all the policies put in place, Morocco desperately needs to raise awareness of climate change and its consequences. A report from the BBC’s research project Afrobarometer indicates that a majority of Moroccans are not even familiar with the term climate change, let alone its impacts on the country’s environment and people.  The study shows that four out of ten Moroccans have never heard about climate change. The result is alarming as policies need mobilization and vigilance from citizens in order to achieve concrete results and to reduce the surge in climate change concern. Perhaps the solution lies in a campaign to help educate Moroccans about the existence and serious effects of climate change. In addition to zero plastic campaign Morocco has been seeking to initiate awareness campaigns on the impacts of climate change. In May, the country hosted the Peace Boat Program in Tangier. The program includes youth, who travel abroad by boat to speak about the challenges that the world faces due to climate change. The program is a collaboration between the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Action Campaign, Moroccan NGO Atlas for Development, and the Council of Young Leaders of Tangier. Morocco World News is proud to be part of the Climate Covering Now journalism initiative. We are dedicated to shedding light on the climate change challenges that face Morocco and planet earth. In the run up to the September 23 UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Morocco World News commits to covering the “biggest story of our time.”

Rabat – We would not automatically think of banjo tunes segueing into traditional Moroccan Gnaoua music, fused with blues and jazz. But this trajectory made all the sense in the world for Majid Bekkas, an internationally renowned pioneer of Gnaoua fusion music. The native of Sale, Morocco, started playing the banjo at 15 years old. From picking the twangy instrument to working as a librarian for the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Bekkas followed an unusual career route that lead to a unique genre.  Even after teaching classical guitar at Rabat’s National Conservatory of Music, Bekkas finally said, “Enough. I prefer to spend the rest of my life playing my music. That’s what I do.” Bekkas shared stories and opinions on his career, the spirit of Gnaoua music, and the genre’s international trajectory, in an interview with Morocco World News. Bekkas accepted a fresh juice with this reporter along the Sale Marina, across the Bouregreg River from the capital city Rabat. Sunlight danced across the waves as the musician began to recall his musical journey.  At 15, Bekkas picked a banjo to play popular “chaabi” music before he helped the recent Gnaoua renaissance. Gnaoua music is a traditional Moroccan genre with roots in slavery, a fame for its trance practices, and hypnotizingly beautiful rhythms.  Gnaoua was not popular during Bekkas’ banjo days. At the time, “when you said Gnaoua,” Bekkas remembers, “you said slave.”  During his banjo days, Bekkas found inspiration in Casablanca’s Nass el Ghiwa, which he phrased as “the Beatles of Morocco.… The history of the groups, it starts with this group.” This band featured the guembri, a traditional Gnaoua two-string instrument. As soon as the guembri touched Bekkas, his banjo was doomed to take a back seat. The Gnaoua master, or “maalem,” Ba Houmane was a popular figure in Sale. Bekkas watched the well-known community member drumming Gnaoua in the streets. He connected.  “One day I followed him. He was with the drum and I was following him until his house. And he told me, ‘What do you want?’ I was a very—I don’t know—something, something was in me, told me that I must follow him.” Thus began his menteeship on the camel-skin bass instrument. Nestled in the Arab world and North Africa, Moroccan identity is sometimes conflicted. Gnaoua’s recent revival plays a part in connecting Moroccans to a pan-African identity. “I think Gnaoua music in itself, she’s African.… The mother is one—it’s Africa. Even with the blues, the blues or Gnaoua music—African music. The mother is one.”  Bekkas is enthused for the Gnaoua diaspora but has concerns about preserving its integrity.  “I still hope that this music [can] be more developed.… But what I am afraid of—I’m afraid that it becomes something that will lose the spirituality of this music. That’s the most important in this music—to stay spiritual. And so we have to be careful when [we] speak about fusion, we really have to be careful, and we have to be open to know about the other cultures before starting to make this fusion between Gnaoua and the other music.”  His work proves that Gnaoua’s essence can be preserved with open-minded cooperation and inspiration.  Gnaoua’s spreading popularity has a lot to do with coastal Essaouira’s annual Gnaoua World Music Festival. In June, an estimated half million+ music fans traveled to the 22nd annual celebration—a celebration both of Gnaoua music and its capacity to complement other genres from around the world. Music transcended borders under the stars on stages free for all visitors.  Long before the festival, legends like Jimi Hendrix visited the area to learn from Gnaoua music. This genre, at the roots of so much beloved music, is now up for a vote into UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list. “Gnaoua music, it’s not only music … the master of Gnaoua, at the same time, he’s—how do you call it—guerisseur. Healer of the soul.… It’s the other function of the master. He organizes a Gnaoua night, we call it lila, when someone doesn’t feel good.… They play these colors—seven colors—we have seven colors in the lila. And they play these seven colors until the morning. And after that, people enter in trance, and they feel much better. It’s why they call the masters of Gnaoua also the healers of the soul.” Bekkas believes these sacred trance roots will be key to preserving the genre in its integrity. “It’s because of the lila that this music will never disappear. You can never lose it, because in the Gnaoua night, we play the tradition—all the tradition, tradition repertoire. In the festival, it’s what we call secular. In the lila, we play the sacred. And in the festival, the secular. That’s the difference.”  This is starting to change. Gnaoua’s increasing popularity means recognition and new festivals in Europe. “It’s great – that means that it’s a big success. And now in Belgium, they’re gonna organize the first edition of a Gnaoua festival.”  Bekkas will perform in Belgium October 2 and performed in Berlin in August. The Berlin festival, in its second year, actually includes a lila trance night to share the music’s spirituality. “I hope in each European city, we will have a Gnaoua festival like this. The Gnaoua can tour all over the world,” he added.  Essaouira’s emblematic festival faces concerns about cultural appropriation and a focus on foreign artists. As long as the music retains its integrity, Bekkas is not worried about cultural appropriation or fusion.  He acknowledged inequities within the group of artists but focused on the opportunities playing with big names provides to the Gnaoua community.  “I think that the organizers—they try to, of course, you know when you bring a big name, it’s—treatment is different, everywhere. Even in the United States.… But the Gnaoua musicians, the Moroccans, they cannot forget that, at least this festival, it gives them the opportunity to play and to share their music with thousands of people.”  Festivals in Morocco rarely invite Gnaoua musicians. “And then there are many specialists there, many professionals, they can choose some [Gnaoua] groups to play abroad,” he pointed out.  In addition to playing upcoming festivals in Europe, Bekkas is working on a record with the Afro Gnaoua Jazz Ensemble. Essaouira attendees in June got a sneak peak at their work during a high-energy show—fans should look forward to an electric guembri solo on the album.  Bekkas personally recommends anyone new to the genre listen to three different maalems, masters of the three schools of Gnaoua: Maalem Sam, Maalem Hamid Da Bouso, and Maalem Mahmoud Guinea. Looking into Gnaoua fusion, Bekkas’ classic “African Gnaoua Blues” is a must-listen.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has instructed an “important governmental delegation” to represent Morocco at a security summit organized by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), government sources have indicated. The conference, set to open today in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is expected to discuss the mounting security challenges facing the West African bloc as well as other strategic areas in the Sahel area. In the past months and years, the Sahel region has faced a resurgence of terrorist activities by various extremist groups, including Boko Haram, Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi), and, increasingly, ISIS returnees. Countries like Burkina, Niger, and Mali, and Nigeria have so far borne the brunt of the rising insecurity in the region. The conference, organized amid that grim background, is meant to be an occasion to discuss tighter security cooperation among ECOWAS member states—15 in total—as well as other countries on the continent and elsewhere willing to significantly contribute to curbing the lethal wave of terrorism revival in the region. “Under special royal instructions,” noted the government statement, the Moroccan delegation to the conference will be headed by Foreign Affairs minister Nasser Bourita. The statement added that the royal instructions came in response to an invitation from Niger’s President Mohamadou Issoufou, who extended a special invitation to King Mohammed VI for the summit. Morocco’s status of “special guest,” according to the Moroccan government, suggests an acknowledgement of the kingdom’s efforts for continental agendas, especially in the ECOWAS where Rabat has been notably active of late in all vital sectors. Meanwhile, for Morocco, the event represents an opportunity to support its ECOWAs membership bid by highlighting the depth of its significance to the regional body, from economic to socio-political reasons. Despite strong evidence that Morocco’s membership would significantly benefit the organization, the country’s membership bid is still facing some internal obstacles. At the Ouagadougou summit, Morocco hopes to emphasize its effective, world-renowned security and anti-terrorism apparatus, a reminder of the significant value added its membership represents for the collective challenges ailing many countries in the regional bloc.

Rabat – A new report has warned against the danger of receiving ISIS widows, pointing out that many of them could still pose serious security threats to their countries of origin or adoption. The report, carried out by a Brussels-based organization for monitoring the return former wives of ISIS fighters, found out that while many of the returning “ISIS brides” are ready to readjust to normal life and forgo of the radical lifestyle they lived under while in ISIS strongholds in Iraq and Syria, a significant number could still be serious security threats. Among the returnees and prospective returnees monitored in the study are various European nationalities, including 10 Belgians of Moroccan descent, Morocco’s Arabic outlet Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported on September 14. According to the paper, many of these women joined the terrorist group young and impressionable and underwent some radicalization training. While Morocco has not particularly been concerned with the return of ISIS widows, the Al Ahdath Al Maghribia report indicates that dozens of Moroccan women, formerly married to ISIS fighters, are currently living in Kurdish refugee centers in the custody of Kurdish fighters credited with liberating many of the former ISIS strongholds. This means that Morocco, too, should prepare for the challenge of returning ISIS widows, according to the report. The report comes in the wake of hot debates in Europe and the US around the fate of ISIS widows and their children. In the UK, the Shamima Begum case sparked controversy earlier this year. Begum was 15 in February 2015 when she left the UK with three other school girls to join the then Islamic caliphate. Now 19 and a mother of one, the former ISIS bride has expressed remorse for her decision to join the terrorist group and said she wants to return home to the UK to give her son the chance to have a normal life. Opinions were divided in the UK, with some advocating for her return and others arguing for Begum to be stripped of her British citizenship and be denied entrance to the UK. The British government is so far siding with the anti-return camp in the intricate matter of returning ISIS brides. Begum’s story ignited a wave of emotional support in the UK, government critics pointing to the callous decision of refusing return to a young, remorseful mother. Her son has since died; she had several children who have also all died. The most recent was born and died while she was waiting to hear from the Home Office if she could return to the UK. In a similar instance in the US, Hoda Muthana, who left her family and university studies in Alabama to join the terrorist group, has also expressed profound regret for her decision. The former ISIS bride has also begged to return home with her son, but has so far been met with steady refusal from the Trump administration. In its report, the Brussels-based group argued that the number of former ISIS brides poised for normal life and genuinely remorseful for their involvement with ISIS far outweighs that of those that could still be security threats. It recommends that, despite the serious security challenges, countries should receive these former ISIS brides and hold them in rehabilitation or deradicalization centers until they are fully ready to lead normal, radicalization-free lives in the countries to which they choose they return.

Rabat – The leading online travel agency for personalized vacations, Tourlane, conducted a study to determine how expensive a weekend at Oktoberfest is, and what surprising destinations are cheaper than a weekend at Oktoberfest. “Every year thousands of German travelers plan a visit to Oktoberfest. But we wanted to find out what kind of vacations they could experience for the same amount of money,” noted Manuel Stegmann, Head of Travel Product at Tourlane. “We are excited to show travelers a variety of amazing destinations that they can travel to for even less than a weekend break in their home country,” he added. The agency came up with a list of ‘exotic’ destinations where Germans can spend one week for less than what they would spend at Oktoberfest. The 186th Oktoberfest will be held between September 21 and October 6. Based on the costs of accommodation, roundtrip flights, ground transportation, food, drinks, activities, and souvenirs, the price per person for a weekend at Oktoberfest is estimated at €1,356.56, according to Tourlane’s press release. The agency’s list of alternative destinations includes Mauritius, Panama, Seychelles, Jordan, and Morocco. “Turns out, a weekend of beer-swilling costs Germans more than a week-long vacation to the gorgeous country of Morocco!” According to the study, a one-week stay in Morocco costs from €835 per person. The trip prices per person and for one-week include roundtrip flights, accommodation for seven nights, daily breakfast, and rental car via Casablanca, Rabat, Meknes, Fes, and Marrakech. As for beer, Germans can still enjoy it for only €17,78 instead of €47,20. “For one-third of the price you can experience a fairy tale from “One Thousand and One Nights,” says the agency.

Rabat – In yet another interesting development in the six-month-long anti-system protests in Algeria, demonstrators in Algiers were on the verge of storming the private residence of General Ahmed Gaid Salah, the chief of staff of the Algerian armed forces and current Defense Minister. But they were eventually prevented from reaching the villa, derailed by a strong security contingent deployed to secure the place. According to local reports, protesters’ anger with their country’s political establishment has grown in recent weeks amid concerns that the regime has no genuine will to retreat from political life once the transitional period is over. Protesters are aiming for a radical, complete rupture from the establishment that has ruled over the country for the past two to three decades. Meanwhile, the current regime is seen as plotting continuity, with a figurehead candidate prepared and sponsored to be voted in power. This, according to analysts, would mean that the old regime would be pulling the strings from behind the curtains even long after elections are held. In the past weeks, General Salah has become the most prominent face of the continuity which protesters are determined to root out. Yesterday, in the thirtieth week of the ongoing protests yesterday, a strong contingent of security officers was deployed at the villa of General Salah in the Annaba neighborhood in Algiers, where the general spent his day, several on-site observers commented on social media. The unusually strong military presence aimed at preventing crowds of demonstrators from storming General Salah’s private villa, reports concurred. The news comes amid abiding perceptions in the ranks of protesters that the general could be the most serious obstacle standing in the way to the radical generational change of political power that demonstrators are seeking. In his latest speeches, the general has called for elections to be held as early as mid-December. This, he has argued, is to end the political and social impasse in which the country has been engulfed for six months. “The situation can no longer tolerate delay,” General Salah recently said. For protesters, however, General Salah pushing for early elections smells of ulterior motive from the current regime. Algerians, the Washington Post reported earlier today, “don’t want an election forced on them by a regime they decry, and see their uprising as a chance for a wholesale democratic rebirth.” In an analysis published earlier this week by the African Arguments, Algerian analyst Faten Aggad made the same point. Aggad argued that the vast majority of Algerians regard “quick elections” as a “trap.” Aggad wrote: “Gaid Salah’s preference for speedy elections is well-known. Since Algeria’s huge protest movement forced President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to resign after 20 years in office this April, the ruling establishment has repeatedly argued for quick elections.” The suggestion is that the establishment sees in early elections an opportunity to have its figurehead candidate win over an ill-prepared and potentially divided opposition.

Rabat – In a statement, the Directorate-General of National Security (DGSN) reported the arrest of a 31-year-old individual suspected of possession and dealing in heroin. “In light of the extensive efforts to fight against drug and psychotropic trafficking, the DGSN arrested the suspect on September 13 in Bni Makada district in Tangier,” said the statement. Following investigations and search operations, the DGSN seized two kilograms of heroin as well as large sums of money. The police suspect that the money, totaling MAD 198,710 is revenue from the suspect’s drug deals. The suspect remains in police custody under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office.  The investigation to determine the details of the case is ongoing. Police are also looking into the possible national and international ramifications of the case. Moroccan authorities aborted several other drug trafficking operations in recent months. Police thwarted an attempt to smuggle 700 kilograms of cannabis resin in the city of Asilah in Northern Morocco, on August 30. A day before, on August 29, Moroccan police forces cooperated in leading search operations. The search enabled the seizure of two cars with fake plates, six tons and 723 kilograms of cannabis resin, and the hunting rifle.

“I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,” read a tweet, characteristically trump-esque in its style, on Tuesday, September 10. With the tweet, the president announced his decision to dismiss John Bolton, his notoriously hawkish, distinctly mustachioed senior security adviser, known for his unabashed and undiplomatic practice of diplomacy. As ever, Trump’s tweet, meant for spectacle hit the jackpot in a matter of hours. Reporters and analysts fell over themselves to make sense of Bolton’s unceremonious dismissal by a president with whom he once shared numerous views on foreign policy, including the belief that “toughness” is all that is needed to end the world’s problems. Trump had been clear about the reason for his decision: “I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration.” “The rift between the president and his national security adviser owed as much to personality as to policy. The president never warmed to him, a dynamic that is often fatal in this White House,” the New York Times reported within hours of Bolton’s dismissal, giving the first insights into the abrupt end of Bolton’s tenure within the Trump administration. Then came the onslaught of commentaries and analyses with the clear aim of illuminating Bolton’s fall from grace with Trump. As it happened, hours after Bolton’s exit from team Trump, the hawkish diplomat’s disagreement with Trump on questions such as North Korea and Afghanistan provided the perfect background for a sudden dismissal that seemed at once surprising and expected. “It was a marriage that was never going to last: Trump and Bolton rarely saw eye to eye on global hotspots. The national security adviser held far more hawkish views than the ‘America first’ president on matters like Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan,” the Associated Press analyzed. While this answers “why” Trump may have finally decided to make use of his beloved “you are fired” line with Bolton, it does not answer the “why now” aspect of the interesting development in what once looked like a Trump-Bolton bromance, with “toughness” and “greatness” as the defining features of a “winning America” amid a resurgent China, a determined (to come back) Russia, a petulant North Korea, and an intransigeant Iran, among other challenges. For all the reported fallouts and the storied disagreements between Trump and Bolton, few would have bet on Trump’s firing Bolton as dishonorably as he did. For one thing, Bolton’s “tough guy” reputation and his unwavering pro-Israel stance on Middle-East issues spoke to the heart of the most powerful bastions of the Republican establishment. More still, Trump is said to have genuinely believed that Bolton was an invaluable asset to his foreign policy. “The president says having Bolton on his team improves his bargaining position and gives him a psychological advantage over foes like North Korea and Iran,” Axios reported last July. Trump’s “Bolton doctrine,” the report went on, was rooted in the president’s strong belief that Bolton’s very presence in his administration was a stark reminder to other countries that every instance of refusal to fall in line with Washington came with the promise of “invasion” or air strikes or “tough” economic sanctions.  Bolton, in a sense, was Trump’s safety jacket in the troubled and unpredictable waters of foreign policy. So why fire him now? Because, answers the Guardian’s Julian Borger, “Trump wants to build a legacy,” whereas “Bolton breaks things.” An “inveterate hawk,” Borger continued, Bolton’s isolationist and aggressive methods accounted for Trump’s failure in landing the diplomatic breakthroughs he so desired with North Korea, Iran, and most recently the Taliban in Afghanistan. What this flurry of post-dismissal analyses, think pieces, and in-depth reports all seemed to agree on is what has so far been referred to as the “Bolton effect.” The idea paints Bolton’s preference for chaos and havoc over intricate diplomacy or painstaking peace negotiations. “If it was up to him he’d take on the whole world at one time,” Trump said of Bolton in a June interview. But while North Korea, Iran, and the Talibans are the dish du jour, and the most readily cited reasons for Trump’s disillusionment with Bolton, the Bolton effect went beyond the confines of those three foreign policy challenges. In the Western Sahara case, Bolton carried a considerable punching weight that has gone unmentioned, or perhaps neglected, in almost all the commentaries since his unceremonious dismissal. The obvious reason, at least judging from the top dossiers currently on Trump’s security agenda, is that Western Sahara does not carry a similar weight as any of the three ostensible reasons in the offices of the White House or the Pentagon. While such an argument correctly reflects the mood in Washington, it misses something essential in the recent ramifications of the Bolton effect. Bolton’s winding career as a senior US official and then a UN diplomat would be incomplete without his Western Sahara episode. By Bolton’s own admission, he is one of  the two American diplomats with extra-diplomatic attachment to Western Sahara. This was plainly laid out in his presentation last December of the US’ new Africa Strategy. Even as the “strategy” was supposed to be about what the US plans to do to “contain” China’s and Russia’s growing influence in Africa, Bolton made sure to put Western Sahara at the center of any US’s “Africa strategy” under his watch as senior security adviser. He said he was “frustrated” with the twenty-seven years of “ineffective” cease-fire without referendum. He went on, in the Q&amp;A session, to puncture almost all his answers with suggestions of how committed he is to referendum and “self-determination for the Sahrawi people.” But the most visible impact of the Bolton effect came when the UN Security Council broke with its tradition of renewing the UN peacekeeping mission by one year. Bolton pressured for a six-month renewal, arguing that “intense pressure” on all conflicting parties would yield faster results. Bolton views MINURSO, the UN’s Western Sahara peacekeeping mission, as “wasteful” and “ineffective,” and the entity could expect no friendly winds as long as Bolton dictated much of the US security directives. “Since Bolton’s appointment, in March, there has been a flurry of activity regarding the Western Sahara conflict at the UN and in the State Department,” the New Yorker reported late last December. The article quoted Bolton as saying, “There are two Americans who really focus a lot on the Western Sahara: one’s Jim Baker, the other’s me. I think there should be intense pressure on everybody involved to see if they can’t work it out.” This, other interviewees told the New Yorker reporter, amounted to Western Sahara’s dose of the “Bolton Effect.” The underlying message was clear: Bolton was the brain behind the US’ shift on MINURSO, and his policy of maximum pressure on conflicting parties came with the radical promise that things would quickly, perceptibly evolve on the Western Sahara front. In Bolton’s recognizably cold pragmatism in Western Sahara, Morocco stood as the obvious culprit for all the bad in the enduring conflict. “Morocco is in possession of almost all of the Western Sahara, happy to keep it that way, and expecting that de facto control will morph into de jure control over time,” Bolton said in a 2007 piece, particularly fuming at the failure of the Baker Plan for Western Sahara, a resolution to which he had contributed in 2003 while serving alongside James Baker, then the UN personal envoy for Western Sahara. While pro-Polisario outlets applauded Bolton’s appointment in March of last year, Rabat was on the edge, knowing that Bolton’s sympathy was for the opposing camp. For a large swath of Moroccan analysts and policy makers, Bolton’s very presence in the upper echelons of the US security machinery was a source of uncertainty, even anxiety. Bolton hung over Rabat ferocious and constantly threatening, like a Damocles sword. And so, while Iran, Afghanistan, and North Korea were the primary reasons for Bolton’s impromptu departure, Morocco finds itself an incidental beneficiary of a move—Bolton’s sacking—which, while it had apparently nothing to do with Western Sahara, could vastly impact the direction of the upcoming MINURSO discussions in October. Of the latest developments in Western Sahara, the most notable was arguably the revelation of Washington’s preference for Morocco’s autonomy proposal over the Polisario Front’s insistent statehood aspirations, in flagrant defiance of Bolton’s determination to push through a referendum on self-determination. In a recent report that caused jitters in the pro-Polisario camp, the Wall Street Journal, considering the merits and limits of the Bolton effect in Western Sahara in the past months, spoke of the frustration to come for self-determination enthusiasts pinning all their hopes on Bolton’s sympathy for their cause. “Independence activists in Western Sahara were elated, seeing in Mr. Bolton a potential savior. Moroccan officials worry he is too sympathetic to those hoping to create Africa’s newest country,” noted the article. It continued, citing Hmad Hommad, a pro-Polisario activist in laayoune: “We’re depending on him, we appreciate what he is doing for the people of Western Sahara, and we will be good friends of the U.S.” And then, turning to a pragmatism that now comes across as a bout of foreign policy prophecy, the article concluded: “But those hoping to raise their flag over an independent Western Sahara are likely to be disappointed by the Trump administration.” But with Bolton gone, the separatist front has not merely lost a supporter; it has lost one of its most vocal, passionate champions with the relevant connections in the right places.

Rabat – Early morning in the coastal town of Azemmour, about an hour south of Casablanca, Anne Heslop makes her way from her house to a nearby garbage dump. Like every other day, she will begin this one by looking through piles of rubbish for newly abandoned kittens.  Azemmour, like most Moroccan cities, is overrun with strays. Many of these cats and dogs are malnourished and carry viruses—and they are all rapidly reproducing. But one charity, ERHAM, has been working tirelessly to change this.  ERHAM means “take pity” in Arabic, and this is exactly what founder Anne Heslop wants the people of Azemmour to do: take pity on the animals subjected to a life of neglect in Morocco’s streets.  Anne formally established the charity in October 2017 by hosting festival “Meow” in the town of Azemmour. The celebration of cats taught the local people how to take care of their cats and, most importantly, introduce them to the benefits of sterilization.  ERHAM’s ultimate aim is to reduce Azemmour’s cat population by carrying out regular sterilization campaigns and help end the unnecessary suffering of street cats and unwanted kittens. Azemmour’s kitten dumping crisis One of the town’s glaring issues is the constant abandonment of kittens, born to cherished household pets but dumped in a rubbish tip by owners who can’t afford to keep them.    “The people love their cats, and love that they keep their houses free of mice and rats, but they are at a loss to know what to do with the kittens that keep on coming,” Anne told Morocco World News.  “Some of these kittens will probably end up abandoned on the dump. The owners most likely believe the kittens will survive independently, but the chance of this happening without our help is really very small.” In the spring of 2019, Azemmour faced a total disaster at the city’s garbage heap. “I couldn’t believe it when I arrived last April and went to the dump. There were approximately 80 kittens crying for food, many of them were sick, and two were disabled,” Anne recalled.  A local resident named Fatima had been caring for the kittens of the rubbish tip for longer than she can remember. This year, however, was overwhelming.  “Fatima was doing her best to take care of them, but she was utterly distraught and clearly needed help. It was a heartbreaking scene.”  ERHAM quickly organized a clean-up and treatment day and employed workmen to set up a concrete slab with a tiled surface for feeding. Meanwhile, volunteers removed all of the kittens from the dump, cleaned them, fed them, and gave them medical treatment. ERHAM also made waterproof boxes to serve as shelters on the concrete, and the “kitten city” of Azemmour was born. That day underscored precisely why it is so important to offer free sterilization services to Azemmour’s cat owners and educate the population about the procedure’s benefits. Most residents can’t afford to sterilize their own cats, and many suspect that spaying and neutering animals violates their religious principles. This creates a staggering population of unwanted kittens. “Instead of just working with street cats, we carry out awareness and treatment days in different parts of Azemmour to encourage people to bring their female cats to the clinic and make use of the free service,” Anne explained.  A desperate situation Anne is a UK native and photojournalist. She has been visiting Morocco regularly for the past 30 years and bought her house in Azemmour in 2008. Although ERHAM is still a relatively young charity, Anne’s concern for Morocco’s cats goes a long way back.   “I remember finding flu-ridden kittens in Taghazout on one of my first visits and spending a lot of time trying to help them, but it was when I bought my house in Azemmour that it really hit me how desperate the situation was,” Anne recalled.  “Once your eyes are open to their plight, you see it everywhere.” Overwhelmed by the dozens of kittens she found wasting away in the streets of her town, Anne “researched animal welfare and cat rescue in Morocco, hoping to find some help, but there were very few active organizations active at that time.”  The pivotal moment that inspired Anne to take matters into her own hands occurred in 2014.  “I heard a kitten’s pitiful cries coming from a deserted building and followed the cries to find it. While looking, I found two more, both with severe eye infections and both terrified.” While a friend went to fetch Anne a box to transport the three kittens she had found, she came across another two. She went home with five sick kittens that day and ended up turning her roof terrace into a kitten hospital.  This marked the unofficial start of ERHAM.   Anne began her work by doing what she could for the town’s cats by herself, supervised by a sympathetic local vet named Abdelbaki Zryouil. While filing the paperwork to formally launch the charity, she gradually found other local cat lovers who wanted to get involved, and now ERHAM has a small team of volunteers. Anne devotes masses of time towards promoting ERHAM while at home in the UK. She writes articles for news outlets such as Metro and the animal welfare blog Katzenworld. She is constantly reaching out to new contacts for support, organizing events, and facilitating adoptions in the UK.  “It’s incredible how much goes on behind the scenes to keep the plight of the cats in the forefront of people’s minds and to fundraise to support our activities,” Anne said. She added that gaining support and encouragement from a few key people, including Agria Pet Insurance and Britt Collins, the founder of Catfest London, has been a huge help. “We are ready now to increase our work to have a bigger impact on the welfare of the cats in our town, but funding is a key component to enable us to do this.” Looking to the future: sterilization is the only way forward Anne has noticed a change in Azemmour, where the general public seems to be following ERHAM’s lead.  “They are becoming more aware of the street cats’ needs and also seem to have learnt and appreciate how important sterilization is.”  Most importantly, the locals know that they can go to ERHAM for help—this is key in an area where most people cannot afford veterinary care.  Comprehensive country-wide change, however, must be initiated on a larger scale. Although there have been unverified rumors of upcoming government-led sterilization and vaccination programs, there is still a long road ahead.  “I do think there is a shift in the Moroccan government’s attitude to animal welfare and rights,” Anne noted hopefully.  “At the moment, there are agreements being drawn up with established local animal welfare organizations and there is more awareness that the people of Morocco, supported by foreigners, no longer accept the barbaric methods of population control currently in practice,” she continued.   “We hope to soon see new laws implemented and adhered to by the local administrators to protect animals and respect their rights.” You can support ERHAM’s free sterilization program here: Just Giving Go Fund Me

Rabat – The water crisis has been a global issue, leaving no country untouched. In recent years, and with the emergence of social media as a means to voice concerns, people have started sharing videos to express their frustration over the water crisis in both rural and urban areas in Morocco. So, how safe is drinking tap water in Morocco? For Shelley Clevedon “poor drinking water is a widespread problem throughout Morocco.” Clevedon has initiated a project she labeled as the “Giving Pool” to help people, particularly girls in boarding schools in the Atlas Mountains, get access to safe drinking water. “I am starting in Asni because it is simply a place to start,” she said.   The project owner chatted with Morocco World News about her objectives and expectations. “I have been bringing water filter bottles and larger family-sized water filters to Morocco and my friend Hassan Hisse, who is a tour guide, has distributed them to families in need as he travels the country.” The Giving Pool finds that despite efforts to mitigate the crisis of drinking water at the international level, “these huge projects take time” to bear fruit. “Building dams and wastewater recovery plants take time,” the NGO said. “I have been doing fund-raising in my town of Polson, Montana in order to buy and distribute water filter bottles and pump-style water filters to those in need,” she said. Clevedon now is digging to reach her goal: to provide water bottles to boarding homes established by Education for All, an NGO that seeks to help provide education for girls in rural Morocco. The NGO  establishes boarding houses near secondary schools to help girls in rural areas continue their education. “My goal is to provide water bottles to each of the girls at the boarding homes (about 600) in the near future.” She said that during her next visit to Morocco she will bring “pump-style water filters along with replacement filters to each of the kitchens at the boarding homes.” She added that she will be bringing many water filter bottlers as she can possible bring “I am sure you understand that shipping into Morocco is quite costly and I will bring them when possible to reduce costs,” she said. In the Giving Pool webpage, there is an estimation that “1 in 4 people in Morocco do not have access to safe drinking water.”  In addition to safe water concerns, Morocco is also considered a water-scarce country “confronted with dwindling groundwater reserves,” according to the United States Agency for International Development  (USAID). Awareness is the key A recent report from the World Resources Institute (WRS) has ranked Morocco among the countries threatened to face high baseline water stress. The report listed Morocco  22nd in the overall ranking and 12th in Arab countries. Taking the problem of the water crisis in Morocco to heart, especially in rural areas, the project owner takes the boarding school for girls as a priority. “I want to distribute bottles through the schools and boarding homes that we so that we can also educate as to the problems with contaminants in the water.” She also emphasized that awareness is needed to help people avoid problems from water contamination. “Awareness of the problem is key,” she said. She added that she had talks with  Mike McHugo, founder of Education for All, hoping to make teachers involved in the awareness campaign “so that they can begin testing their own water.” “We envision that the  girls can then bring water samples from the wells in their home villages for testing and then we can start branching out and providing water filters to their villages.” ‘I have no idea where the project will lead’ With high spirit, Clevedon is inspiring to make her goals achieved despite the fact that she is not sure where her project will lead. “I simply want to help in any way I can.” Asked about what inspired her to initiate the project, she said that during her first visit in Morocco in 2015, she was “drawn to the country.” “I have witnessed the difficulties of obtaining pure water to bring and became very aware that many people must drink unsafe water.” She said that the crisis is affecting “many people”s health. “I am a pediatric occupational therapist in the US and the focus of my life is on children. I, therefore, will focus on the children with this project as well.” The  project-owner also drew attention to Morocco’s waste management systems, saying that the water crisis is even a problem for those “who can afford to buy drinking water.” In Morocco, as you know, many of these bottles end up littering the countryside because of poor waste management systems.  I have more information regarding this concern on my website.” Clevedon said that the only profit she is expecting from the project is better drinking water for the people. “There is no money profit to me at all.  The profit will be in better health of people who should be able to have their basic needs met, namely fresh, clean water,” she told MWN. She added that she used her own private fund to “obtain legal help, obtain the non-profit status, build the website and initially, all of the bottles were purchased out of my private funds.” Clevedon added that in order to make her project work, she has a wholesale bottle status with “the Seychelles Company that makes the water filtration systems.” “For every bottle, I sell at regular retail price, I can donate one to a child in Morocco.” She told MWN that she is also able to take “donations and I am having a music fund-raiser in October to raise more funds. I have plans to also work through the schools in the US to help raise funds,” she added. Morocco: my ‘heart place’ Clevedon did not forget to pay tribute to Moroccan people and for the country for its beauty and for the hospitality of Moroccans. She added that she visited many places in the North African country. “When I come next month, I will tour three of the boarding homes near Asni,” a small town in the foothills of the High Atlas Mountains near Marrakech.  “I am stuck by the hospitality of the people. I am welcomed by everyone. Although I love my home country, I feel an affinity to Morocco and call it my ‘heart place’.” Helping in a small way Clevedon cited King Mohammed VI’s recent speeches, in which the monarch called on the government to come up with a new development model to curb the socio-economic crisis to end social disparities. “The King has recently called for faster expansion of access to basic social services, support for schooling and an increased focus in the fight against poverty.  I am not the only one who knows that there are great social disparities in Morocco,” she said. With simple thoughts, Clevedon said she wants to “lend my hand in helping with the more overarching goals laid out by your King and government.  I think that something as basic as providing fresh drinking water is a good place to start.”  In addition to the water project, Clevedon also said it is an honor to help Education for All in providing education for girls. “These girls grow into educated women who then have families and are vital members of their communities.” Clevedon wrapped up the chat with Morocco World News, sharing her experience in one thought. Clevedon said that she met with “so many wonderful, heartfelt people who want to help.” She also described her experience as lovely “while making this dream a reality. This is a passion for me, and I will stick with it. I will keep moving down the road as long as I possibly can.”

Fez – “Although it is too late for me to get back some of my lands, when I see all these women finally getting justice, I feel like the struggle has been worth it. I feel that their joy is my joy,” said Rkia Bellot, a soulalya woman and activist, to Morocco World News.  “Whether they like it or not, it is our right. The law is on our side now.”  The House of Councillors has adopted a new set of laws designed to protect the rights of women who have a stake in communally-owned lands, also known as soulalyat women. The new laws, passed on August 2, affirmed women’s rights to benefit from their ancestral lands alongside men. The approval of the new law has cemented an important step in the fight for gender equality in land rights that has lasted over a decade.  “After ten years, it is an incredible moment in the struggle for the rights of soulalyat women,” affirms Saida Idrissi, a women’s rights activist who has been involved in the fight since its very beginning, in an interview with MWN.  “Before, we were talking about a lawless situation, where the issue was dealt with through the administrative circular of 2009. Now these women know that they have the power of the law on their side. They can go to court if need be.”  The term soulalyat comes from the Arabic word “soulala,” meaning bloodline, family, or tribe. The soulala system has been in place in Morocco since pre-Islamic times. Under this form of land management, the land belongs to the kinship group as a whole, and thus could not be sold.  The right to use the land for agriculture and benefit from its proceeds, however, was transferred from father to son according to the “orf,” or custom, which denied women the right to inherit.  According to Saida Idrissi, over 15 million hectares of land across the kingdom falls under the soulala system. Over 10 million people have claims to using the land. Based on that figure, the issue affects approximately 5 million Moroccan women. Until the new laws passed in August, the main legal texts governing soulala lands were the Dahirs of 1919 and 1969, which upheld the power of the “orf.” “Before, the men were more responsible, they took care of their mothers, sisters and nieces, the system worked. Now, everyone is just looking to profit,” says Bellot. She has been one of the movement’s figureheads since its early days. She is from the Lhadada commune in Morocco’s Gharb region, which includes Rabat, Sale, and Kenitra. Although the movement has expanded nationwide, the Gharb region is still considered its epicenter.  “Women have always contributed to the lands. They have always worked alongside the men in agriculture, in addition to tending to the home and raising children,” Bellot comments. “The situation was illogical, unnatural. Women have worked those lands and were just as entitled to them as men, but they would be denied and their rights trampled on. Women would invest in the land and work on it. Many would build houses on the small plots they owned, only to be kicked out when their brothers got married and wanted to start a family” insists Bellot.   With Morocco’s rising economy and expanding cities, many soulala lands have been purchased through public domain or private acquisitions. The money goes into an account managed by the office for rural affairs at the Ministry of the Interior. It is then supposed to be distributed according to the official lists of rightful claimants presented by the “nuwab,” the elected representatives of the soulala.  Before the administrative circular of 2009, the nuwab omitted the names of women from those lists.      When Bellot started working on this issue back in 2007, she faced plenty of resistance, not only from local representatives, but also from the NGOs she reached out to for help. “Nobody wanted to touch this topic, it was too complicated, too risky,” she says.  Bellot went to see the Democratic Association of Women in Morocco, ADFM, who finally gave her the support and attention she was looking for. The ADFM rallied women to the cause, providing awareness campaigns among those affected and lobbying before the government.  The hard work accomplished by the movement began to bear fruit. The first real progress was seen on the issue in 2009, when the Ministry of the Interior issued an administrative circular stating that the Office for Rural Affairs would refuse to consider lists which did not include women.  However, the burden was still on women to present themselves and try to get their names put on the registry of legitimate claimants. As Bellot affirms: “When women try to claim their lands, they still hear: This is none of your business. Only men have the right to use these lands. This is what our traditions say.” “Since the movement for Soulalyat rights has started, the Office for Rural affairs and everyone in the central administration has always been very helpful. However, we faced and still face a great deal of resistance from local officials.”  Many of the nuwab would outright ignore the provisions of the circular, feigning ignorance or citing the supremacy of the “orf.”  Some women faced threats from male family members if they tried to put themselves on the list. “Many men threatened to divorce their wives if they put their names forward,” Bellot says. For women in rural areas who still depend heavily on their husbands for support and where divorce is a social taboo, this is a sizeable threat.  For many of the women and activists involved with this topic, the new laws are only the first step to guaranteeing true equality for soulalyat women. As Saida Idrissi points out, “Authorities must make it easier for these women to access information. Much work still needs to be done to guarantee access to information and administrative services.”  For rural women in Morocco, poverty rates are high and illiteracy rates are even higher. In 2015, seven out of 10 rural women had never had access to formal education. Despite the many efforts by NGOs and the Ministry of the Interior to empower women, they still face barriers when it comes to claiming their birth rights.  In addition, the procedure for women to claim their rights is still difficult. According to Bellot,  women first have to submit a claim to the local “kaid” and the local “naib,” or representative. If at this stage the woman’s claim is refused, she must then submit a complaint to the Office for Rural Affairs at the Ministry of the Interior. If her case is subsequently dismissed, she can now, thanks to the new laws, go to court. The process is both lengthy and financially draining for women, many of whom are working in agriculture, have families to care for, and have to incur the costs and time burden of hiring a lawyer and handling the legal procedures. According to Bellot, it can take up to a year or two and cost up to MAD 5,000. For many women living in rural areas in Morocco, that is a fortune. “There is still a lot of resistance, many men still want to keep the lands and profits to themselves, even educated men go back to the ‘orf’ when it suits them. Although things have been changing, [and] more women have been able to sit on the nuwab councils,” Bellot says. “What we really need is an awareness campaign. We need these laws to trickle down into the ground. We need local officials to be aware of the laws and to apply them. Laws by themselves will not change much unless there is genuine awareness and punishment for those who break them.”

Rabat – Based on US Department of Treasury data, published on September 13, Four Moroccans are on the list of Washington’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. One of the Moroccan terrorists on the list is Anas El Abboubi who currently lives in Syria, having joined ISIS in 2013.  Anas El Abboubi, believed to be dead following fighting in Syria, was an Italian citizen of Moroccan descent.  El Abboubi, known in Italy by his stage name Mc Khalifa, was previously arrested by Italian counter-terrorism police in June 2013 for jihadist propaganda. He had created a blog titled “Sharia4Italy,” and used it to incite to racial hatred. El Abboubi was taken into police custody in Italy in 2013 for plotting an attack in northern Italy and recruiting individuals for militant activity in Syria. He was released after two weeks in custody and later fled to Syria to join ISIS. In 2016, The Obama administration imposed sanctions on El Abboubi for joining ISIS. The State Department, then, included him in its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. The second Moroccan terrorist on the blacklist is Abdallah Hamch nicknamed “Abu Souleymane”. He is the commander of the Tarek Ibn Zyad battalion of 300 foreign fighters affiliated with ISIS. Abu Souleymane was often mentioned following the terrorist attacks perpetrated on November 13, 2015, in Paris killing 131 people. ISIS took responsibility for the attacks. US intelligence identified the veteran fighter as a potential mastermind behind the Paris terrorist attacks. The other two Moroccans on the US list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons are Salah Abdeslam and Mohamed Abrini. They were also involved in the attacks in Paris and the attack on Brussels airport.

Rabat – Security services in Errachidia province recovered on Friday, September 13, the five more victims from the wreckage of the bus crash caused by heavy flooding.  Over the past two weeks, authorities have found several bodies after a bus connecting Casablanca and Rissani overturned on a bridge in the Draa Tafilalt region. The incident was the result of floods in the region after severe rainstorms hit the province. Search operations are ongoing to find possible missing victims. On Monday, September 8, authorities initially reported that only six people had been killed in the accident. Search operations subsequently found several more bodies. On September 11,  authorities found the body of a woman, also the victim of the accident caused by floods in the Errachidia province. Security services managed to rescue 30  other people victims of the incident. Moroccan television channel 2M reported today, September 13, that the 54 passengers were on the bus. Floods hit several regions across Morocco, killing eight in Taroudant in southern Morocco last month.  A further two people were reported dead due to floods in Khenifra, while the Imlil region,  a town 66 kilometers far from Marrakech, experienced a flood that caused massive material damage

Rabat – A fire started at Hassani Hospital, located in the center of Nador, yesterday September 12. The fire caused serious damage to the hospital’s facilities but there were no human casualties. Firemen responded quickly and extinguished the fire. The emergency services also evacuated all the personnel and patients of the hospital. Police are now undertaking an investigation to find the cause of the fire. Witnesses at the scene suspect a short circuit. This is not the first fire to send shockwaves through Morocco in recent months. In August, a forest fire burned 470 Hectares of greenery near the city of Chefchaouen, in the north of Morocco. Local authorities worked for nearly three weeks to control the flames. In the same month, a shocking video of a young girl trying to escape a burning apartment went viral. The incident happened in Sidi Allal Bahraoui, a town near Rabat. The footage shows Hiba, the little girl, trying desperately to escape the building by the window, but she was blocked by metal grills. Neighbors who had gathered down below, waiting for firemen to arrive, could only look on helplessly as the girl burned to death.

Rabat – Ticket inspectors on a bus in Safi took 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome to a police station for boarding without a ticket. The ticket inspectors are employed by Spanish transport company Vectalia. Zineb, the young girl, was on the bus to go to Mohammed VI physiotherapy center for one of her regular sessions. She wasn’t able to pay for a ticket. For decades, people with disabilities have had the right to take public transportation for free in most Moroccan cities. However, when the city council of Safi signed a contract with the Spanish company, in January 2019, they omitted the right of disabled people to free transportation. This change in policy caused many incidents where people with various disabilities, who had always taken buses free of charge, were forced to pay for a ticket or kicked off the bus. Many Moroccans reacted to this incident on social media, questioning “the humanity” of the employees and bystanders. “Those who took the girl to the police station are Moroccans, as I know. The passengers who were watching are also Moroccan. How come that nobody was generous enough to pay for the poor child’s ticket?” reads one comment on Facebook. “People with Down syndrome can easily forget their books, even if they’re attentive. Sometimes they could be stubborn and refuse to communicate. Those employees are not well-trained and they’re uncultivated,” said another Facebook user. The young girl received an apology from the company after the wave of support on social media. However, Vectalia’s public image was stained by the incident. Safi is not the only city where this problem is raised. Free transportation for disabled people was also cancelled in Rabat and its neighboring cities, after the Spanish company Alsa started operating. A Member of the Parliament, Ibtissame Azzaoui, from the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM), addressed a question about the matter to the Minister of Interior, Abdelouafi Laftit, on September 11. #صوتك_في_البرلمان #برلمان_القرب
وجهت اليوم سؤالا كتابيا إلى السيد وزير الداخلية بخصوص أسباب إلغاء مجانية التنقل عبر حافلات النقل الحضري بالرباط للأشخاص ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة وهو الأمر الذي كان معمولا به منذ سنين طويلة pic.twitter.com/AU79RAj0AY — Ibtissame AZZAOUI – إبتسام عزاوي (@Ibtissame_azz) September 11, 2019 “People with special needs were surprised by Alsa cancelling their right for free transportation on urban buses, which they used to benefit from for many years. Now, they found themselves forced to pay for bus tickets, as an addition to the expenses and daily suffering they have to deal with in many domains. We would like to ask about the reasons behind this cancellation,” said the question. The MP would like to find a common ground with the government in order for disabled people to benefit from free transportation or, at least, from reductions.

Rabat – Kahina Bahloul, the first female Imam in France, told French-Monegasque Radio Monte Carlo (RMC) that she plans to open the first liberal mosque in France.  Men and women would pray side by side and lead prayers alternatively in the proposed place of worship. Bahloul also announced that she launched a crowdfunding campaign to open the mosque, which she intends to call “Fatima.” When asked about headscarves by the talk-show host, Jean-Jacques Bourdin, Bahloul said: “I consider that headscarves are not a religious obligation. I have studied many religious texts and I believe that the Quran does not oblige women to conceal their hair.” “It is important for Islam to establish a new model where men and women have the same role in mosques. In traditional mosques, the main prayer room is exclusive to men. This is not acceptable in the 21st century,” added Bahloul. Kahina Bahloul is a graduate in Islamic Studies from the Practical School of Higher Studies in Paris. She is also the founder of the NGO “Parle-moi d’Islam” (Talk to me about Islam). Last saturday, September 7, two female Imams, Eva Janadin and Anne-Sophie Monsinay, led the first mixed gender prayer in France. Bahloul expressed her support for the initiative.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump took international public opinion by surprise with his decision to fire national security adviser, John Bolton. Despite the ideological affinity between Bolton and Trump, their shared dislike of the United Nations, and multilateralism, their diverging views on several foreign policy decisions have surfaced in many media reports.  In light of the nature of statements Trump has made about his now-former national adviser since last May, it became clear to observers in Washington that his departure from the Trump administration was no longer a matter of if, but of when.  Bolton’s attempts to drag the US into war against Iran, his unsuccessful policy in Venezuela, his disagreement with Trump’s decision to open communications with the North Korean President, and his rejection of Trump’s decision to hold a secret meeting with the Taliban in Camp David Resort all accelerated his departure from the US administration. Moroccan diplomacy, which has been wary of Bolton and has redoubled its efforts to push back against his attempts to leave his imprimatur on the Western Sahara conflict, must have cheered his departure with a sigh of relief.  Having worked on the Western Sahara issue when he was a State Department official and assistant to the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy, James Becker, from 1997 to 2004, Bolton was expected to use all his political weight to pressure the Security Council into accelerating the UN political process in order to force a final solution to the conflict.  Pointing the finger at Morocco Since he was dismissed from his last official position in the US government in 2006, Bolton has blamed Morocco for the failure of UN efforts to end the conflict in all his published work. He has also lashed out at the UN for not having the political will to impose a binding solution on all parties. Bolton has regularly stressed the need to enable the Sahrawis to exercise their right to self-determination through a referendum. An analysis of Bolton’s statements on the subject for more than a decade, suggests that he was embittered by his and James Baker’s failure to end the conflict.  He, therefore, took advantage of his presence at the helm of the National Security Council to shape the outcome of the political process in line with his own convictions. Bolton’s personal stance on the conflict deviates from the official position adopted by the successive American administrations for twenty years, which is to maintain a position of positive neutrality, with some tacit support for the Moroccan position. Bolton’s personal interest in the Western Sahara issue was conspicuous since the early days of his appointment as national security adviser. His appointment coincided with the UN Secretary-General’s submission of his annual report on Western Sahara in April 2018, and with the deliberations of the Security Council surrounding the annual resolution on the conflict.  Bolton’s influence manifested itself in the adoption of Resolution 2414, which renewed  MINURSO’s mandate for six months only as opposed to the traditional one-year period. The shortening of MINURSO‘s mandate aimed to pressure Morocco and the Polisario Front, and push them into demonstrating goodwill and resolve to reach a final, and perhaps non-consensual, solution to the conflict.  Since April 2018, the Security Council has adopted three resolutions, the latest of which was resolution 2468, which extended MINURSO‘s mandate for six months. The shortening of MINURSO’s mandate, and the pressure that the US put on the parties to work out a solution, paved the way towards two roundtables in Geneva in December 2018 and March 2019 under the auspices  of former Personal Representative of the United Nations, Horst Köhler. Bolton’s personal resolve Bolton’s resolve to personally monitor the conflict, as well as to shape and accelerate its resolution, was evident in his December 2018 address to the Heritage Foundation. During the address, he expressed his frustration with the Security Council’s failure to manage the conflict as well as  MINURSO’s failure in its mission to hold a referendum of self-determination. Bolton also expressed his personal commitment and the determination of the US administration to put an end to what he sees as the Security Council’s failure to reach a final solution to the conflict.  Bolton took many by surprise when he mentioned the referendum and seemed committed to making it a priority. Bolton’s media appearance indicated that he was personally monitoring the conflict, and more, that he was adamant about pressuring the parties and the Security Council into action. The speech came nearly a month after Algeria had signed a contract with lobbying firm Keene Consulting, owned by Bolton’s close friend  David Keene.  These two events suggested that Keene and Bolton would work collaboratively to shape the outcome of the UN political process to the benefit of Algeria and the Polisario. Since Bolton’s appointment as national security adviser, I called on Moroccan diplomacy to act quickly and to mobilize all its energies, human resources, and contacts in Washington to push back against his plans and prevent him from undermining Morocco’s strategic interests and its strategic relations with the US. I suggested that one of the solutions available to Morocco to neutralize Bolton was to cozy up  to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, known for his affinity with Trump, for being part of the president’s inner circle, and also for having less than friendly relations with Bolton.  Despite Bolton’s political weight and strong personality, it was a given that he could not single-handedly take any foreign policy decisions or impose them on the US administration. There are many players in the US decision-making process, including the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the White House, which has the final say in decision-making. A positive outcome for Morocco despite all the challenges An analysis of the outcome of the UN-led political process of Western Sahara during Bolton’s 17-month tenure, shows that it has been more positive for Morocco than many believed. Morocco has shown a sense of savviness and resilience in dealing with what the media dubbed as “The Bolton effect.” Notwithstanding the Security Council’s decision to shorten  MINURSO’s mandate, the three resolutions adopted by the Security Council since April 2018 have enabled Morocco to make diplomatic achievements that it had failed to achieve in the years prior to 2018.  Morocco’s diplomatic leap forward is illustrated by  resolutions 2414, 2440, and 2468, which all emphasize the need  to achieve a “realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise.”  These resolutions are the first in which the Security Council discusses the outcome of the political process, and stresses the parties’ need to be realistic in order to reach a practical and lasting solution. The Security Council’s new outlook means that a winner-loser solution is no longer on the table, which is in line with Morocco’s position. Rabat has long reiterated that its autonomy proposal is a face-saving solution that protects the interests of all parties, including the Polisario, while preserving Morocco’s sovereignty over the Sahara. The preamble to resolution 2468 includes new pro-Morocco language, namely the Security Council’s emphasis on its commitment to supporting the parties to reach a  just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution, based on compromise. In comparison with previous resolutions, the phrase “based on compromise” has been added to highlight, once again, that the Security Council will not impose any solution that is not based on compromise.   What further underscores the Security Council’s approach is the fact that it stressed that the political solution will be based on compromise three times in Resolution 2414, four times in Resolution 2440, and five times in Resolution 2468.  The language in the new resolutions was not as heavily used in all previous resolutions. The phrase “on the basis of compromise” was mentioned only once in all resolutions adopted since 2007, except for resolutions 1754 and 1783, which did not include it at all. Additionally, resolutions 2440 and 2468 mentioned Algeria and refer to it on quasi-equal footing with Morocco. This is an unprecedented change in the language adopted by the Council on this issue since the start of the political process in 2007. While the importance of Algeria’s participation in the political process was mentioned three times in Resolution 2440, it was mentioned five times in resolution 2468. This suggests a gradual shift within the Security Council to consider Algeria a key party in the conflict. This shift is in line with Morocco’s stance. Morocco has long insisted that Algeria be considered a key party to the conflict, and on the fact that the dispute cannot be solved as long as Algeria is not seen as such. Based on the above, one can safely say  that Morocco did not only emerge unscathed from Bolton’s tenure as national security adviser, but also made significant diplomatic gains it had not been able to achieve in the past. One possible explanation for this could be that Morocco has benefited from increased contact with and outreach to US State Department and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  The political gains Morocco has made during  Bolton’s tenure in the US administration, suggest that Morocco has benefited from the rocky and unfriendly personal relationship between Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It is an open secret in Washington that his personal feud with Pompeo is so intractable that the two communicated through intermediaries. Morocco may have taken advantage of these circumstances  to cozy up to the US Secretary of State and senior State Department officials to convince them to maintain the US traditional stance on the conflict, and to prevent Bolton from imposing his own convictions and personal agenda. Morocco has also managed to get its message across to the White House by cozying up  to President Trump’s son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner. Kushner made two visits to Morocco in 2019; during one visit, he was received by King Mohammed VI.  These two visits suggest that the Moroccan diplomacy has succeeded in passing its message along to President Trump via his son-in-law, thus neutralizing  Bolton and preventing him from undermining Morocco’s interests or negatively affecting Moroccan-American relations.  The ultimate decision-maker in the current US administration is President Trump, and if Morocco succeeded in cozying up to his closest associates, it will have gone a long way to aborting all its opponents’ schemes to stymie its efforts to preserve its diplomatic gains and sovereignty over Western Sahara.

Rabat – Driss Jettou, head of Morocco’s Court of Auditors submitted his 2018 report, in which he drew attention to serious concerns about standards across various sectors. One section in the report scrutinized the conditions of prisoners in Moroccan prisons and the overarching infrastructure of the prison system Jettou found that the participation of regional directorates in the management of prison institutions was “weak.” The court criticized the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) for not having enough man-power to manage prisons. According to the report, “the DGAPR suffers from weak supervision within prison institutions,” emphasizing the significant difference between the number of staff compared to the prison population. Within the central administration of DGAPR there are also serious gaps in manpower, including vacancies for directors, the court found.  The report also found delays in the submission of paperwork for construction work on the prisons. The failure of contractors. “Three prisons were assigned to the same company in the framework of open requestions for tenders.” The three prisons were commissioned in Asilah, Berkane, and Oujda. “The company announced its bankruptcy.” The company, therefore, stopped its construction works, which started in 2015. “These projects are currently in the process after some other companies took over.” The court report added that field visits to some prison institutions show “deficiencies in the infrastructure.” The findings specified that, “no safe areas around the perimeter of most prison institutions.” “Despite the importance of these infrastructures in the security system of prison institutions, the action plan in line with the security protection strategy does not include any action aimed at addressing this shortcomes make infrastructure meet international standards.” Jettou also addressed the lack of electronic monitoring equipment to combat the smuggling of illegal products into the prison. The report said that the examination of data on the management of electronic surveillance devices to combat counterfeit products was able to “identify severe shortages of such equipment.” Examinations found that 39 prisons do s not have a radiation detector. The available detectors do not meet monitoring requirements. Many prisons also lack metal detectors, 58 prisons in total do not have metal detector gates.  The DGAPR does not “have a preventive plan to manage the maintenance of these devices.” The court report said that 68% of the offenses committed within prison institutions during the period 2013-2017 are linked to the possession of illegal substances. Only 30,42 % of prison institutions have video surveillance systems, according to the court’s findings. “The effectiveness of these systems remains limited due to the presence of video cameras, which does not enable comprehensive surveillance of all sensitive places,” the report warned. The report added that 48 % of prison intuitions do not have electronic surveillance rooms.  “The available [electronic surveillance] rooms are not provided  with qualified and sufficient human resources.” Prisoners at risk The report shows that prisoners remain at a high risk of suffocation in the event of a fire within the prison facilities. “Data on  fire-fighting equipment proved that prison facilities still suffer from several weaknesses that limit the effectiveness of these devices.”  Field visits to the prison showed the persistence of flammable materials used in the cells, including the beds. The report says that the average space allocated to each prisoner is about 1.8 square meters. According to international standards, the court emphasized, prisoners should have 3 square meters.

Rabat – The annual report from the Court of Auditors for the year 2018, published on September 11, has raised serious concerns about food hygiene and safety in Morocco. The report found shocking issues in several sectors, especially the agricultural sector. The sector is under heavy scrutiny as it constitutes one of the pillars in Morocco’s economy.  Driss Jettou, the head of the court pointed fingers at the Moroccan National Health Security Office of Food (ONSSA) in the report. The office operates under the supervision of Aziz Akkhannouch,  Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. The court accused the office of not generalizing the monitoring of food safety in local markets. The court found that certain steps  of the food chain “are not covered by [ONSSA’s monitoring system], including wholesale fruit and vegetable markets and traditional poultry slaughterhouses.” Jettou’s findings warned that all concerned parties should be involved in the monitoring of the health and safety of food products.  The  Ministry of Interior, local authorities, and royal gendarmerie members who monitor transport used to distribute food are, according to the court, all bodies with a responsibility for monitoring food hygiene. “The porosity of some border points makes it difficult to control [food safety] due to the smuggling of live animals, and veterinary medicines, as well as agricultural pesticides.” Health concerns from pesticide use According to Breast Cancer.org, there is a real concern that chemicals such as pesticides can increase the risk of breast cancer. “There’s a real concern that these chemicals may cause health problems, including an increase in breast cancer risk.” While no studies show direct connections between pesticide exposure and risk of breast cancer, “young female farmworkers are at higher risk for a range of medical conditions. And some of the most commonly used pesticides have been shown to mimic estrogen in laboratory animals,” the organization said. The cancer mortality rate has increased in Morocco in the past few years, especially in cases of cervical cancer. In 2018, in the region of 2,465 women died of cervical cancer, out of the 13.2 million women in Morocco. The number of deaths from cervical cancer per year nearly doubled in the country between 2012 and 2018, increasing from 1,076 to 2,465, according to the coalition. The use of agricultural pesticides, the report noted, is “one of the main measures to improve productivity, but such use must be subject to a number of conditions to reduce the adverse effects that such pesticides may cause.” The conditions include respect for the amount of the approved product in fruits and vegetables, the report added. Not respecting such conditions can cause high levels of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. Pesticides can cause serious human health problems and damage the environment. Export products are safer Products for exports are subject to “strict control of agriculture pesticide residues,” while products distributed in the domestic market are not subject to the same standards, the report noted. Staff at the regional divisions have only completed one monitoring plan for pesticide residues in fruits, vegetables, and aromatic plants to control plant products or plant origin. Lack of coordination The report warned that this issue facilitates the smuggling of foods of unknown origin and health status into Morocco. There is also a lack of coordination between stakeholders involved in food control at ONSSA.  The issue makes the establishment of good tracking targets impossible. “The size of human resources is not commensurate with the size of the tasks entrusted to the office [ONSSA].” The report emphasized that a large number of ONSSA staff retired in recent years. Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch’s department is also accused of not holding people involved in food safety violations accountable. The report found that concerned administrations are often unable to hold to account violators who produce, store and distribute food products. “The [ONSSA] observers do not comply with the requirements of LAW 07.28, as these observers have only limited authority to impose administrative sanctions against” vendors and manufacturers who violate the standards. The law only allows observers to seize products not meeting safety requirements.  Article 18 of Decree 617.98.2  of January 5, 1999, on the inspection of livestock’ safety and quality, stipulates that meat products shall be damaged if they don’t meet consumption standards. The court finds that slaughterhouses don’t have the necessary means to respond to the requirements of destroying meat products that are found not safe for consumption. Most municipal abattoirs do not have a crematorium or, in cases where they do have, it is not used to the high cost of fuel consumption.  The slaughterhouse in the city of Temara, near Rabat, is an example of this. In rural areas, the situation is “worse,” finds the report. “In  slaughterhouses in rural areas, slaughter  and skinning conditions are not conducted in the proper way.”

Rabat – Morocco has “firmly” condemned Israeli Prime Minister’s recent comments about annexing the Jordan Valley and other territories in the West Bank, joining a growing chorus of critical voices that have warned against setting a dangerous precedent in the Israel-Palestine conflict. In a statement published yesterday by MAP, Morocco’s official news outlet, the Moroccan government said it was deeply concerned by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s insistence on extending Isreali sovereignty to the Jordan Valley. Echoing the unanimous decision of the Arab League, Morocco said the comments from the Isreali Prime Minister constituted “a dangerous escalation” in a conflict that has lasted for far too long. For Morocco, annexation by Israel of the territories would further tensions, “torpedo” international law, and dampen any hopes of resolution for the lingering conflict. Like many in the international community, Morocco supports a two-state solution where the territories in question would be under Palestinian sovereignty. In response to Netanyahu’s annexation rhetoric, Morocco reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding the dignity” and “inalienable rights” of the Palestinian people, arguing that the Israelis premier’s declaration was in large measure an ultimate act of hostility towards Palestinian’s rights. Morocco’s “firm” response comes after an equally muscular speech by Prime Minister Netanyahu, full of Israeli nationalism. In an electoral speech last Tuesday, Netanyahu exhorted Israelis to give him “a clear mandate” to annex most of the West Bank. “If I receive from you, citizens of Israel, a clear mandate to do so… today I announce my intention to apply, with the formation of the next government, Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea,” he said. He promised, however, that the move would be completed in “maximum coordination” with Washington. Netanyahu’s domestic critics have interpreted the “dramatic announcement” as an “election trick.” They have maintained the comments are an empty promise aiming at securing the support—and votes—he needs for winning next week’s elections. Outside of Isreali electoral calculations, however, the declaration has been deemed serious; it has consequently been met with equally serious condemnations. “He is not only destroying the two-state solution, he is destroying all chances of peace,” Hanan Ashrawi, a senior official with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, told AFP. She described the move as “unquestionably reprehensible” and added: “This announcement is a declaration of war against the Palestinian people’s rights as well as the very foundations of the international rule-based order.”

Phosboucraa gained the certification in Angers, France on Thursday, September 12 as an acknowledgment for its pro-development project, the Foum El Oued Technopole.  The project is a city of “knowledge and innovation” in favor of Morocco’s southern provinces, Phosboucraa Foundation said.  The OCP-backed body launched the planning project on a 600-hectare plot. The construction started in February 2016. The project, which required a budget envelope of $ 200 million, is expected to accommodate  30,000 inhabitants by 2035. The technopolis, 20 kilometers away from Laayoune, includes a training and research center, support facilities for regional economic development, cultural facilities, such as a museum, and a commercial and artisan village.

Rabat – Magnus Soderlund, a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics, caused controversy after he allegedly advocated cannibalism at the Gastro Summit in Stockholm. The professor made his statement at a panel entitled “Can You Imagine Eating Human Flesh?” according to the New York Post. Magnus argued that eating human flesh from dead bodies, as an alternative to over-reliance on pastoral farming, could help with the challenges of climate change. The professor also said that he is “open” to the idea of tasting human flesh. In an interview after the symposium, he said, “I feel somewhat hesitant, but to not appear overly conservative …  I’d have to say … I’d be open to at least tasting it,” he said. He also said that eating pets and insects would help with climate change challenges.

Rabat – Spain’s first far-right party Vox again called on Spain Thursday, September 12, at the Spanish Parliament to build walls at the Moroccan borders of enclaves Ceuta and Melilla. The wall, according to the party, would ease the flow of irregular migration between Spain and Morocco. Both countries are facing pressure due to irregular migration. Vox also seeks to send armed forces to the border, providing them with more weapons, according to Grupola La Provincia. Currently the borders of the two Spanish enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, with Morocco are enforced with double fences and barbed wire. Often described as a Trump-inspired politician, the leader of the party, Santiago Abascal,  believes that Rabat should pay to build a wall at the land border between Spain and Morocco.   In response to the party’s claims, spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi said at a press conference held after the government weekly meeting on September 12  that Morocco’s position regarding Ceuta and Melilla is clear. El Khalfi said that both enclaves are occupied territories. “The position of the kingdom has been known for a long time,” he said. This is not the first time that the Trump-inspired politician has asked Rabat to pay for a wall at the land border between Spain and Morocco. In a book titled “Santiago Abascal: Espana vertebrada,”published in March, writer Fernando Sanchez Drago revealed Abascal’s party immigration policies. The book states that Abascal wants to make Morocco pay for the wall because he sees the North African country as the primary culprit for the waves of irregular migrants that have reached Spain in recent years. Abascal believes that the wall “is a psychological one and consists of informing immigrants that those who enter illegally in Europe will never be able to regularize their situation nor will they have the right to stay, nor will they have social assistance, nor will they be given a health card,” according to  Fernando Sanchez Drago’s book.

Rabat – The young Moroccan man who filed a complaint for rape against Spanish television personality Felix Ramos, withdrew his complaint today, September 12. “The victim declared that he does not want to pursue his legal action against the alleged pedophile. He withdrew his complaint from Tangier’s court this Thursday, September 12,” said Taib Bouchaiba, the regional coordinator of the NGO “Don’t Touch My Child” for the fight against pedophilia. According to the activist, who accompanied the young Moroccan to file his complaint, the victim has “certainly received money from the Spanish suspect’s circle.” “He (the victim) lives in a difficult situation, he must have accepted money to withdraw his complaint,” adds Bouchaiba. As a consequence of the withdrawal, the case against the suspect is weaker. Ramos may now escape jail time. Ramos is known to the Spanish and Moroccan courts for selling falsified titles, distinctions, and diplomas on behalf of several institutions. He was arrested on Tuesday, June 18 in Tangier for “child abuse and human trafficking.” The victim reportedly met Ramos when he was 14 years old. The suspect approached the young man who lived in a homeless shelter run by a Spanish woman, and offered him work on television. Ramos also promised the boy documentation and accommodation in Spain. Ramos then invited the boy to a five-star hotel in Tangier. “That day, he raped me; I suffered so much that I will never forget it,” said the victim, reports Spanish newspaper El Espanol. The alleged pedophile abused the young man for several years, paying him for his silence. Local authorities of Tangier closed the homeless shelter where Ramos met his victim after the incident. According to Bouchaiba, other homeless young people in Tangier could have been victims of similar abusers. “These children living on the street are the new victims of pedophiles who come here for what is called ‘sex tourism’,” he said. These young people seek for the most part to sell their bodies to survive. “It’s the easy solution when they need money. They do not always want to lodge a complaint because they live on it,” says Bouchaiba.

Rabat – For the first time in 13 years, a Harvest Moon will fall on a Friday 13th. A Harvest Moon is the full moon that occurs closest to the September equinox each year when the face of the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth as the sun. The Harvest Moon occurs every year and marks the beginning of autumn. The rare thing about this moon is that it falls on what is considered to be the unluckiest day of the year in Western superstition, leading people to call it the “spooky full moon.” A full moon this Friday 13th? Time to get spoopy 👀🎃 — Sarita Bee (@quesarita21) September 10, 2019  The fear of Friday 13th is believed to have originated in the 13th century, but the exact origin of the superstition continues to be debated. But, in many cultures, 13 is considered to be an unlucky number and Friday has also been associated with bad luck, so the two combined strikes fear into the hearts of the superstitious. September Full Moon is on Friday 13th. My four wicked brain cells: pic.twitter.com/ew9wfRfOhY — T0NEδ (@GiinTonic) September 8, 2019  According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in Asheville, North Carolina, an estimated 17 to 21 million people in the United States are affected by a fear of this day. There is even a specific term for the phobia: friggatriskaidekaphobia. The word, which is over 100 years old, is made up of a combination of the Norse and Greek roots words for ‘Friday’ (Paraskeví), ’13’ (dekatreís) and ‘fear’ (phobia). Over the years, studies have been conducted, particularly in the US, to determine whether the day actually increases the chances of unlucky things such as accidents occurring. No significant correlation has ever been found. The day has also held cultural relevance in the West thanks to the American horror franchise Friday the 13th, which has had 12 sequels as well as a series of spinoffs and is believed to be one of the most successful media franchises of all time. A full moon also has spooky connotations in many cultures. One widespread belief is that the full moon causes people to act strangely, which lead to words such as lunacy and lunatic being derived from the Latin word “luna.” The combination of the two leads to a perfect storm for superstitious people this Friday. The next time the date coincides with a full moon won’t happen until 2049.

Rabat- Several Saudi women have freed themselves from the Saudi dress code. Traditionally, women in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to go out without wearing abayas, long black public robes. Mashael Al Jajoud is one of the women who defied the dress code in Saudi Arabia, posing for photos wearing an orange top and a white paint with high heels. Photos show Al Jouloud walking with pride in a Riyadh mall have gone viral. The photos of the 33-year old woman stirred debate on social media. In the viral images some Saudi women and men wearing abayas and staring at Al  Jouloud. Some wondered if the woman is a celebrity. Al Jouloud shared a video in July, emphasizing that she was not allowed in a mall as she was wearing “indecent clothes.” The video shows the Saudi woman wearing a white top and a black pair of trousers. Al Jouloud was not the first one to defy the dress code, other Saudi women have also started wearing “western clothes” encouraging the female population of Saudi Arabia to do the same. Mashael al-Jaloud is one of only a handful of women who have abandoned the abaya in recent months. #HumanRights #WomensRights pic.twitter.com/urcmE5jl8Q — Eman al-Hathloul (@EHathloul) September 12, 2019  #اعتبريني_زي_اخوك pic.twitter.com/QDO3CYxOzB — مشاعل بنت عبدالعزيز (@m80h93) July 5, 2019  Manahel Al Otaibi, a Saudi activist said in an online post that she has been living in Riyadh for four months without wearing an abaya. She added that she wants to live “the way I want, freely and without restrictions. No one should force me to wear something I don’t want.” In an interview with CBS TV, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia hinted that his country had ruled relaxed provision on dress code for women. “The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of Sharia [Islamic law]: that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men.” He added, “This, however, does not particularly specify a black abaya or black headcover. The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses to wear.” In past years, Saudi Arabia announced a series of reforms to increase their freedom. In August, Saudi Arabia published decrees allowing women over the age of 21 to apply for a passport without authorization and travel without the guardianship of a man. Previously, women were required to seek permission from their guardian, usually their father or husband, to marry, apply for a passport or to leave the country.

Rabat – International analytics company New Frontier Data released new data on drug trafficking on September 10. The analytics company claims that Morocco is Europe’s biggest cannabis supplier. A graphic shows that 62% of cannabis seized in Africa was from Morocco in 2016. Security services, according to the visual, seized a total of 937,414 kilograms of hashish between 2012 and 2016. New Frontier Data also say that Morocco is the world’s largest – albeit illicit – “supplier of cannabis to Europe.” The data quoted a recent report, providing statistics on how Europe imports cannabis from Morocco.  A report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2019 says that can Cannabis resin is “mostly imported from Morocco, with Libya emerging as a major hub for resin trafficking.” The report pointed out that Morocco’s proximity to Europe makes it a center for drug trafficking. “Because of its proximity to Morocco, Spain is particularly important when it comes to quantities of cannabis resin seized, accounting for almost three-quarters (72 %) of the total quantity seized in the European Union in 2017,” the report said. Cited by the New Data Frontier, a report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), confirmed that Morocco remains the world’s largest producer of cannabis. The report shows that Morocco produces over three times more than the next highest contender, the European country Moldova. Cannabis production in the country continues to grow, with the production of cannabis herbs increasing from 35,653 tons in 2016 to 35,703 tons in 2017, the report added. Crackdown New Frontier Data said that Morocco’s broad production of cannabis is reflected in seizures and the crackdown against drug trafficking. “Morocco’s vast production is reflected in the size of related cannabis seizures, characteristically measured by the ton. In one July 2019 haul, Moroccan police seized a record 27.3 tons,” the news report said. In addition to July’s seizure, Morocco’s security services aborted tens of drug trafficking operations throughout the year. Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation seized seven tons of Cannabis in Casablanca in April. In March,  police seized 1.675 tons of Cannabis resin in Fez.  Police also seized 13 tons and 750 kilograms of hashish at Tangier Med Port. Morocco continues to exert heavy pressure on the illicit drug trade. In 2018, the North African country announced the implementation of “a multi-dimensional national strategy to fight illegal drugs and is determined to place civil society in the forefront of this national strategy.” Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said last year that Morocco prosecuted 107,000 people in 2017 in drug cases, an increase from 36,000 people per year during the previous decade. A report from the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)  earlier this year shows that hashish is the most common drug that police seized in Africa. The 2018 report shows that Morocco is where the largest quantities of cannabis were seized in 2017: 117 tons of cannabis resin and 283 tons of cannabis.

Rabat – A family living in Adeje, a town in the south of the Canary Islands, discovered a scorpion in the backpack of their youngest daughter. The parents were packing up their daughter’s bag before her first day of school when they had this dangerous encounter. According to Spanish newspaper El Dia, the family had used the backpack where the scorpion was hiding during their trip to Morocco. The parents immediately notified emergency services. The scorpion was taken to the Neotropic Foundation of the Canary Islands, where they identified its species. The foundation identified the scorpion as an Androctonus mauretanicus, a species known for being venomous. The species is responsible for about 60% of deaths caused by scorpion stings in Morocco, according to the Spanish news outlet. Summer is a period when many arachnids and reptiles can invade Moroccan homes. Attracted by the cold and darkness of some corners and spots in Moroccan houses, scorpions, snakes, and other small creatures decide to hide indoors from the heat. Scorpions sting as a self-defense mechanism, but the sting can be fatal for humans, especially children. According to the Moroccan Center of Antidotes and Pharmacovigilance (CAPM), about 170 Moroccans die every year from poisoning in all its types. About 50 of these cases are caused by scorpion stings, and 8 are caused by snake bites. Around 70% of the incidents happen inside  homes. In 1999, Morocco launched a strategy to combat scorpion and snake related incidents. The strategy was updated in 2013 and it aims to diminish the number of casualties.. The campaign aims to raise awareness about the gravity of this problem, through media campaigns. The strategy also involves supplying all health facilities in regions where this problem is frequent with antidotes. “We are very proud of the results that we have achieved so far. The death rate in hospitals diminished from 2,37% of the stings and bites incidents, in 1999, to 0,18% in 2018. The death rate decreased by more than 13 times,” said Anass Doukkali, the Moroccan Minister of Health, on July 1, 2019.

Rabat – Moroccan men with yellow envelopes flocked in their hundreds to a “youth center” in Oulad Tayma, a city in the Taroudant province on Wednesday, September 11. The march was not a protest but a bid for job contracts in France. Morocco’s National Agency for Employment and Skills (ANAPEC) opened the opportunity to youth aged 25 and 45. If successful, the candidates will get a work contract in France for citrus fruit picking. Videos and photos showing crowds of men of different ages in front of the youth center have gone viral. Men from different places in the Souss-Massa region flocked to the region, hoping for a chance. The requirements stipulate that the candidates should have experience in farming and been in good health to secure a contract. Under the contract, successful candidates will receive a monthly salary of € 1,525 for 39 hours per week. Candidates will have to pay for their own transport to France. “The situation is weak in Morocco, I came to see if I will get a chance to travel to work,” one of the candidates told the press. “Look at all these youth, all came here looking for an opportunity. France, France, open the borders for us,” he shouted. Another video showed candidates jumping over the wall to enter the youth center in order to submit their application. Mohamed Dabach, a journalist from the region wrote: “Crowds of young from Oulad  Tayma wishing to emigrate France exposed the reality of marginalization and misery.”  Unemployment is on the rise in Morocco, especially in rural areas. Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) said in February that 1,168 people were unemployed in 2018. Social disparities in Morocco have raised concerns, urging King Mohammed VI to call for a new development model to reduce inequality. In a speech for Revolution Day in August, the monarch called on the youth to resort to self-employment, agriculture, and vocational training. The King insisted that a focus on a vocational training approach could serve as a concrete solution to reduce unemployment among Morocco’s youth, not only in rural areas but also in urban areas.

Rabat – A Moroccan teacher has caused controversy after calling for a law to support single-gender education. On September 6, Redouane Chakdani posted a call on his Facebook page for a law to separate girls and boys at schools. Chakdani believes that separating the genders will mean“better performance and more complete discipline.”  The teacher’s statement divided public opinion. Some internet users supported his suggestion but others criticized Chakdani. One of his followers wrote: “the best thing they can do is to apply single-gender education.” However, another Facebook user said that “students and parents themselves will stand against this initiative.” “I agree, but in Morocco, you will find a strong opposition, especially from some self-styled NGOs defending rights,” posted a third Facebook user.  The teacher also took to his Facebook several times to defend his point of view. In one post, Chadkani said that he had received “dozens of messages with Chadkani accused those who disagree with his suggestion of not following the teachings of Islam, calling them non-believers.   Goud.ma, a local news outlet described the teacher as an ISIS member suggesting that Chadkani’s perspective stems from an extreme interpretation of Islam. The news outlet called on the Ministry of Education to intervene. “Where is the Ministry of Education as it has such ISIS members. Some teachers left everything, asking for a single-gender education at Moroccan public schools,” the news outlet posted on Facebook.  One of the Facebook commentaries strongly criticized the teacher’s suggestion. “So mixed-gender education is the reason why school system is not good? It is necessary to search to find the best solutions to improve the quality of education in Moroccan school. It is serious.” Another Facebook user said, “Instead of looking for solutions to save our education system,(…) this mister is speaking of mixed-gender education! It’s really unfortunate.”

Rabat – The Moroccan House of Representatives is currently discussing Bill n°10.16, amending the Criminal Code. The bill includes new punitive measures in relation to the possession of weapons. Article 303 of the amended code punishes the unjustified possession of weapons with one month to one-year imprisonment and a fine of MAD 1,200 to 5,000. “Whoever is arrested, in circumstances constituting a threat to public order, to the safety of persons or property, while carrying any piercing, blunt, cutting or suffocating object, if the possession is not justified by the professional activity of the carrier or by a legitimate reason.” The penalties will be doubled if the offender is arrested under the influence of alcohol or psychotropic drugs. The penalties will also be doubled if the weapon in question “represents a certain degree of gravity,” says article 303. Currently the imprisonment and the fine are not necessarily cumulative, the judge can choose to opt for only one of the two sanctions. If the reform’s current version is adopted, it will provide for penalties ranging from 1 to 2 years in prison and a fine of MAD 5,000 to 20,000. Above all, it will no longer allow the judicial authorities to pronounce alternatively the fine or the custodial sentence. Recent crimes involving weapons in Morocco In July 2019, a Caid was the victim of an assault in Casablanca. The offender, who was in a hysterical state, stabbed the Caid with a knife in the back, the face, and the belly.  The same month, Police patrol officers intervened to arrest a suspect who had stabbed three victims using a knife. The offender also used the weapon to resist arrest, obliging the officers to use their firearms. In September, Moroccan police arrested a suspect involved in an attempted robbery in Casablanca. The robbers violently stabbed the victim causing her serious facial injuries.

Rabat – The Committee of Films in Lebanon has prohibited the screening of “3 Stolen Cameras,” a documentary which challenges Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. Pro-Polisario news outlet Equipe Media said, on September 8,  that the committee “recommended banning the release of the documentary (…) without revealing the real reasons behind the prohibition.” The pro-Polisario news source was hoping the documentary would be screened at the Lebanese Independent Film Festival. The separatist documentary stands against Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. In 2018, Morocco summoned the Iraqi ambassador to Rabat to condemn an Iraqi festival for screening the documentary. The Sulimani Film Festival in Iraq screened the movie in October 2018. Morocco also protested the screening of the documentary at Lebanon’s International Cinema Festival in 2017. The documentary is a Sweden-Polisario project. The 17-minute film shows alleged Moroccan “violations of human rights” in Western Sahara.

Rabat – In an interesting twist of female solidarity in the in the Hajar Raissouni case, Amina Maelainine, a controversial MP of the ruling, Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD), has joined the chorus of womens’ rights advocates. While not militantly calling for charges to be dropped against Raissouni, the journalist facing prosecution for “illegal abortion,” the PJD MP says norms and rules imposing societal projections on women are obsolete and should be treated accordingly. These are laws, she argued, that are holding back many “traditional” societies from realizing “democracy, dignity, and development.” Maelainine’s comments came in the form of an article-length Facebook post. In it, the PJD MP  called for a nationwide conversation on abortion, arguing that abortion rights need to be discussed in “a serious public debate.” “The Hajar affair offers an opportunity to broaden the debate on a number of provisions in the Moroccan penal code which can be used to violate private life and limit spaces for self-expression,” the MP wrote. The Hajar affair has prompted widespread discussions on abortion and the Islamic religious marriage—the journalist says she married her Sudanese partner in a religious ceremony. Maelainine’s comment comes amid this widespread, hot debate about the implications of societies’ view on women in the public eye. Recalling the event and its accompanying controversies in her post, the PJD MP said that one way to look at the whole case is that it offers an opportunity for Morocco to have a nationwide, broad debate about not only abortion, but a range of other issues associated with womens’ bodies, women’s right to use their own bodies as they see fit, and other individual freedoms. Maelainine knows that she is tapping into one of the most divisive issues in Morocco. But that, judging from her tone in the Facebook post, is the heart of her point: forcing debates about serious social issues some would rather not talk about. The problem with Moroccan society, she argued, is that it is divided in two “blocs” that are not only divided on vital societal issues, but appear to have no interest in considering what the other party thinks. Overall, Maelainine said there are three types of Moroccans (politicians) when it comes to discussing social issues. There are those who would like to challenge, even abrogate traditional norms and laws that are incompatible with individual freedoms and choices. She called those the “modernist bloc.” Then there are those who do not even want to have a debate, because the norms in question are “sacred” to them. Those politicians form “the conservative bloc.” And finally, the third group, somewhat of a hostage of the two extremes, is made up of “those who hesitate.” Surprisingly, Maelainine, once one of the most vigorous, commanding voices of an Islamist, prudish public life, now places herself in the “modernist bloc.” Professing her desire to set the stage for a Moroccan society where the rule of law is the norm, Maelainine is now arguing that laws that limit individual liberties and deny people’s sovereign choices on their bodies and lifestyles should be “abrogated.” As the now self-styled moderate Islamist MP sees it, she is proposing “dignity, democracy, and development.” Heartfelt advocacy or pure opportunism? But where Maelainine offers a vision of full-hearted commitment to womens’ rights, critics may see an opportunist seeking to capitalize on a nationwide dilemma to set the record straight for herself. For all the feminist and women’s rights militancy Maelainine’s current tone suggests, there are questions as to whether the erstwhile ardent defender of an Islamic, puritan public space would have cared for Hajar Raissouni had she herself not recently been at the center of a controversy. In December of last year, Maelainine made headlines after images were shared of her wearing no hijab while holidaying in Paris. The images of a vocal female Islamist politician with no hijab, wearing jeans and appearing to enjoy herself promptly produced powerful tremors in Morocco’s political circles. Quickly capitalizing on the Maelainine case, PJD critics resorted to their traditional criticism of “hypocrisy” and “opportunism,” which they maintained are the modus operandi of the ruling Islamist party. Maelainine first denied the authenticity of the pictures, only to finally admit to having indeed taken off her veil, worn jeans, and enjoyed herself in the French capital. The MP has since become a vocal voice of sovereign and unfettered individual rights. In a March interview, she notably said that wearing the veil is not in fact a religious prescription. Instead, she argued, the PJD leadership is only obsessed with puritanical, prudish public appearances because of political, electorate-linked calculations. “I know some leading PJD members who are very open on the question of the Hijab. Their stances are indeed very liberal. But they can’t openly express their ideas because of party and social constraints,” she said in the interview. In her latest case for Hajar Raissouni and in defense of women’s rights, she echoed that point about PJD leadership’s supposed duplicity on social issues with controversial potential, suggesting that many members of that party hide behind culture and religion-cloaked rationalizations to publicly support ideas that they do not adhere to in their own private lives. For Maelainine, it is high time that the PJD and other bastions of conservative thought in Morocco let go of their “weak arguments” to have “real debates” on the country’s most salient social issues. And to her critics, the controversial MP may well respond that she had no idea of the devastating impact of the public gaze on women’s bodies until she found herself at the receiving end of it. But whether that makes her Morocco’s new women’s right hero is altogether a different matter, and one that raises serious, uncomfortable questions.

Rabat – The Morocco in Fashion &amp; Morocco Sourcing trade show is set to kick off from October 17 to 18 in Marrakech, at the Moulay El Hassan circuit exhibition park. Many renowned international high-visibility brands will be participating in the event, according to a statement from organizers. The event not only aims to showcase the role Moroccan textiles and fashion play at an international level, but also be an opportunity for experts throughout the industry to network. The event will cover 5 different elements of the industry: fast fashion, denim, knitwear, tailoring, and Moroccan brand distribution signs. Conferences and roundtables will be held to discuss topics such as market developments, as well as social and environmental responsibility, which is a major topic in the industry right now. The event is organized by the Moroccan Association of Textile and Clothing Industries (AMITH) with the support of the State Secretariat for Foreign Trade and the Moroccan Agency for Investment Development (AMDIE). Although Morocco will be at the forefront, 5 other countries will be participating. France will be the guest of honor, and Turkey, Portugal, China, and Pakistan will also attend. The organizers point out that the convention is happening as the national textile industry reaches a record level of success. “The sector has been growing continuously in exports for several years, surpassing the 38 billion dirhams mark in 2018, said the organizers. “This dynamic is also reflected in terms of investment and employment.” The organizers are right about the recent boom in the industry. In May of this year, the Moroccan group Vita Couture – Diprints opened two new factories in Tangier, creating over 2200 jobs. The factories have a large production capacity, enabling them to cater to large orders from international fashion companies, making them stiff competition for their Spanish and Turkish counterparts. This supposed boom in the industry is also backed by numbers. Also in May, Morocco’s Ministry of Trade and Industry announced that the textile industry created a total of 79,300 jobs between 2014 and 2018.

Rabat – A 43-year-old Indian man threw his friend’s 3-year-old daughter out of the window of his seventh floor flat. The toddler fell on a car and died from her injuries. The man told police that he committed the murder to “break a Moroccan curse”. According to Indian press, the suspect, Anil Chughani, worked in a clothes shop in Morocco for ten years. He and his Indian wife, who have been married for more than ten years, were never able to have a child. A Moroccan colleague told Chughani that it could be because a Moroccan woman used black magic on him, and the only way to “break the curse” would be “to sacrifice twins and go to jail for it.” The Indian man, who was described as “mentally unstable” after investigations, believed the suggested solution. According to India Today, he has been planning to “make the human sacrifice” since last May, 2019. He also kept a log of his plans and ideas on a personal diary. On the day of the crime, Chughani asked his childhood friend, Premlal Hathiramani, if he could babysit Hathiramani’s 3-year-old twins for the day. Hathiramani’s 6-year-old son also wanted to go with Chughani, so a nanny joined the man to help with the three children, reports The Hindu. While the nanny was busy looking after the 6-year-old boy and one of his twin sisters, Chughani took the toddler to the bedroom and threw her out of the window. The fall from the seventh floor flat caused her death. Alarmed by the noise of the child falling on the bonnet of a car, the nanny protected the second twin. The suspect, knowing that he could not complete his plan of “sacrificing two twins,” called the police and locked himself in the bedroom until their arrival. According to local press, Chughani will face trial for murder. He was also charged under the Indian penal code act for practices of human sacrifice and black magic. Witchcraft and black magic are still relatively widespread phenomena, especially among older generations and illiterate people. A report published on August 9, 2012, by Pew Research Center states that 78% of Moroccans believe in black magic. About 7% of Moroccans admitted that they used “spells” to prevent bad luck and bring good fortune. The studied sample consisted of 1.474 Moroccans. Article 609 of Morocco’s penal code says: “anyone who practices ‘fortune-telling’ or dreams interpretation shall be punished with a fine ranging from MAD 10 to 120.”

Rabat – Security services have found the body of a woman, the victim of an accident caused by floods in the Errachidia province. On Sunday, September 8 shockwaves spread throughout Morocco when a bus overturned on a bridge in Errachidia province. Security services are still looking for possible missing people, while 18 people have been reported dead. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) initially reported on Monday, September 10, that six people lost their lives in the accident. Search operations subsequently found 12 more bodies. Security services managed to rescue 30  other people victims of the incident. Local authorities reported that they are investigating the driver bus, who fled the scene immediately after the incident. As floods throughout the southern provinces of Morocco continue to claim victims, authorities warned citizens to check weather forecasts to avoid similar incidents. Equipment and transport Minister Abdelkader Amara told the press that “the National Meteorological Directorate published weather reports on a regular basis that must be taken into account and that citizens must be aware of the weather warnings issued by provincial and local officials.” He added that weather issues “should not be treated carelessly.” In addition to the flood in Errachidia, floods in Taroudant killed eight people. A further two people were reported dead due to floods in Khenifra, while the Imlil region,  a town 66 kilometers far from Marrakech, experienced a flood that caused massive material damage

Rabat – The Spanish rescue mission, Salvamento Marítimo, rescued 79 immigrants, including 10 women and two minors on September 9.  The immigrants were on a boat located in the waters of the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast, reports the EFE news agency.  According to a spokesman for Maritime Rescue, an NGO alerted rescuers to the presence of the boat after a warning from the Moroccan authorities stating that they had rescued a ‘patera’ carrying 61 people. The NGO alerted the Almería coordination center that three boats had left the coast of Morocco. The rescuers deployed a Frontex plane to locate the first boat. However, the Spanish maritime services are still searching for the two other boats. The NGO told the Spanish coastguard that neither of the two missing boats corresponds to the one rescued by Moroccan authorities.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump has fired his senior national security adviser John Bolton. The adviser’s dismissal comes a year and a half after his appointment. Trump announced his decision on Tuesday, September 9. He wrote on Twitter that he informed Bolton that his services are “no longer needed” at the White House. “I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning,”  Trump wrote.
 I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019  Trump added that he will appoint a new National Security Advisor next week. The New York Times said that Trump’s move is motivated by Bolton’s confrontational view on Iran and North Korea. Meanwhile, Trump’s administration is trying to normalize diplomatic ties with the two countries. Bolton, on the other hand, believes that both Iran and North Korea are not “trustworthy.” “The rift between the president and his national security adviser owed as much to personality as to policy. The president never warmed to him, a dynamic that is often fatal in this White House. Mr. Bolton also clashed with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,” the New York Times wrote. Trump appointed Bolton in April 2018. In addition to his stance on Iran and North Korea,  Bolton is also seen as pro-Polisario voice in the continued conflict between the separatist group and Morocco. Bolton supports self-determination and referendum for the region, which is against Morocco’s sovereignty over the region. “When I got the UN in 2005-2006 , again we tried to fix … all what we wanna do is hold a referendum  for 70,000 voters . 27 years later the status of the territory is still unresolved,” Bolton said last year at a Washington, D.C., event. Expressing frustration that the conflict has not yet ended, Bolton also criticized UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO.“Ladies and gentlemen, 27 years of deployment of this peacekeeping force, 27 years and it’s still there? How can you justify that? I have got to know over the years the Saharawi people, I have enormous respect for them, I have enormous respect for the government and people of Morocco and Algeria, is there not a way to resolve it?” Since his appointment, Bolton has sought to leave his personal imprimatur on the Western Sahara conflict by putting unprecedented pressure on Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario to engage in negotiations which would force a simple resolution to the complex, and long-lasting conflict. The decision of the Security Council in April, October 2018 and April 2019 to renew MINURSO’s mandate for six months only, as opposed to the historically approved one year term, was Bolton’s way of conveying his displeasure with the UN-led political process. He hoped to push the parties into showing genuine willingness to move the political process forward.  Algeria has sought to benefit from Bolton’s presence at the highest level of the US administration and thwart all the progress Morocco has achieved in recent years. To garner support for its position on the conflict Algeria hired right-wing lobbyist, and Bolton’s longtime friend, David Keene. But the $30,000 a month contract that Algeria signed with Keene has failed so far to yield the expected outcome. With Bolton’s sudden departure, it remains to be seen whether Algeria will keep Keene on its payroll.

Rabat – A video has gone viral on Moroccan social media showing teenagers in the El Karia neighborhood of Sale playing with banned firecrackers on September 9, the evening before the Ashura festival.  The video could easily be mistaken for footage from a warzone instead of the streets of Sale, with the streets lit up with the flare of the firecrackers and loud noise flooding through the streets. Similar scenes are common across Morocco the evening before Ashura, and injuries often occur. Last year, one neighborhood boy died in Derb Ghallef, a suburb of Casablanca, after being injured by a firecracker. Despite the death and the ban of firecrackers in Morocco, the dangerous trend has continued for another year. Ashura marks the tenth day of Muharram, the first month in the Islamic calendar, a day of great significance for Muslims worldwide. Sunni Muslims, the majority in Morocco, celebrate the day as a way to commemorate the anniversary of God creating a path in the Red Sea to liberate Moses and his followers from Pharaoh 622 AD.

Rabat – A list of 23 states have expressed support for Morocco’s territorial integrity and the Autonomy Plan submitted by the North African country to the UN in 2007 as a possible political solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. Permanent Ambassador and representative of Morocco to the UN in Geneva Omar Zinber said on Tuesday, September 10,  that a group of 23 countries believe that the autonomy initiative “has been recognized by the Security Council as a serious and credible basis for definitely resolving the regional conflict.” The countries expressed their support for Morocco’s cause at the 42nd session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. The countries believe that solving the conflict “will contribute to the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the African and Arab peoples in terms of integration and development, an objective to which Morocco is strongly committed.” Zniber, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), said that the countries signed a declaration, in which they emphasize that Morocco has engaged in a constructive, and profound interaction with the UN human rights system, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The group of countries also indicated that 12 special missions visited the Moroccan provinces of Laayoune and Dakha in Western Sahara.  The missions had free and unrestricted access to all places in the region. “It is also in this context that Morocco has hosted a technical mission of the OHCHR, at the invitation of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco, aimed at strengthening the capacity of action of international institutions,” said the Group. Saudi Arabia and the UAE were among the countries to express their support for Morocco’s autonomy initiatives, despite rumors of tension between Morocco and the two Gulf countries. The reports of friction between Morocco and its Gulf allies   escalated after Saudi Television outlet Al-Arabiya aired a documentary that challenged Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara.  Morocco’s government denied any conflict with its allies, emphasizing that it has strong and historical ties with both countries. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said in March that from “the point of view of Morocco, relations with Gulf countries,” especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE, “have always been deep historical relations.” In addition to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Jordan also reiterated their support for the Autonomy Plan. The list of Morocco’s supporters also includes: Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Djibouti, Senegal, Central African Republic, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, Sao Tome and Principe, Paraguay, Guatemala, Saint Lucia, and El Salvador.

Rabat – The Moroccan Government is planning to approve draft Decree No. 2.19.244 in a meeting next Thursday, September 12. The “Solidarity Tax against Disastrous Events” will be part of the Solidarity Fund against Disaster Events. The Council of Government approved the establishment of the fund in accordance with the law. The Government was supposed to approve the draft on April 18, but the approval was postponed. The decree outlines the introduction of a new tax of 1% on premiums and contributions paid under insurance contracts, with the exception of life insurance contracts. It also specifies the list of natural disasters covered by the scheme for the consequences of disastrous events (Law n°110.14) adopted in 2016. The scheme is designed to cover disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis. This scheme includes two insurance systems. The first offers insurance for the victims with an insurance contract; the second is allocated for the victims with no insurance contract. According to Article 64-7 of Law n°110.14, the maximum compensation per event can not be inferior to MAD 2 billion in the case of a disastrous event due to natural causes, and 300 MAD million when it is due to man-made violent actions. Recent floods in Morocco The Government’s decision to focus on the draft decree comes in light of the recent devastating floods hitting several regions across Morocco. The floods and heavy rains have damaged cities and caused many casualties. Heavy rainstorms and floods hit the province of Taroudant on August 28, killing 8 people in Tizert village when the river overflowed onto a football pitch. In the city of Tata (180 km southeast of Taroudant), heavy rains flooded the homes of 200 locals. On September 8, a bus connecting Casablanca and Rissani, a town in Errachidia Province, fell off the Oued Damchan bridge. The accident was caused by similar floods.

Rabat – Human Rights Watch has slammed Algeria for its perceived crackdown on dissent, as well as efforts from the Algerian government to preempt the success of the ongoing wave of anti-establishment protests in the country. In a recently published report, “Algeria: Tightening the Screws on Protests,” the advocacy group painted an extreme portrait of Algeria’s subtle yet perceptible crackdown on anti-government expression. This ranges from the waving of anti-establishment symbols (Amazigh flags, for example) to reports in independent media critical of the post-Bouteflika government, or even calls anti-military or government-bashing comments by some prominent dissidents. Among HRW’s long litany of complaints against the current Algerian regime is the arbitrary arrest some of the most prominent figures of the “Friday protests,” the blocking or harsh censoring of independent, critical news outlet like TSA, as well as the criminalization of waving Amazigh flags. “Starting June 21, security forces began large-scale arrests throughout the country, targeting marchers with Amazigh flags, a symbol of the large ethnic community of the same name, also known as Berbers. About 40 protesters remain in custody, most in Algiers. All are under investigation for “harming the integrity of the national territory,” which carries sentences of up to 10 years in prison, under penal code Article 79,” HRW detailed. According to the report, even as “Friday protests” continue since February, when former President Bouteflika was forced to step down, the government has been deploying its wrath on determined protesters demanding bold political changes. In the current Algerian context, HRW suggested, holding views critical of the regime or waving flags deemed insulting come with heavy, disproportionate, and arbitrary measures like imprisonment. Hamid Guemmouch, the Director of TSA, explained to HRW how his outlet has recently been targeted. He said the media’s internet website was blocked on numerous occasions and they were left without any explanation from the authorities. “This is an arbitrary block ordered by the authorities. We tried to contact the government to get explanations, but they refused to answer our questions. This blockage is a serious threat to our survival as an independent website,” he said. In addition to heightened censorship, Guemmouch went on to explain, the government withholds advertisement deals from critical outlets, distributing them to state-owned and other pro-government media organizations. This, he argued, is aimed at forcing critical news into silence or untimely bankruptcy. “The old practices of the authorities have not stopped,” he lamented. Other sources concurred. Like the TSA director, they all told tales of how the post-Bouteflika authorities are deploying state power to either sidestep popular demands or force the faces of dissent into silence and eventual submission to the agenda of the authorities. The perception is that the current regime wants to preserve its power as long as possible, in defiance of sustained, popular demands for a fair, well-organized, and quick democratic transition. The news comes as many analysts perceive a gradual decline in effectiveness and impact in the course of six-month Algerian protests. Begun in February to force President Bouteflika to give up on his reelection bid, the “Friday protests” gained worldwide traction after a besieged Bouteflika stepped down. Bouteflika’s resignation did raise doubts in some quarters, prompting questions as to what would be next in the Algerian masses’ fight to get rid of the whole Bouteflika establishment, including the current regime’s most powerful men. However, the broad, popular expectation was that the same urgency and determination that forced Bouteflika out would eventually overwhelm the remaining Bouteflika cohort, forcing them to leave room for a new crop of young, in-touch political leaders. There was hope that Algeria’s would not be the bold yet short-lived “business-as-usual” type of social movements until now witnessed in much of the MENA region. But this certainty is gradually turning into a doubt about whether Algerians will get the radical changes they are asking for. While the determination is the same among protesters, William Lawrence, a North Africa specialist at George Washington University recently told France 24, “the regime has played its cards right.”

Rabat – On World Suicide Prevention Day, September 10, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a 2016 world suicide report.  According to the report’s interactive world map, Morocco shows 3.6 female suicide deaths per 100,000 people. The kingdom has the highest female suicide rate in North Africa. In 2016, Morocco recorded 1,014 suicides, of which 613 are women.  The rates in other North African countries remained below 3.0.

Rabat – Algerian Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui is expected to announce his resignation in the coming days. Senior sources told Reuters on Tuesday, September 10, that the move seeks to “facilitate the holding of elections this year.” Earlier this month, Algerian army chief Gaid Salah announced that his country will announce a date for the delayed presidential election on September 5. The announcement comes amid nationwide protests, calling on the entire government and the army chief to leave. Salah said that “it was appropriate to summon the electorate on September 15th.” He added that the election can be held “within the deadlines provided by the law.” Algerian law stipulates that the election should take place  90 days after the announcement. Bedoui is one of the elites that Algerian protesters want to remove from power. Protesters urged several senior officials and former head of state Abdelaziz Bouteflika to leave in April. Algerians are also calling on the army to not interfere in politics. 
Protests in Algeria started in February. Throughout the year,  Algerians have been denouncing the wide corruption in the country, calling for accountability and for an end to the impunity enjoyed by elites. Algeria’s security services arrested several officials including Algeria’s two former prime ministers, Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal.

The theme of the stands was the fight against plastic pollution in seas and oceans. We presented an exhibition entitled ‘Sea: The final destination of plastic waste’.” The “Clean Beaches” campaign was launched in 1999 by Princess Lalla Hasnaa, the President of FM6E. Over the 20 years of its existence, the campaign contributed to improving the state and quality of more than 100 beaches around the country.

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien de Phosphates (OCP) is partnering with the National Basketball Association (NBA), to “expand Jr. NBA programs” in Morocco and Rwanda. Jr. NBA programs are the NBA’s “global youth participation” platform for both boys and girls. The program’s main purpose is to familiarize young people of both genders with the fundamentals of basketball. Also included in the experience is the teaching of life skills like leadership, team spirit, communication skills, and health awareness. This year, the NBA hopes to reach as many as 51 million young people across 75 countries, according to the press release. The announcement was made yesterday, September 9, at the opening ceremony of the new basketball court in Ennahda in Khourigba, in central Morocco. The event was celebrated “ in the presence of OCP chairman and CEO, Mostafa Terrab; NBA Africa Managing Director and Basketball Africa President, Amadou Gallo Fall. 10-time NBA All-Star, Ray Allen, also attended, according to a press release from the organizers. In the press statement, the OCP group reassured that the joint OCP-NBA platform aims at promoting youth and development-related causes by investing in projects of youth empowerment and sustainable development. On a practical level, the statement explained, the partnership “will teach life skills” and help build basketball courts in Khourigba and Benguerir in Morocco, and Kigali in Rwanda. In both African countries, the overall aim is to use “the transformative power of basketball to empower” young people by making them value-driven ambassadors of their respective communities, according to the press release. An awareness raising platform at its core, the partnership also prides itself on being a reflection venue for cementing a team building spirit and community values among the Moroccan and Rwandan youth. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the newly built basketball court in Khourigba, OCP CEO Mostafa Terrab extolled the leadership, youth empowerment, and community-building values associated with the imitative. The joint NBA-OCP program, he argued, will be a venue for making young people not only better ambassadors of their communities, but also driven individuals seeking self-improvement and excellence through the mindset of resilience and hard work that comes with sustained practice of a sport like basketball. “The partnership with NBA is part of the Act4Communicty Initiative, carried out by OCP volunteers, with one of its major objectives being development through sport,” the OCP chairman said. “The young people here are full of talent and energy, and the goal of this project is to provide them with a framework where they can develop their potential through a spirit of sport excellence and coaching focused on leadership and personal development.” Fall, the Basketball Africa president, agreed with Terrab. While expressing his joy and “thrill” at being an essential party in the youth initiative, he stressed the justice and social inclusiveness components of the program. As well as teaching youth excellence and resilience, the platform, he highlighted, also hopes to be a venue where young people learn to break conventional wisdom or stand up to adversity in the way to realizing their potential or achieving their dreams. He said, “As we continue to push the boundaries of accessibility to our game, the authentic partnership will contribute tremendously to inspire more boys and girls to play the game of basketball and grow with its core values while empowering coaches and programs as role models for the youth in their communities.” Meanwhile, in Morocco and Rwanda, the program is meant to further illustrate both OCP’s and the NBA’s commitment “to the development of the African continent.” The organizers hope the imitative will spur broader and more far-reaching educational, cultural, and other socio-economic initiatives for both young people and employees of OCP and NBA to be involved in projects which benefit their communities. In both African countries, the statement noted, the program will “feature 30 boys’ and 30 girls’ school teams competing for their respective league’s leagues’ championship. Each school team will represent one of the 30 NBA teams and will receive corresponding team-branded jerseys for their games.” The program launches today, September 10 in Morocco at the Salle Omnisport in Bengeurir, while Rwanda’s is set to start on September 21 at the Integrated Polytechnic Center in Kigali.

Rabat – Former international football player Ruud Gullit said that the Netherlands Football Association (KNVB) should reconsider its plans to invest in Moroccan-Dutch football players. Traditionally, dual nationality makes it hard for a football player, who face the dilemma of  choosing between two national teams. This is the case of international football player Mohammed Ihattern, who has not yet decided whether he will represent Morocco or the Netherlands.  Both the  Moroccan and Dutch national teams are striving to convince the young football prodigy  join them.  Gullit believes that there is no point in investing in Moroccan-Dutch football players in case Ihattaren chooses Morocco.  “It makes no sense if that happens again,” he said in a sports television show broadcast on Ziggo Sport Voetbal. Gullit is annoyed by the number of Moroccan-Dutch football players, who decided to represent Morocco’s national team instead of the Netherlands’. The Dutch football federation has failed to convince several Moroccan-Dutch football players to represent the Orange team. The list includes , Oussama Idrissi, Hakim Ziyech, Nordin Amrabat, and Sofyan Amrabat. The decision of Moroccan-Dutch football players to represent Morocco has angered many people in the Netherlands. Last week, Dutch coach Ronald Koeman accused Moroccan Dutch footballers, including Ziyech,Noussair Mazraoui, and Idrissi of receiving bribes from Morocco. Referring to Inhattaren,  Koeman added that “if the player was given a large sum by Moroccan officials, their Dutch counterparts could not do much; it makes it difficult to convince them to play for our teams.” Ziyech refuted the claims, saying that “people invent the craziest things.” “I have not received any money to play with the Moroccan national team and the same applies to Nossair Mazraoui and Oussama Idrissi,” he said.

Rabat – During a visit to Switzerland, a Moroccan delegation led by the Minister of Equipment, Abdelkader Amara, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Federal Councilor Simonetta Sommaruga, Minister for the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications.  The two parties signed the memorandum following their bilateral talks during a train journey to Erstfeld where they visited the Ripshausen Heavy Traffic Control Center.  The memorandum aims to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in the field of road and rail transport. Road safety is one of the issues at the core of this cooperation. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Amara said that the memorandum of understanding “covers about twenty areas of cooperation, from planning to the operational phase.”  According to Amara, the transports issue concerns, at least, two levels. The first is related to the theme of “sustainability,” noting that “this is a strategic theme in Morocco as the country has adopted a pioneering strategy of renewable energy.” The second level relates to the efforts needed for the development of railway transportation. The goal is to give this type of transportation enough “importance given that it is ecological and allows mass transport and optimized territorial planning.”  Swiss Federal Councilor Simonetta Sommaruga welcomed the signing of the memorandum noting that the discussions were an opportunity to tackle different issues related to transportation and infrastructure. Sommaruga stressed “the importance of transporting more goods on railways from an ecological and efficiency point of view although the needed infrastructures can take a lot of time to be accomplished”. She also emphasized that “financing such infrastructure is also very important.” The Federal Councilor highlighted the determination of the two countries “to collaborate on issues related to the transport sector, whether funding, infrastructure issues, road safety, or tunnels, in which Switzerland has gained a great deal of experience.”

Rabat – On Saturday, September 7, two female imams led a Muslim prayer, gathering both men and women. The prayer was the first Muslim prayer led by a woman and involving both genders in France. “This moment is important for Islam in France because this prayer guarantees gender equality in Islam,” said Eva Janadin, one of the two female imams in her opening speech. The room where the prayer was held was full of participants from both genders. The sermons were given in French with translations of Arabic expressions. While some of the women in attendance were wearing a headcovering, others, including the two imams chose not to cover their heads. The female imams wore non-traditional clothing, with one wearing jeans. The two imams, Eva Janadin and Anne-Sophie Monsinay, both converted to Islam years ago. They want to express their vision of a “progressive” and “enlightened” Islam in concrete acts. “Today, with this first prayer, our vision materializes,” said Anne-Sophie Monsinay. The two women are hoping to provide a “dialogue space free of any community or family pressure,” because they understand that “a lot of Muslims have a vital need for emancipation and liberation.” “It is possible to develop an alternative model to counter Islamism and conservatism,” said Eva Janadin.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Education has released a statement denying media reports that the National Program of Generalization and Development of Preschool, which consists of multiple high budget projects, is flawed. The program was announced on June 26 and is being put into practice this school year, which kicked off last week. The ministry argued that it is too soon for any criticism of the program to be valid, as it has only just been implemented. “Claiming that the Inclusive Education Project is struggling is completely unfounded, because how can an evaluation be made of a program that is still in its first phase of implementation,” said the ministry. The statement also reassured the public that the General Inspectorate of the Ministry will carry out a periodic evaluation in order to provide practical support for ongoing programs, identify any problems, and work out how to overcome them. Additionally, a computer system that collects all data relating to projects carried out at the regional level has been created in order to ensure a follow-up rigorous of the projects, the statement adds. The statement added that the ministerial meetings that have been held in recent days come in preparation for the school year, especially the monitoring of projects, and have nothing to do with any difficulties the media has reported.

The statement also urged the media to uphold “rigor and objectivity,” adding that the ministry reserves the right to sue all anyone who circulates “false information to the detriment of the ministry and its officials.”

Rabat – In the recent days, videos and pictures of a sub-saharan immigrant protesting against the low-quality service provided by the tramway company of Rabat-Sale are going viral. The immigrant, wearing a shirt with the Benin flag on it, lay down in front of a tramway wagon, saying that he would not move until his demands were met. In one of the videos, he explains the reasons behind his protest.  “The tramway company did not inform us that there would be a malfunction today. A large tramway company, in a country such as Morocco, needs to notify people that there will be a malfunction of the tramway system one day before. They did not warn us,” explained the protester. The immigrant then explained his personal situation. He works for a call center in Agdal and his budget is very limited. “I came out of my place with just enough money to renew my transportation card. I don’t even have one dirham on me, not even one cent, look! I don’t have money to go to work,” he said while showing his empty wallet. The protester also shed some light on how the situation had evolved: “We arrived to Hassan bridge and they asked us to get off the tram; because of a malfunction. Why do we have to get off because of an electricity malfunction? It’s not our business. I paid for my transportation card. I don’t have money to pay for a taxi to go to work. They need to find me a solution.” Afterwards, the protester talked about what he saw as a racist comment from one of the bystanders. “I am complaining here and the man over there asked me ‘can you do this in your own country?’ This means that since it isn’t my country, I don’t have the right to talk, even if they step on me!” he exclaimed angrily. The man then expressed his demands: “I won’t move from here until they find me a solution. They need to pay a taxi for me to get to work, and give me a document to justify my late arrival to work.” Finally, the man urged everyone to defend their rights: “This happens because nobody speaks up. When this happens, everyone goes to their occupations and nobody talks about it. If everybody speaks up for their rights, this won’t continue. This needs to stop!” Moroccans expressed their support for the protester, and encouraged all fellow citizens to do the same when their rights are not respected. “If Moroccan citizens did acts like this one, our conditions would improve in many domains, especially trains, public administrations, and hospitals,” commented one Facebook user. “For those who don’t know it, transportation companies are legally bound to provide alternative transportation or a refund, along with a document to prove your late arrival to work or studies,” added another Facebook user in a comment. Tramway delays and malfunctions are not an unusual event in Rabat. Only a few days before this incident, on September 6, a tramway wagon malfunctioned near the National Library. Passengers were compelled to find other means of transportation to get to their destinations. Tramway traffic remained interrupted for more than two hours before getting back to normal.

Rabat – Police of El Hajeb (60 kms away from Fes) arrested yesterday, September 8, a Spanish national for pedophilia. The 53-year-old man was accompanied by an 11-year-old Moroccan child. He was caught in the act of showing pornographic videos to the child at a local Internet café of El Hajeb. Police intervened as soon as they were notified of the criminal act. The alleged pedophile will appear in court as soon as police complete the investigation into the suspect.. This case brings out the importance of finding measures to prevent such incidents from happening. A report published by the Moroccan NGO “Do not touch my child” (TPAME) back in 2013 stated that around 26.000 children are raped in Morocco every year. However, the vast majority of these incidents do not get reported to the police. This is not the first case of its kind to surface in recent months, on August 28, 2019, an Australian-Hungarian man was arrested in Rabat’s beach while attempting to take photos of minors. In February 2019, an American man was sentenced to four years in prison for raping minors and a married woman in Chichaoua, near Marrakech and in January 2018, a French man was arrested in Fes for raping four minors. While these cases cause anger within the Moroccan public, the case that sparked the most outrage dates back to July 2013. Daniel Galvan, a Spanish pedophile incarcerated in Kenitra prison for raping 11 Moroccan children, was granted a pardon “by mistake”. Moroccans took to the streets to protest against this pardon. The protesters called for the pardon to be revoked, which happened on August 10, 2019, and the reform of laws to protect Morocco’s children.

Rabat – Renault Maroc Group and its subsidiary Renault Commerce Maroc (RCM) discovered fraud within its sales department. RCM detected the fraud in car sales procedures a few weeks ago.  Médias24 reported that the issue started last July when an internal control mission detected “breaches of internal procedures.”  The breaches were seemingly intentional and not due to human error.  Renault’s management did not clarify the nature of the breaches. The fraud is, allegedly, of a commercial nature involving both internal RCM employees and accomplices. An internal process has been initiated following the fraud’s discovery. The process may lead to legal proceedings. So far, RCM’s internal control identified and fired at least three people. Answering a question on the fraud’s effect on customers, RCM stated that “the recorded shortcomings had no impact on our customers.” “No damage, of any kind, has affected the customers of Dacia and Renault. The impact is seen internally,” explained the management of RCM to Médias24. As for the degree of financial damage the fraud has caused, RCM described it as “very minimal,” without specifying any further details.

Rabat – Human Rights Watch (HRW) has issued a statement to condemn the arrest of  Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni, who is facing charges of “undergoing an illegal abortion and sex outside of marriage.” HRW said on Monday,  September 9 that the arrest of the journalist “flagrantly violate her rights to privacy, liberty, and numerous other rights.” The NGO also called for the immediate release of the journalist, urging the authorities to drop the charges against her. Police arrested Raissouni, who works for the Arabic speaking news outlet Akhbar Al Yaoum, on August 31.  According to a statement from the public prosecutor at Rabat’s First Instance Court, police apprehended the 28-year old journalist at the entrance of the building, where a “monitored clinic” is located. The prosecutor said that the police were closely monitoring the clinic for its involvement in conducting illegal abortion. Raissouni’s trial is set to start on September 9. The journalist risks a sentence of two years if convicted. Ahmed Benchemsi, Middle East and North Africa Communications Director at HRW said that Raissouni is “being charged for alleged private behavior that shouldn’t be criminalized in the first place.”  Benchemsi also criticized the publicization of “detailed allegations about her sexual and reproductive life.” “Authorities trampled on her right to privacy and apparently sought to smear her reputation,” he added. The NGO recalled that police also arrested Raissouni’s fiance, the doctor and his two aides. In addition to HRW, Amnesty International, public figures, and journalists have expressed sympathy with the journalist. On September 6,  Amnesty International called for Raissouni’s immediate release. “The arrest of Hajar Raissouni and four others is completely unjust and these allegations are an outrageous invasion of her privacy,” Amnesty International wrote. The NGO linked the arrest of the journalist with her work as a journalist, stating that Raissouni conducted interviews with Ahmed Zefzafi, the father of Hirak Rif activist Nasser Zefzafi. The Public prosecutor of Rabat’s Court of the First Instance denied that Raissouni’s arrest was in any way linked to her profession. “The legal proceedings against a journalist, who was arrested recently along with others including a physician, are not related to her profession but are based on facts linked to abortion,” said the public prosecutor on Thursday, September 5.

Rabat – Police in Tan Tan and Laayoune in southern Morocco arrested on Saturday, September 7, six people for their involvement in alleged irregular migration and human trafficking. The suspects are aged between 33 and 39, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said on Sunday, September 8. DGSN added that the operation allowed the arrest of five of the suspects in two different houses in the city of Tan-Tan. The suspects were accompanied by four Moroccan candidates for irregular migration. Police arrested the sixth suspect in a taxi in Laayoune, southern Morocco. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation, to identify and arrest other possible accomplices. The operation is in line with Morocco’s strategy to curb irregular migration networks.  On Saturday, September 7, police in Oujda, eastern Morocco, arrested a Guinean national for forcible confinement, organizing irregular migration, and human trafficking. Police received a call from a Sudanese citizen claiming that his brother was kidnapped by a person who is active in irregular migration, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security said. In August,  Morocco’s government announced that security services aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, said on  August 29 that Morocco also dismantled 100 irregular migration networks. The official also spoke about the importance of a shared responsibility to curb the common concerns over the issue of irregular migration

Rabat  – “Don’t you have to wear a headscarf?” and “What do you wear in Morocco?” are questions I am sure most European expats regularly hear. Certainly, these questions seem to fascinate my friends. Visitors worrying about swimwear and t-shirts in Essaouira all seemed very surprised to learn that Moroccans are not horrified by arms, and that my sisters-in-law wear – pause for dramatic effect – normal swimming suits at the beach! So when I decided to breastfeed my son, I braced myself for the interrogation.  Having already spent nearly two years batting off comments about modest clothing from less well travelled British friends, I was not looking forward to the breastfeeding debate. However, in the UK, breastfeeding is already a contentious topic for some and it wasn’t going to be easy.  My husband assured me that public breastfeeding is perfectly acceptable in Morocco, while his mother seemed surprised by my apprehension about breastfeeding in the airport. Encouraged by my sister who had also reassured me that breastfeeding in Morocco would not be a problem, I did a bit of online research. Having put “breastfeeding in Morocco” into google, Lonely Planet and Tripadvisor posts jumped out from the list. “As a western woman having a baby attached suckling on the teat would attract unwanted attention in a public space. I wouldn’t recommend you considered that. Moroccans are very friendly towards young children but unlike Eastern Africa I have never seen a woman in a public space breastfeed in morocco,” commented a tripadvisor user.  The lonely planet debate was a bit more positive, although one user asked “Would you do it in public where you are from? I hope not. Use the restroom.” Another commenter wrote “Sorry, but I find that women who think we all want to see their breasts, full of milk and bulging veins, are wrong. It is not the prettiest sight.”  However, I comforted myself; these comments have more to do with attitudes to breastfeeding in general than with Morocco and could have easily been said about breastfeeding in the UK, US, or any other country.  In general the comments seemed to suggest that it is not at all common to see Moroccan women breastfeeding in cafes, restaurants, or any public spaces. However, Mumsnet told me exactly what I wanted to hear; “All in all, probably less stressful than feeding in the UK.” Encouraged, I decided to hold on to this comment and put the others out of my mind. But that, of course, was easier said than done. On my first outing with the great baby in Essaouira, I was nervous and tried to plan the excursion around his usual feeding times in order to avoid having to prove the mumsnet breastfeeder either right or wrong. As is usual with babies, this did not go to plan. On arrival in the medina, despite baby having eaten right up until the minute we got in the car to drive into town, as soon as we got out of the car the baby made it clear that more milk was all that would do.  Fortunately, we were very near to our usual coffee stop, Cafe L’horloge, which is run by an elderly gentleman who has known my husband since he was a child.  Like most cafes in Essaouira, it is mostly frequented by tourists and Moroccan men. We made for the cafe, where, upon arrival, we were greeted with enthusiasm by the proprietor. Having given Baby’s forehead the customary kiss, he rushed inside to fetch me a bottle of water, free of charge. I looked around nervously as we prepared to feed. The baby latched on quickly, and ate greedily, while I looked around anxiously, waiting for some kind of negative reaction. There was no negative reaction. I kept expecting one. None came. While I was feeding the baby, the owner of the carpet shop next door almost ran over to touch Baby’s head, saying “mahshallah.” A Moroccan woman, with her elderly mother, smiled at me with approval, and the grumpy looking man reading the paper at the table next to us looked on indulgently. So, the mumsnet Mum was right; in Morocco, breastfeeding was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. My little boy is now five and a half months old and both he and I have become very comfortable with feeding in cafes across Essaouira, and we even had to stop once on the Corniche for a quick snack! We have never experienced anything but positive comments, kind looks, and offers of help. So, where did the negative online comments on breastfeeding in Morocco come from? Honestly, I think some of this definitely comes from well-meaning ignorance. People assume, and I myself made this assumption before coming to Morocco, that, because the population is 99% Muslim, its culture is the same as that of all predominantly Muslim countries. There is also a presumption that all Islamic countries are of one, homogenous culture. The other factor here is thinking that modest dress and breastfeeding are one and the same issue; which they are not.  The other significant point is that breastfeeding in general is not common in Morocco so the question of public breastfeeding becomes slightly defunct.  Last week my husband and I bumped into a friend of his at a cafe. This friend has a baby the same age as ours; although our little monster is significantly larger. “What do you feed him?” the friend asked, slightly aggressively, I felt. My husband replied that he is breastfed. “But what do you give him with the milk?” “Nothing,” my husband replied, “he is exclusively breastfed.” At this point our usually calm and collected friend looked incredulous and inexplicable angry. He said to my husband firmly, “You should thank God your wife has enough milk.”  After this exchange, my husband and I considered for a while and realised that we don’t know any Moroccan women, including in his family, who breastfeed (or breastfed) exclusively. It was also not the first time a Moroccan acquaintance or family member had asked me what I do to supplement milk or what I do to help with lactation. Perhaps, then, the reason tripadvisor users had not seen Moroccan women breastfeeding in public is that they just don’t breastfeed. Some of them choose to use formula instead, perhaps believing that it has vitamins and minerals that breast milk doesn’t, others have to work and cannot stay with the baby all the time, while many more simply don’t produce enough milk.   According to the Moroccan Ministry of Health, only 27.8% (2017) of babies are breastfed and in 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 26% of Moroccan mothers breastfeed immediately after birth. In the UK, according to Unicef 81% of babies are breastfed so, of course it is more common to see women breastfeeding in public places because more women are breastfeeding in general. So, next time I travel to England and someone asks me about breastfeeding in Morocco, I will be able to confidently reply that Moroccans, or at least the ones I know, have absolutely no problem with breastfeeding, public or otherwise and that the mumsnet breastfeeder’s review was entirely accurate. I can heartily recommend Beach Friends, Megaloft, Cafe L’Horloge, and Restaurant Les Planches in Essaouira, to name just a few.  My answer would be less confident, however, about the UK, where, despite the high number of breastfeeders, one still gets the odd disgusted look or disapproving whisper. I have been given a very cold welcome while breastfeeding in Yeovil’s Tesco cafe ( they needed to close) and breastfeeding in Gatwick airport well nigh impossible.  However, there are some very comfortable places and I am very grateful to the Grosvenor in Shaftesbury, Dikes of Stalbridge, and The Mitre, Shaftesbury where the staff and customers have never made me feel anything but utterly welcome and comfortable.

Rabat – Rabat’s Court of First Instance begins hearing the case of journalist Hajar Raissouni, on trial for illegal abortion and premarital sex, on Monday, September 9. A group of citizens have said they will gather outside the court for a sit-in beginning at 1 p.m. “We, citizens concerned by the current situation of rights and freedoms, and in particular the situation of women in Morocco, show our support for Hajar Raissouni and are dismayed by the affair, strongly denounce the reasons and conditions of her arrest … and call for the immediate release of Hajar Raissouni, her fiance, the doctors, and the nursing staff involved,” writes the group. Police arrested Raissouni as she was leaving a doctor’s office on Saturday, August 31. They accused her of undergoing an abortion and arrested her fiance, a physician, a nurse, and a secretary from the practice. The journalist, however, denies the charges. She says she sought treatment from the doctor for internal bleeding. If convicted, Raissouni would face up to 2 years in prison. Her lawyer, Saad Sehli, has said he will argue that Raissouni did not undergo an abortion, but that she was receiving treatment for a possible miscarriage. “We have a medical report that says there is no induced abortion. There may be a spontaneous abortion, and that is not criminal,” Saad Sehli asserted. Miscarriages in the first trimester of pregnancy are very common, and women often seek medical assistance to pass the remains of the baby. The prosecutors office insists that they have medical evidence Raissouni was pregnant and had an abortion. Amid uproar over the case, the office denies the arrest is related to her journalistic work. Raissouni writes for the Arabic newspaper Akhbar al-Yaoum. Her uncle, an Islamist ideologist, is also an editorialist for the paper. The journalist published a letter in the newspaper alleging that, while in police custody, she was interrogated about her uncle. As possible political motives, Raissouni’s relatives also point to her recent articles about the Hirak activists who were convicted of participating in unauthorized protests and imprisoned. The journalist was set to be married September 14. Premarital sex is illegal in Morocco.  In 2018, police arrested 14,503 individuals for engaging in sex outside of marriage. Police also arrested 3,048 people for committing adultery. Police made far fewer arrests for illegal abortions, only 73. However, associations estimate there are 600-800 secret abortions performed in Morocco every day. Moroccans have widely discussed the case on social media. Some international organizations have also voiced their opinions, with Amnesty International calling for her release.

Rabat – Security services in the province of Errachidia have found the bodies of three more people, bringing the death toll of the bus accident caused by floods in the region to 11. Authorities found the bodies of three more people on Sunday evening, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Search operations are ongoing to find other possible victims.  On the morning of Sunday, September 8, a bus connecting between Casablanca and Rissani, a town in Errachidia Province, fell off the Oued Damchan bridge. The accident was caused by floods. Security services have so far managed to rescue 27 people. Some news reports said that the number of people killed due to the accident reached 14. King Mohammed VI ordered the government to send a high-level delegation to Errachidia to inquire about the situation. Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit led the delegation, which includes Minister for Equipment and transport Abdelkader Amara and the General of Corps, Mohamed Haramou, Commander Royal Gendarmerie.

“Whatever it takes.” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid E]l Falih boldly presented the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) approach to stabilizing 2019’s fluctuating oil market, in a statement to the Saudi Press Agency this June.  Capping crude oil output and directing a dynamic market are the organization’s greatest challenges, RBC Capital Markets analysts said this week. Industry officials cited the Trump administration’s trade conflicts and volatility as a force to be reckoned with for the allied oil giants, as OPEC+ prepares for a September 12 meeting in Abu Dhabi. This summer, the oil cartel expressed concern over a less likely challenge – youth climate activism. “There is a growing mass mobilization of world opinion… against oil, which is totally unscientific” and this is “perhaps the greatest threat that is facing our industry,” commented Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General. “Civil society is being misled to believe that oil is the source of climate change,” added Bakindo.  His comments came after the annual OPEC and Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in Vienna on July 2. The 14 member countries and non-member oil producing allies, now including Russia, are preparing for another major meeting in Abu Dhabi.  Like the July meeting, next week’s meeting should review market developments and uncertainties, reaffirm commitment to mutual interests of oil-producing nations, and focus on returning investment and confidence to the industry.  Barkindo further noted that “we believe this industry is part of the solution to the scourge of climate change,” though he did not provide specifics regarding the industry’s role. He also failed to provide insight into his assertion that the growing anti-oil opinion is “totally unscientific.” An explanation could have clarified his unconventional claim, as scientific consensus backs the destructive impact of fossil fuels in climate change. Barkindo signaled that the mobilization referenced 16-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg, and the millions of youth climate activists who have followed her school strike protest movement. Teen Activism Thunberg began a global movement last August. The teen decided to strike from school every Friday to protest climate inaction in front of the Swedish parliament. The movement spread as Thunberg delivered inspirational speeches to major international bodies, beginning at COP24 in December. The activist received a standing ovation from British MEPs after an impassioned speech in April.  School-children worldwide have joined Thunberg and taken to the streets in increasing numbers since the activist’s first school strikes last August. Roughly 1.4 million school children worldwide have joined in weekly Friday school strikes or larger FFF events, demanding swift and powerful climate legislation. Students from all continents have participated, excepting Antarctica, where adult scientists joined the action.  The movement’s next major action is scheduled for September 20-27.  While Barkindo did not single out Thunberg by name, he clearly alluded to the movement she champions. He admitted that children of some OPEC colleagues “are asking us about their future because … they see their peers on the streets campaigning against this industry.”  The executive added that mobilization against oil was “beginning to… dictate policies and corporate decisions, including investment in the industry.” Thunberg thanked OPEC for shining a spotlight on the growing movement. “Thank you! Our biggest compliment yet!” she tweeted to her roughly 728,000 followers on July 4.  Also in July, Amnesty International named Greta and her Fridays for Future (FFF) movement as their Ambassador of Conscience 2019.  Thunberg is a Nobel Peace Prize nominee for her leadership against the climate crisis. If awarded the prize in October, she will be the youngest Nobel Laureate in history. Thunberg is lauded for giving a voice to a young generation, one that cannot vote in legislatures but will face greater climate impacts than today’s political leaders. OPEC’s Barkindo implied that the oil cartel also lacked a voice. He urged the press: “We need your help because you are the voice of the voiceless … let’s focus on the science, not the political narratives.” Thunberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a carbon neutral sailboat, hitting international headlines. She arrived in New York aboard the Malizia II on August 28. The teen braved a two-week ocean journey to voice her generation’s concerns at the September 23 UN Climate Action Summit. ‘The Science’ in MENA Region “No region on Earth is expected to be harder hit by climate change than the Arab world. No other region has already displayed quite so clearly the potential threats to stability and peace that rapid environmental change may bring,” according to the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa (WEF). In 2018, a city in Oman recorded a 24-hour minimum temperature of 42.6°C, which the WEF reported as the highest minimum temperature ever recorded by a weather thermometer.  A city in the Algerian Sahara reported a maximum temperature of 51.3°C, likely the highest ever reliably recorded across all of Africa. The same report mentioned the region’s extreme vulnerability to rising sea levels, as well as several record-breaking natural hazards in recent years.  Thunberg acknowledged the disproportionate effects of climate change on major polluters versus non-polluters when accepting her Amnesty International recognition: “To act on your conscience means that you fight for what you think is right.”  She went on to explain that, “I think all those who are part of this movement are doing that, because we have a duty to try and improve the world. The blatant injustice we all need to fight against is that people in the global south are the ones who are and will be most affected by climate change while they are the least responsible for causing it.”  MENA Teens Join Fridays for Future Ranks Gulf countries rank among the world’s major CO2 emitters. North African countries generally do not, but still tend to emit more than Sub-Saharan countries. Regardless of their countries’ impact on climate change, students from MENA at large joined several FFF demonstrations. While no participation was reported in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Algeria, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar, every other MENA country, from the UAE to Morocco to Iraq to Israel, has participated. Even students from conflict-ridden Iraq, Libya, and Syria prioritized including FFF involvement within their wearied agendas.  Israeli and Palestinian teens came together in Jerusalem to make their voices heard. The two demographics “feel that in order to defeat something much bigger than us, we must put the unfortunate hatred aside and focus on what actually matters the most: saving the world from an ongoing climate breakdown,” according to 16-year-old organizer Michael Bäcklund. OPEC pins its fears on a teenager’s tenacity and a generation’s existential determination.  Recent data on climate change’s economic impact indicates that the biggest “losers” from the effects of climate change will be emerging market countries with high temperatures, and oil producers.  At the intersection of the two groups, data shows Saudi Arabia as the world’s most economically vulnerable country to climate change. One one hand, as an emerging market economy with a large share of outdoor workers and in agriculture and construction, rising temperatures mean productivity declines. One the other hand, the more fossil fuel emissions increase, the more oil demand decreases.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, might be wise to stop criticizing the FFF movement. Instead, the kingdom should focus on adapting to rising temperatures and diversifying its economy. Ultimately, “whatever it takes” should direct concern to the same threat Thunberg stresses, climate change itself.

Rabat – The Cessna 172 aircraft of a Moroccan student pilot disappeared during the night of September 4. The student pilot, Hind Barch, was headed to Sherbrooke in Quebec (eastern Canada), said the Moroccan Embassy in Ottawa on September 7. In order to obtain a professional license and become a commercial airline pilot, the 22-year-old flight attendant at Air Transat needed to do more day and night flight hours. The student’s aircraft left Mirabel, near Montreal, and disappeared from the radar some 37 kilometers northwest of Sherbrooke. Barch’s aircraft, making a round trip to Sherbrooke, disappeared from the radar on its return flight.  According to a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) spokesman, it is “too early to speculate on the causes of the plane’s disappearance.” To locate the student’s aircraft, a Canadian Armed Forces Hercules aircraft, two helicopters, and a Sûreté du Québec aircraft flew over an area of 3,300 square kilometers between Montreal and Sherbrooke. 8 Wing Trenton Public Affairs Officer, Captain Graeme Scott, stated that “we established this area based on the last signal issued. It is a wooded and rural area where search operations are difficult.” The Moroccan ambassador, Souriya Otmani, reported on Twitter that “great means have been mobilized to find the young Moroccan pilot.” “The Moroccan embassy, ​​consulate, and Moroccan community are following the news closely and expressing their support to the Barch family,” continued the tweet.

Rabat – Some environmental human rights defenders have risked everything to communicate the impact of climate change, and now a UN Special Rapporteur report supports their claim that human rights are threatened by an escalating “climate apartheid.” In a presentation to the UN Human Rights Council, Philip Alston, the report’s author, explained that climate threats go beyond endangering rights to food, health, and housing; they threaten good governance and fuel xenophobic, nationalist agendas. It is not only an environmental challenge, but also a social, economic, and governance challenge.  Alston’s report emphasized the disproportionate effects climate change will have on the world’s poor, where the “wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger, and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.” The climate crisis already infringes on rights, and even the world’s well-off polluters are starting to heed the warning cries. But those fighting the climate apartheid also risk their rights. From Russia to South Africa and Honduras to Vietnam, environmental activists have come under increasing pressure and sometimes violence from strong-arm governments.  The geopolitically fragile Middle East and North Africa region is challenged by particularly severe and continuously escalating impacts from climate change. At the same time, oppression of eco-activists is on the rise.  “I am extremely worried and appalled by the growing number of attacks and murders of environmental defenders, but also by the continuous resistance of States to act in front of egregious human rights violations,” UN special rapporteur Michel Forst said in a 2016 report.    The UN Environment Programme reported that 197 environmental activists were murdered in 2017 alone, already a dramatic increase. Iran has gained notoriety for cracking down on environmental activists. According to Amnesty International, Iranian authorities arrested at least 63 eco-activists during 2018. The targeted activists were often accused of posing as environmentalists and scientists to gather strategic information. According to the same report, “at least five were charged with ‘corruption on earth’, which carries the death penalty.” Reports of torture, abuse, and suspicious deaths are rampant from some Iranian prisons and environmental defenders are not exempt.  In January 2018, Iran arrested nine members of the Persian Wildlife Heritage without legitimate charges. Managing Director Dr. Kavous Seyed-Emami reportedly committed suicide in prison in grossly suspicious circumstances. The international rights community pushed for a fair investigation into his death without avail. Family members noticed fellow detainees sported signs of physical abuse during long-delayed visits.  The prosecutor-general found the surviving eight guilty during a March trial, which “contradicts the findings of three major state agencies in Iran, including the country’s highest security body, the Ministry of Intelligence, who have stated that the accused are all innocent of the spying charges filed against them,” according to Iran’s Radio Farda. The Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF) tracks (or, more accurately, tracked) native flora and fauna and is known for championing the endangered Asiatic cheetah. Kaveh Madani, a senior fellow at Yale University, explained the eco movement’s threatening face to national governments at a March Atlantic Council conference. He pointed out that the social power and collaborative nature of environmental issues “creates paranoia. [Security services] think that every NGO which is in touch with outsiders has an … agenda.”  Madani formerly served as deputy head of the Islamic republic’s Department of the Environment. The scientist abandoned his government post and fled the country following an arrest last February. In the post Arab Spring internet age, governments across MENA are keenly aware of popular dissent’s power. These same countries are facing especially harsh challenges from the climate crisis. Regional instability and the fragilility of its nature are a combination to be reckoned with.  In the short term, it is arguably easier to silence climate activists than to address the climate crisis. The cross-border nature of this nature-based movement also fuels government paranoia. Climate change does not recognize anthropogenic boundaries, and international data cooperation is an essential activity for climate scientists and activists.  Some MENA states afraid of data sharing have reportedly intimidated researchers giving international conference reports and greatly restricted access to national scientific data for domestic research use.  On top of that, environmentalists and researchers often use surveillance equipment that raises red flags for wary governments. Across a tense border with Iran, Iraqi activists and researchers are keenly aware of this paradox in their work.  “No one believes that these are for bird-watching,” Laith Al-Obdeiei of Nature Iraq, and no newcomer to government harassment, told the Atlantic. He spoke of binoculars, not even approaching classes of typical conservationist tools such as drones. The PWHF arrests regarded camera-trap technology used to track endangered cheetahs. Iraq’s frequent crackdowns on environmental defenders often come over water rights, at Iraq’s environmental threat forefront. “Water is used as a political instrument against Kurds, Syrians and Iraqis by Iran and Turkey,” said Salman Kharillah, also of Nature Iraq. “The water belongs to everyone. It needs to become a tool for sustainable peace rather than political hegemony, which would only cause more war and conflict.”  But there lies a glimmer of hope. “You can like the government or hate the government. You can be religious or not,” Madani, the now Yale scientist, told the Atlantic. The planet, on the other hand, “unites people. It’s different to other kinds of political activism.” Just as climate crisis permeates the region, so does the need for coordinated action. The environmental defense movement ignites government paranoia for its cross-border collaborative nature. This culture of collaboration and a movement unified against a non-discriminatory natural threat may prove a source of increased cooperation in a conflict-ridden region. Urgency moves EcoPeace Middle East to transcend a conflict paradigm and focus on securing water for residents in the Jordan River Basin, to protect human life. Gidon Bromberg, the organization’s Israeli co-founder, spoke on behalf of the Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian cooperative.  “Water scarcity is the most critical environmental issue that our region faces. Managing our shared water resources … presents the opportunity to forge solutions that advance peacemaking in the region. Even in the most intractable of situations and conflicts, when we work together on a common objective that serves mutual interest, we can … build trust and give good reasons for hope for a better future.”

Rabat – Morocco’s tourism ministry has signed a “co-marketing partnership” agreement with Ctrip, China’s largest online travel agency, to promote Chinese tourism in Morocco. Signed on Friday in Rabat by Adel El Fakir, the general director of the Moroccan National Office for Tourism (ONMT), and James Liang, executive chairman of Ctrip, the agreement is set to be a key part of broader China-Morocco bilateral connections, according to the two parties. As Rabat and Beijing seek to expand their political and commercial ties, it is also important that they invest in socio-cultural ties between Moroccans and Chinese, said representatives from both parties. The partnership is expected to set the seal on a relationship that began three years ago. In June 2016, Morocco announced a new visa policy for Chinese tourists. Chinese citizens can now obtain visas upon arrival in Morocco instead of having to get them in advance. Since that move, the number of Chinese people visiting Morocco has exponentially jumped, from less than 20,000 when the policy was announced to over 180,000 in 2018, according to the Moroccan tourism ministry. While the change in figures has been impressive, the goal of the partnership is to attract as many as 500,000 Chinese tourists per year. Referring to the visa policy, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that Morocco’s hope is to “become a privileged travel destination for Chinese.” In a subsequent interview with Chinese outlet Xinhua, El Othmani reiterated Morocco’s desire to be a leading tourism destination for China.
“We are waiting for more Chinese tourists to visit Morocco in the future,” El Othmani said. “The tourism cooperation between the two countries is of great significance and will enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples and lay a foundation for further strengthening bilateral relations.”

Rabat – Morocco’s largest telecommunications operator, Maroc Telecom, has apologized for the poor quality of the internet. In a Facebook post, the company said that a fault in one of its cables crossing the Atlantic ocean has caused some disruptions in its internet services. “MarocTelecom has mobilized all necessary means, including a specialized cable ship, to restore the situation as soon as possible,” the post said. Maroc Telecom presented its apologies for the inconvenience and said that the problem is beyond their control. Moroccans have often complained about  Maroc Telecom’s poor services. Some internet users commented that the internet has always experienced disruptions even before the cable breakdown. Others said that they are paying for a service they are not receiving.

Rabat – Vahid Halilhodzic, Morocco’s newly appointed coach of the national football team, is taking Hakim Ziyech’s defense after yet another crucial miss from the player. For Halilhodzic, Ziyech needs fans’ support to boost his morale and help him regain the confidence and effectiveness that made him Morocco’s best player in the first place. Ziyech, Morocco’s best player and arguably one of the best attacking midfielders worldwide, was mostly a shadow of himself against Burkina Faso yesterday at the Marrakech stadium. The Ajax star missed a penalty and struggled to impress and make his marks on the game. Some fans at the Marrakech stadium vented their frustration on the Ajax star, booing and whistling. Coach Valilhodzic disagrees with such a treatment. He thinks that difficult moments like the ones Ziyech appears to be going through are in fact moments when he needs the unreserved support of fans to help him get back to his best shape. “Something that I found disappointing is that a national team player got whistled,” the coach said after the match. “Ziyech does not deserve that. He is a likable guy. He is also an excellent player, and that is why I selected him.” Not so long ago, Ziyech was the darling of many Moroccan fans. His sterling form with Ajax, both in the Dutch league and at the UEFA Champions league, had a big hand in raising fans’ expectations for Morocco’s CAN aspirations. But Morocco disappointed, and many fans were particularly angry with Ziyech’s last-minute penalty miss against Benin. For many Moroccan fans, the outstanding moment in yesterday’s match was Ziyech’s missed penalty, as a goal at that moment in the game could have given Morocco the lead when the team needed it to assert itself against a Burkina team that was starting to grow into the game. Turning to Ziyech’s missed penalty in his post-match press comments, the Moroccan coach made the point that missing vital opportunities in crucial moments is part of football. “Even Maradona and Platini once missed. We have to give him the confidence he needs; he really is a high-level player.”

Rabat – Morocco’s presidency of the African Union’s Peace and Security Council (PSC) was the subject of a recent meeting between Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chair of the AU Commission, and Mohammed Arrouchi, Morocco’s AU representative and PSC president for September. According to reports, the meeting between the officials aimed at discussing the agenda of Morocco’s one-month tenure at the helm of the AU’s highest body on questions of stability, peace, and crisis management on the continent. Morocco will preside over the PSC for the month of September. In line with the PSC’s responsibility to uphold stability across the African continent, the two officials discussed some of Africa’s lingering security challenges, from terrorism to the internal conflicts befalling some African countries. Even as Morocco is increasingly rising as an indispensable player in African affairs, this is the first time that the kingdom has been elected to chair the PSC. According to Ambassador Arrouchi, Morocco’s election to chair the council is an acknowledgement of the kingdom’s efforts on the pan-Africanist front in the last two years. Since it rejoined the AU in January after decades of absence, Arrouchi recalled, Morocco has emerged as a leading voice on essential issues for the AU’s agenda, from migration to intra-African exchanges and regional security. Chairman Mahamat echoed Ambassador Arrouchi’s sentiment when talking about the role Morocco has played in the years since it rejoined the pan-African body. The AU official acknowledged Morocco’s “dynamism” and “leadership” on issues of utmost importance for the AU’s pan-African agenda and vision for the continent.

Rabat – Morocco World News sat down to talk to Anwar Bougroug, a 28-year old fashion designer who is quickly making a name for himself thanks to his innovation and distinctive vision. The uniqueness of Anwar’s designs may be attributed to his upbringing, split between two continents. Anwar was raised in Oslo but came back to Morocco every summer. After completing his studies in fashion in the Norwegian capital, Anwar moved back to Morocco to put down roots and create his brand in 2016. And so, it was born – simply under his last name “Bougroug.” The label combines the best of both Anwar’s worlds. “For me, design is essentially about creating functional items in high quality, and when you think about Scandinavian design or Moroccan craftsmanship, that what it comes down to,” said Anwar, explaining how the two different countries have affected his designs.
 “I studied and worked in Scandinavia during the initial part of my career so that affects my aesthetic and values tremendously,” he said. “However, coming to Morocco every summer and making fashion, accessories, and interior with tailors and craftspeople, I always felt I had a special insight on the know-how on how to create unique items in high quality.” “I love the idea that I can make anything I want here in Morocco.” The brand, much like Anwar’s upbringing, is shared between Morocco and Scandinavia, with the head office in Stockholm and the production office in Marrakech. One of the most distinctive elements of Bougroug is that every piece is entirely unisex, a fashion movement that has been gaining momentum in recent years, particularly as gender fluidity becomes more normalized, but is yet to be seen in the windows of most commercial stores. “I think gender-based clothing is a bit ridiculous since it’s just another set of social codes that human beings made to control society. My brand is about creating the perfect universe, where everyone wears whatever they want wherever they want,” explained Anwar. “I want to challenge certain gender-related norms, especially toxic masculinity, which I believe is very visible when we create collections and products.” The unisex element, in addition to the overall minimalism, again shows Anwar’s Scandinavian influences. “Scandinavian fashion is more about personality and less about your gender, people care more about coolness and how you style things, compared to if things fit your asserted gender or not,” said Anwar. “I love this idea and I think it celebrates individuality, but most and foremost, it just looks really good when people wear whatever they feel like.” Anwar’s brand is perfect for the generation that welcomes open-mindedness and pushing boundaries. The brand also reflects the increased awareness of the youth on the importance of sustainability, and a need to hit back against fast fashion. The brand is still out of the box, and possibly ahead of its time – certainly in Morocco, where clothing is still firmly gendered. However, Anwar has a clear vision of who he pictures wearing his clothes during his design process and that kind of consumer is unquestionably out there. “I see someone that’s very conscious, both about whom they’re buying from, meaning they want someone that stands for the same values as themselves, but also people that want something special and unique,” Anwar elaborated. “We’re still a small brand, so we don’t create too much of anything, something that is also part of our sustainability strategy,” said Anwar, something that again reflects the environmental consciousness of Anwar’s generation. “Additionally, we get custom orders on dresses, shirts, bags and so on, and these people are oftentimes people like ourselves: open-minded individuals that want to contribute and be part of a more tolerant and inclusive world.” Anwar’s brand, which has such a clear vision, reflects a deep passion for modern design and the societal elements that shape it. This is something that Anwar felt even as a child, split between his colorful summers in Morocco and the sharp and clean designs of Oslo. ‘I was always very fascinated about how clothing could transform a person. Fashion has such power in our society and I find it interesting how everyone is related to this subject, even if they think they’re not,” he explains. “I was always surrounded by people making clothing or getting things custom made, I even made things for my little sister and took photos of her to copy old Vogue covers.” “I used to watch fashion shows when I was younger and I was so compelled with how these designers, season after season, created a new world on the catwalk,” said Anwar, reminiscing on his earliest memories of fashion. “I loved the stories and the romanticism connected to fashion. That’s why I sometimes say that I am more of a storyteller than a designer, even if both of them go hand in hand.” Of course, even with a strong passion for the industry and natural talent, the road to success in design is still long. Anwar had a few words of advice for other young Moroccans who want to pursue a career in design, but may feel daunted by the uncertain path such a career choice has. “It’s just about doing it. Give yourself 5 years to get things done, and another 5 years to become more established,” he advised. “If you have a chance to learn from someone else, do it. Work for other companies and designers, that’s such valuable knowledge and experience that you can live without.” “Fashion and design are huge topics, it takes many years to fully learn everything and manage a business or a career in it. Be patient, work hard and stay dedicated. That’s what everyone successful in the industry has done previous to their current success.” Anwar’s brand is stocked in three boutiques in Marrakech, 33 Rue Majorelle, El Fenn Boutique, and the Moroccans. The brand can also be found in Rabat, at the concept store Bee on 6th.

Rabat – Pastilla is a delicious and unique dish, a crispy pie that combines sweet and salty flavors, it is often served at weddings and celebrations but can be cooked for a special family dinner. The sweet-savoury meat stuffing is enveloped in a thin, crispy pastry called “warqa,” it can be bought in supermarkets as “feuilles de pastilla” or freshly made in the market. The same pastry is used for briwat.  There are different forms of pastilla and the traditions vary from region to region. In coastal areas, for example, pastilla is more often made with seafood. Chicken and pigeon are also common fillings. Today we’re going to learn how to make my favorite – chicken and almond pastilla.  It can be quite tricky to get it right, but I promise it’s well worth the effort. Let’s start with the ingredients: 2kg of chicken cut into pieces ½ kg of onions, finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley ½ tablespoon of chopped cilantro 1 teaspoon of ginger powder 1 teaspoon of  turmeric powder 1 teaspoon of salt ½ teaspoon of black pepper 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder 2 tablespoon of brown sugar A large pinch of saffron threads 1 tablespoon of salted butter ¼ cup of oil ½ kg warqa sheets (if you can’t get warqa, you can replace with filo pastry sheets.) To prepare the almonds you will need: 500g boiled almonds – peeled – fried until  light golden and crushed 3 tablespoons of caramelized, condensed milk 1 tablespoon of  orange blossom sugar ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon powder In a large pot, put the chopped onions in oil and add chicken, salted butter, spices, and garlic. Stir and cook for a few minutes. Add water almost to the level of the chicken. Cover the pot and when it comes to the boil, lower the heat to medium and keep stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until the chicken pieces are cooked and the meat separates easily from the bones. When the chicken is cooked, remove the pieces to a plate. Add brown sugar and cinnamon cook the sauce still in the pan until the onion is caramelized. When the chicken is cold remove meat from bones and add into the pot to onion and mix well. In a bowl, mix the crushed almonds condensed milk, cinnamon, and orange blossom sugar. Grease the round mold with butter. On the bottom of the dish, place 7 sheets of pastilla well-greased with butter (butter side up), overlapping them like the petals of a flower and leaving the overflow to the outside edges of the dish (about half of the sheet inside the flat, the other half to the outside). Consolidate the bottom of the pastilla with 1 or 2 more sheets placed in the center of the mold. Put a layer of the almond mixture on the sheets using the back of a spoon to spread it perfectly. Put pieces of chicken and onions over the entire surface of the almonds in order to completely cover the mold. Add a layer of almonds on the top. Add another sheet of pastry on top then fold the layers of the pastilla pastry over the stuffing. Arrange 3 new sheets on top and overlap to close the pastilla firmly. Once the pastilla is closed, spread the yolk of an egg on the top. Using a small wooden stick, like a toothpick, put some small holes on the top of pastilla. Put the pastilla in a preheated oven for about 45 minutes (more or less depending on oven). The pastilla should be golden brown and crispy when cooked When it is baked, leave to rest (about 5 minutes) then Sprinkle icing sugar over the entire surface  Just before serving, sprinkle icing sugar or the surface of pastilla and decorate it with cinnamon and crushed fried almonds.

Twenty-seven-year-old Fatiha Amrani dropped out of school at 16 to pursue art of Amazigh (Berber) weaving, making use of her childhood hobby and skills. Fatiha, who was raised in the patriarchal society of the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco, has set out on her own career of carpet-weaving. Although she attended school in a remote village in the Middle Atlas Mountains near Aoumana village, Khenifra province, she picked up her artistic skills while watching her mother weaving Amazigh carpets. “Hurrying on my way home from school, carrying a heavy school bag on my fragile back while walking in plastic sandals, my mind and heart were obsessed with weaving,” Fatiha said. “At the age of 6, I started to weave my own models of new carpets which were mocked and disparaged by other women in the village. As a little girl, I couldn’t stand their envious giggles and glances, but I never stopped weaving because I wanted to do something not only different but also creative,” Fatiha explained. Through some art classes in middle and high school, Fatiha found inspiration as they opened new horizons of creativity for her. “When I was at the middle school in my village Aoumana and at high school in Khenifra city, I kept weaving along with attending my classes at school … and learned how to use and mix colours,” she said. But at the age of fifteen, Fatiha’s life turned upside down.   “At high school, I got more enthralled with weaving creatively, I was even more possessed by threads, looms, and colors of nature,” she said. But Fatiha’s enthusiasm and passion were exclusively invested in weaving, and her grades suffered, ultimately leading to her dropping out of school. As a dropout, Fatiha began to think of marriage as the only option for a teenage girl like herself living in the Atlas Mountains. Without a husband, she would be the subject of gossip.   When Fatiha failed her second year at high school, she received many marriage proposals and accepted two. But neither worked out. Her first fiancé had a quarrel with another interested man and his family, and the engagement was broken. “I didn’t accept the marriage proposal at the beginning, but my fear of shameful rumors of being a single woman pushed me to accept. This ruined my life, and as a result, I dropped out of school,” Fatiha said with tears in her eyes. Fatiha then decided to focus on her Amazigh weaving. Supported by her brothers and mother, she developed a vision for her art. “At the beginning only my brother, who is an artist, helped me. However, my relatives considered my work as trivial, insane, and a waste of time. They said it won’t be successful,” Fatiha narrated.  Her family’s support and her own child-like enthusiasm drove her to stick to her dream. “My mother understood this art because she has been weaving since she was a child, too, but relatives stood against me because of my ill health, up to today.”  She continued to narrate sadly that teen girls from her region are expected to find a husband when they hit 15. Otherwise their families will be ashamed. Often, the prospect of marriage means that young girls do not finish school or have the opportunity to develop their skills and become independent.   “In the eyes of society, married girls who can have kids and take care of the husband’s house and family are the most enviable ones.” Fatiha is fighting this stereotype by launching art associations with other artists, both women and men. “Lately, I helped my family financially thanks to my artistic skills. I used to work outside the home to support myself and not be looked down on as a single woman by society. Girls here in this region are regarded as a burden, so at the age of 15, they start to get married and sometimes even younger,” she said.  Even though Fatiha’s art has achieved outstanding results and her fame is spreading in Morocco, her work is still in the early stages. There is much to be done for her and for other women in her village.  In addition to some health issues, Fatiha is facing the difficult situation of working outside the home in a patriarchal society where women are supposed to stay at home.  By telling her story, Fatiha appeals to civic society and the Moroccan government to aid girls in poor areas to follow their dreams and have a brighter future.

Rabat – There were, it is true, perceptible changes in Morocco’s game, from the line-up to the way they played. Their philosophy seemed different, even if the end result bore markers of déjà-vu for fans who suffered the exciting yet frustrating Atlas lions of CAN 2019.  As the Atlas Lions, fresh from their CAN disappointment, played Burkina Faso at the Marrakech stadium, it was clear from the beginning what the fans wanted: an opportunity for players to redeem themselves, and perhaps a chance at invoking the spirits of a team that used to actually score. Scoring goals has been Morocco’s biggest problem. They have been impeccable in terms of tactical disposition, playing exquisite football and overwhelming most of the teams they have played in the last three months—even Argentina—with a kind of footballing dexterity that makes fans think: “Yes, this is the team, big time!” And yet tonight was a textbook rendition of what Morocco has been in its most recent outings: focused and technically irresistible but somehow, and inexplicably so, incapable of scoring, of finding the tiny cracks that great teams tend to find in opposing teams’ disposition.  Morocco’s Lions started well tonight against Burkina, their passing accuracy far more superior to their opponents’, while their flow of ball, especially in the middle and on both flanks, meant that, like Ivory Coast and Benin before them, Burkina played the kind of football where your main concern is to prevent your opponent from scoring. A type of play based on parking the bus and counting on providence to take advantage of the few counterattacking opportunities the opposing side throws, reluctantly, in your way.  And so for 45 minutes in the first half, there was a sense of monotonous regularity to the actions. Morocco pressured and pushed, while Burkina held back and waited for Morocco to err and concede scoring chances.  At which point, by minute 55, barely 10 minutes into the second half, it would have been a safe, accurate bet to expect a scoreless draw. But football has its own ways. It so often happens that, in a matter of mere minutes, what seemed like a done deal, a sealed un-performance, can become lively and enthralling.  The spectacle here, at the Marrakech Stadium, may not have been that lively in the second half. But at least it was different. Burkina Faso started to believe they could make something meaningful of their evening in Marrakech. And Morocco, for its part, seemed to be waking up, rather belatedly, to the reality that this was an opportunity to start burrying the painful memories of the recently conclude CAN.  With a new coach intent on “changing some things” and breathing discipline and in a team he called talented but deeply flawed and in need of reconstruction, tonight game was supposed to be the signal of a whole new, post-Renard era.  But the only difference in this side and the one that played the recent CAN came in the last 10 minutes of the game, as Morocco, now down 1-0, chased indefatigably for the equalizer. Just now, in the game’s dying minutes, they started displaying the passion and drive that a team of their standing should have summoned much, much earlier. It would have been sacrilegious to lose, and the players knew it. The longed-for equalizer did come at the 88th minute, courtesy of a deflection gifted to Morocco’s Zouhair Feddal by a poor Burkina defense. With a 1-1 scoreline against Burkina, Morocco has dodged a defeat that would have raised many (uncomfortable) questions, something that would have been ruinous for the morale, spirit of a new era that has not actually really started yet.  “We still have a long way to go,” Morocco’s new coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, said at the end of the match when asked about his overall take-away from his team’s performance. And maybe that’s all Morocco has got for the moment, that’s the only consolation at the team’s disposal: this transitional period will take time. But if handled well, it could give Morocco the kind of team it has been hankering after for years.  Yesterday noon, Validhodzic faced the Moroccan media in his maiden press conference as Atlas Lions coach. He was asked to give an outline of what his coaching tenure will look like with Morocco. What, in other words, does he think this team needs to do to rise above its current level, to win titles and make history?  “I have watched all their games at the World Cup and the African Cup of Nations—twice. I think some things need rebuilding…. I’ve heard quite a lot about how talented this team is. But then I see forwards who have only managed to score three or four goals in a season. That’s not talent.”  The Bosnian coach spoke about pace, physical strength, and mental stamina, saying that it is the lack of a balanced combination of these factors that accounts for Morocco’s mediocre performance in front of goal.  Judging from tonight performance, and not to mention yet another penalty miss from Hakim Ziyech, it is hard not to agree with Valilhodzic’s assessment of where Morocco currently stands.  The point, however, is whether the Bosnian can lead this team where it needs to be. Which brings us back to an earlier point: He may ultimately lead them there, but it will take time—transitions, at least successful ones, always do. Halilhodzic is already being called a miracle worker. But miracles don’t come cheaply.

Rabat – In a remarkable turnaround after repeatedly calling Morocco an “excellent” and “indispensable” partner for Spain and Europe, Spanish Head of government Pedro Sanchez appears to be distancing himself from Morocco on an issue of the utmost importance for Rabat. In a document entitled “Open Proposal for a Progressive Common Agenda,” published on Tuesday, September 3, the Sanchez-led Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) laid down its vision for a “better future for Spain and Europe.” As should be expected, the document, which is comprised of 370 policy points encapsulating PSOE vision for both domestic, European and foreign affairs, noticeably featured the Western Sahara question in its section on foreign policy actions deemed of high interest for PSOE. When it comes to the territorial conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, the document noted, rather diplomatically, Spain’s stance has always been one of unreserved commitment to the UN-led process. “The Spanish government supports the Western Sahara negotiations process, both at the UN and other levels, based on respecting international law,” the document asserted. Of greater significance, however, was PSOE’s invocation of human rights monitoring for MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara. The Spanish government “supports the extension of the MINURSO mandate to monitor human rights,” it said. This turnaround, a stark departure from Sanchez’s usual “Morocco is of critical importance for Spain” rhetoric, is set to have far-reaching implications for Madrid-Rabat relations. In Spain, the change has been interpreted as a gasping-for-breathe move to secure the support of Unidas Podemos, Spain’s unapologetically left-leaning, populist party. On the Western Sahara question, Podemos, a vocal Polisario supporter, has been one of the main initiators of pro-Polisario PR campaigns in Spain and during EU-Morocco proceedings featuring Western Sahara (the EU-Morocco agriculture and fisheries agreements, for example). PSOE’s proposal, which contains what Sanchez’s party is calling essential 370 policy points for a “third way” to move Spain forward, are actually Sanchez’s way of winning the much-needed support from Podemos for the formation of a coalition government, according to reports from Spain. “As deadline for new election looms, Spain’s PM reaches out to Podemos,” El Pais headlined its September 3 story on the new, prospective PSOE-Podemos bromance. Because he failed to win the absolute majority he needed in the latest snap elections, Sanchez is out for the support he now needs to form a coalition government, even if that means giving up on some policy points he once deemed central to the type of leadership and geopolitical alliance he has long espoused. In Morocco, by contrast, the move is seen as a disappointing turn of events, an utterly unexpected move from a once-upon-a-time reliable, vocal ally. Sanchez has been one of the most pro-Morocco European leaders in the past months, consistently defending Morocco’s “strategic value” to both Spain and the EU at large. He has called Morocco “an exemplary ally,” lauded “Morocco’s key role in multiple priority issues for the European Union,” and vowed, with the solemnity and gravitas of a new convert, that “Spain and Morocco are, today more than ever, two countries united…” The common denominator of Sanchez’s comments on Morocco, at least until September 3, has been that Rabat is an ally that Madrid cannot afford to lose. As he now urges for the inclusion of a human rights monitoring clause in MINURSO’s mandate, however, a move that has not been part of the UN-led discussions since 2013, and seen in Rabat as yet another Polisario maneuvering to have the international community call Morocco names for its “blatant disregard for human rights” in Western Sahara, the Spanish PM’s move has been received with a mix of disbelief and dismay. But past the momentary suspension of disbelief, dismay and unpleasant surprise are what have set in among Moroccan observers and analysts, prompting some to call the Spanish PM out for his “hypocrisy” and duplicity. At a press briefing on September 5, journalists bombarded Mustapha El Khalfi, the spokesperson of the Moroccan government, with questions about the implications of what is happening in Spain. What is Morocco’s response, or how will it respond? There were other questions, too, all of them one way or another trying to get something, anything (but especially an expression of anger, shock, or ‘deep concern’) from El Khalfi. To the barrage of questions, El Khalfi, wearing that imperturbable look of “everything is fine, or there is nothing to worry about,” a popular requirement among state officials whose task is to deal with the press, simply commented that what Sanchez’s party is calling for is no longer part of the UN’s agenda in Western Sahara. That Sanchez and Spain are bringing up a point that was dismissed in 2013, when it was first brought up in resolution talks; and that, more fundamentally, saying what needs to be done in the UN-led Western Sahara process is the exclusive prerogative of the UN Security Council. El Khalfi may have not sounded “alarmed” or “deeply concerned,” as he delivered his answers with composure and a noticeable resolve to shun anything that could come close to sounding alarmist. However, he implied, especially in his insistence on leaving Western Sahara to UNSC, that, whatever happens next in the PSOE-Podemos episode, the next weeks or months will come with questions from Rabat for Madrid.
But, of course, the questions will be asked in the behind-the-doors manner diplomats are trained in. And these, in all likelihood, will be demands to clarify, retract, or water down, as far as Morocco is concerned, the ostensibly pro-Polisario tone of Sanchez’s recent comments. How Rabat and Madrid handle this “clarification-retraction-temporization” episode will define what Morocco-Spain relations will be like for the rest of Sanchez’s premiership.

Rabat – The defense team of Hajar Raissouni, the Moroccan journalist arrested for undergoing an illegal abortion and having sexual intercourse out of marriage, has stated that the police forcing Rassouni to undergo a medical examination against her will is tantamount to torture under the UN Convention against Torture (UNCAT). The journalist’s legal team said in a statement, obtained by the Arabic news outlet Alyaoum24, that they will file a complaint against the police, complying with the UNCAT that Morocco signed in 1986 and ratified in 1993. “Hajar Rissouni condemns this political file through which the authorities want to punish her for articles on the Hirak Rif (Rif movement) and threatening her uncle Ahmed Raissouni, a human rights activist and journalist in the Arabic-speaking newspaper Akhbar al-Yawm.” Raissouni’s lawyer Mohamed Sadkou accused the judicial police of Rabat of “breaching the international human rights treaty by torturing his client,” decrying the “inhumane, cruel, and degrading treatment that she was subject to. According to Sadkou, the medical examination was against Raissouni’s will and is, therefore, considered as a “direct violation to her physical and moral integrity.”  He added that “the aim of the inhumane treatment is to exhaust the journalist to obtain the required confession, and that’s the definition of torture.” Sadkou drew attention to the political side of the case, arguing that “Raissouni is a courageous journalist who dealt with hot topics that authorities want to silence.” “We are facing a fake moral casefile because the real motive is political and the questions that were asked were not related to abortion. It is the independent journalism that is under attack here.” Raissouni denies all the accusations. If convicted, she would face a two-year sentence.

Rabat – The government council has adopted yesterday, September 5, in Rabat, two draft decrees presented by the Minister of Labor and Professional Integration. The first draft decree concerns including midwives and rehabilitation professionals in the Obligatory Medical Insurance (AMO) and in the pension system. The second decree aims to include notaries. The government’s spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, revealed that the draft decree concerning midwives and rehabilitation professionals was developed after concertation with all the concerned parties. “Consultations were held with midwives and rehabilitation professionals representatives, in the presence of representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Labor and Professional Integration, National Social Security Fund (CNSS), and National Health Insurance Agency (ANAM),” said El Khalfi. “These meetings allowed the Ministry of Labor to appoint the communication body responsible for exchanging information on midwives and rehabilitation professionals with the CNSS,” added the spokesperson. The Ministry of Health will take care of communicating the necessary information for registering the concerned professionals to the CNSS. The second draft decree, concerning notaries, was developed after concertation with representatives of notaries, in the presence of representatives from the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labor and Professional Integration, CNSS, and ANAM. The aim of these meetings aimed to find the best way to apply AMO and pension systems on this category of professionals. CNSS is a public establishment that provides services such as familial allocations, medical insurance and pensions. However, many professionals do not benefit from its services, including liberal professionals, freelancers, and people working without contracts.

Rabat – On Thursday, September 5, the Government Council adopted Decree 2.19.737 to establish a committee under the Ministry of Equipment to oversee the construction of the Dakhla Atlantic port. The committee is expected to launch a tender for the project in the last three months of this year. The government has set a seven-year deadline for the project and a budget of MAD 10 billion. The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, said that the project is in line with the country’s development plans for the southern provinces and the 2030 National Ports strategy. The strategy includes the construction of six ports, allowing each region to profit from the dynamic role of port activities. Morocco’s ultimate developmental goal is to promote and enhance the investment potential of Morocco’s southern provinces. Such projects are also in line with King Mohammed VI’s vision to enable the local population to make the region an economic hub. On the 40th anniversary of the Green March in November 2015, the monarch launched a development model in Laayoune. In the speech, the King said that  the aim of the development model in the region is to “seal” the integration of these provinces into “the unified homeland and to enhance the influence of the Sahara region as an economic hub and a crucial link between Morocco and its African roots.” The development model includes infrastructure plans, airports, and a railway between Tangier and Lagouira. The projects aim to support the social economy and to create job opportunities, especially for the youth of the region. Refuting Polisario’s false claims  A Moroccan diplomat, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity, told Morocco World News that “this investment and the more than $ 7 billion that Morocco has pledged to invest in the region since 2015 are a rebuttal to Polisario’s claims that Morocco has been exploiting the natural resources” of Western Sahara. The diplomat added that the separatist group had switched its focus to the “unfounded claims that Morocco exploits the natural resources of the region” after it failed to push the United Nations into including the monitoring of human rights in the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in the region.” “Polisario and its cohort of supporters resort to fact-twisting and deception to lure people who are not familiar with the issue into believing that Morocco is exploiting the wealth and natural resources of Moroccan Sahara,” said the diplomat. The source explained that “when people dig deep and look for real facts, they realize that Morocco has heavily invested in the territory over the past four decades to build much-needed infrastructure to enable the local population to lead a dignified life.” South-south cooperation Moroccan political analyst Abdelffatah El Fatihi told Morocco World News that the implementation of development programs in southern provinces is in line with Morocco’s ongoing strategy in favor of the local population, despite the absence of a political settlement to end the conflict. “It is a way to assert that Morocco cannot wait forever.” The expert added that the projects fall in the framework of Morocco’s strategy of south-south Africa cooperation “The port is expected to play a vital role in promoting African trade.” In July, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani attended a regional communication meeting held in Dakhla to inspect the projects under the Southern Provinces Development program (2015-2021). El Othmani said that the region’s development program, includes 149 projects; 21 of which are not yet complete. The other  75 projects are in progress in the final phase, while another 50 are awaiting their launch. A more developed region The Polisario Front has long claimed that Morocco is exploiting the region’s resources. Polisario expressed frustration after Morocco and the European Union renewed their fisheries agreement in January, calling on the UN to intervene in Western Sahara. Morocco’s government, however, informed the UN of its signature on the agreement. The government emphasized that the agreement is in favor of the population and for the development of the region. El Fatihi said that it is natural to receive negative positions from the separatist “because it will strengthen the Moroccan influence in North Africa and in the West African region. 3 In a speech to celebrate the 39th anniversary of Morocco’s Green March in 2014, King Mohammed VI spoke about Morocco’s successful strategy in reviving the economy of the region as it was experiencing lower human development indicators before 1975. The King said, “ Since we recovered the Sahara, for every single dirham of revenue from the Sahara, the state invests 7 dirhams there, as part of the solidarity between the regions and between the sons and daughters of the region.” The King reiterated Morocco’s continued determination to boost the development of Western Sahara on every anniversary of the Green March, emphasizing that the revenue benefits the population of the region. On the 41st anniversary of the Green March in 2016, the monarch  said that Morocco’s southern provinces are “ambitious thanks to the specific development model and projects launched in the region.”

The new flight, which will take 12 hours, will facilitate traveling for Moroccan and Chinese businessmen who previously had to make a stopover before continuing to their final destination. RAM had planned to launch the direct flight in June 2015, but because of the delay of receiving the Dreamliner 789-9, it was pushed back to January 2020.

Rabat – A light-weight aircraft carrying cocaine crashed in the early hours of September 6 in Sabt al-Zinat, a few kilometers from the city of Assilah, according to a local news outlet. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), however, has not yet reported on the incident.  At 2 a.m., the Royal Gendarmerie, the police, and intelligence services’ teams went to the scene to investigate the incident.  The craft crashed between Larache and Assilah (46 kilometers south of Tangier). The ‘helicopter’ was carrying cocaine, originally from South America, between Morocco and Spain, says the local source.  At the crash scene, the Royal Gendarmerie arrested the pilot, a man in his fifties of Mexican nationality. Having sustained minor injuries, he was evacuated to the nearest hospital where he will be questioned by the Royal Gendarmerie. The news outlet pointed out that the craft was allegedly traveling at low altitude to avoid being tracked by radars. The causes of this accident are still unclear. An investigation was opened to determine the causes and the exact circumstances of this crash. Local news also mentioned that this is not the first time that small planes transporting drugs crashed in the area. Other crafts have been found in the suburbs of the city of Tetouan. Morocco and Spain’s recent drug trafficking pressure  Moroccan and Spanish police have recently been facing a rising number of drug trafficking operations.  On September 2, Spanish police arrested four British suspects for their alleged involvement in an international drug trafficking network. During the arrest operation, police seized €100,000 and 1,500 kilograms of cannabis.  On August 15, a unit of the Royal Navy aborted a drug trafficking operation in the same region of Assilah, Northern Morocco. After a long chase to stop three “Go-Fast” boats, the navy seized 130 packets of cannabis resin weighing more than 4 tons. In June 2019, Moroccan Police in Nador aborted a large international drug-smuggling operation and seized a total of 12 tons and 800 kilograms of cannabis resin.

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture and Communication announced that a budget of MAD 11 million has been allocated for the restoration of the Kasbah of Boulaouane, a historical fortress in El Jadida region. Minister of Culture and Communication, Mohamed Laaraj, also gave the green light to the first stage of the project. The restoration plan aims to repair the walls, the corridors, and the mosque located inside the fortress. The restoration will respect all the norms of rehabilitating historical sites and Kasbahs. This renovation project is part of a touristic circuit that will link the city of El Jadida to historical monuments of the region, added Laaraj. The circuit will facilitate access to monuments located in secluded areas. The minister also emphasized the importance of preserving and valorizing Moroccan cultural heritage in all the regions of Morocco. He also stressed the role that historical monuments can play in the economic and social development of the region where they’re located, if they are respected and preserved. The Kasbah of Boulaouane was built in the year 1710. It is only one of a dozen Kasbahs built under the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail Benchrif (1645-1727). The architecture of the Kasbah resembles fortresses built during the Byzantine Era. Years after the Kasbah was built, it was abandoned and covered by the sands. The fortress is located strategically, on the top of a hill and surrounded by Oum Errabia river. It overlooks all the neighboring regions. The river of Oum Errabia surrounding the Kasbah is the second largest river in Morocco.

Rabat – Amnesty International has issued a statement to condemn the arrest of journalist Hajar Raissouni. On Friday, September 6, the NGO called on Moroccan authorities to immediately release the journalist. “The Moroccan authorities must immediately release and drop all charges against journalist Hajar Raissouni, who has been accused of having an abortion and having sex outside of marriage,” Amnesty International said. The journalist, who works for Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, will stand trial on September 9 for illegal abortion and sexual relations outside marriage. NGO stated that the arrest of Hajar is unjust. “The arrest of Hajar Raissouni and four others is completely unjust and these allegations are an outrageous invasion of her privacy,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. Morayef said that Raissouni’s case is a “stark reminder of the urgent need to repeal Morocco’s laws criminalizing sex outside marriage and abortion.” Morocco, a Muslim country, criminalizes both abortion and sex outside marriage. The NGO, however, is calling for Morocco to change this law to give women the freedom to make their “own sexual and reproductive decisions.” Police also arrested the doctor and his two assistants for practicing and participation in abortion. Raissouni’s case divided public opinion. While some expressed concerns about traditional Fatiha marriage, others expressed sympathy and denounced the campaign of defamation against the journalist. Amnesty International wrote that the journalist recently conducted a set of interviews with Ahmed Zefzafi,  the father of Hirak Rif activist Nasser Zefzafi. The NGO added that some of the Raisssoun’s work was critical of Moroccan authorities. Morocco’s public prosecutor at Rabat’s Court of First Instance, however, refuted that Raissouni’s arrest was linked to her profession. “The legal proceedings against a journalist, who was arrested recently along with others including a physician, are not related to her profession but are based on facts linked to abortion,” said the public prosecutor on Thursday, September 5.

Rabat – The Head of the Government’s individual meetings with the leaders of the majority parties are ongoing.  The Party of Justice and Development (PJD), headed by Saad Eddine El Othmani, has been pressuring the head of government to keep the party’s current majority. According to the Assabah daily’s September 6 issue, some PJD members have warned El Othmani against making concessions that would reduce the party’s majority in the government.  The party’s reaction is allegedly due to the Socialist Union of Popular Forces’ (USFP) bid for influence over more government departments.  However, PJD Islamists are hoping that the presence of parties in government ministries remains proportionate to each party’s number of seats in Parliament.  This means that a party with 30 parliament representatives should not be able to govern more departments than a 100-representative party. El Othmani has not yet discussed with party leaders the new organization of the government, says Assabah newspaper. Even though the daily considers that the sovereign ministries (Interior, foreign affairs, Justice and Islamic affairs) will not be affected by the changes, the USFP suggested which ministries should be canceled.  The Ministry of Higher Education, for example, could be removed from the government as Moroccan universities will be autonomous, while vocational training is expected to be assigned to the Ministry of Employment. The political parties are expected to choose the new ministers based on merit. The head of government has emphasized the need to provide competent profiles who focus on fieldwork and who can take over the priority issues, starting with the social issue, says LesEco.

Rabat – The case of Hajar Raissouni is believed to be the most topical this week with the journalist’s plight prompting sympathy from public figures, citizens, and journalists. The journalist, who works for the Arabic-speaking newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, is facing charges of “illegal sexual relations resulting in pregnancy and illegal abortion.” The journalist is “married” to a Sudanese university professor through a traditional marriage called in Morocco a “Fatiha marriage.”   Raissouni and her “husband” were waiting for documents from the Sudanese embassy to formalize the union. The couple was expected to celebrate their official wedding in two weeks. Penal code 454 stipulates that sexual relations outside marriage are punishable by arrest and imprisonment for up to two years. The publicization of Raissouni’s case has prompted a national debate on both the validity of Fatiha marriages, and the ethics of abortion. Fatiha marriage controversy  Fatiha marriage, a religious marriage ceremony conducted without a written contract is still common in Morocco, especially in rural areas. However, Morocco’s family code, or Moudawana, stipulates that a marriage contract is necessary for the legal recognition of a marriage.  Article 16 of the family code says that a “marriage contract is the accepted legal proof of marriage.” The same article states that “if for reasons of force majeure the marriage contract was not officially registered in due time, the court may take into consideration all legal evidence and expertise.” Last February the Ministry of Justice issued a statement in which it announced that Article 16 of the Family Code clarifies that a legal contract is the only document accepted to prove a marriage. The ministry also stipulated that there is a limited transitional period for citizens who have not yet documented their marriage contract to avoid legal proceedings. Why is a  Fatiha marriage no longer a safe option?  Morocco World News asked Mohamed Samir, fqih an expert in Islamic Law. The situation called for the perspective of Islamic, academic, and legal experts as well as activists. President of the national coordination of mosques Samir spoke with MWN on Thursday, September 5. He emphasized that marriage in fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence] is valid if it meets several conditions. These conditions include consent, mahr or dowry, and witnesses. The Islamic expert who chatted with MWN on Thursday, September 5, emphasized that marriage in fiqh or Islamic jurisprudence is valid if it meets several conditions, including consent, mahr or the mandatory payment, and witnesses. “What I mean by consent is not the contract, but it is the fact that both parties should mutually accept the marriage,” Samir said. The fqih, however, warned against the traditional marriage as it is against the law. “Marriage should be documented. It is the right way to preserve rights. Think about children,” he said Documenting the marriage give the wife legal security, meaning that she would have rights should the husband ever think of abandoning the marriage. “What if the wife is pregnant. What if the husband wants to leave her? Even if there were witnesses, the wife and her family would face problems especially after the baby is born.” “People should really think about the circumstances of such marriages. You should think about what is going to happen later before it happens. Get over traditions, any marriage should be documented,” he added.  The issue of  Fatiha marriage is fully linked to both abortion and other social issues, including single mothers.  Bouchra Abdou, an activist, feminist, and president of Tahadi Center, told Morocco World News that Fatiha marriage is still a common issue in Morocco. “Unfortunately, Morocco is still experiencing this phenomenon, which is categorically rejected,” she said. Abdou added that it is necessary to raise awareness about this issue, emphasizing that married people should definitely document their marriage, especially if there are children. “Even if there are witnesses to the Fatiha marriage, what if the woman gets pregnant?” she wondered, emphasizing that this would lead to other problems. “In this case, there will be other issues, including the fact that there should be legal proof of paternity in order to get papers for the baby after he or she is born.” Lawyer Hafida Maksaoui told MWN that the law is very firm regarding the Fatiha marriage. Publicization  Despite sharing concerns on the Fatiha marriage situation, Abdouu strongly condemns the campaign some internet users and local media launched against journalist Hajar Raissouni. Both online commentators and media outlets have gone too far in condemning and publicizing Raissouni’s case, the feminist said. “Raissouni is free to do whatever she wants. I call on people who attacked her to respect personal lives and the privacy of others,” she added. Like Abdou, the Union of Moroccan Press also condemned the publicization and the defamation campaign launched against Raissouni. The union called on all journalists and national media to respect the ethics of journalism and respect her and her innocence until she is proven guilty. The spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, also warned local media and journalists not to publicize Raissouni’s case.  It is her body Feminist Bouchra Abdou condemned the defamation campaign against Raissouni, especially the “heinous” comments the journalist received after reports of medical certificate indicating that she had frequently undergone abortions was circulated. “It is a matter of personal choice, even if it is true. It is her right to do whatever she wants with herself,” Abdou said. Abdou added that people should really respect the privacy of others. If it is not a forced relationship, it is no one’s business but the couple’ss. The feminist also recalled that the fight to legalize abortion in Morocco continues. “What if a victim is raped and pregnancy occurs? What if the victim does not want the baby or she cannot financially take care of the baby?” she asked. She added that abortion is a better solution that having women throwing their babies in trash bins. Article 453 in Morocco’s penal code stipulates that abortion is not punishable if it is practiced to preserve the mother’s physical health in case of a medical threat. In this case, abortion can be openly practiced with the spouse’s authorization. It is both punishable for the doctor and the patient. Moroccan feminists and activists have been campaigning against the law, calling for the legalization of abortion. In April, Moroccan Alternative Movement for Individual Freedoms (MALI) led a protest, chanting slogans such as “my body, my rules” to defend their view on abortion “We consider that the repressive legislation that criminalizes abortion is a grave violation of women’s rights,” MALI stated in a press release following the protest. The Moroccan government agreed in 2016 to change the law to also legalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, situations where the mother has serious mental health issues, or when the fetus has a serious illness or malformation. However, since then, the Parliament has taken no steps to change the law.

Rabat – Morocco’s Office Cherifien de Phosphates (OCP) and the Ghanaian government have signed an agreement to build a fertilizer plant in Ghana by 2024. The agreement is an essential component of OCP’s South-South or intra-African venture, in relation with the “Royal vision” to not only be a regional and continental leader in terms of agricultural output, but also as a fulfillment of the urge to be an indispensable party in the pan-African vision to reach food security and stability. In a statement to MAP, Morocco’s official news outlet, OCP Africa director Karim Lofti Senhadji said that the agreement was yet another success in the OCP Africa story. Since its founding in February 2016, Senhadji recalled, OCP’s Africa-centered vision has emerged as a vital, reliable partner for African governments in their shared goal of reaching food self-sufficiency in individual African countries and across the continent. In addition to signing an array of cooperation deals with a number of African countries to build fertilizer plants, OCP is training local farmers in modern agricultural techniques, or providing local markets with quality fertilizers and other agricultural inputs adapted to the types of soil in their regions. As has been the case with other agreements between OCP and other governments on the continent—most recently Ethiopia and Nigeria—the goal of the deal with Ghana is to assist the West African country in its food security aspirations. This includes self-sufficiency in terms of consumption as well as an eye, in the long-term, to exporting a number of crops specific to Ghanaian soil. “Based primarily on Ghanaian and Moroccan raw materials, that is gas and phosphate, this plant will have a production capacity of 1 million tonnes” of fertilizers, Senhadji explained. He said the coming months will be a period of preparation for the final project of building the fertilizer plant. The preparation period will include, among others, sessions of orientation and training for local farmers, as well as cartography missions to determine the type of fertilizers and other agricultural inputs compatible with different types of soil across Ghana. The news comes as OCP continues to assert its continental leadership. From the outset of its African venture, OCP has been adamant, in line with Morocco’s increasing visibility in African affairs, to be the driving force in what it hopes will be a “green revolution” in Africa. The company’s efforts in that regard have not gone unnoticed. Recently, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari was full of praise for OCP and Morocco for boosting Nigeria’s agriculture output and bringing Nigerian agriculture to “the next level.” “We are taking our focus on agriculture to the next level. In our first term, we partnered with Morocco to revive abandoned fertilizer blending plants across the country,” said President Buhari.

Rabat – The popular Moroccan singer, Adil El Miloudi, has been under fire for his pro-violence statements. “He who does not beat up his wife is not a real man,”  El Miloudi confidently stated during his appearance on the Kotbi Night show broadcast on June 29 on Chada TV. The video recently resurfaced on social networks, prompting a widespread backlash. The controversy comes only a few months after the High Authority for Audiovisual Communication (HACA) suspended Radio Mars host, Adil El Omari, for misogynistic remarks.  The host told a female football fan that she’d better “take care of her cooking, watch Choumicha’ s shows (famous Moroccan cooking show) and leave the national team alone.” El Miloudi further added that he still beats his wife and that he was arrested once for it in Spain. “She told the cops that I did not do anything to her; they released me 24 hours later,” he explained. The singer also stated that “this is normal in Morocco; everyone can do whatever they want with their wife, hit her, kill her…”.  Imad Kotbi, the host of the Kotbi Night TV show, told Huffpost Maghreb that Chada TV was not yet under HACA’s supervision at the time of broadcast, possibly implying that the Chada TV will not be sanctioned. Several  Internet users took to their keyboards to condemn El Miloudi’s statement. Some demanded the opening of a judicial investigation as well as a boycott of the singer on all platforms. Others called on women’s rights associations to intervene. The singer is known for his sexist and threatening remarks. In July 2015, through his song “Kifach Houma Mahadrouch” (“Why didn’t they talk?”), he threatened director Nabil Ayouch and actress Loubna Abidar after the release of their controversial movie “Much Loved”.  “Loubna Abidar, today, you are in danger. Everyone knows what you did, it will bring you only misfortune,” sang El Miloudi referring to Abidar’s sex scenes in the movie. The song continued, “Nabil Ayouch will be arrested, and we will see what “Much Loved” means then.” In March 2018, El Miloudi went live on Facebook defending the singer Saad Lamjarred, who was, at the time, suspected of rape for the second time in two years. One Twitter user replied to El Miloudi’s video saying, “El Miloudi must be banned from TV, radio, social networks, shows, and concerts. He is a real public danger.”  In a more recent post, the user demanded if “any explanations have been asked from the channel, producer, and broadcaster?”  The commenter also stated, “God only knows how many times, they rebroadcast this sh**;  with his 400,000 fans, no wonder we will have 200,000 women beaten in Morocco 10 years from now.” “I am scandalized by these toxic words. Now, I think we need to mobilize so that all Moroccan radio and TV stations ban this person,” added another user.

Rabat – Three Moroccan startups won EDF Pulse Africa Tour Morocco’s prizes. The EDF Pulse Africa Tour Morocco is a competition aimed at discovering and supporting African innovators in the energy field. Among the lucky startups, the Moroccan start-up Azolis was named winner of the 1st EDF Pulse Africa Tour Morocco in the Off-Grid power generation category. The startup developed batteries incorporating a BMS (Battery Management System) with increased performance,  tripled lifetime, and improved resistance to dust and high temperatures. These small batteries make it possible to improve the deployment of on-grid and off-grid solar kits systems in remote locations. The startup Winsol won the ‘Coup de Coeur’ prize (off-grid power generation category). Winsol offers a hybrid electric generator system between photovoltaic panels and wind turbines. The use of two renewable energies at once produces high-efficiency electrical energy even under unfavorable conditions. The ‘Coup de Pouce’ prize went to Farasha Systems (Production of electrical uses and services category). Farasha Systems provides developers and operators of renewable energy plants with solar-powered drones for plants’ inspection. The drones are equipped with a hardware system gathering data from solar and wind fields. These data are classified, processed, archived, and displayed on a digital platform allowing plant operators to manage their operating and maintenance costs optimally, while also contributing to a significant reduction in the ecological footprint. The event was jointly organized by EDF Group and Emlyon Casablanca business school campus. The challenge, first launched in 2017, aims to support the entrepreneurial dynamic in Africa with two objectives, namely identifying potential partners and supporting innovation by involving local entrepreneurs in the development of innovative offers. Mario Bernardo, head of North Africa zone and president of the EDF Pulse Africa jury said that “this Moroccan edition has revealed the huge potential of start-up companies in the country.” “We are proud to encourage these Moroccan entrepreneurs, who have been able to set up ambitious projects whose foundations will be part of the energy solutions of tomorrow,” he added.

Rabat – A fire that broke out on Thursday, August 29, has burned up 470 hectares of trees and land in the Achacha-Tassift forest in northern Morocco, near Chefchaouen. The fire destroyed maritime pines, Aleppo pines, junipers, and evergreen oaks in the Talassemtane National Park east of Chefchaouen, according to Abdelaziz Hajjaji, the regional director of water, forests, and the fight against desertification (HCEFLCD) for the Tangier-Tetouan region. Hajjaji told state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the trees made up about half of the burned vegetation. The other half was made up of “herbs.” The area is known for its fields of marijuana plants. As many as 300 professionals and ordinary citizens have fought to contain the fire, which spread because of high temperatures and windy conditions. As of Wednesday, September 4, they were still fighting the blaze. The Royal Moroccan Air Forces sent in eight aircraft to help control the fire. Hajjaji noted that the region’s terrain has made fighting the fire difficult.

Rabat – In a bid to benefit more from skilled migrants, while consolidating its reputation for easing socio-professional integration for migrants, Canada is planning to appeal to more international, French speaking students. If, as a Moroccan student, you are proficient in French and you plan to pursue your academic training in Canada and subsequently launch your professional career in the North American country, there is good news for you. Canada is embracing students with similar profiles, as it plans to open its schools and labor market to a larger pool of young, French-speaking candidates. In an announcement published on its official website on August 30, the Canadian government declared its goal of attracting more students from Morocco and Senegal. The move, the announcement explained, is part of the government’s policy of appealing to thousands of French-speaking students. “Canada is making the Student Direct Stream (SDS) available to international students coming from Senegal and Morocco, starting September 9, 2019,” began the statement by the Canadian government. “By providing fast, reliable processing of study permit applications, Canada is better equipped to compete in attracting the best and the brightest from around the world.” The announcement comes six months after Canada unveiled its Francophone Immigration Strategy, a policy designed to attract Francophone students to Canada as a “top destination” for studies and socio-professional integration. “Expanding this faster and more efficient application process to prospective students from Senegal and Morocco supports the Government’s Francophone Immigration Strategy to encourage more young French speakers to choose to study in Canada,” noted the statement. With its effectively bilingual professional and academic environments, as well as its global, solid reputation for being a successful model of multiculturalism, Canada takes enormous pride in leading the global dance for intercultural dialogue and exchanges on a daily basis between citizens or (international) students with different social, economic, or religious backgrounds. For international students, the government’s announcement suggested, with Canada’s multicultural reputation in mind, the North American country presents unique learning and professional and academic growth opportunities. The country offers international students “a high-quality international education and employment in their field of study once they graduate, ” in addition to providing ample opportunities to secure “permanent residence through Express Entry.” The encouraging statements from the Canadian government are not empty, outsized marketing slogans, the type that often bend the daily experience of international students just to attract even more of them. The positive, laudatory appraisal suggested by the government’ announcement has precedence. On August 13, OECD reported that “Canada has the most comprehensive and elaborate migration system.” The OECD report elaborated, “Canada boasts the largest share of highly educated immigrants in the OECD as well as high levels of public acceptance of migration. In addition, it is seen as an appealing country of destination for potential migrants.” Commenting on the rationale behind Canada’s policy to attract students from Morocco and Senegal, Ahmed Hussen, Canada’s Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, put forth the country’s hope, and goal of cementing its global leadership on matters of successful migration and multicultural policies. Hussen echoed OECD’s finding: “Canada’s diverse, welcoming society, high-quality educational institutions and opportunities to work or immigrate after graduation have made Canada a leading destination of choice for students from around the world. “In expanding the Student Direct Stream to a more diverse range of prospective students, we’re enhancing the tremendous cultural, social and economic benefits that international students provide.”

Rabat – Five days after Hajar Raissouni’s arrest, on August 31, new evidence has emerged causing more controversy around the case. A medical report, signed by Dr. Samir Bargach from Rabat’s Ibn-Sina Hospital, confirms that Raissouni underwent an abortion. Additionally, the medical report claims that this pregnancy and abortion was not Raissouni’s first. According to the report she had undergone a previous abortion six months prior to the alleged procedure that prompted her arrest. However, newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, Raissouni’s employer, drew attention to inconsistencies within the report. According to the medical report, “there is no trace of a tenaculum being used on Hajar’s uterus”. However, the newspaper noted that “abortion is impossible without the use of a tenaculum”. The new evidence will be presented in the next hearing session, on September 9. Until then, Raissouni, along with the other defendants in the case, will remain in custody. Raissouni’s arrest dates back to Saturday, August 31. According to Raissouni’s narrative, relayed by Akhbar Al Yaoum, six undercover police officers surrounded her and her fiance, a Sudanese researcher and activist, right after they left a gynecologist’s office in Agdal, Rabat. The police officers then proceeded to take them both back to the doctor’s office, saying that Raissouni had undergone an abortion, which she denies. Raissouni, her fiance, and the medical staff were all arrested on a range of charges related to illegal abortions. The defense of the doctor mentioned that the medical check-up done on the journalist when in custody proved that she had not undergone an abortion. “Expertise at the University Hospital Ibn-Sina, at the request of the judicial police, confirmed Raissouni’s medical state,” according to Al Yaoum 24. Online backlash The arrest of Hajar Raissouni sparked a lot of controversy, with Moroccan people divided on the motives behind the journalist’s arrest. Some Moroccan internet users have speculated that the charges against Raissouni are based on a “hidden agenda”. Raissouni’s uncle, Ahmed Raissouni, is the former head of the Movement of Unity and Reform, a branch of the Justice and Development Party (PJD). The arrest also comes about one year and a half after Taoufik Bouachrine, the founder of Akhbar Al Yaoum where Raissouni works, was arrested for “adultery” and “human trafficking”. On the other hand, while some Moroccans defend the importance of anti-abortion laws, others believe that it is a personal affair that shouldn’t have been made public in the first place. Toute l’affaire de #HajarRaissouni me rend dingue, le maroc se transforme en une dictature à la nord-coréenne. Nous sommes d’accord qu’il y a une thérorie du #complot derière cette histoire. — Stendhalienne (@stendhalienne) September 5, 2019  “The whole case of Hajar Raissouni makes me mad. Morocco is turning into a North Korea style dictatorship. We agree that there is a conspiracy theory behind this story,” posted one twitter user. Tout mon soutien à #HajarRaissouni, injustement arrêtée pour soit-disant “relations sexuelles hors mariage” et “avortement illégal”. Tout laisse penser qu’il s’agit d’une arrestation politique. S’il vous plaît, lisez ce thread, elle a besoin de soutien. https://t.co/Ga6732Qjgw — Rachid l’instit (@rachidowsky13) September 4, 2019 
“All my support goes to Hajar Raissouni, arrested unjustly for ‘out-of-marriage sex’ and ‘illegal abortion’. Everything leads to think that it is a political arrest.”, commented another twitter user. Je refuse de savoir si #HajarRaissouni a véritablement subi un IVG ou pas. Je m’en fous de le savoir. C’est sa vie privée. La presse doit pouvoir dénoncer ces pratiques, et parler clairement d’un 2 poids 2 mesures sur l’application de ces lois, à la base très contestées — Othman Naciri (@othmannaciri) September 5, 2019 
“I refuse to know if Hajar Raissouni underwent an abortion or not. I don’t care to know. It is her personal life,” reads a tweet. Abortion in Morocco This arrest also reawakened the public debate about abortion laws in Morocco. It is illegal to carry out an unauthorized abortion as a doctor, and for a pregnant woman to undergo the unauthorized procedure. However, article 453 of Morocco’s penal code stipulates that abortion is not punishable if it is practiced to preserve the mother’s health in case of a medical threat. In this case, abortion can be openly practiced with the spouse’s authorization. In 2016, the Moroccan government agreed to legalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, situations where the mother has serious mental health issues, or when the fetus has a serious illness or malformation. However, these changes have not yet been implemented.

Rabat – A report published by Afrobarometer, on February 14, 2019, shows that a large proportion of the Moroccan population is not aware of climate change and how it affects the environment. The report was based on a study completed by interviewing a diverse sample of Moroccans. The results of the study show that 4 out of 10 Moroccans (39%) have never heard about climate change. Climate change awareness is higher within formally educated Moroccans. The climate change awareness rate goes from 17%, for people who never went to school, to 85% for those who received a university level education. About half the interviewees agreed that droughts (52%) and floods (54%) have become much more intense over the past 10 years. When those who were aware of climate change before the interview were asked about the reasons behind it, more than half (55%) believed climate change happens because of bad weather, and only 41% traced it back to man-made factors. As for the ability of ordinary civilians to reduce the effects of climate change, 36% of people who are aware of the phenomenon believed that there is nothing one person can do. Afrobarometer is a research project launched in 1999 and includes 36 African countries. It aims to measure people’s awareness and positions concerning different world issues, and then provide the results of the popular studies to decision-makers. The study was completed in collaboration with the Moroccan company Global for Survey and Consulting. Although popular awareness about climate change is relatively low in Morocco, Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2019 ranked Morocco 2nd out of all countries. Morocco ranks first in Africa and the MENA region. The index takes into consideration “Greenhouse Gases” (GHG) emission, renewable energy, energy use, and the climate policy. Compared to 2018, Morocco climbed one rank in the index this year (3rd in 2018). This high ranking is mainly ascribed to Morocco’s different ecological initiatives and projects, including Morocco’s “Green Plan”, Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA) initiative, “Durable Oases” initiative, “Noor” project, and the “Blue Belt” project.

Rabat – Four months into the UN’s deafening silence on the prospects of its Western Sahara agenda after the show’s main performer threw in the towel, Western Sahara is once again the notable absentee in UN Security Council’s scheduled meetings for September. As the UNSC announced its September schedule, the talking points for the upcoming security discussions do not feature the Western Sahara conflict. The glaring omission will likely revive circulating suggestions about the visible stasis that has set in among UN diplomatic circles and informed Western Sahara observers since the untimely resignation of Horst Kohler as personal envoy. Included in the UNSC’ schedule for September are security concerns as varied as the Libyan crisis, the Syrian predicament, and the global migration crisis and related topics such as human trafficking, among other global security challenges.  The lingering Western Sahara conflict, one of the most complex territorial disputes to date, was conspicuous only by its absence from the schedule. The only possible, vague and arcane reference to Western Sahara is perhaps the agenda for a September 26 press briefing: “Peace and Security in Africa: Partnership to maintain regional peace and security.”  At best, and provided the press briefing manages to circuitously touch upon Western Sahara, this reads more like a face-saving move, so telling a is the sidelining of Western Sahara-linked discussions just a month before the expiry date of the UN Peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO). While the omission is not particularly a cause for prolonged contention or wild speculations, as is often the case in this multilayered dispute, the news comes at an emotionally charged conjuncture in the progress of the UN-led negotiations.  A major setback Last May, Kohler surprisingly resigned from his post as the UN Secretary General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara. Among Western Sahara observers of different—sometimes exclusive—political and ideological persuasions, Kohler’s two-year tenure was largely seen as a notable success.  In convincing all the four parties, especially Algeria and Mauritania, to be full-throated participants in the political process, Kohler helped gather a momentum that has escaped other UN envoys in almost three decades.  Even for a territorial dispute as historically tangled and geopolitically convoluted as the Western Sahara case, there was palpable hope that it was only a matter of time before the Kohler-moderated process achieved something the international community has failed to even come close to imagining for over a decade. Where a number of his predecessors—James Baker and Christopher Ross, for example—came across as biased and favoring one side of the conflict, Kohler successfully gained the trust of all the parties. Or at least that was largely the impression, particularly buttressed by the series of the recently held Geneva meetings. On multiple occasions, either in his written reports to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres or in press statements from his office, Kohler repeatedly made it clear that the point of the settlement process was to devise a working formula for a mutually acceptable and politically negotiated solution. As a result, words and concepts such as realism, pragmatism, political feasibility, and compromise-based solution, emerged as the founding principles of the UN-led process under the German diplomat.  “There is no doubt that Kohler’s sudden departure is a major setback for the UN political process to help the parties to the conflict to achieve a mutually acceptable political solution,” MWN’s editor-in-chief Samir Bennis wrote in May amid the what-is-next-saturated speculations after Kohler announced his resignation.  Bennis continued, this time throwing in an even more pertinent observation: “Kohler breathed new life into the political process and thanks to his charisma and his gravitas, he enjoyed the relative trust of all parties. With his resignation, the political process is likely to return to square one. As an immediate result, it is likely that there will be no roundtables until early next year or even later.” Who will replace Kohler? Beyond Kohler’s formally announced reasons for resigning (his health conditions), there have been alternative suggestions for why the German “really left” amid perceived momentum. But for all the resulting contention, more often than not informed by observers’ stance on the Western Sahara dossier, a resounding agreement among observers has been that, for better or worse, replacing Kohler is set to be a pain in the neck for the UN-led process.  A direct consequence of Kohler’s resignation, some specialists recently told Moroccan outlet le 360, is that the UN’s agenda will not feature Western Sahara until October of this year, when the UNSC will once again meet to deliver on whether to renew the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara.  “The past 100 days have seen a breakdown in this [Western Sahara] matter,” political scientist Mustapha Sehimi told le 360. “There is a crisis of perspective.”
 Questions abound as MINURSO’s mandate reaches its end. Who will replace Kohler? Will Kohler’s replacement be an American or a European? Or should UNSG Guterres appoint an African or Asian diplomat as his personal envoy?  Amid this uncertainty, there seems to emerge a picture of “back to square one” or even “business as usual,” giving the known ideologized voting, or the alliance-inspired politicking during UNSC proceedings.  By all perceptible evidence, maintaining the momentum Kohler achieved in two years will prove an even more daunting task for the next personal envoy than was the case when the German diplomat took over what mostly looked like mission impossible, a doomed and hostility-beset dossier with scant hope of resolution in at least a decade.

Rabat – Moroccan internet users slammed Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera after it posted the wrong photo with a piece about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The news outlet used a photo of the father of detained Hirak Rif activist Nasser Zefzafi, Ahmed Zefzafi. On September 4, Al Jazeera Mubasher Channel shared a post about Netanyahu facing backlash after he gave a ceremonial address at the Haram-al Ibhrami, or the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The visit of the Israeli prime minister sparked outrage among Palestinians. The news outlet did not notice its mistake until Moroccan internet users called for Al Jazeera to apologize to the father of Nasser Zefzafi.   The photo shows Ahmed Zefzafi in Al Hoceima on his house’s rooftop. In the photo Zefzafi is putting black flags on his rooftop for Eid Al Adha, the feast of sacrifice, which Morocco celebrated on August 12.  Several Moroccan internet users called on Al Jazeerra to apologize to Ahmed Zefzafi.  “The photo is from Morocco’s al Hoceima of the father of  activist Nasser Zefzafi, who received 20-year prison sentence after he called for a hospital and a university in the city.” Another wrote, “it is better to fix the photo and provide  medical glasses to Al Jazeera employees for free.” This is not the first time Al Jazeera has made such a mistake. In February,  Al Jazeera news channel also mistook the controversial Moroccan actress Loubna Abidar for the granddaughter of the late Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein. Al Jazeera posted a picture of Abidar on its official Facebook page on Thursday, September 4, accompanying the photograph with general information on Hussein’s granddaughter.

Rabat – Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska has reiterated Madrid’s determination to further strengthen diplomatic relations with Morocco. The Spanish official held talks on Wednesday, September 4, in Rabat with his Moroccan counterpart Abdelouafi Laftit. The talks focused on the means to reinforce cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking, terrorism, and irregular migration. Morocco and Spain maintain strong diplomatic ties with regular cooperation in common interests, especially migration. Migration is an ongoing issue for both countries. The ever increasing pressure urged Madrid to increase its activism in favor of Morocco at the European Union. On top of the €140 million promised by the EU, Spain also approved an additional  €32 million grant to Morocco to help with border control. The Spanish official spoke with the press following his meeting with Laftit about the “direct” and “sincere” cooperation between the two countries in several security fields. He mentioned Morocco’s collaboration with Spain in the fight against drug trafficking, terrorism, and irregular migration. Laftit also spoke to the press about the “excellent” relations between the two countries, emphasizing that decisions affecting the Rabat and Madrid “are made in close cooperation” between both sides. The Spanish official recalled that Morocco’s efforts, in close cooperation with Spain, resulted in a  45% decline in the number of irregular migrants who arrived in Spain. Grande Marlaska seized the opportunity to express his satisfaction with Morocco’s efforts in the fight against irregular immigration and its policies to regularize the status of more than 50,000 migrants from sub-Saharan countries. The Spanish officials also extolled the success of the Spanish-Moroccan cooperation in the fight against terrorism. He said that the cooperation and coordination between the security services of both countries helped dismantle several terrorist networks and prevent many operations and criminal acts. “The achievements made in this area are ‘tremendous,’” he said. In July, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that  Morocco “is today one of the most important partners in Spain. The close relationship that unites us is articulated around a dense network of shared interests to which my government has devoted priority attention in the last year.” Sanchez said visited Morocco in November and December 2018. During the visits, the Spanish prime minister reiterated his country’s determination to further strengthen ties with Morocco.

Rabat – The World Economic Forum has published its Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019. Morocco took 1st place in the Maghreb region and 2nd in North Africa. In the Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) overall rankings, Morocco came 66th with a score of 3.9 exceeding the average in the MENA region, but barely over the global average. Spain, France, and Germany all took 1st place with a score of 5.4. Morocco dropped one rank compared to 2017. However, the report labeled Morocco as the most improved country in Business Environment and Air Transport Infrastructure ‘pillars’. Morocco was the top scorer in the Prioritization of Travel &amp; Tourism (T&amp;T). The kingdom ranked 26th globally thanks to government prioritization of T&amp;T (30th), availability of data (16th) and above regional average effectiveness in tourism marketing (41st). The same applies to Natural Resources, in which Morocco was also the top scorer. The country ranked “63rd globally thanks to the degree to which natural assets are a reason for tourist arrivals (52nd) and digital demand (27th).” International Openness In the regional analysis section, the TTCI report mentioned how “the region (MENA) is plagued by geopolitical tensions, instability, and conflict.”  “Security concerns also play a role in why MENA members are some of the most restrictive when it comes to international openness,” explained the report, excluding only Qatar, Oman, and Morocco for making significant improvements.  Subregional analysis (North Africa) The TTCI report stated that although “all four members of the North Africa subregion increased their TTCI scores over 2017, Morocco demonstrates North Africa’s slowest improvement in TTCI performance.” The report found that Egypt (65th) is the subregion’s top scorer and its largest T&amp;T economy. The country is also MENA’s most improved scorer. Morocco, on the other hand, is a close second to Egypt when it comes to overall competitiveness. The kingdom boasts the MENA region’s top TTCI scores on natural resources (63rd), North Africa’s best enabling environment (71st), infrastructure (69th), and tourist service infrastructure (78th). The TTCI 2019 report The 2019 edition of the Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report benchmarks the T&amp;T competitiveness of 140 economies and measures “the set of factors and policies that enable the sustainable development of the Travel &amp; Tourism (T&amp;T) sector, which in turn, contributes to the development and competitiveness of a country.” The 2019 TTCI assesses the 140 economies in four subindexes: Enabling Environment, T&amp;T Policy and Enabling Conditions, Infrastructure, and Natural and Cultural Resources. Each sub-index is composed of 14 pillars and 90 individual indicators, distributed among the different pillars.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial  Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled on Thursday, September 5, a 5-member terrorist cell linked to ISIS in Nador and Berkan, two cities in Eastern Morocco. A statement from the Ministry of Interior said that the suspects are aged between 27 and 41. BCIJ also seized electronic devices and knives during the operation. A preliminary investigation shows that the members of the cell planned to join the camps of a pro-ISIS network in the Sahel in the Sub-Sahara region before plotting terror acts targeting sensitives sites in Morocco. The situation in the Sahel region has become a primary concern not only for Morocco but also for international powers such as the US. In August, Army General Stephen T. Townsend, the commander of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) said that the US shares Morocco’s concern on the worrying situation in the Sahel region. Morocco has been warning that the region has become a fertile ground for terrorists active in the region. “Head of BCIJ Abdelhak Khiame also emphasized the importance of shared responsibility and cooperation to tackle the surge of terrorists in the region. Considering Morocco as a strong partner for the US on counterterrorism, Townsend said, “We are working with all of our African partners and international partners to try to solve this problem” The statement added that the mastermind of the cell had become an expert in making explosives intended for use in terror attacks. BCIJ put the suspects in custody for further investigation. Thursday’s operation comes after the BCIJ dismantled a four-member terrorist cell in Al Haouz, a province in the Marrakech-Safi region. Morocco’s CCIJ conducted several similar operations as part of Morocco’s strategy to counter terrorism in the country and in the whole region.

Rabat – Prior to competing in international championships, European clubs announce their selection of players on social networks. Ajax Amsterdam tweeted their selection on September 2. ❌❌❌ all over the world! 🌍 Wish our boys good luck in the comments…📮 pic.twitter.com/sruWQn47Ml — AFC Ajax (@AFCAjax) September 2, 2019  The selections of the various continental confederations are preparing to play the qualifiers of the World Cup 2022 (Africa and Asia), and the Euro 2020 (Europe).  The Dutch club posted on its Twitter account an infographic of the world map with a photo of each player in front of his home country. The map, however, showed a line separating Morocco from Western Sahara. Some Internet users replied to Ajax’ tweet, pointing out the separation line and demanding its rectification.  One user posted a zoomed version of the map asking the club for “a small correction here please.” Another user replied with a corrected map labeling it, “my country.” Een klein correctie hier AUB 👇 pic.twitter.com/xdjmsMPhIb — Hassan (@Hassanon_) September 4, 2019  My country 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 pic.twitter.com/GOipJUxlSh — Lahcen Bensmain (@bensmain_lahcen) September 2, 2019  This is not the first time that a European club posts a divided map of the Kingdom. During the last African Cup of Nations, AC Milan wanted to wish good luck to its player Franck Kessie in Morocco vs Ivory Coast match. However, the club put a Moroccan map without the Sahara. Facing a wave of negative comments from Moroccans, the Italian club removed the controversial Facebook post. In December 2018, Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) also tweeted a divided Moroccan map. The map showed the football clubs that qualified for the eighth round of the Zayed Champions Cup including Morocco’s Raja Casablanca (RCA). Contacted by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), the UAFA said that posting the map was an “unintentional mistake,” and deleted the tweet.

Rabat –  Brazil has reiterated its  support for Morocco’s efforts in finding a mutually acceptable political solution to the Western Sahara conflict.  The Brazilian Federal Senate adopted a motion in favor of Morocco’s territorial integrity, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The Senate adopted the motion in support of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan by a large majority, reflecting its respect for Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over its southern provinces in Western Sahara. David Alcolumbre, the Senate speaker, addressed the motion to the Brazilian Foreign Minister  on Wednesday, September 4. The motion was adopted by 62 senators out of a total of 81 and shows Brazil’s support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal. The Autonomy Plan was submitted to the United Nations in 2007  as a consensual and sustainable political solution to the regional conflict over Western Sahara. The motion  added that the Latin country Brazil’s support for the autonomy proposal “‘will be consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions as well as with the position of the international community for the search of a realistic and consensual political solution to this regional conflict.” MAP reported that Brazilian senators expressed their support for Morocco’s cause and autonomy initiative that “respects the territorial integrity and the national sovereignty of Morocco.” In June, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Brazil as part of his tour to several Latin American countries. The visit is in line with Morocco’s strategy to increase its involvement in the region to gain support for its position on the Western Sahara conflict. During the visit, Brazil’s foreign minister  Ernesto Araujo said that his country is determined to back Morocco’s efforts towards a “realistic” political solution to end the conflict. In May 2018, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies adopted, by a large majority, a motion in support of the Moroccan autonomy initiative.

Rabat – Spanish police arrested today, September 4 Moroccan athlete, Jaouad Tougane, for alleged robbery. The athlete was caught in the act four times in the past week, in different shopping centers around the city of Valencia, southeast of Spain. Spanish newspaper Las Provincias reported that the athlete was well known for local police of Valencia. Back in July 2019, Tougane was arrested for the same reason, and then released one day later. “Although he expresses his regret after getting caught by security guards, it is the tenth time that the young Moroccan steals electronics and escapes to sell them later in the streets of Valencia,” explains Las Provincias. “On August 18, the young Moroccan committed two robberies in a few hours in the same shopping center. He stole a Virtual Reality set, then came back the afternoon to steal more electronics,” adds the Spanish newspapers. After his first arrest, Tougane spent one night behind bars, but the police released him the next day. The athlete returned a few days later to the same shopping center where he was arrested and stole clothes and other merchandise to the value of more than €800. The Moroccan athlete could face 6 to 18 months in prison for reoffending. In July, Playas de Castellon Athletics Club expelled Tougane after his involvement in the robberies. Born in Morocco, the 27-year-old athlete has lived in Spain since his childhood. He participated in many athletics competitions. Tougane was the champion of Valencia’s Marathon in 2018. He also participated with Morocco’s national athletics team in the 5000m competitions at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Rabat – On Tuesday, September 3, the host country for the 22nd FIFA World Cup, Qatar, unveiled the official emblem for the football tournament in Doha at 8:22 pm local time. Thousands of spectators witnessed the projection of the emblem on a number of iconic buildings in the country, including Burj Doha, Katara Cultural Village Amphitheatre, the Ministry of Interior, Souq Waqif, and Msheireb and Al Zubarah Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The new emblem was also broadcast on large screens on the world’s most iconic buildings and landmarks, including the Kasbah of the Udayas in Morocco’s capital Rabat. The swooping curves of the emblem represent the undulations of desert dunes, while the unbroken loop depicts both the number 8, indicating the 8 stadiums where matches will be played, and the infinity symbol. “The emblem’s central form takes inspiration from a traditional woolen shawl. During winter months, shawls are worn around the world and in the Arab and Gulf region in particular by a variety of people and in various styles,” said FIFA on its website. FIFA added that “the regionally inspired winter garment also alludes to the tournament’s start dates and the fact that it will be the first FIFA World Cup to be played in November and December.” “The new typeface created to accompany the emblem reimagines traditional Arabic calligraphy in a new, contemporary font, taking inspiration from the region and Asia, and fusing tradition with modernity,” FIFA pointed out.

Rabat – Following the royal speech on Throne Day, a reshuffle of the government has been expected. Some Moroccan News outlets have unveiled Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s prediction for an upcoming government reshuffle. TelQuel Arabic reported that the Head of Government plans to meet separately with heads of each party of the current government. One possible outcome for the coming reshuffle is a slimmed-down government with fewer ministers. Morocco World News contacted Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi for comment. He told MWN that “if any reforms are to be undertaken, it will be solely the decision of the head of government.”  “The reforms will be communicated to the public via the adequate official means,” he added. According to the Arabic-speaking media, the reforms will only be partial as “the government has only one year and a half left.” “It is too short of a period for any minister to be able to tackle files or implement the changes,” added TelQuel’s source. The reforms include possible changes in the government’s composition consisting currently of three poles, social, economic, and industrial. The government could possibly reduce the number of secretaries of state, says the news outlet. Another possibility is the transfer of ministerial positions between political parties. TelQuel Arabic reported that even though the reshuffle is possible, it remains a far fetched option due to the short deadline the government is facing.

Rabat – Nigeria and South Africa may be on the verge of a diplomatic row as Nigerians appeared to be the primary targets of recent waves of anti-immigrant sentiment in Pretoria and Johannesburg, the two biggest cities in South Africa. According to reports, mobs attacked foreign-owned shops and other businesses starting in the late hours of September 1. The violence exacerbated by September 2, with more people joining mobs to vandalize foreign-owned businesses, AFP reported. The recent waves of violence and shop looting come in the wake of reported killings of foreigners, mostly Nigerians, in popular neighborhoods in Johannesburg. The most recent such incident, reported by the BBC in late August, is the death of a Nigerian woman who was allegedly strangled in her hotel room, Nigerian author Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani recently wrote in the BBC’s Letter from Africa series. Nwaubani referred to the events as “animosity between Africa’s two superpowers.” While South Africans think that migrants, especially Nigerians, are “arrogant and don’t know how to talk to people,” she writes, “Nigerians believe that South Africans are simply jealous of us. Of our self confidence, and our ability to thrive and outshine.” Under pressure from Nigerians, who have demanded en masse on social media that the “killings stop,” the Nigerian government has requested that Pretoria take “urgent measures” to end what Nigerian news outlets have portrayed as chilling scenes of xenophobia and negrophobia. On Tuesday, September 3, Nigeria’s President Buhari sent an envoy to South Africa to deliver a message about “Nigeria’s displeasure over the treatment of her people.” Other high-level meetings are expected in the coming days between officials from the two countries. Meanwhile, in response to the scenes of violence in Johannesburg, some Nigerians have taken to the streets to loot South African-owned businesses in the West African country. According to reports, offices of MTN, South Africa’s telecoms giant, bore the bulk of violent protests in Nigeria. The strong sentiments felt by Nigerians in the wake of these events were especially evidenced in the sour language that some Nigerian representatives have used in reference to the events in Pretoria and Johannesburg. “Anarchy” was, for instance, the word Nigeria’s high commission in South Africa used to highlight what it described as South African police’s failure to effectively deal with the violent, xenophobic attacks. The Nigerian ministry of foreign affairs has suggested it is keenly waiting for an explanation from Pretoria, stressing that the West African country is resolved to end what many Nigerians have said is a usual occurrence in South Africa. There have also been reports in the Nigerian press that President Buhari has been advised by his cabinet to consider military action against South Africa. While not as firm and condemnatory as Nigeria, other African countries have also urged Pretoria to take measures to end the violence, but also avoid a repeat of such strong anti-migrants movements. In discussions on social media, citizens from other sub-Saharan African countries have decried “shameless xenophobia” and “scandalous negrophobia” from “black South African brothers.” In a statement, the African Union (AU) condemned “the despicable acts in the strongest terms.” Meanwhile, for all the opprobrium being heaped on the southern African country, authorities in Pretoria are adamant that the recent wave of violence has very little to do with xenophobia and anti-migration sentiments. Bheki Cele, south Africa’s police minister said that “criminality rather than xenophobia” is the primary factor for the “senseless violence.” xenophobia, he added, “is an excuse.”

Rabat – The release of a condemnatory report on the inhumane conditions in the Edhibia prison in the Tindouf camps reflects the growing concern from Sahwaris about the situation in the camps and the failures of the Polisario leadership. On September 3, pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara published a “special investigation, ” criticizing serious human rights violations in the Edhibia prison. The report, entitled , “has the al-Edhibia prison become one of the worst prisons in North Africa?” narrowed its focus to condemning the situation of Sahrawi detainees in the prison. Currently, 58 Sahrawi detainees are being held in the Edhibia prison. The prison has only seven cells and so the 58 prisoners currently incarcerated far exceed its capacity. The report explained that the overpopulation of the jail is in direct contravention of the international standards that Polisario pledged to respect. “The institution belonging to the ‘Sahrawi state’  for many years has been out of the spotlight,” the report said. The seven cells, according to Futuro Sahara, have become overcrowded as some of them cannot accommodate more than six people. “It is one of the dirtiest and ugliest prisons in the region compared to prisons in Mauritania and Algeria, without comparison with Moroccan prisons,” said the condemnatory report. The publication added that the Polisario leadership has forgotten that Edhibia jail is a “prison institution that is supposed to comply with international standards that respect the freedom of prisoners and provide them with some basic rights.” The investigation also condemns the sudden searches that prisoners are subject to three times a week. Isolation and torture The report also drew attention to the use of torture and solitary confinement. “A minor mistake can lead a prisoner to an isolated cell, abuse, physical torture from the gendarmerie. If ever one dies in the prison [ due to torture] there is nothing easier than making it seem like a suicide.” Prisoners are “prevented from going out to the prison recreation space to enjoy the sun. They are also prevented from having sports activities,” reported Futuro Sahara. Prisoners are forbidden from talking to each other, according to the investigative report. They are also kept from contact with the outside world and current affairs. “It is strange to find an educated young man not aware of the word ‘Khashoggi,’” referring to the case of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “For example, one of them [prisoners] still believes that the Mauritanian president is still Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.” “The isolation of inmates in Edhabia prison contravenes international laws.” The investigation warned that oppression might have negative effects on the mental health of prisoners. “The aim of the world’s prison institutions is to reform rather than increasing the number of mentally disturbed people in society.” Silencing protesters Polisario ‘authorities’ are currently holding three Sahwari activists who have no been in prison for more than 74 days. The activists were arrested for taking part in peaceful protests to condemn inhumane conditions and human rights violations in the Tindouf camps. The families of the activists have been protesting the arbitrary arrest of the three activists and have called on Polisario leader, Ibrahim Ghali, to release the activists and explain the charges against them.  This is not the first time that the Polisario Front faces accusations for violations in the camps. Throughout the year, the family of Ahmed El Khalil has been condemning the Polisario Front for its silence on the forced disappearance of their relative who has now been missing for more than 10 years.

Rabat – After its closure at the end of July, the Tarajal II pass reopened its doors. Ceuta’s authorities had indefinitely suspended crossings through Tarajal II starting July 25 to rehabilitate and expand the Spanish side of the border.  As soon as it reopened, Tarajal II registered a higher number of crossings. The transits between Morocco and Ceuta are expected to reach 4,000. Starting September 3, Moroccan and Spanish authorities coordinated in order to better control and manage the porters’ crossings.  El Faro de Ceuta reported that porters crossing the border had to leave their cars due to the construction work carried out on roads on the Spanish side.   Vehicles carrying merchandise, known as “patera” cars, were no longer allowed passage. In a press release, the Spanish government previously noted that this ‘atypical commerce’ will only resume once technicians determine that the border’s infrastructure is safe enough. According to El Faro de Ceuta, the president of Phase II of the Tarajal border, Bilal Dadi, criticized how “after suspending the border’s activity for more than a month, we are still waiting for the road to be asphalted.” Dadi also warned that the security plan “does not guarantee the movement of porters with their cars 100% full of merchandise.” “This situation will force people to attempt taking merchandise inside shopping carts or attached to their bodies; it will create greater pressure on the pedestrian side of the border,” says El Faro de Ceuta.

Providing employment opportunities for the local community and #education for girls from rural areas. Brilliant https://t.co/BXtRviHwDF — Thomas Reilly (@TSAReilly) September 3, 2019  The project is a collaboration between Kasbah du Toubkal, a mountain retreat, and Education for All Morocco (EFA Morocco), a non-profit organization that aims to reduce the number of girls dropping out of school in the region. The project is providing girls, aged between 12 and 18, of rural communities in the High Atlas Mountains with housing, meals, access to computers, and study support. It is partly financed by a British sister organization. Thomas Reilly also shared a photo of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, during their visit to see the project, on February 24, 2019. The visit of the British Ambassador comes only two days after floods hit the region, causing massive damage to property. Some Moroccan news outlets criticized Moroccan officials for not visiting the stricken town. Heavy rain hit the town of Imlil between August 31st and September 1st. The bad weather caused rivers crossing the town to break their banks, the strong currents carrying rocks and destroying cars and buildings facades. The floods also blocked roads inside and outside Imlil. Luckily, no human casualties were recorded.

Rabat – Morocco is participating in a two-day summit on migration and global human trafficking networks in the capital of Mexico. The summit, organized by the Ibero-American federation, the Network on Migration and Human Trafficking, and the Mexican council on human rights, convenes more than twenty countries from the Ibero-American federation as well as a number of observer states. The Ibero-American summit is an annual event that gathers government delegates and civil society groups to discuss the shared challenges, mostly human-related, facing countries where Portuguese and Spanish are the main languages, or widely spoken and considered as part of the national identity as in the case of the US and Morocco. According to the organizers of this year’s event, the goal of the summit is to discuss ways of implementing or contributing to the implementation of the spirit of the recently signed Global Compact on Migration (GCM). Signed in early December of last year in Marrakech, Morocco, the document was a landmark achievement for migration-related global discussions. It has since become indispensable for any migration-linked summit or agreement at the regional and global levels. Participants in the two-day summit in Mexico said they hope to come up with concrete, workable proposals to curb what they described as a worrying trend of “transcontinental human trafficking” and “mass detention of migrants” in third countries. In addition to tackling challenges on the human trafficking front, other topics discussed at the summit include the “origins of migration,” “extra-continental migration,” “non-ordinary migration movements,” and “international protection for migrants.” With the human rights aspect of the global migration crisis as its focal point, the event hopes, according to the organizers, to be a platform of experience sharing and “ policy coordination” to mitigate the plight of migrants and persons on the move at the global level. The Moroccan delegation at the summit is headed by Mounir Bensaleh, the newly appointed secretary of the country’s National Council for Human Rights (CNDH). As the country which hosted the signing of the GCM, Morocco has become a prominent voice in global discussions on the migration crisis. Morocco’s partnership with the EU on curbing irregular migration in the Mediterranean is the of-cited factor when discussing Morocco and migration. Since 2014-2016, when the Moroccan King instructed the regularization of as many as 50,000 undocumented sub-Saharans, Morocco has secured a solid reputation for migrant-friendly policies. This has also earned it its leadership position on Africa’s migration agenda. Of Morocco’s participation in this year’s Ibero-American summit, a CNDH statement noted “humanitarian” and “Pan-African” shift Morocco’s migration policy has experienced in the past three to five years. Morocco’s hope, it said, is the organization of a global dialogue for the elaboration of rights-based migration policies that protect displaced people and guarantee migrants the most basic, inalienable human rights.

Rabat – Surprisingly, the increase in the budgets of the ministries of education and reforms started over the past decade in many countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) have not resulted in significant improvements in the quality of education, and the level of students remains uneven across countries and regions and within the same country. The quality of education in the region is a real challenge. Not all countries reach the international average in global assessments. The progress made will be insufficient to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely to attain quality education and reduce poverty and socio-economic inequalities.  By international standards, the quality of educational systems in the MENA region is still relatively low, although governments spend far more than Singapore, one of the strongest countries that devote much less on the education budget than the Gulf area or other developed countries. There are many ways to improve the educational system. In most countries, reforms are very complex and their results are controversial. Successful education systems are characterized by a number of criteria. First, they encourage excellent students to become teachers in the future. Second, as the recent McKinsey Research Group study shows, best practices can be implemented in Morocco or in any other cultural environment, and include relying on teachers for improving the quality of education. Upgrading the quality of the education system, however, cannot be achieved without highly trained teachers, who can ensure the quality of teaching within classrooms. Third, an effective educational system is always reflected in the learning achievements and results of each student. Lastly, to contribute to the quality of education, modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) should be integrated into educational institutions, leading to a positive change in teacher-student relations and improved teaching methods. Using these technologies will contribute to improving the quality of courses and teaching methods, curbing disparities in the quality of education, and reducing the gap between urban and rural areas. Recent field studies on the use of ICTs in Moroccan schools and universities indicate that there are insufficient computer materials at the disposal of students and teachers alike. Further, modern technology is rarely used to help teachers in schools. Thus, an integrated approach to using educational ICTs in schools is essential, which means not only more investment in infrastructure, but also the urgent need to allocate more resources to train teachers and provide rewards to those who use ICTs in the classroom, and job opportunities for coordinators of modern technology within educational institutions. To achieve these goals, the gap in the use of ICTs between regions must be narrowed. Programs focusing on new teaching methods must be established through digital technologies, which will help improve the quality of education and monitor progress in the use of digital technologies to acquire relevant skills. In order to reach this goal, ICT training for teachers should be mandatory, most of whom master the software, as they often train themselves outside of working hours to acquire these skills. It is helpful that students and pupils have access to ICTs both at home and at school, and the lack of infrastructure in schools does not mean that teachers and students are not interested, but the problem is that there is no clear educational policy to promote the use of information technology in Moroccan schools and universities. Although most students and teachers support the use of digital technologies, most schools lack enough computers and internet access. By comparison, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation recently provided Internet access and offered thousands of computers to schools and libraries in many developing countries including Chile, Mexico, Botswana, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria and Vietnam. The Foundation has also invested $240 million to provide Internet access in 99% of public libraries in the United States, as well as a huge number of computers and training workshops. Our education system should invest in communication technologies, equip all educational and administrative facilities with computers with connection to the Internet, and train teachers and students in this field. There are thousands of students who need information literacy and do not find opportunities. The most important thing, as mentioned above, is that in all educational frameworks, students and pupils should be fully prepared to take advantage of this type of technology. It has become necessary to increase the dissemination of scientific and technological culture among teachers and students. Likewise, introducing entrepreneurship will enhance the interaction with the business world and promote cooperation and partnership with the private sector. Seeking to achieve greater harmony between the educational system and its economic environment will strengthen the practical aspect of education and enhance the compatibility between school curricula and the economy. Finally, the integration of ICTs into the curriculum and teaching methods is essential for the development of Moroccan student personality, because in addition to access to knowledge, the goal of education is to produce knowledge, boost creativity and contribute effectively to development.

Rabat – Global automotive parts supplier Yazaki is planning to open a new plant in Morocco in January 2020. The Japenese company is planning to strengthen its presence in Morocco with a fourth plant in Kenitra near Rabat.  The plant is also seeking to open job opportunities to 2,500 people. This will bring the total workforce hired by the company to more than 12,500, L’ Econolmiste reported. In an interview with the French-speaking news outlet,   senior managing director, and general manager of Automotive Business Management Division Hiroshi Ichikawa said that the company invests in Morocco because it has customers in Spain “To get closer to them, we had to have a production base. Morocco presented itself with a competitive offer including several incentives in addition to an industrial free zone,” he said. He added that the business is going “very well” in Morocco. Ichikawa said that the Renault site in Tangier and the PSA group plant in Kenitra are Yazaki’s customers. “We have been working with them for many years,” he said. The automotive industry is one of the pillars of Morocco’s economy.  In April, Morocco’s Ministry of Industry said that the automotive industry recorded the strongest job creation.  The sector created 116,611 jobs between 014 and 2018, representing 28.8 percent of all new jobs in the time period. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Morocco is becoming a key supplier for European auto factories, “including Ford Motor Co.’s F 0.22%  high-tech plant in Valencia, Spain, which imports car seats, interiors, wiring and other components from Morocco.” Recently, Morocco has attracted several investors to build plants making car parts, including Nexteer, Gestamp, Ficosa and Fiat subsidiary Magneti Marelli.

The new procedure was designed to increase the safety of minors going abroad. According to the Spanish daily, the Spanish Ministry of Interior indicated that the new procedure is also applicable for journeys from Ceuta to Morocco. The Ministry of Interior issued the new procedure in July aiming to prevent cases of kidnapping or human trafficking. The initiative also aims to increase the protection of minors’ personal data. El Faro de Ceuta reported that the new procedure, issued by the Secretary of State for Security, “unifies the control systems at the borders and details the procedures and the checks to be carried out by agents before minors’ entrances and exits.” The Spanish outlet reports that the procedure comes as a result of the frequent departures of minors outside the national territory. “The diversity of situations these minors may suffer due to their status as minors, such as illegal human trafficking or parental kidnappings make it necessary to implement and unify a common system of control, both to comply with national regulations and to safeguard the International Agreements and Treaties Spain is part of,” says El Faro de Ceuta. The Spanish Constitution obliges public authorities to ensure the social, economic and legal protection of minors. Article 39.4 provides that children should enjoy the protection provided in international agreements ensuring their rights.

Rabat – The journalist, working for the Arabic-speaking newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, is suspected of “illegal sexual relations resulting in pregnancy and illegal abortion.” Standing in court in Rabat on September 2, the defendants refuted the allegations, as reported by AlYaoum24, an online media company owned by Akhbar Al Yaoum. The gynecologist reportedly told the judge that Raissouni had had a hemorrhage that required immediate surgery.  “We did not perform any abortions. I made an urgent intervention,” said the gynecologist, according to AlYaoum24. Raissouni told the court that she had been married to her fiance, a university professor of Sudanese nationality, in a religious ceremony, and was only waiting for documents from the Sudanese embassy to formalize the union expected to take place in two weeks. Raissouni also clarified that she was not arrested in the doctor’s office. She affirmed that six police officers in civilian clothes surrounded her asking if she had just left the gynecologist’s office accusing her of having had an abortion.  “They then dragged me up into the doctor’s office,” says the journalist. The defendants will remain in custody until the second hearing, taking place on September 9. “The case file contains no concrete material evidence of the abortion charge,” according to AlYaoum24. The defense of the doctor also mentioned a medical report in the file. The medical check-up done on the journalist at the hospital Souissi in Rabat when in custody proved that she had not undergone any abortion.  “Expertise at the University Hospital Ibn Sina, at the request of the judicial police, confirmed Raissouni’s medical state,’ according to AlYaoum24. Abortion in Morocco Abortion in Morocco is illegal. However, article 453 in Morocco’s penal code stipulates that abortion is not punishable if it is practiced to preserve the mother’s physical health in case of a medical threat. In this case, abortion can be openly practiced with the spouse’s authorization. It is both illegal to carry out an unauthorized abortion as a doctor, and for a pregnant woman to undergo the unauthorized procedure. In 2016, the Moroccan government agreed in principle to change the law to also legalize abortion in the cases of rape, incest, situations where the mother has serious mental health issues, or when the fetus has a serious illness or malformation. However, since then, Parliament has taken no steps to change the law.

Rabat – The CMA CGM Group, a French container shipping company, will add Dakhla port to its shipping routes to be the 1st maritime transportation and logistics company to operate in the port and serve clients in the South of Morocco. The group intends to strengthen its services in Morocco with a new stop at the port of Dakhla and the commissioning of CMA CGM AGADIR, the third ship of the Group under the Moroccan flag. CMA CGM AGADIR can transport up to 1,120 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) containers.  With the inclusion of the port of Dakhla in the Moroccan shuttle service, CMA CGM will be the first shipping company to serve the strategic port of Southern Morocco, the group said in a press release. The statement added that the group’s customers, including fish exporters, will benefit from a “fast and competitive” service to the rest of Morocco and via the ports of Tangier Med – inaugurated on November 28, 2018, by the group’s general-director Rodolphe Saade – and Algeciras.  Morocco is a country that is strategic for the development of CMA CGM, particularly because of its role as a crossroads for trade between Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranean Basin, the press release added. The Group employs 1,600 people in Morocco and 33,000 worldwide and makes more than 1,000 calls a year, with 25 maritime services serving 420 ports in different countries, including more than 80 ports served directly.

Rabat – The leader of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Ibrahim Ghali, has his expressed frustration after Japan made clear its unwavering position on the Western Sahara conflict. Last week, at the 7th Tokyo International Conference on Development in Africa (TICAD VII), Japan made clear its ongoing support for Morocco’s territorial integrity .                                                                                                                                    During the symposium, the Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister, Taro Kono, reiterated Japan’s position, stating that Japan does not recognize the self-proclaimed SADR as a state. The minister added that the presence of the Polisario at the international event does not in any way affect Japan’s view. Ghali reacted to the statement from the Japanese minister, saying; “Japan should be neutral regarding the conflict in Western Sahara, and refrain from showing any sort of support to the Moroccan illegal occupation of parts of the national territory of the Sahrawi Republic.” He also said that the strong ties between Japan and Morocco should not push Japan to enter into “illegal agreements with Morocco,” referring to the EU-Morocco fisheries deal. The Polisario Front claims that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement is not legal, despite it being approved by the United Nations and the European Union. Morocco has been firm that no agreements should be made without the inclusion of its southern provinces in Western Sahara. In January, the EU and Morocco signed the fisheries agreement. The agreement covers the fishing area  from parallel 35 to parallel 22, from Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. Morocco’s government informed the UN when the agreement was signed. This latest disappointment for the Polisario leadership comes after several  long-time supporters of Polisario claims, including El Salvador, have withdrawn their recognition of the self-proclaimed SADR. Japan’s statement of support for Morocco’s territorial integrity follows  a publication from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) which said, on August 11, that Trump’s administration will not back the creation of another state in southern Morocco.

Rabat – The US has delivered 50 military vehicles and trucks to Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR), a statement from FAR’s website has recently indicated. The shipment constitutes yet another vindication of the strong, and continuously evolving security cooperation between Washington and Rabat, the statement suggested. In a subsequent Facebook post, FAR went on to explain that this delivery was the first phase of a broader agreement involving the shipment of 100 military vehicles and “tactical transportation trucks.” The second phase is expected to take place “in the coming weeks.” “50 tactical transportation trucks are currently on their way to Morocco from the US. Another 50-truck shipment will take place in the coming weeks,” the FAR statement noted. In addition to transporting Moroccan troops to strategic positions in times of combat, the trucks and militarized vehicles can be used as shields against light weapons, artillery shells, and mortar bombs. They are expected to reinforce the capabilities of the Moroccan land forces. The news comes months after the Moroccan air forces received a number of upgraded F16 fighter jets from the US. However the purchase and the free provision to Morocco of US-made army equipment are not the only aspects of the defense cooperation between Rabat and Washington. Morocco is widely known as the strongest US ally in North Africa and one of Washington’s most reliable partners in the global fight against terrorism and radicalization. Most recently, General Stephen T. Townsend, the commander of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM), said that Morocco is a strong and exemplary ally, pointing out that Washington is keen to upgrade the security cooperation between the two countries. “The US military and the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces can improve our ability to work together and provide a safe, more prosperous future for the region,” he said.

Rabat – Authorities in the German city of Hanover found on Tuesday, September 3, a 250-kilogram-bomb hidden underground since the WWII. Authorities have evacuated 15,000 people as a precaution while the bomb was defused safely. The inhabitants were subsequently able to return to their homes at around 1 am local time on Tuesday, August 3 (midnight GMT). Bombs dropped during the WWII are often found in Germany, which was a target of intensive Allied bombing at the time. In 2017, around 65,000 inhabitants in the city of Frankfurt were evacuated after the discovery of a huge British bomb with a charge of 1.4 tons of explosives. According to experts quoted by the weekly Der Spiegel, nearly 10% of the millions of bombs dropped on Germany until 1945 did not explode.

Rabat – As his first challenges loom large on Morocco’s footballing horizons in the forms of two friendly matches in quick successions, on September 6 against Burkina Faso and September 10 against Niger, Vahid Halilhodzic, the new head coach of Morocco’s Atlas Lions appears to ooze an elegant mixture of reserve and confidence. Two weeks after he was appointed to take Moroccan football to new heights in terms of trophy delivery and consistency in performance and energy levels, Coach Halilhodzic is bound to go into the upcoming friendly games with a state of mind above the traditional, not-such-a-big-deal kind of energy that friendly games usually induce. While the two games are not of any particular consequence for Morocco’s standing in the footballing world, they provide the first litmus test for whether the new coach can fill the shoes of his illustrious, charismatic predecessor. With Herve Renard in command, Morocco played spectacularly well on countless occasions but fell short on delivering on the biggest occasions. In signing Halilodzic, the hope is to keep the sense of style and fluidity in playing, while coupling it with the much-needed sense of clinical, goal scoring instincts. In other words, in place of the boundlessly talented but sometimes self-indulgent Renard-coached Atlas Lions, an essential part of Halilhodzic challenge will be to put in place a team that can manage to win even when they are suffering, either suffocated by the opposition’s superiority or unnerved by an underdog that refuses to play, as was the case when they played with Benin recently. Having already made public his list of select players for the two friendlies, Halilhodzic is due to grace Moroccan fans and football commentators with yet another gift. On Thursday, just hours before his first test as Atlas Lions’ manager, the newly appointed coach will unveil his master plan for Moroccan football. Will he adopt some of his predecessor’s tactics? Will such and such players still be around? Who will be the creative minds, the necessary shields, and the indispensable in Halilhodzic’s starting squad? Will some players be as untouchable as they were under Herve Renard or will the new coach bets on a performance-based philosophy, choosing players on the basis of their current shape rather than on familiarity with other players and other extra-performance criteria? These and many other questions—similar or not—are set to be the talking points as the Franco-Bosnian coach faces passionate Atlas Lions supporters and recently disappointed Moroccan sports journalists this Thursday. 15 minutes, which is the time Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has set for the press conference, will naturally be insufficient for laying out a detailed, elegant coaching philosophy. But no one expects specific, detailed answers at this point. Rather, no matter who asks the questions on Thursday or how they ask them, what most want to know is how different the Atlas Lions will be under Halilhodzic, or whether the Bosnian can really succeed where his French predecessor, a rock star in African football, failed repeatedly. Whatever the answers, and regardless of the rhetorical technique Halilhodzic uses to provide them, the performance on the ground in the two matches will be the ultimate response to the myriad of queries clouding the footballing judgment of Atlas Lions Fans after a soul-crushingly early elimination from their most recent tournament. There will be no trophy to win on September 6 and 10, neither will the two games be an occasion for qualifying for a major tournament. This, however, should be no reason to sniff at the games, or—at least as far as the coach and his players are concerned—to drop the standards, or take the whole exercise for granted. At stake will be the fight for winning back the unconditional love of visibly distraught Moroccan supporters. Some are already suggesting—and somewhat rightly—that, at heart, what Moroccans want from this post-Renard squad is a new, radical departure from their languid performance at the recent Africa Cup of Nations. Meanwhile, as far as FRMF is concerned, the terms of the contract with Halilhodzic could not have been clearer. Explicitly mentioned goals in the contract include qualification for the semi-finals of the 2021 CAN, qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and winning the 2023 CAN. As Moroccan football strives to end a three-decade cycle of disappointments and what ifs, Halilhodzic knows what he signed up for when he accepted Morocco’s call. “Coaching Morocco is a big responsibility and an honor,” he said during a press conference immediately after he was appointed. “My first objective is to qualify for the World Cup. I will try to qualify a fourth consecutive national team.” The Bosnian understands, as does his new team’s new technical director, that the whole point of his appointment is to catapult Morocco to the type of footballing heights and glories that have always seemed doable, achievable, but have consistently managed to go to others, to elude Morocco. Halilhodzic is cut from the same cloth as Renard, boasting a varied coaching experience and winning across continents. Some may even say that is slightly better and more experienced than his younger predecessor, having made his marks both as a player, but also as a successful and revered coach for many clubs and national teams. But whether the Bosnian will eclipse Renard and succeed where the Frenchman failed is too soon to tell. Nevertheless, his first results and his team’s morale in those early games will provide ample clues as to whether Halilhodzic’s Morocco will be any different from Renard’s.

Rabat – The Spanish Ministry of Interior has announced that Minister of the Interior Fernando Grqnde Marlaska will travel to Morocco on Tuesday September 3 for a working visit. The minister’s agenda includes a meeting with Morocco’s interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit. The meeting will take place on Wednesday, September 4. Europa Press  reported that the aim of the meeting is to “reinforce the existing cooperation” between Rabat and Madrid, especially in the control of migration flows and criminal networks. The news outlet said that Spain is facing pressure from undocumented migration, stating that more than 18,396 migrants arrived in Spain irregularly in 2019. The statistics come from the International Organization of Migration (IOM).  The number represents 43.3% less than the same period in 2018, when 32,451 migrants arrived in 2018. In March, Spanish Minister of Interior Fernando Grande-Marlaska  said that Morocco’s security services are “leading to a decline in the arrival of migrants to the Spanish coasts.” He added that “coordination with the countries of origin and transit in the fight against these networks has led, since February, to a decline in migrant arrivals that is being confirmed during this month of March.” Morocco considers Spain one of its major partners in the fight against irregular migration. The visit of the Spanish official came after the Spanish acting government approved on  August 23, a  €32 million grant to back Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration. The visit of the interior minister will also follow two important visits of both the Spanish royal family earlier this year and the visit of the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez.  On November 19, Sanchez visited Morocco, where he met with King Mohammed VI, Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and other Moroccan officials. Sanchez also visited Morocco in December, when he  participated in the Intergovernmental Conference on the Global Compact for Migration.

Rabat – A total of six Canadian Muslims have been refused entry to the United States in recent weeks. The incidents have raised concerns among Canadian immigration lawyers. Among the Muslims denied entry is Imran Ally, a Guyanian Imam in a mosque in Toronto who was questioned for more than five hours at the Peace Bridge border crossing near Fort Erie. Ally’s wife and his three children were also interrogated, according to Radio-Canada. Authorities at the crossing point took a photograph of Ally as well as his fingerprints, before denying him entry. An American agent told him that he has the same name as a wanted criminal.  Ally, who was traveling to New York for the wedding of his best friend’s daughter, was interrogated about his donations to organizations that help to resettle Syrian refugees. Authorities also confiscated his cell-phone. “I knew that my first trip to the United States was not going to be on a red carpet. We had prepared for [a long interrogation], but I never thought they would deny entry because of my name,” Ally told CBC News. The president of Toronto-based Iraqi Turkmen community group, Nejmettin Vali experienced a similar situation. American authorities interrogated Vali and his family for more than four hours and seized their cellphones, before denying them entry. Vali has, however, traveled to the US in the past to support his three children when his son – a former Iraqi police officer – was killed by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) fighters. “We’ve had many cases in the last couple of weeks and we do not know what to attribute them to,” said Ali Daud a lawyer specializing in Migration told CBC. “We know that the climate in the US has changed, but, at the same time, there should be procedures and ways of doing things, and people should have the opportunity to appeal their cases,” Ali added. Neither Iraq nor Guyana are listed in Donald Trump’s ‘Muslim Ban’ which bans citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the US.

Rabat – From August 28 to 31, the 8th Climate Change and Development in Africa Conference (CCDA) was held in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. The conference’s theme was “Intensifying Climate Action for a Resilient Africa – a Race We Can and Must Win.” Representatives from member states of the African Union (AU), and members of the UN attended the conference. The event, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), aims to prepare for the UN Climate Action Summit which will be held this month in New York. Countries must come to the summit prepared with “concrete, realistic plans” to fight climate change, which was one of the main aims of CCDA. Opoku Mensah, UNECA’s chief of staff, pointed out in the CCDA’s welcoming address that even though Africa contributes the least to global emissions, the continent is already suffering from the “most adverse impacts” of climate change, and plans must be put in place. “The continent contributes under 6% of emissions, with per capita emissions of only 0.8 tons per year, well below the global mean of 5 tons, and far lower than that from other regions such as Europe and Asia,” Mensah said. “And yet climate change poses an existential threat to the continent,” she added. Representing Morocco was Mohammed Arrouchi, Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the AU and UNECA, who headed the delegation. He used the opportunity to highlight Morocco’s counter climate change efforts over the past few years. During the conference, Arrouchi mentioned the initiatives taken by King Mohammed VI following the COP 22 meeting in Marrakech in November 2016, including the “Adaptation of African Agriculture” (AAA) initiative. The initiative proposed measures such as improved soil management, water and irrigation management, and better weather forecasting and insurance programs for farmers affected by drought. He also referenced the fifth Session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD), which was held in Marrakech in April. During ARFSD, Morocco reaffirmed its commitment to putting in place the basis for sustainable development in Africa, as outlined in the 2011 constitution.

Rabat – Following the Ajax Amsterdam vs Sparta Rotterdam game, Dutch coach Ronald Koeman suggested that dual nationality Moroccan players such as Hakim Ziyech, Noussair Mazraoui, and Oussama Idrissi choose to play for the Moroccan national team for financial gain. During the Studio Voetbal program on Dutch channel NOS, Koeman insinuated that the Royal Moroccan Football Federation lures dual-nationality players to the national team with large sums of money. Referring to Mohamed Ihattaren, the next PSV Eindhoven star, Koeman added that “if the player was given a large sum by Moroccan officials, their Dutch counterparts could not do much; it makes it difficult to convince them to play for our teams.” “People invent the craziest things,” responded Ziyech when interviewed after the game. “I have not received any money to play with the Moroccan national team and the same applies to Noussair Mazraoui and Oussama Idrissi,” he continued.  There is currently a fierce competition between the Royal Moroccan Football Federation and the Dutch Football Federation to persuade Ihattaren to play for their teams.  Ihattaren, on the other hand, affirmed that he wants to focus on his future internationally before deciding on which national team he will join. He also asked for some time to think about his final decision. Koemen told NOS, “I think we have to do much more to convince them, but I also understand how ten or more players would choose to defend the colors of their home countries, whether it is Morocco or Turkey, at the expense of the Dutch team.” Ziyech joined Ajax Amsterdam in 2017. He is also a key player in Morocco’s national football team, with whom he made his debut in October 2015 in a friendly match against Cote d’Ivoire.

Rabat  – Tunisia’s Mosaique Radio said that two of the terrorist fighters that opened fire on Tunisian police guards on Monday, September 2  were Algerians. Soufiene Sliti, spokesperson for the anti-terror judicial unit said that “these neutralized terrorists are the subject of  legal proceedings.” He added that one of the  terrorists who died in the shootout with police was responsible for the majority of terror attacks that have been perpetrated in Tunisia since 2013, MAghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported.

Rabat – The group of young men and women who volunteered to replace cleaners aimed to draw attention to the important role these workers play. Pictures of the initiative, posted by the group Azilal Family, went viral on Facebook.  The group took over cleaning the streets and alleys of the city, allowing the cleaners to take the day off, in recognition of the work they do and to sensitize the city’s residents to the fact that the cleanliness of the city is the duty of every citizen.   The initiative was organized by Azilal Family, part of Hero Family or Heroshima Family. The association includes thousands of young Moroccans across the country and it mostly works on volunteer and charity social works. The cleaning initiative was Azilal Family’s first awareness campaign. It all started with Jihad Elachyr’s idea.  Elachyr told Morocco World News that the idea behind the initiative was an incident she witnessed. “I was walking one day and I saw a car driver humiliate a cleaner. He threw his trash on the man’s face! ” she explained. “I had to intervene, so, I went to talk to the cleaner, and he felt immensely offended and humiliated,” Jihad added. She explained that “since I did not have enough money to help, I thought I could at least help with their work, I tried to gather as much manpower to do the job.” “It was also an opportunity to be an example and raise people’s awareness,” Jihad further added. Answering a question, Oussama Tabsart, one of the initiative’s organizers, told Morocco World News that the cleaners were extremely happy for the attention given to their cause. “Since they only get paid for every day worked, they were also happy that they would not lose that day’s pay,” Tabsart added. Tabsart also mentioned that the group has chosen “August 31 to be celebrated each year as a cleaners’ day in order to give these workers the attention and recognition they deserve.” In the evening, the group also organized a small event in which the cleaners received symbolic prizes.  The initiative received impressive encouragement and support from Internet users who called for organizing similar campaigns in other cities. K.M commented on Azilal Family’s post, saying “I applaud you for this great initiative, and I hope other cities follow your steps.” “It seems very simple, but the happiness in those people’s hearts is immeasurable,” she added referring to the cleaners.

Rabat – Algerian intellectuals launched an initiative, in the form of a petition, reiterating their call for the official reopening of the Moroccan-Algerian borders, and the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The initiative comes after Algeria’s victory at the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). The Moroccan-Algerian borders witnessed a unique situation when thousands of Moroccans flocked to the borders to celebrate the victory of the Algerian national football team. The initiative aimed to convey the aspirations of these joint celebrations to the leaders of both countries. During CAN’s matches, Algerians and Moroccans had also launched a virtual campaign on social media under the hashtag “KhawaKhawa” (brothers). Fans of both teams actively reacted to the campaign and attended matches to encourage and support the other team. According to Panora Post, the signatories of the petition affirmed that the current popular movement in Algeria was decisively in favor of the initiative. They indicated that it is high time politicians ended the ongoing icy diplomatic relations between the two governments.  Panora Post reported that Algerian writer and signatory of the petition, Said Hadef, stressed that “the idea came in the context of previous calls for the opening of borders on various occasions”. It was also “the culmination of recent calls by Algerian civil society to establish Algerian-Moroccan relations open to creative cooperation,” he added. As for the initiative’s future, Hadef said that “the problem arises from the elite’s failure and inaction in accomplishing its task.” Hadef pointed out that “the political class’ weakness and its mismanagement of political affairs in both countries result from the superficiality of the role of the cultural elite and its ignorance of the local and regional state of affairs.” Start of conflict  The land borders between Morocco and Algeria have been closed since 1994 following the bombing at the Atlas-Asni Hotel in Marrakech, on August 24 of the same year. A commando of two armed men fired shots in the air, took the hotel’s money and targeted a small group of tourists in the lobby. Two Spaniards were killed and a French woman seriously injured. The perpetrators had French-Algerian origins. Investigations conducted by the Moroccan authorities showed that several similar attacks were planned on the same day in Tangier, Fez, Casablanca, and Marrakech. Morocco, suspecting the involvement of Algeria’s secret services, imposed visas on all Algerian nationals. Algeria responded by completely closing the land border (the air border remains open) between the two countries. The situation worsened with the two countries’ conflict over Western Sahara. Algeria financially and politically supports the Polisario front’s claims against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Morocco has consistently called for Algeria to be recognized as a full-fledged party to the conflict, while Algeria casts itself as an observer.   In 2007, Morocco proposed an Autonomy Plan to solve the conflict over Western Sahara. Since then the Plan received the support of the UN Security Council considering it a “serious and credible” solution the decades-long regional conflict. Several countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, kuwait, Bahrain, Senegal, Gabon, Côte d’Ivoire, Jordan, Sudan, UAE, and Peru, to name just a few, have expressed their support of Morocco’s Plan.

Rabat – On Monday, September 2,  police killed three terrorists in an operation involving the National Guard and military army units in Hidra, Tunisia.  Tunisian’s news agency  Agence Tunis Afrique Press (TAP) reported that “Units of the National Guard and the Army in Kasserine seized four Kalashnikov rifles and dismantled three explosible belts at the end of the OM Dhfa’s (Haidra) proactive security operation on Monday.” “The chief of the National Guard district in From Edhfa was killed during this proactive police operation,” TAP added. The incident came after Tunisia officially opened for Tunisia’s presidential election after the death of Beji Caid Essebsi in July. The Tunisian Ministry of Interior said that the “proactive operation fits within the war against terrorism and efforts to track down terrorist groups, particularly in western borders.” The Ministry added that search operations are underway. The terror operation followed two terror attacks on June 27 when ISIS members targeted Tunisia’s law enforcement. The first attack targeted a security service vehicle on Charles de Gaulle Avenue, killing one policeman and injuring three civilians. Another terrorist blew himself up near a police station in Al Karjani district, injuring four others. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.

Rabat – Last week’s floods which killed 7 people in the Taroudant province and caused severe damage in several other areas in southern Morocco have turned the spotlight on the World Bank pointing fingers at the Moroccan government, and raising concerns on the country’s apparently inefficient approach to crisis management when faced with natural disasters. In a scathing report  published in April 2016, the World Bank pointed to the lack of coherent vision and continuity in Morocco’s crisis management methodologies. Recalling the three-year-old report, Arabic newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia indicated in its September 2 issue that the unfurling of the recent, unfortunate events in southern Morocco came with a painful reminder of many of the points the World Bank raised in that appraisal of natural disaster management in Morocco. According to the Casablanca-based newspaper, the World Bank’s report pointed out that a number of recent—sometimes similar—natural disasters in various Moroccan regions have shown that the country is not sufficiently ready to face recurring patterns of critical, natural hazards. For the World Bank, according to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the repeated issuing of new “urgent measures” to deal with similar crises in different locations is an indication that there is no proactive, beforehand designed roadmap to immediately respond to challenges as soon as they emerge. The report describes Morocco’s approach as “reactionary” rather than “responsive,” arguing that, more often than not, Morocco’s response to natural disasters like floods bears the markers of “improvised reactions” instead of well-planned, in-advance, and carefully considered policies. Despite lambasting the Moroccan government for what it sees as irresponsible and incoherent response to recurrent crises, the report was ambivalent on some points. It acknowledged the “immense efforts” Morocco has made on the environment and climate change front and praised the country’s recent political reforms meant to further political accountability and improve government responsiveness to nationwide challenges. It maintained, however, that more collective efforts, coordinated actions are needed from the authorities to mitigate the consequences of environment-linked disasters. Without sounding alarmist, the report noted that, as the climate crisis becomes an integral reality of countries around the world, incidents similar to the Taroudant events are bound to happen. Because of the inherent, multiple risks and natural hazards associated with climate change, the report noted, the Moroccan government should show more willingness and resolve to devise more effective policies to adequately manage, respond to, or even altogether preempt such events. In its most condemnatory remarks, the World Bank consistently reproached Morocco for its apparent lack of a coherent set of policies to face natural hazards. The report referred to the responses to the Taroudant and other such events in recent years across the country as “institutionalized disorder.” The poignantly critical assessment is consistent with the reactions and comments from family of victims and eyewitnesses in Taroudant. After the floods hit the province last Thursday, many local residents fumed at the government and the local authorities for neglect. They complained about local authorities’ failure to take into account alerts to the high-risk nature of the football field where 7 people died when the floods hit, as well as serious warnings, days prior to the floods, that southern Morocco would be engulfed by heavy storms on August28-29.

Rabat – Families of detained Sahrawis have addressed a letter to the leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali, urging him to intervene to release their relatives who have been incarcerated for more than seventy days for “unknown” reasons. In June, the Polisario Front arrested Mahmoud Zidan, Fadel Braika, and Moulay Aba Zid. The three activists were taking part in a protest to condemn “human rights violations and inhumane conditions” in the Tindouf camps. Since then, the detainees’ relatives have been staging strikes and protests to condemn the “arbitrary detention” of the activists. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara shared a copy of the letter from the families of the detainees, who also held a protest on Sunday, September 1 in front of the self-styled presidential headquarters. During the protest, Sahrawis chanted slogans to emphasize the dire necessity for freedom and justice in the camp. In the letter, the protesters called for an “an answer, clear enough” to explain the reason for the arrest of their relatives who were “kidnapped and put behind bars for 74 days  for unknown reasons.” The families also condemned the “terrible” silence of the Polisario Front on the arrest and the treatment the detainees received from the “concerned authorities.” The letter accused the Polisario Front and its leaders of  “injustice against us and our children.”  “Shame, shame on anyone who does not recognize his people’s rights,” the letter read. The families further condemned the treatment of the detained activists, accusing Ghali of sending “hungry wolves and malicious foxes to cut, rip, and tear them apart.” Appalled by the situation of the three detained activists, the protesters, the activists called on the leader of the separatist group to give a clear account and explanation on the arrest of their relatives. The letter also called for a fair trial for the three activists. The families of the victims were not the only people to condemn the arbitrary arrest of the activists. In August, the Sahrawi Khat Shahid “the Line of the Martyr” movement addressed a letter to the United Nations, calling on it to end Polisario’s violations against the activists. “They were kidnapped, tortured and thrown into small cells in a land where temperatures exceed 54 degrees.” Amid the protests and condemnation, international media have been silent on the subject of the arbitrary arrest of the activists. Meanwhile,  international NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called on the immediate release of the activists.

Rabat –  Pope Francis has appointed Rabat’s archbishop Cristobal Lopez Romero as one of the new  13 cardinals. Vatican News said that the new cardinals will be promoted at a consistory that will take place on October 5 at the Vatican. “Their origin expresses the missionary vocation of the church which continues to proclaim the merciful love of God to all the men of the earth,” the Pope said. Pope Francis appointed Lopez Romero in December 2018. He was then ordained as the new archbishop of Rabat in March 2018. He succeeded former archbishop Vincent Landel, who resigned for age reasons. Born in 1952, Cristobal was ordained a priest in 1979 in Barcelona.  The new archbishop has a vast knowledge of Moroccan culture, having worked in Morocco since 2003. The Spaniard also held a position in Paraguay from 1984 to 2002. According to Agenzia Info Salesiana, Cristobal holds a degree in journalism from the Autonomous University of Barcelona.  The promotion of Romero Lopez came six months after the visit of Pope Francis to Morocco. The visit which took place on March 30-31 was the first visit for the pope.  During his visit, the Pope met with King Mohammed VI, senior officials, and migrants. The Pope enjoyed his visit to Morocco, delivering statements to express gratitude for the warm welcome he received. “Last Saturday and Sunday [March 30-31], I completed an Apostolic Journey to Morocco, and I thank His Majesty King Mohammed VI and the other authorities, for their warm welcome.” The Pope also said that it was an honor and a joy to visit the “noble kingdom of Morocco.”

Rabat – Essaouira’s beautiful 18th century medina is characterized by intricate, winding alleyways, unique and strange door frames, jewel bright colours, stark poverty, and excess. In amongst the disparities in living conditions, education, and culture, lurk hundreds upon hundreds of stray cats. You may wonder why I am bringing cats into the issue, but I promise, it is relevant. Some Moroccan families in the medina choose to feed the cats, tourists can regularly be seen cooing over kittens with eye infections and compassionately sharing their tagines with the big tom cats that patrol the medina walls. Meanwhile, many of the European permanent residents in the medina and the surrounding area take it upon themselves to become the moral guardians of Essaouira’s stray cat population. Post upon post appears on the Essaouira community facebook pages calling on residents to adopt kittens, pay for sterilization, or to stop the authorities laying down poison on the beaches. While the cat-lovers of Essaouira are not throwing themselves at or biting locals in the manner of the Tangier-chicken-woman, some of the posts on facebook are a little preachy to say the least. In one post about cats in the port, the group members criticize a local toilet attendant who set up kennels for the cats, calling him “cruel” for shutting the cats in at night. Another post about Moroccan children chasing cats reads, “I saw this a lot in Morocco. Children abusing and terrorizing cats. Are they taught to behave like this?” Even tripadvisor plays host to comments from worried cat-lovers. “Read some tips on Essaouira on TA and says there’s a problem with stray and injured cats in the city…It really does upset me if I see injured animals , I understand all countries have strays though, so can anyone update me on the situation. Is it really terrible there with stray and injured cats, and dogs ?” The tripadvisor community were quick to assure the upset tourist that several European cat charities already operate in the area.  A friend of mine even cancelled her trip to Essaouira, just weeks before my wedding, partly because she was afraid she would be unable to bear the plight of the stray cats and partly because of  worries about food poisoning from the freshly caught fish. I was, I have to say, disappointed and surprised by the squeamish and superior attitude to the country in which I have chosen to live. What I see here, and recognize sometimes in myself, is privilege. The privilege that comes from growing up in a stable society, with access to a high level of education, and the mobility that comes with financial security. This privilege makes us forget that not all societies follow the norms of those we have grown up in, and that our view on the world and how things should be done is not necessarily the only one.  But can “white privilege” really be anything to do with cats? It’s definitely a blurred line, but the assumption seems to be that Morocco needs European tourists and residents to deal with their street cats, and that Moroccan people and authorities are not capable of addressing the issue without the input of a “white saviour.” Moroccan society has a different view of cats and dogs from that of the UK, or France. For example. while I allow my little Jack Russel terrier free reign in my house, my Moroccan parents-in-law see dogs as guard animals, not to be permitted inside. They have two, very well fed, well cared for dogs which are not allowed inside the house due to concerns about cleanliness.  Meanwhile, my neighbors regularly feed local strays and our lane is a hub of activity for kittens and cats of all shapes and sizes. Our dog has a particular rivalry with a large ginger tomcat who seems to rule the neighborhood. However, these cats are not domestic animals and are not permitted inside the houses.  Obviously, my backyard is not representative of Morocco in its entirety but, hopefully this does give an insight into the different, and still valid, attitudes to animals. Not only do the cat saviours dismiss the validity of a different cat culture, it could be said that they prioritise it over the everyday needs of Moroccan people. Meanwhile, Moroccans themselves may feel they have bigger fish to fry than stray cats. Just in Essaouira medina it is clear that some families struggle to feed themselves. Some might say that the huge social and educational disparities need to be addressed before the perceived cat crisis. To be clear, I am not disparaging concern for animal welfare, or dismissing it as a non-issue; only questioning the presumption that Morocco and Moroccans are in need of outside input. There is definitely a place for international associations, be they addressing stray cats, poverty, or literacy, but these must be in cooperation with Moroccan authorities, Moroccan people, and with a full, and balanced understanding of the culture and society with which they are dealing. And, as for my cat-loving friend, who knows whether she will ever bring herself to make the journey to beautiful Essaouira and share a fresh fish tagine with some local felines, but, for my part, I hope that she will be able to come, with an open-mind, and appreciate a culture that is different, but no less valid, than her own.

Rabat – Weeks after both houses of the Moroccan Parliament adopted the controversial Law 51.17 on education and the change of the language of instruction, Morocco’s Education Minister, Said Amzazi, is calling for local authorities to “effectively implement” the new education bill by the start of the upcoming academic year. In a number of official letters addressed to school authorities across Morocco in the weeks since the new bill received parliamentary approval, Amzazzi has made it his personal mission to counter the pile of criticism leveled at the education bill from conservative circles. While Law 51-17 is officially said to be about rehabilitating Morocco’s stuttering public schools and making the country’s educational system “socially inclusive” and more competitive at the global level, the document’s articles 2 and 31 drew poignant criticism from conservative Moroccans. The two articles insist on the “necessity” and “opportunity” of changing the language of instruction for scientific subjects from Arabic to French. Critics, mainly political and media figures whose political stance is mostly a blend of nationalism and Islamism, have widely interpreted the two articles as the culmination of a cultural and social capitulation to France. Effectively adopting French in public amounts to pandering to France, critics have maintained. In his instructions to local authorities across Morocco, however, Amzazi dismissed what he sees as reactionary attitudes from critics. The minister insisted that, regardless of the continued criticism, the provisions of the new law should be “effectively implemented” as early as the 2019-2020 academic year. Where critics see the basis for sustaining the colonial hegemony of France through the Moroccan Francophone elite ruling over masses of Moroccans with no or a tenuous command of the French language, Amzazi sees the opportunity to “invest in the future of the Moroccan youth” in a fast-moving, technology and innovation-driven, globalized world. As in his earlier defense of the contentious bill, Amzazi consistently pointed out in his instructions that the bill is actually meant to curb the traditionally widening performance gap between Moroccan students, further the 2015-2030 “strategic vision” for inclusive education, and equip Moroccan students to rise to the challenges of a globalized world economy. Amzazi’s apparent resolution to “effectively implement” the new regulations as soon as this academic year is perhaps a response to the equally strong-willed, resolved group of critics vowing to “thwart all ‘Francization’ attempts” in Morocco. Led by former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, the group of vocal critics against Law 51.17 suggested in a press statement on August 7 that the fight against the implementation of the new bill is a fight for the soul of Morocco. In the statement, the Benkirane-led group called on “all Moroccans to watch out for all threats to Morocco’s language, its identity, its civilization, and its glorious history.”

Rabat – Abdellatif Hammouchi,  head of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate of Territorial Security (DGST) arrived in Italy on Sunday, September 2 for an official working visit. Yassine Mansouri external intelligence agency  (DGED) accompanied Hammouchi, sources told Moroccan French-speaking news outlet Le360. The two senior officials are expected to hold talks with Italian counterparts on security. State-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has not yet posted news on the visit. Morocco’s security services have international partnerships with several countries, including Spain, the US, and France. The countries have been collaborating in several fields in security, including counterterrorism and the fight against radicalization and extremism. The 2018  Country Reports on Terrorism from the US Departement of State said that, “Following the August attacks in Barcelona, Morocco assisted the Spanish investigation and promised to expand cooperation to track terrorists of Moroccan origin radicalized abroad.” The report also explained the cooperation between Morocco’s security services, including the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation, DGST, and DGSN. “Law enforcement officials and private carriers worked regularly with the United States to detect and deter individuals attempting to transit illegally and to address watchlisted or mala fide travelers,” read the report. Hammouchi’s policies in the security field are also well-recognized at the international level. Jeune Afrique said earlier this year that Hammochi is the mastermind of Morocco’s efficient anti-terrorism mechanism. It also listed him as one of Africa’s most influential personalities in 2019, describing him as the “nightmare of terrorists.” In 2018, Spanish news outlet El Pais  also paid tribute to Hammouchi, describing him as “the man who never sleeps.”

Rabat – A wildfire that started last Thursday, August 29, is still ravaging Achacha-Tassift forest, in the Chefchaouen province (north of Morocco). The fires have damaged around 65 hectares of forest so far, announced the regional director of Water, Forests, and the Fight Against Desertification (HCEFLCD) in Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, Abdelaziz Hajjaji. “Members of the regional delegation of HCEFLCD, Civil Protection, Auxiliary Forces, Royal Armed Forces, and local authorities are combining their efforts to control the wildfire”, explains Hajjaji. He added that two “Canadair” planes have been deployed to support the efforts of the security and emergency services at the scene. “All air and land assets are mobilized to extinguish the fires,” added Hajjaji. However, fire trucks face difficulties accessing the fire zone because of the mountainous landscape. Planes also cannot be deployed in the early mornings because of dense mist obstructing their view. The wildfire may cause still more damage if the authorities do not manage to control the flames. The National Center for Forest Climate Risk Management released a report on April 11, 2018, stating that around 841 hectares of forest were damaged by a total of 343 wildfires in Morocco, during 2018.

Rabat – Morocco had 2.5% more in total international reserves as of August 23 than it did at the same time in 2018. Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al Maghrib, reported that the country has MAD 232 billion in international currencies, according to state-owned media Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  During the week of August 22-28, over the time of the G7 summit in France, the dirham gained by 0.23% against the euro and by 0.10% against the dollar. The week marked escalations in the trade war between the US and China and concerns about a recession in the German economy. In the last year, the dirham has gradually been strengthening against the euro. At the same time, the dirham has slightly weakened against the dollar. Morocco embarked on a plan to float the dirham and gradually move away from set exchange rates in January 2018. However, in January 2019, the government decided to postpone further exchange rate changes because of Morocco’s debt. One official, speaking to Bloomberg on condition of anonymity, said making the dirham exchange rate flexible might hurt Moroccan international currency reserves due to an “unpredictable global trade environment and no expected pick-up commerce with major partners in Europe.” Two other officials said further changes may wait until 2020.

Rabat – Starting this month, private sector employees who receive benefits from the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) will see their family benefits increased. For up to three children, parents will receive MAD 300 instead of 200 annually. The CNSS board approved the increases on July 17. On Thursday, August 29, the Government Council endorsed the act, which amends Law 2.08.358.   On April 25, Morocco’s major trade unions, the government, and the Federation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) came to an agreement through social dialogue on reforms, including the increases in CNSS benefits. The increased benefits go into effect in September but will be retroactive to July. Approximately 1.12 million CNSS beneficiaries will be eligible for the family benefit. Despite the increased payouts, employees will not have to pay more into CNSS from their monthly salary. CNSS will also cover more medical expenses than before. It will reimburse consumers for 90% of the cost of generic drugs, 100% of medical devices, and 70-80% of medical care. The fund will also increase the maximum payouts for certain medical products, such as eyeglasses and dentures. Increased benefits, the government hopes, will improve the purchasing power of private sector employees and give them more of a cushion against financial trouble. The government expects to spend MAD 7.8 billion on the benefits this year, an increase from MAD 5.5 billion in 2018.  CNSS expenses have been steadily increasing. The fund began running a “technical” deficit in 2018 and will face a “total deficit” in 2027, according to Morocco’s Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CECE). Barring reform, CNSS will exhaust its reserves by 2044. However, the Oxford Business Group believes CNSS’s bankruptcy is imminent and could happen as soon as 2021.

Rabat – Spanish news outlet El Faro De Ceuta reported that Spanish police have arrested four British suspects for their alleged involvement in an international drug trafficking network. The suspects were allegedly smuggling cannabis from Morocco to Marbella, Spain. Police seized €100,000 during the arrest operation. The police also found 1,500 kilograms of cannabis during the arrest operation. The suspects owned a boat that they used to transport drugs from Morocco to Marbella.

Rabat – On Friday, August 2, the Urban District of Casablanca launched a call for tenders, looking for a company to  “construct reading kiosks in the public gardens of the city of Casablanca.” Once the tenders are submitted, the selected company will be responsible for the construction and layout work of the kiosks, such as masonry, electrical connections, waterproofing, plumbing, carpentry, plastering, and painting. There will be 16 of these outdoor reading spaces and kiosks, one in each area of the city. The project will cost a total of MAD 1.8 million. Candidate companies have until September 17 to submit their bids. The project follows a report from Morocco’s Social Economic and Environmental Council (CESE) in July that said that a concerted national strategy must be established to promote reading throughout life. The report, entitled “Promoting Reading, an Urgency and Necessity” recommended that national conferences be held to develop an integrated and shared public policy that promotes reading. Additionally, CESE proposed that local authorities across Morocco set aside a budget to promote reading, as well as to promote the production and distribution of books by putting in place incentives to support the publishing sector. In Morocco, illiteracy is still prevalent, with 32.2% of Morocco’s population older than 10 years of age being considered illiterate. Illiteracy affects women more than men. 42.1% of Moroccan women and 22.1% of men were recorded as illiterate in 2014. Rural populations are also more affected, with 57% of illiterate people coming from rural areas as opposed to the lower percentage of 43% from urban areas. Although literacy has seen a dramatic rise in recent years, with an increase of 12% between 2009 and 2015, there is still a long way to go.

Rabat – Moroccan police at the Ceuta border crossing  arrested a French-Turkish national for alleged links to international drug trafficking network on Saturday, August 31. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the police arrested the suspect on the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by French authorities on July 29.

Rabat – The administration of the Tangier 2 local prison denied allegations that Hirak Rif detainee Karim Amghar has been on a hunger strike for a week. In a statement quoted by Maghreb Arab Press on August 30, the administration described the allegations as “unfounded.” The statement added that the prisoner did not send any “notification in this regard,” adding that the detainee has been taking his meals regularly. “He is in good health, underlining that the allegations about a week-long hunger strike by this detainee are baseless,” the statement added. The administration continues that spreading such false news éraises questions about the motives of those who invent and disseminate them on social networks, without taking into account how determinantal this could be on the concerned detainees and their families.” Local media, including Hespress, reported that the committee for support and solidarity with the detainees of Hirak Rif said confirmed that “the detained activists have been on a hunger strike since August 23.” Amghar is among the 54 Hirak Rif detainees who were sentenced in June 2018. The court sentenced Amghar to 10 years in prison for participating in “unauthorized protests” and for “undermining the internal security.” The court gave sentences ranging from 1 to 20 years.  The court’s decision resulted in protests in the northern city of Al Hoceima, where the Hirak protests broke out in 2016 and 2017. Protesters condemned social disparities and the death of Mohcine Fikri, a fishmonger who was crushed in a garbage truck in 2016 while he was trying to retrieve confiscated goods.

Rabat – Contractual teachers in Morocco have returned to the streets to protest again four days before the school starts for the 2019-2020 academic year. Hundreds of contractual teachers are flocking in Rabat streets, calling on the government to integrate them in the public sector. The teachers were chanting several slogans, including “no to contracts,” “we want integration,” and “we will not give up.” The teachers, who called themselves “the forcibly contracted educators” have been rallying in the streets since February 20. They suspended the strikes on April 29 after the National Coordination of the “Forcibly Contracted Teachers” issued a statement, stating that teachers decided to go back to work to preserve students’ interests. The teachers started their protests just four days before the 2019-2020 school season starts. Throughout the protests, the teachers called to be hired into the public sectors. Demonstrators ale also calling for the abolishment of fixed-term contracts, demanding the end of “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers. In 2016, the Moroccan government began hiring teachers under annually renewable contacts.

Rabat – Morocco will chair the Peace and Security Council of the African Union for the month of September. This is the first time for Morocco to take the presidency of the body since its return to the African Union in 2017. Morocco was voted onto the AU Peace and Security Council for a two-year term in 20018. The body’s role is to contribute to the promotion of peace and stability on the continent. Permanent representative of Morocco at the AU and the Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) Mohammed Arrouchi told Maghreb Arab Press that the “Moroccan presidency of the Peace and Security Council of the AU will be an opportunity to realize the Royal Vision of the African joint action on peace and security as an essential condition for a sustainable development for the continent.” The diplomat also recalled the challenges hindering the development of the continent, including climate change, migration, epidemics, violent extremism, and cybersecurity.” He added that such threats are among the many themes that Morocco take as a priority to tackle. “The Moroccan presidency of the Peace and Security Council of the AU attaches paramount importance to the interdepartmental coordination within the pan-African institution to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the African joint action on peace and security,” he said. Arrouchi also recalled King Mohammed VI’s speech after Morocco’s official return to the AU at the 28th  AU Summit held in Addis Ababa in January, 2017. The King promised that Morocco will contribute to the peace and development of the continent in multiple ways. “You will see: as soon as the Kingdom becomes a member and is able to contribute to the agenda of activities, its action will, on the contrary, help bring about unity and progress,” the monarch said in his speech.

Rabat – Vegetable Couscous is prepared in most Moroccan households every Friday, to be eaten after Friday prayers. Families unite around the huge couscous dish once a week and enjoy the taste of tradition. While modern families enjoy couscous with a fork or spoon, some older Moroccans eat with their hands, rolling one-handed balls of couscous. A far cry from the dehydrated, just-add-water couscous of European supermarkets, Moroccan couscous is steamed as many as three times for a fluffy, moist texture. As with most traditional Moroccan recipes, the methods of preparation and ingredients differ from region to region, and from family to family. In the southeast of Morocco, Amazigh people prepare couscous with kale which is abundantly available in this region. In the spring and summer months, rural communities cultivate kale and use it as a key ingredient for their Friday couscous. In winter, it is the fava bean season and many families choose to include the bean as the special ingredient for their couscous. In the atlas region, women prepare couscous with pumpkin and zucchini and adding milk to the gravy before serving. Another lovely couscous recipe is “tefaya,” it is decorated with honey onions and raisins. While it is usually served as at ceremonies and parties, many families choose to cook this type of couscous every Friday. Today I’m going to show you how I make vegetable and lamb couscous. You will need a couscous pot. I should tell you, this is not a simple process and will take some time and concentration. Here’s what you’ll need: 500 g of medium couscous
1 kg of lamb meat
4 carrots, peeled cut lengthwise
3 turnips, peeled and cut lengthwise
250g of fava beans, peeled
2 medium squares of pumpkin
Some roughly chopped cabbage
2 zucchinis
1 cup of chickpeas, tinned or soaked overnight
2 tomatoes, grated
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro and parsley
1 tablespoon of butter
1 teaspoon of black pepper
1 teaspoon of turmeric
1 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of ginger
Pinch of saffron threads
½ cup of olive oil
Enough water (about 3 liters) Now you’re ready to start cooking: In the couscous pot, put oil and onion, meat and cook for 5 minutes on a medium heat.
Add grated tomatoes and chopped parsley and cilantro, stir, and let cook for another 5 minutes. As a trick, I add some grated pumpkin to give the gravy a good taste and make it thick.
Add vegetables, spices, and water to cover the vegetables. (Zucchini and pumpkin may be added later since they don’t take a long time to be cooked). Leave the pot on medium heat until boiling. Meanwhile, you can start preparing your couscous: Place couscous in large plate or using Gasaa (Moroccan couscous plate). sprinkle with 1/4 liter of water and separate the grains by gently rubbing them between and add two tablespoons of oil. Place couscous inside the steamer and put it on the boiling couscous pot. The steam will rise from the couscous. Let couscous steam for 15 minutes and remove it into a large bowl, and separate the grains again by rubbing them gently between your palms or with fork while.
Sprinkle some cold water, separate the grains. Return the couscous in the steamer to steam again for about 45 minutes. Decant the couscous into the large bowl and sprinkle some cold water, for the last time, and gently break all the lumps with a fork and let rest for 10 minutes. Add 2 tablespoon of oil, butter, and a pinch of salt to the couscous and mix well. Replace the couscous in the steamer and put it on the pot. steam until the steam rise from the top for 5 minutes. The couscous is ready. Now tip couscous onto a large dish or gasaa, add the meat in the middle, then place the vegetables decoratively on top of the couscous. Add sauce till it is soaked enough.
Now it’s time to serve, enjoy with family and friends. If you feel brave enough, try eating with one hand!

Rabat – Mount Toubkal, at 4127 meters above sea level (ASL), is recognized as the highest peak of the Atlas Mountains. Its summit is also the highest point in North Africa.  The altitude is respectable, yet the mountain isn’t technically interesting for most professional climbers. Still, if your goal is to climb the world’s most prominent summits, you should add it to your bucket list! So let’s say you decide to climb Mount Toubkal. This means that in the near future you are going to take your body to a height of over 4000 metersASL, and in 99% of cases, this will be your first experience staying at such a height. Sounds exciting, right? Here are some top tips for a safe and successful climb up North Africa’s highest peak. Get Acclimatized:  The number of days required to climb Mount Toubkal depends on the route you choose. Some routes are faster (two days), and are slower (six or more days). The classic route (Imlil – Toubkal Refuge – Toubkal summit) requires two days.  It is best to negotiate with your travel agency and ask them to extend your climbing program to at least three days. An extra acclimation day will improve your chances of successfully climbing the mountain, and will facilitate greater ease on the summit day. If you climb too fast at high elevations, you may have difficulty with the lower oxygen pressure. You risk altitude sickness, which can jeopardize your journey.  You will have to pay a little money for the extra day, but it is much more affordable to add an extra day right out of the gate than to return to Morocco for a second attempt.  You will also have a unique opportunity to visit local attractions, which are not covered by the standard two day climbing program. The best route to take is the Toubkal ascent via Azzaden valley. It has excellent scenery and fewer crowds. This beautiful route takes three days and vastly increases the chances of a successful summit. Take it Slow:  When taking on a challenge like Mount Toubkal, remember the golden rule: “slow and steady.” It may mean a huge difference between turning back early and successfully making it to the summit.   Adjusting to the lower oxygen pressure in the mountains takes time, and it is essential to be gentle with your body. Don’t race to the next campsite – it doesn’t help at all to be first. Take your time and enjoy the scenery. For the majority of the trek, you should walk at a pace that allows you to carry on a conversation with your team. On summit night, you will adopt an even slower pace, taking a rest step in-between each step to preserve your energy.   Rest-stepping is a technique commonly used by professional mountaineers to help them reach the summits of mountains such as Everest and Kilimanjaro. It really does the job. Energy for chatting on summit night will be sparse, so remember to breathe in through the nose, and breathe out through the mouth slowly. Train for Your Trek:  Altitude may be crucial in a successful climb, so being fit and in good physical condition is essential. We understand that training can be hard to fit into a busy daily routine, but when you’re faced with a 10-hour hike up and down Toubkal, you’ll thank yourself for preparing your body, especially your legs.  Here are some tips on how to boost your fitness: Gear Up:  Many experts have provided comprehensive packing and equipment lists for Mount Toubkal so we’re not going to repeat these. However, see our top five “other” things to bring,  basically to keep your sanity intact: Choose a Good Company:  An experienced guide knows how to set the right pace for the group. He or she knows how to notice and treat altitude sickness.  The guide understands how to improve your chances of reaching the summit successfully and safely. Perhaps most importantly, good guides can coordinate a rescue in emergency situations because they have been trained in safety protocols. It is often tempting to choose the lowest price when making booking decisions. Resist this temptation when it comes to climbing Toubkal.  This is about you making it to the top and coming back home safe and sound. Cheap or unknown companies cannot be relied upon for safe and quality services. One highly experienced company to reach out to is High Atlas Hiking. The company is staffed by local, licensed mountain guides. Since they are locals, they know the area well and can be sure you’re experiencing the best the area has to offer. Treat Yourself: At high altitude, people tend to lose their appetite.  Even with the extreme levels of exertion, getting the calories to keep you going can be an extremely difficult task. You can’t let the loss of appetite take you down! We advise you to bring some of your favourite high-calorie snacks for your climb. High Atlas Hiking will feed you very well, but you may sometimes crave comfort snacks from home. The idea is to pack goodies you will eat even if you don’t have an appetite. Yes, junk food and candies are totally fine! Don’t worry, you will burn off every last calorie. The treats help provide the energy you need for that extra push to make it to the top. Make sure to pack things that don’t melt or freeze. Chocolate, nuts, hard candy, and protein bars are some of the most common snacks climbers bring. Be Determined: Getting to the top of Mount Toubkal has a lot to do with determination and motivation. Keeping a high spirit is essential for success. There will likely be a point during the summit attempt where you may feel like giving up. You might be feeling really sick, tired, and exhausted. Be prepared for that! At that lowest point it is important that you remain motivated, remember why you decided to do it, and stick to your goals to get to the top – one step at a time. The satisfaction after making it to the top is unbeatable!
