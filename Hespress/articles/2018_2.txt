Rabat – Once seen as an underdog, “a little David with no winning chances against three Goliaths”, Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup is now seen as a serious challenger, a bid capable of turning the tables around, of unsettling the once over-confident giants, of claiming—deservedly—a victory that many had thought impossible. In fact, it already has. That is at least the conclusion ESPN seems to have suggested in a recent article on the seriousness of the Moroccan challenge. ESPN reports that “a confluence of events and circumstances in recent months” has proved to be unsettling for the once firm and solid US-led North American bid. Instead, ESPN said, the joint North American bid is turning out to be shakier and less firm than most observers thought. “There is no denying that the race is far from a foregone conclusion,” the report said, almost rueful that a contender that did not threaten much is now not just threatening the North American bid, but “can actually beat it.” All indicators, the report said, are suggesting that the Us-led bid is in jeopardy. Even Sunil Gulati, the former president of US Football federation and now leading the North American joint bid, acknowledges that Morocco is a tougher challenge than many had anticipated. “We’ve never taken anything for granted in this process,” Gulati reportedly told ESPN, adding: “We understand that in a competitive election—and that is what it is—a lot of different things go into a decision.” Among the reasons for the likely defeat of the US-led bid, some reports have cited the technical component of the new voting procedure, the fact that on June 13, it is the national federations that will decide on the fate of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. African federations, emboldened by the unapologetic support of CAF’s chief executive for Morocco’s bid, are set to overwhelmingly cast their vote for the Kingdom. As for South American national federations, ESPN says that a great majority of them are still thought to be holding grudges against recent US justice department-led corruption investigations that targeted and exposed many of their executives. And so they’re said to be more inclined to vote for Morocco to host the 2026 World Cup. Should the vote be cast right now, considering Africa’s bloc vote, the bulk of South America, and a considerable number of Asian federations –mostly Arab and Muslim countries, Morocco would definitely emerge as the triumphant side, an influential FIFA official under conditions of anonymity reportedly told ESPN. While these make sense, and will indeed be determining in the impending possible success story of Morocco’s bid, there is more to the story than the technical side. On February 22, former FIFA executive Sepp Blatter expressed support for Morocco’s World Cup dream, saying in a twitter post: “It is time for Africa again.” Although many football fans, including many Moroccans, questioned the significance and the weight that the words of a dismissed executive could carry, many high-ranking football officials are reported to have reached the same conclusion as Blatter. But while some officials are motivated by an-Africa-deserves-better mentality, there seems to be, according to ESPN, something much more basic at play in the now likely debacle of the North American bid: Donald Trump. “At this particular moment in time, does the world want to give something nice to the USA?” asked ESPN in its report, clearly suggesting the rampant Anti-American sentiments perceptible all around the world. American football officials are reported to have said that when they visit with other national federations to promote their joint 2026 bid, technical questions—pertaining to stadiums, hotels, and all other infrastructures-are evaded, sidelined. Instead, what federations ask is: “Can the US be considered a friendly place for foreigners?” But while the now shaky American bid is good news to Moroccan football fans, CAF’s executive Ahmad Ahmad has told Moroccan federation that something much more substantial needs to be done: Communication. Which is exactly what officials in charge of managing Morocco’s bid are reported to be doing. At a recent football convention in Bratislava, Moroccan federation dispatched dozens of officials in order to present and market the strengths and merits of Morocco 2026. Speaking to the press on what Moroccan officials had achieved there, an official told the press: “They were not there for the weather.” Now that the ‘lone North African bidder’ is challenging the giant North American bid, many are waking up to something that Moroccan officials have been saying since the beginning of the whole story: The Kingdom has potentials to host a major tournament, and did not bid for the sake of bidding.

Rabat – Naima Lahrouri, one of the alleged victims who filed against Taoufik Bouachrine for his alleged sexual misconduct, has broken her silence to speak about her alleged experience. Lahrouri is the first woman who filed a complaint against Bouachrine for alleged sexual assault. In a Facebook post, Lahrouri, also a journalist, explained that she was the victim of sexual assault,forced on her by Bouachrine. “I filed a complaint because I was assaulted by Bouachrine (…) an attack accompanied by rape, coercion, intimidation, and threats,” she wrote. Lahrouri said that it took a lot of courage before filing a complaint against Bouachrine, especially since “many of the components of society, unfortunately, do not do justice to women.” “It would have been embarrassing to keep silent and not defend my dignity,” she said.  “I do not care if Bouachrine is in the media market. I do not care who likes him and who doesn’t. I do not care if the state has a feud with him,” said Lahrouri , who is currently a member of the National Rally of Independents party after running for the Socialist Union of Popular Forces party. “I only care that he sexually harassed me. I have the right to demand that he gets punished by law,” she said. Lahrouri expressed pride at being the first woman to file a complaint against Bouachrine, which, according to her, allowed other victims to speak up against him. Yesterday, journalist Kholoud Al-Jabri, one of the victims of his alleged sexual misconduct, made a video appearance and said that Bouachrine “did not rape me, but attempted to.” She explained that Bouachrine had allegedly tried to kiss and grab her. “But I always reject,” she said. Sometimes, she added, “he would use violence and force against me.” When she refused him, he began criticizing her work. “I had a program dubbed ‘The Other Face’ and he shut it down, to press me to give him what he wanted,” she said. Several women in Bouachrine’s circle of friends and colleagues were summoned by the Public Prosecutor as part of the ongoing investigation of charges that have been filed against him. His lawyer, Mohammed Ziane, said that the number of women contacted so far is about 30. According to a communiqué published Monday by the Prosecutor General Office, Bouachrine appears in 50 different videos, showing him with female victims of his sexual misconduct. The same communiqué noted that “Bouachrine is being prosecuted for human trafficking, rape, and sexual assault.”

Rabat – The recent ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the European Union (EU)-Morocco fisheries deal has sparked controversy and provoked angry rebukes from Moroccan analysts, who have deemed the decision to be biased against Morocco. On Tuesday, February 27, ECJ decided that the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco is, “ valid insofar as it is not applicable to Western Sahara or to its adjacent waters.” The court added that if the EU and Morocco included the Western Sahara region in their agreement, this action would be against certain rules of “international law that are applicable to relations between the EU and Kingdom of Morocco.” Fishery ties between Morocco and the European Union date back to 1988. Negotiated four years ago, the fisheries agreement provides annual permits without restriction, according to the European Union. Since that time, partnerships between the two entities have expanded to involve protocols from different fields, including trade activities. Legal experts and analysts have been raising concerns about the ECJ move, warning the court to not exceed its legal mandate by giving a political dimension to the issue of the EU-Morocco agreement. The court, however, appears to have ignored the warnings issued by legal experts.According to Moroccan professor of international law Reda El-Fellah, the court “has exceeded the scope and the framework of the matter to be judged.” Referring to Western Sahara, the court had said that the region has been “occupied by Morocco, which considers it to be an integral part of its territory.” Condemning the court’s identification, El-Fellah said that, “the ruling uses the term ‘occupation,’ which has never been used or found in any UN decision nor in any international document with respect to the Sahara issue.” The political analyst also told Morocco World News that the ECJ’s decision contradicts general international law—adding that it specifically violates the portions regarding self-determination. The Moroccan analyst added that the judgment consists an obvious, “breach of the international law of self-determination since it considers Morocco an ‘occupying power. “To be sure, all UN resolutions and the UN’s practices during the post-colonial era have defined a right for self-determination as strictly conferred to people based on geography, ethnicity, and culture, or people under racial discrimination or exploitation (see UN resolutions 15/14 and 15/41 In 1962, and Res 26/25 in 1970),” said the analyst. Pro-Polisario Verdict? The Polisario Front has long been appealing against the EU-Morocco agreements, urging the Court of Justice to intervene. On January 10, the Advocate General at the ECJ, Wathelet Melchior, issued an opinion statement on the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, saying that the deal should be declared null and void because it includes the Western Sahara. The opinion of Melchior appeared to be similar to the decision taken by the ECJ on Tuesday, February 27,— though that Morocco’s Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Aziz Akhannouch, denied the similarity of statements. Akhannouch believes that the court did not follow Melchior’s recommendations and has not, “clearly stated  that there is a ban on fishing in the waters of southern provinces.” However, El-Fellah has said that the judgment is politically biased and impinges on UN prerogatives. The UN  is the only international body charged with the resolution of the conflict. “The ECJ argues that the expression ‘territory of Morocco’ doesn’t include the territory of Western Sahara. This conclusion is based on a fallacy and without any legal reference.” Morocco’s Reaction The EU agreement judgment sparked a strong reaction from the Moroccan government. In an interview with Moroccan news outlet Le360, Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said that,  “nothing in this verdict challenges the political legitimacy of Morocco to conclude with EU agreements.” The CJEU has not taken the conclusions of its first general advocate,” certifies Bourita, noting that the high court of the EU has at no time “invalidated” the Morocco-EU fisheries agreement. According to Bourita, the ECJ has not followed conclusions made by the court’s General Advocate, Wathelet Melchior. Bourita has also reaffirmed the strategic partnership that links between Morocco and EU in different levels—stating that the two parties will continue to work to consolidate their cooperation and fisheries’ ties. ECJ has no Power to Decide the Agreement Legality In his interview with Morocco World News, El-Fellah has echoed statements made by legal experts about the agreement and its legality. Many experts maintain that ECJ does not under any circumstances have the legal expertise to demand the annulment of an international agreement. According to former policy advisor at the European Parliament, Jeanne Laperrouza, only the EU and UN are competent enough to address the annulation of an international agreement. El-Fellah has sided with Laperrouza, emphasizing that, “the ECJ court does not have the authority to conclude that Sahara waters do  not fall within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Morocco.” Reinforcing his argument, the Moroccan analyst added that the judgment,  “ implies that Morocco would conclude its international agreements with a breach of territorial integrity! Which is inconceivable.” In response to the court’s decision regarding the validity of the agreement, El-Fellah has said that “the fishing agreement would be right to include all territories that fall within the sovereignty and the jurisdiction of Morocco; otherwise it would not be valid at all.”

Rabat – Fouzi Lekjaa, President of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation, has broken his silence to express his opinion regarding the remarks made by President of FIFA Gianni Infantino, who urged the Confederation of African Football (CAF) earlier this month to remain neutral in the selection process for the 2026 World Cup host. In an interview with Moroccan newspaper Al Massae, Lekjaa said “just two days before the General Assembly of the CAF, FIFA has issued a circular letter addressed to the 211 members’ federations, asking them to remain neutral” in the selection process of the 2026 World Cup host. FIFA’s remarks, however, did not stop CAF from expressing its full support for Morocco’s bid and “did not prevent it from making its position clear during its General Assembly.” CAF’s 40th Ordinary General Assembly took place on February 2 in Casablanca, with FIFA president Infantino and CAF’s President, Ahmad Ahmad, in attendance. Speaking at the event, Ahmad said, “I can reassure you that I will not be neutral. I say it loud and clear.” His statements come in response to the Infantino’s “neutrality.” In December 2017, Infantino expressed his support for the North American bid, saying that, “Joint biddings are certainly positive.” FIFA’s president also said at a conference in Dubai, “Let me say one more thing, to have Canada, U.S., and Mexico coming together for a joint project, already this is a positive message,” reported American news outlet The New York Times. Addressing the attendees of the event, Infantino said, “I ask you to do everything possible to make the process as healthy as possible. It is about our credibility.” When asked if Infantino has been backing the three-nation North American bid, Lekjaa said, “the important thing for Morocco is that the federations, which are set to vote for their favorable bid, will do it through a transparent vote.” FIFA’s decision will be announced on June 13, a day before the launch of the 2018 World Cup, which will take place in Russia next summer. Around 221 national soccer federations from around the world will meet in Moscow in June to decide between Morocco and the USA/Canada/Mexico joint bid for the host of the 23rd FIFA World Cup. The candidates’ files must meet FIFA’s technical terms, including infrastructure and commercial criteria.

Rabat – Female Chinese  cyclist, Huang Shuang, cycled from Casablanca, Morocco, clear to Lagos, Nigeria. What is even more impressive is that she completed her trip within five months! On Monday, February 26th, Shuang  told the news agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos o that she is convinced that anybody can achieve anything if they are determined enough  Shuang states, “I am glad that I have also been able to ride from Morocco to Lagos, Nigeria. This is an indication that, irrespective of our sex, we can all achieve anything we set out to do. “My whole idea to cycle  started when, one day, I decided to embark on a cycling trip around my country, China. “After my trip around China, I was motivated to take my cycling to the other side of the world— to America, where I covered about 5,500 km in two months. “Now, I have cycled to  Lagos from Morocco, after I flying from America to France, where I cycled around Europe for four months, before taking a ferry from Spain to Morocco.” The trip began on September 6th, 2017. The cyclist says  that she always travels with money, noodles, a tent, a sleeping bag, extra clothes, and a bicycle-repair kit.  Shuang adds g that her trip was fascinating. She experienced fatigue, robbery, crashes,  and sometimes had to sleep under bridges and inside gas stations. Shuang  told NAN that she crossed the Sahara desert within six days, stumbling upon many African villages where she was well-received, and able to share meals with  the local villagers. “I happily sung and danced with children in different African villages and communities where I passed the nights or stopped to cook. “I have seen the most beautiful sunsets, the most stunning mountain views, and the most breathtaking lakes and virgin forests across Africa.My trip has also exposed me to many African children still living in poverty, hunger, and without education and basic amenities,’’ Shuang reflects. The Chinese cyclist has said she would bike to about 33 more countries over the next three years, adding that she would continue to cycle through the African continent, from Lagos to Cameroon, Gabon, the Congo, Angola, Namibia, South Africa, and other parts of the world.

Rabat – Usually, teams contending in the same tournament follow each others’ performances very closely. Their aim is to gain a better grasp of their opponent’s strengths and weaknesses.  Three months before the official launching of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, the scramble for the two qualifying spots has already begun. Morocco’s soccer team, the “Atlas Lions,” is one of the teams categorized as “Group B,” along with Portugal, Spain, and Iran. Only two of the four countries will qualify to play at FIFA. In this “group of death”   made up of four countries, wariness of opponents e has apparently taken a form of seriousness that borders on “spying,” Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported in its February 27th edition. According to the daily newspaper, the other teams in Group B will not only be watching Morocco take on Serbia on March 23rd, but they will also be present at the stadium! Al Ahdath Al Maghribia stressed that all three opponents in Group Bhave made it known that they will dispatch teams of technical staff members to watch and evaluate Morocco’s performance against Serbia, which will take place in Turin. Carlos Queiroz, the Portuguese manager of Iran’s national football/soccer team, has delegated his first assistant Andrade Da Cruz to be on-site in Turin and to make a thorough evaluation of the game. Additionally, the coach of the Spanish national football team Julen Lopetegui and Portugal’s coach Fernando Santos.  As a reminder, the Atlas Lions will open their World Cup campaign by taking on Iran on June 15th, followed by the deadly and outcome-defining encounters with both Portugal and Spain—on June 20th  and 25th, respectively.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Tensions ran high at the 37th session of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday February 25 as Hungary demanded the resignation of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein. During the opening of the meeting, Zeid warned of rise of xenophobia across the European Union, specifically criticizing Poland and Hungary. “Xenophobes and racists in Europe are casting off any sense of embarrassment, like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who earlier this month said ‘we do not want our color … to be mixed in with others.'” Both Poland and Hungary have come into focus for their governments’ hardline on immigration. Last March, AFP reported that Orbán stressed “ethnic homogeneity” as vital to Hungary’s success. Last week, Orbán called on the EU to reimburse Hungary for the cost of securing its borders, claimed to be “not only protecting [Hungary], but Europe as well.” In Geneva, Zeid expressed concern over any society whose “leaders seek ethnic, national or racial purity.” However, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó took umbrige. He repudiated Zeid’s comments, calling them “unacceptable” and adding it was “obvious” that Zeid should resign. Szijjártó said that Hungary had “made the most in Europe against antisemitism” decades earlier and called Zeid’s comments “inappropriate,” adding that it was “obvious” in his eyes that the UN High Commissioner should resign. This is not the first time Zeid has placed himself at odds with the EU governments’ stances on the subject of migration. The Jordanian prince, who already announced that he will not seek a second term when his mandate expires in August, accused Europe of “hysteria” in a previous UN Human Rights Council meeting. Zeid also criticized anti-immigrant rhetoric in politics “spanning the length and breadth of the European continent.” However, it is election season in the European Union and migration will be a deciding factor in this year’s elections in Italy and Hungary. With far-right, anti-immigrant parties gaining ground, many activists and immigrants will see Orbán’s comments as representative of more than just his government’s opinions.

By Ahlam Ben Saga Rabat – After she was banned from singing in Egypt for “mocking” the Nile River, Egyptian Pop singer Sherine Abdel Wahab is now sentenced to six months imprisonment and fined for “insulting Egypt.” On Tuesday, February 27, the Egyptian Moqattam Misdemeanor Court sentenced famous Egyptian Pop singer, Sherine Abdel Wahab, known to her fans as “Sherine,” to six months in jail for “insulting Egypt” with scornful remarks about Nile River, reported Egypt Independent News outlet. The court also ordered Sherine to pay a fine of 5,000 EGP. In November 2017, a storm of outrage engulfed social media after a video was shared on Twitter. It showed Sherine making a joke at one of her concerts about Egypt’s Nile river when her audience requested her to sing her famous song “Mashrebtesh Men Nilha” (translation: “Have You Not Drunk from [Egypt’s] Nile”). During the twelve seconds segment of the video, Sherine quipped: “You’ll get bilharzia [translation: schistosomiasis] if you drink from [Egypt’s] Nile.”She then suggested that her audience drink Evian, a bottled mineral water brand. “It is better,” she said. While some Egyptian people criticized Sherine and vowed to stop listening to her songs, others supported and defended her.The video became a sensational subject, and the Egyptian Musicians Syndicate banned Sherine from singing for “insulting” her motherland. The Egyptian Ministry of Health responded to Sherine’s remark in the video, stating that it has long combated the parasitic disease that once plagued Egypt, and “reduced its prevalence to 0.2 percent,” reported the news outlet Egypt Today . Sherine apologized for her remarks, claiming that the video was recorded during her concert in the UAE city of Sharjah the previous year, and that her uttering such statements had been erased altogether from her memory.

Rabat – French-Moroccan film director Nabil Ayouch was born in Paris to a Muslim Moroccan father and a Jewish Tunisian mother. His lineage informs his work as a film director, complex layers of personal, cultural, social, and religious narratives that make his films innovative and engaging. Prior to the release of Horses of God in 2012, Ayouch had directed a handful of small- and medium-sized films and produced dozens of others. But Horses represented his arrival as a master storyteller. He followed up Horses with two more major films, Much Loved (2015) and Razzia (2017). The three films each capture so much about Morocco’s social complexity. I watched Horses of God and Much Loved on DVD. Many films can lose emotional impact when viewed on the small screen (laptops or TV). But both held my attention. Razzia is a rich full cinematic story, set mostly in Casablanca, that deserves viewing on the big screen. As a non-Moroccan who enjoys the cultural minutiae of this complex nation, some key aspects of his films have stayed with me. For me, the films help create relevant social narratives that inform where Morocco is in 2018 based on where Ayouch’s characters have been in his respective movies. The polished drama about alienation among a group of young men from the slums of Casablanca is based on the novel, The Stars of Sidi Moumen. The film won several awards, and was Morocco’s submission for the Academy Awards in 2013. Horses is great movie. It gives the viewer an intimate look at a depressing day-to-day existence that helps foster spiritual decay, emotional alienation and intolerance. Alienation is a prominent theme of the film, alienation from home, family and the larger society. Ayouch didn’t create a lecture piece on religious extremism. He created a great film that chronicles the destructive effects of stress on young men who see no future for themselves. A favorite scene of mine takes place when the main characters, having found a new sense of purpose and discipline from a small secretive group of devout men from the same neighborhood, travel to the countryside to escape the gloom and claustrophobia of the city. They relax in the fresh air and natural beauty of the countryside. For a few hours, they are free from the physical and emotional claustrophobia that would later doom them all. The gritty story chronicles the prostitution scene in Marrakesh through the stories of four female sex workers. While the film did address an important issue in Morocco (sex workers), it stumbled as a narrative story designed for the cinematic experience. The issues related to prostitution work overlap with many other public concerns, from health and disease prevention to gender equality. Much Loved only barely shed light on these issues. The women had, by the very nature of their clandestine work, become both heartbroken and hardened to the realities of their lives. If Ayouch had wanted to make a serious documentary on the sex industry, then his plot points for Much Loved would have provided a good roadmap. The movie chronicles all the emotional emptiness of temporary gratification but Ayouch didn’t give us an ending to humanize a harsh and emotionless industry. It focused on both the superficial glamour of the parties and the emotional emptiness that no doubt follow for the main characters. The film didn’t let us see a more complex existence that certainly would have included their hopes and dreams. Perhaps that was the lesson of the film. Released last fall in Europe and just recently in Rabat, the complex film follows multiple storylines as various characters face unrelenting pressure from each layer of Moroccan society: family, job, religion, traditional culture, modern life in social media world, etc. The film includes references to the classic 1942 film Casablanca. Like Ayouch’s other films, its wonderful cinema from a skilled storyteller. Bright colors during joyous scenes, low light and evening scenes during moments of crisis, conflict and tension. Razzia is a film in the same vein as Magnolia, a 1999 film from American director Paul Thomas Anderson. The tribulations of private lives intersect with the larger public world. And like Magnolia, Razzia stumbles as it moves toward a conclusion. The narrative of several characters is only partially revealed and he only hints at profound macro-level messages for Moroccan society rather than telling the audience anything profound. It’s still a very good film, revealing the tension that exists between tradition and modernity. The characters that Ayouch has created are wonderful and capture the complexity of Moroccan society in the 21st century. Traditional, modern, Arab, European, Amazigh, obedient, rebellious, pious, sinful. His characters are often uncomfortable in their surroundings, often out of place and out of time. Ayouch’s films explore cultural dislocation and emotional alienation, themes worth exploring not just in his chosen medium but in all society’s institutions.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a rousing message to participants in the National Forum on Senior Civil Service on Tuesday.  The text, which put innovation and practical solution proposals at the heart of modern public administration, reaffirmed the King’s “new development model”, his vision of a more “efficient” civil service, calling upon participants to uphold principles of integrity and fairness, and ensure accountability in Moroccan public service. As senior officials in the country’s public service, the King told participants, they play a central and key role in helping the country face emerging challenges, and have a solemn obligation to not only meet the growing and varying needs of Moroccan population, but to also make sure that the country’s public administration is in line with the demands and requirements of new realities. “Government agencies, at both central and local levels, are at a crossroads today. This means civil servants are expected to be actively involved in the country’s economic and social transformation process and support public policies and development projects in the country,” the King said, later reminding participants of what the goals of such a responsive and accountable civil service should be: “The aim is to meet citizens’ growing needs, promote social justice and guarantee a dignified life for all.” The king, although critical of the inefficiency and lack of “practical” proposals, which have been major problems in Morocco’s public administration, took the conference’s theme- Restructuring the Senior Civil Service – as an opportunity to reaffirm his unwavering faith in the existing human competence, while calling participants’ attention on the need to reform government services by ensuring an “optimal use of human resources.” In the face of new and emerging challenges, the King said, restructuring senior civil service is “an urgent matter” that will entail “upgrading performance”, improving available human resources, and promoting a “practical approach to local governance.” “What I want, in fact, is for the civil service to perform more efficiently, to be in step with the changes the country is witnessing, to adjust to global developments and to contribute to efforts to rise up to the development challenges facing our country.” While  reminding participants that his “new development model”, the blueprint for his aspirations for a more developed and confident Morocco, cannot be brought to fruition without the support of a “thoroughly and profoundly reformed civil service”, the King presented good governance as an indispensable ingredient of economic transformation, suggesting that senior civil servants-who he said “represent the elite that helps manage public affairs”-resist  corruption and be fully committed to “integrity, merit, transparency, and equal opportunity.” “The aim is to build an effective administrative model that would not only be compatible with the characteristics of the desired development model, but that would also help meet current and future needs,” the King’s message concluded, arguing that the implementation of the  new development model is dependent upon the espousal, especially by senior civil servants, of positive administrative values that uphold and foster a “result-oriented and contract-based” administrative culture, and promote “public interest, regional equity and social cohesion.”

Rabat – American and other Western tourists are sometimes accused of Orientalism when they visit Morocco or other Eastern countries. But Chinese are from the Orient! According to the UN Tourism Organization, China is now outspending the U.S in tourism. But there is nothing essentially political about it. China is already a digital and technological powerhouse. So it should not be surprising that its youth, and expanding middle class, thirsty for new experiences, especially overseas, want to revolutionize travelling, to set new rules. As we convened last Monday after our first morning classes to talk about how our weekends had gone—nothing is more thrilling to groups of exchange students than the narration of their adventures in their host countries—an American friend, from New Mexico, explained how he’d fallen in love with Meknes over the weekend. “It’s a small town,” he said, adding that although there was not much to visit and you could pretty much walk through the entire town in one day, “it was still a beautiful experience”. “It was beautiful, beautiful”, he stressed, before adding, in that American proclivity of repeating sentences: “I loved it! loved it!” “What about you? How was your weekend?” We kept asking one another, like a pack of over-enthusiastic primary school students, triggered by the thought of knowing what the others’ worlds look like, what they’re doing when not at school, when not going about their “boring” home works. “Awful. Awful. I mean Rabat is nice. I very much like it here. But the other day, I almost felt like being invaded by Chinese Tourists,” said another American friend as she explained, perhaps unaware of her somewhat hostile American reaction to China’s new-found global assertiveness, how a “flock of Chinese tourists had invaded” all the tourist places that she visited during that weekend. “They were everywhere. Taking group pictures and acting as though they were the only ones around, as if saying ‘hey everyone, we are the new boys in town,’” she said, visibly still dismayed at “the Chinese invaders.” And that’s where the new generation of Chinese travelers enters the picture. In the spring festival, Chinese tourists, once a rare breathing kind at Moroccan resorts, became the prevailing group, the new dish du jour in Morocco’s never-ending thriving tourism. They filled hotels, outspent and out-shopped other nationalities. Most important of all, they sent pictures to relatives (or shared them on social media) to encourage friends and acquaintances at home to join them, perhaps next time, in the Chinese tourist fray in the Kingdom. 500,000 Chinese tourists a year not an unattainable goal During the China-Morocco Tourism Forum held early February in Casablanca, Mohamed Sajid, Morocco’s Minister of tourism, Air Transport, and handicraft, said that the Kingdom wants to attract annually 500,000 tourists. Which, if you think about it, is not unattainable: China is unmentionably populous. Plus, people tend to travel when, as their life conditions improve, they yearn for new experiences, novel feelings. And China’s living standard has enormously improved in the past years. The more money we make, the more we look for new ways of experiencing the world, new attachments—we take on the world, expand it. Given our digital generation, a generation that has ‘going places’ and adventures inscribed in its DNA, the tourist revolution China has recently engaged in, if you consider the country’s current global standing, is a much overdue development. And Morocco, which decided, in June 2016, to exempt Chinese tourists from visa requirements, is already reaping huge benefits in terms of revenues and tourism-related works created, for the new Chinese global “invaders” are a generation of tourists for whom your ‘brand’ is determined by the number of places you’ve visited, the number of overseas adventures in your travel toolkit. Morocco, the number one tourism hub in Africa, naturally made the top of their list. According to Chinese News Agency Xinhua, a flock of Chinese tourists visited Morocco during the Spring festival. In cities like Marrakech, Xinhua reported, “busses full of Chinese tourists could be found everywhere.” Two girls from Ningbo told Xinhua told the Chinese outlet that they chose Morocco as their Spring Festival travel destination to “taste the country’s unique Arabian flavor.” They said they travelled for fifteen days around “classical destinations” like Casablanca, Marrakech, the Sahara, Fez, Chefchaouen, and Tangier. But, Xinhua adds, “in addition to the classic route that most people choose, Chinese tourists’ footprints also extend to Moroccan tourist cities such as Essaouira, Tetouan and Irfane.” Chinese tourists have already done this in Asian countries. Now that they’re turning towards Morocco, so long as Moroccan tourism keeps meeting their expectations, Chinese tourists are set to be a game-changer: they can shift the center of gravity of Moroccan tourism, which has for decades been revolving around Americans and Europeans. Only 5% of Chinese population are said to possess passports, a number the Chinese government has decided to increase in the coming years, especially by delivering 10 million new travel documents every year. Should that happen, and should Morocco still remain a leading touristic destination, the revolution that began this spring will be but a tiny little tree in the huge forest yet to come.

Rabat – As the opening date of the LGV high-speed train approaches, photos showing the interior of the train are making the rounds on social media. The trains have a sleek interior decorated in black and red and include a modern cafeteria. The LGV’s interior design is eye-pleasing and captures the sophistication of the soon to be running fast trains. The high-speed train is the first of its kind in Africa and it represents the culmination of rail infrastructure investments in the kingdom. The train will link Tangier to Kenitra in just 90 minutes, and Tangier to Casablanca in two hours and ten minutes instead of the current five hours.  Morocco received delivery of the first LGV carriages in July 2015. The second group of LGV carriages arrived last September at the Port of Tangier Med. The first tests of the line were carried out in February and March of last year. The trains were tested at high speed for over forty kilometers near Kenitra, verifying the running conditions of the tracks as well as the trains and station signaling technology. The second phase of these dynamic tests have affirmed that the line is suitable for train circulation at a maximum speed of 320 kilometers per hour (198 mph). The third and last phase of tests on the LGV line took place during February. The project was launched by King Mohammed VI and the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy in September 2011. Morocco, France, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE all contributed funds for the high speed train project, about USD 2 billion for the new trains, new tracks, improved signaling technology and upgraded train station platforms.

Rabat – Mauritanian ambassador to Morocco, Mohamed Lemine Ould Aboye Ould Cheikh El Hadrami, presented on Tuesday his credentials to the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mohamed Ali Al-Azraq. The news was confirmed by the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

Ould Aboye was appointed an ambassador for the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to Morocco in December 2017. The past few years have seen on and off the diplomatic tension between Morocco and Mauritania over political and regional issues, including the Western Sahara conflict. His appointment came a few months after the appointment of the new Moroccan ambassador to Mauritania, Hamid Chabar. Ould Aboye’s appointment also comes six years after the departure of the previous Mauritanian ambassador in 2012. Recently, Morocco and Mauritania have both expressed a willingness to reestablish closer diplomatic ties. In an interview with the Paris-based magazine, Jeune Afrique, Mauritania’s President Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz said that Mauritanian-Moroccan relations “have been somewhat lethargic, there have been ups and downs, but they are improving and our goal is to strengthen them further.” Western Sahara Conflict is a Headache During his interview with the pan-African magazine, the Mauritanian President named the Western Sahara conflict as the main reason for the current tensions between the two Maghreb nations. “It’s a real headache, we’re going around in circles!”, said the president. The Western Sahara conflict, according to Ould Abdelaziz, requires sacrifices from both sides. “There should be a lot of sacrifices on both sides and, above all, a political will to solve this problem by going beyond rivalries between states in the name of a global vision of the Maghreb.” Ould Abdelaziz also underscored the importance of reviving the Arab Maghreb Union.

Rabat – As the case of Akhbar Alyoum president Taoufik Bouachrine progresses, former journalist Kholoud Al-Jabri, one of alleged the victims of his alleged sexual misconduct, made a video appearance and said that Bouachrine “did not rape me, but attempted to.” “I am ready to go with anyone who suspects that I have been raped to any doctor of their choice to prove that I am still a virgin,” said Al Jabri on Monday to Alyaoum24, which is affiliated with Akhbar Alyoum. She explained in a video interview, conducted by Chouf TV, that Bouachrine would make her stay alone with him at the office. “We would finish work at 5 pm. But he would ask me to stay until 6 under the pretext that I still have more work to do.” Once in his office, Bouachrine would allegedly try to kiss and grab her. “But I always reject,” she indicates during the video interview, adding that sometimes “he would use violence and force against me.” “He knew that I desperately needed the job to support my family and used that against me as a ‘smart tactic’,” the former journalist said. After informing her parents of the circumstances of Bouachrine’s conduct, they encouraged her to file a complaint, she said in the video. Several women in Bouachrine’s circle of friends and colleagues were summoned by the Public Prosecutor as part of the ongoing investigation over charges that have been filed against him. His lawyer, Mohammed Ziane, said that the number of women contacted so far is about 30. According to a communiqué published Monday by the Prosecutor General Office, Bouachrine appears in 50 different videos, showing him with female victims of his sexual misconduct. The same communiqué indicated that “Bouachrine is being prosecuted for human trafficking, rape and sexual assault.”

Rabat – One French fashion designer has turned to Moroccan souks for inspiration during Paris Fashion week, which opened Monday February 26.  Vogue fashion magazine defines the fashion designer as  “a Paris darling, paid attention to by everyone who matters, thanks to an ineffable mix of confidence, charm, and risk-taking.” His models wore a palette of earth colors, varying from long trousers, tunics, and knitted dresses, to Harem-styled skirts and pants. They are also wore oversized hoodies, tights, and shoes with heels made of wooden balls. During his visit to Morocco, Jacquemus said he visited the recently opened YSL museum in Marrakech, according to the same source. “But I’m not working for a museum,” he said. “I have no interest to look at the [Saint Laurent] book, it was just a feeling. He then “got lost in the souks with just one thing on my mind: I want to make it my next summer collection,” he told Vogue. He came back to Paris during the winter and worked on his women’s ready-to-wear creations for the fall-winter of 2018-2019. “I came back to Paris and made my winter of it; my winter collection. Not wasting any more time, my warm winter .” While “destination collections are often prosaic,” Morocco stands out as inspiration for a clothing line, writes Vogue, as the country “that will forever be linked in the fashion imagination to the late, legendary Yves Saint Laurent, who made his home there.” The 28-year-old French designer also announced that he was launching a men’s line for Fashion Week next June.

  Rabat –  On Monday, February 26, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) drafted a penalty against Raja team supporters for pandemonium during the Raja-KACM football match on February 25. Raja defeated KACM by 3-0 during Sunday’s “Botola-Maroc Telecom” for 2016-2017 season, but the triumph did not end well. Supporters of the green team, Raja, started a vehement diatribe with the supporters of the red team, KACM, which resulted in considerable material and financial loss for Marrakech Football stadium. The disciplinary committee of Royal Moroccan Football Federation decided to penalize Raja team supporters for vandalizing the stadium and throwing chairs at other spectators and law enforcement agents, which resulted in 14 injured, according to an announcement by the Crown Prosecutor Mohamed Abd Nabaoui, as reported by Akhbar Alyaoum. FRMF fined the Raja club MAD 50,000 and restricted Raja supporters from attending two upcoming matches. 65 supporters of the green team were charged with “vandalism acts” and will face trial.

Rabat – SDX Energy announced the process of drilling the SAH-2 well, will begin after a delay of 15 to 20 days, in a press release on February 27. If the drilling proves successful, it will be completed, flow tested, and then delivered to nearby infrastructure. The SAH-2 well, located on the “downthrown” side of the fault, possesses the same drilling structure as those that have produced effective wells for the company. The SAH-2 is the seventh of nine onshore well-drilling programmes in Morocco; four wells have already demonstrated positive results, while the latest drilling (KSS-2 well) revealed low gas saturation incompatible with commercial usage. The company explained that the well is too isolated from the reservoir source rock, due to its location on the “upthrown” side of a fault. In a previous release, the corporation projects that the SAH-2 carries a high potential for commercial use. SDX is an international oil and gas exploration, production, and development company, headquartered in London, England, UK, with a principal focus on North Africa. In Morocco, SDX has a 75 percent working interest in the Sebou concession situated in the Gharb Basin. In Egypt, SDX has a 50 percent working interest in two producing assets located onshore in the Eastern Desert, adjacent to the Gulf of Suez. These producing assets are characterized by exceptionally low operating costs, making them particularly resilient in a low-oil price environment. SDX’s portfolio also includes high impact exploration opportunities in both Egypt and Morocco.

Rabat – Following the verdict announced by the European Court of Justice on the fisheries agreement, Morocco and the EU expressed on Tuesday their willingness to pursue, preserve, and strengthen their strategic partnership and their fisheries ties. Federica Mogherini, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the European Commission, and Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, said in a joint statement that “they took note of the verdict handed today by the EU Court of Justice” on the fisheries deal between the two parties.  The verdict of the ECJ reaffirmed the validity of the fisheries deal between the two parties as long as it does not involve the waters of Western Sahara. In regard to the Western Sahara conflict, the EU and Morocco reaffirmed their support for the United Nations process and efforts of the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, to reach a final political solution to the issue. In the statement, both parties reiterated “their attachment to the strategic partnership between Morocco and the European Union and their determination to preserve and strengthen it.” Both parties have agreed to further reinforce their political dialogue and preserve the stability of their trade relations. Morocco and the European Union emphasized the importance of the close and sincere consultation spirit that guided the process of adapting the agricultural agreement that has created a valuable trust for deepening the partnership. According to the statement, the partners are “determined to preserve their cooperation in the field of fisheries,” and “they have expressed their willingness to negotiate the necessary instruments relating to the fisheries partnership.”  “With this spirit and renewed confidence, the two parties confirmed the richness and vitality of relations between the European Union and Morocco and their full commitment to the continued development of the latter in all areas of mutual interest,” added the statement. Both parties are keen to reinforce their cooperation in different areas in order to tackle other issues, including migration, stability, regional development, and scientific research.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akhannouch, has responded to the European  Court of Justice decision regarding the EU-Morocco fisheries deal, noting that “the verdict does not clearly say that there is a ban on fishing in the waters of southern provinces.” According to Spanish news agency EFE, the minister said that European boats have the right to keep fishing in Moroccan waters until the current agreement expires in July. Akhannouch told the press on Tuesday that “the agreement is valid. The court did not follow the recommendation or the opinion of [Melchior Wathelet],” who made the comments that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement should be declared null and void because it includes Western Sahara. The Moroccan official added that, “the court did not prohibit fishing in the territorial areas,” and that “negotiations for another agreement will be conducted when things will be more clarified with the European Union and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Fisheries.” Today, the European Court of Justice announced its verdict on the EU-Morocco fisheries deal, reaffirming the validity of the deal between the two parties as long as it does not involve the waters of Western Sahara. According to the ECJ, the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco “is valid insofar as it is not applicable to Western Sahara to its adjacent waters.” Legal experts and analysts have been raising concerns about the decision of the court, urging it to exceed its legal mandate by meddling in politics.

Rabat – Innov Invest, Moroccan government-backed funds for supporting innovation and youth entrepreneurship, has unveiled its 2018 rules and eligibility criteria. According to L’Economiste, for the year 2018, a budget of 700 million DHs will be disbursed to support innovative start-ups or projects. Four companies have already been selected to benefit from the financial support, says L’Economiste in its 27 February edition, adding that “295.5 million DHs will be shared among four asset management companies, including 42.5 million for Maroc Numeric Fund II in order to finance existing initiatives.” The CCG, Central Guarantee Fund, the Innov Invest fund’s managing body, will oversee and assist the four management companies in their respective investments and fund raisings, with each company set to receive a financial support proportional to its fund raising capacities. “Each asset management team has reassured [the CCG] to raise, from both foreign and local investors, an amount of money almost equal to what they’ll receive from the CCG,” the central fund announced in a recent statement, noting that it will particularly allocate 205 million for financial support and technical assistance to nascent startups or start-ups in co-funding collaboration with an asset management company. The financing will vary between 100,000 and 4 million DHs. L’Economiste reported that four start-ups are already on the list to receive funding, with the daily noting that the final validation the funding required by the selected projects will be a long process of diligent and careful evaluation by relevant authorities, namely interested investors and the funding committees of the asset management companies working with the CCG on the Innov Invest project. Invest Innov, which was started last year, aims to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in Morocco. This year’s budget (700 million) is said to be targeting up to 100 start-ups. The eligibility criterion focuses on the newness of start-ups (below 5 years of existence) and “a spirit of innovation that challenges the classical way” of doing or launching a business.   The race for receiving financial help and technical assistance is now open, says L’Economiste to start-ups and individuals with innovative projects, stressing that the release of funds is set to start in May this year.

Rabat – On Tuesday, the European Court of Justice announced its verdict on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement, reaffirming the validity of the deal between the two parties. According to the EJC, the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco “is valid in so far as it is not applicable to Western Sahara to its adjacent waters.” The court concluded that if the two parties included the Western Sahara territory in the scope of their fisheries agreement “that would be contrary to certain rules of general international law that are applicable in relations between the EU and Kingdom of Morocco.” The EU court added that the fisheries deal is applicable to “waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction” of Morocco. In accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, “the waters over which a coastal State is entitled to exercise sovereignty or jurisdiction are limited exclusively to the waters adjacent to its territory and forming part of its territorial sea or of its exclusive economic zone.” The recent ECJ judgment resembles an announcement issued in December 2016 ruling on the Morocco-EU agriculture agreement. According to the judgment, the agreements between the EU and Morocco must respect the relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between both parties. Fishery ties between Morocco and the European Union date back to 1988. Negotiated four years ago, the fisheries agreement provides annual permits without restriction, according to the European Union. Since that time, partnerships between the two entities have expanded to involve protocols from different fields, including trade activities. The judgment of the court came after an opinion made by Melchior Wathelet, Advocate General of the Luxembourg-based ECJ, who said that the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement should be declared null and void because it includes Western Sahara. The separatist Polisario group, which has been claiming autonomy in the Western Sahara throughout the four-decade-long conflict with Morocco, has also been filing appeals against the agreement. However, international legal experts have raised concerns over the ECJ’s verdict, urging it to not to exceed its legal mandate by meddling in politics. Jean-Jacques Nuer, an international corporate lawyer and a member of both the Paris Bar and the Law Society in London has called on the ECJ to comply with the theory of “the separation of powers” ascribed to French Enlightenment political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu. The lawyer said that the remarks made by the advocate general “exceeded his mandate describing the situation excess of power.”

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – The Contemporary African Art Fair took place in Marrakech on February 24 and 25, making its debut on the African continent. The event was coordinated by 1-54, a London-based international fair dedicated to contemporary art from Africa’s 54 countries and diaspora. Founded in 2013, 1-54 has previously held the Contemporary African Art Fair in New York and London. “It has been an important goal of 1-54 to host an edition on the African continent, and we could not think of a better place than Morocco to host this inaugural edition outside of London and New York,” said Touria El Glaoui, the 1-54 founding director and daughter of renowned Marrakechi painter Hassan El Glaoui. This weekend, Marrakech highlighted 17 galleries from across Africa and around the world, including Casablanca’s Loft Art Gallery. The fair also featured 60 artists from around the world, including 12 born in Morocco. Artists, dealers, and viewers mingled in the corridors of Hotel La Mamounia near Marrakech’s Koutoubia Mosque.   In addition to the fine art on display, 1-54 also orchestrated a FORUM program, or a series of screenings, lectures, and panel discussions on the weekend’s theme: “Decolonize Always!” FORUM’s curator, Omar Berrada, elaborated on the theme in a public statement: “Our world may be post-colonial, yet it has not been decolonized. Colonial powers may have left, but their past presence casts a long shadow,” he said. “Decolonization is not a bygone historical event; it is an everyday task. Always decolonize!” Omar Berrada writes, translates, and co-directs Dar al-Ma’mûn, a library and artist residency in Marrakech. During the art fair, he moderated a series of panel discussions, focused on various aspects of the decolonization process. Berrada assembled a cast of pan-African artists, historians, archaeologists, and critics for a panel discussion entitled “Decolonizing Knowledge.” Speaking to a packed audience in the conference rooms above La Mamounia’s gallery space, the selected speakers got to share their current projects and offer insight into the varied ways they “wage a battle of the imagination in order to invent new ways of acting and thinking.” Visual artist, historian, and critic Nana Oforiatta-Ayim offered the example of a mobile museum project she formed in her native Ghana in 2015. “We have museums in Ghana, but no one goes into them,” explained the London-born, Accra-based panelist. To challenge the colonial legacy in Ghana, Oforiatta-Ayim decided to rethink museum structures themselves. In imagining what kind of space would be inviting to all people, she ultimately decided on a flexible, mobile museum whose walls can be dismantled, packed “on the back of a truck,” and reestablished in the next town. Oforiatta-Ayim said she hoped to challenge notions of value by creating a space where her country’s patrimony could accessibly be shared and celebrated. The Contemporary African Art Fair itself uses mobility to go beyond geographical borders and celebrate current African artists at separate fairs on three continents. 1-54 is already setting up the next Contemporary African Art Fair in New York City in three months’ time, and subsequently in London in October 2018.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a message to participants in the National Forum on the Senior Civil Service, which opened on Tuesday in Skhirate (Rabat outskirts) under the theme “the restructuring of the senior civil service”. Here follows the full text of the royal message which was read out by the Sovereign’s advisor, Abdelatif Mennouni. “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to take the opportunity of this National Forum on the Senior Civil Service, which coincides with the sixtieth anniversary of the promulgation of the general civil service statute, to send you this message, given that, on account of your position of responsibility, you represent the elite that helps manage public affairs. I made it a point to grant my patronage to this important event because of the key role government services have been playing since independence to serve the country and the citizens and accomplish their mission by contributing to Morocco’s economic and social development, despite the difficulties faced and the shortcomings noted from time to time. I commend you on convening this forum which shows your commitment to give substance to my instructions regarding the reform of government services and the optimal use of human resources. I also commend your choice of theme, namely the restructuring of the senior civil service. I hope this conference will be an opportunity to pause in order to examine the situation, take stock of changes and imbalances in the civil service system – at all levels – and consider the legislative and regulatory measures which are likely to improve the performance of state institutions and agencies. Ladies and Gentlemen, Government agencies, at both central and local levels, are at a crossroads today. This means civil servants are expected to be actively involved in the country’s economic and social transformation process and support public policies and development projects in the country. Despite the important achievements made through large-scale projects, especially in the fields of industry, agriculture, infrastructure, renewable energy etc., the development model we laid down has reached its limit. It can no longer contribute to comprehensive development or satisfy citizens’ expectations due to a number of difficulties, including under performance by civil service institutions and a lack of efficiency, innovation and good governance. Just as I advocated a new development model to rise to current and future challenges, I am calling today for the concept of public service to be put at the heart of this model, through a thorough and profound reform of the civil service. When I talk about the civil service – sometimes in harsh terms – and criticize its performance and low efficiency, it does not mean it is not accomplishing its mission, or that I am casting doubt on the competence of its human resources or the efforts it is making to perform more efficiently.  In fact, I am aware of the remarkable development public service has witnessed over the years as well as the major projects to which it has contributed. What I want, in fact, is for the civil service to perform more efficiently, to be in step with the changes the country is witnessing, to adjust to global developments and to contribute to efforts to rise to the development challenges facing our country. For this reason, I have been insisting on the need for the civil service to upgrade its performance and for the competence of its human resources to be improved. This is a strategic choice that will unquestionably help lay the foundations for the development model to which we are aspiring, in addition to making the civil service an effective tool for the promotion of public policies in various sectors. Soon after my accession to the throne of my glorious ancestors, I defined a new concept of authority, which I consider to be a gateway to improving the performance of government agencies and to consolidating their commitment to the principles of good governance. The aim is to meet the citizens’ growing needs, promote social justice and guarantee a dignified life for all. I was also keen to enshrine good governance in the Constitution. Indeed, I view good governance as an indispensable ingredient for the organization and management of the civil service since it involves the principles of merit, integrity, transparency and equal opportunity among all Moroccans. I also sought to give substance to the constitutional principle of linking public office with accountability. Ladies and Gentlemen, The mission and main function of the civil service, as defined by the Constitution, is to serve the citizens and uphold the principles of equality and fairness throughout the country, while ensuring the continuity of public service. By law, public institutions fall within the jurisdiction of the ministers supervising them, since the civil service is placed at the disposal of the government. However, the Constitution stipulates that civil servants must comply with the requirements of quality, transparency, responsibility and accountability in order to be close to citizens, listen to their demands and meet their legitimate needs. In this regard, I call for the promulgation of the civil service charter provided for in the Constitution to be speeded up and for that charter to be given a mandatory character. This will make it a key reference document for good governance as far as the management of government agencies, local governments and public bodies is concerned. I also want that charter to clearly and unequivocally reflect my new concept of authority, which covers all civil categories and levels, without exception. Ladies and Gentlemen, The efficient management of the means and resources needed to achieve comprehensive development puts the issue of the efficiency of the civil service and of state institutions in sharp focus, thereby underscoring the need to review their work methods and modes for the management of public funds in order to achieve optimal use of the resources available. I am sure you realize that the issue of efficiency is closely linked to that of competitiveness. The merit and effectiveness of the civil service today are measured by the extent to which they contribute to enhancing a country’s competitive edge and enabling it to engage in cutthroat competition for investment, expertise and capital, given the prospects these assets open up for economic and social development as well as job creation, especially for young people. The comprehensive, integrated reform of the civil service is an urgent matter, given the challenges that need to be tackled to ensure the continuity and quality of public service. Attention must also be paid to the regional dimension, to devolution and to the sound, efficient management of human resources. Advanced regionalization, which is viewed as an effective, practical approach to local governance, is the foundation on which the civil service should be based so as to bring public services, public institutions and decision-making centers closer to the citizens. The optimal implementation of this fundamental project cannot be achieved unless all interested stakeholders are actively involved in it, especially the civil service, at both central and local levels. The civil service must have competent staff in all professional categories. We should therefore tackle the challenge of ensuring continuous personnel and senior staff training. Actual needs and the credentials required should be taken into account during the recruitment process, and the requirements of competence, merit and equal opportunity should be strictly complied with. It is also necessary to ensure suitable working conditions and facilities in order to increase productivity, not to mention the need to provide incentives and apply disciplinary measures. We also need to train new generations of senior civil servants to serve in various public departments and agencies. We must also attract highly qualified professionals, making sure they have a keen sense of responsibility as well as the skills needed for effective communication, strategic planning and project management. All of the above are key requirements which must be met when filling senior positions. Such a large-scale reform project requires an overhaul of the regulations concerned, improved management methods, the raising of moral standards in the civil service and the development of the legal framework. Inspiration should also be drawn from the private sector management model and the best international practices in the field. Using modern technology is crucial to improving public service performance. We should seek to ensure general access to digitized public services and provide for remote service delivery as well as joint access to information by various sectors. Ladies and Gentlemen, Despite the attempts and efforts made to promote reform and modernization, the Moroccan civil service will achieve the desired level of efficiency and productivity only if there is a change in mentality and a break with shameful behavior and practices that are detrimental to government agencies and employees alike, such as bribery, corruption, abuse of power or neglect of one’s duties. To achieve the above objectives, we must simplify civil service legislation and strictly apply the regulations governing administrative posts and public institutions, making sure those holding public office can be held to account, where necessary. The success of the reform we want hinges on collective will as much as on the ability to overcome the impediments and obstacles hindering our civil service and development model. Particularly worthy of note is the persistence of certain practices which resist change and reform because of the fear of losing privilege, and also because some officials lack competence and audacity, making them reluctant to initiate reforms. Ladies and Gentlemen, You know how keen I am to make sure the civil service carries out its mission by serving citizens and making an effective, constructive contribution to development. However, reforming the civil service and reexamining public service delivery do not concern just public sector institutions. This endeavor also calls for the best ways to involve the private sector in the proposed reform to be identified, making sure we strike a balance between administrative and development considerations, for the benefit of the country. I hope this National Forum on the Senior Civil Service will be a precious opportunity to reflect on the principles of new public governance and to come up with innovative ideas to ensure its efficiency. Such a governance system should be rooted in a result-oriented, contract-based culture centered on objectives and efficiency. The principles underpinning public service – namely public interest, integrity, regional and sectoral equity and social cohesion – must be taken into account. I hope your Forum will avail this opportunity to come up with concrete, practical and applicable recommendations and decisions and chart pathways for reform, thereby signaling the actual launching of a gradual transition from a civil service model based on career management to a new competence-centered management model. The aim is to build an effective administrative model that would not only be compatible with the characteristics of the desired development model, but that would also help meet current and future needs. I commend you on your efforts and pray that Almighty God grant you every success. Thank you. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

By Johanna Higgs Rabat – Having spent many years traveling across the globe learning about the many forms of discrimination faced by women and young girls, one thing has become blatantly obvious to me: we need more men to speak up on this issue. We need men to take a stand and acknowledge that violence and discrimination against women continues to be a very serious social issue. And we need men to help make this issue a priority. The problem is that, around the world, men are perpetuating a neutral stance. Thus far, most men have remained silent and are reluctant to speak up acknowledge the importance of women’s rights. This results in a tolerance and acceptance of unacceptable attitudes and behaviors towards women and young girls. However,  some men are finally taking a stand. Matt is one of these men. I first met Matt in Tashkent — the capital of Uzbekistan. He was introduced to me as a gender specialist, and after meeting in a smoky restaurant one evening in the center of Tashkent, it was clear that Matt had a passion for women’s rights. Matt grew up in the small town of Termez on the border of Afghanistan in a predominantly Muslim society. Growing up, he recognized just how many problems women and girls face in Uzbekistan. Matt began working as a gender specialist in 2014 in Tashkent and is now actively combating violence and discrimination within Uzbek society. Matt impressed me. Not only does he acknowledge the importance of women’s rights, but he was also taking action to help achieve change. What is even more impressive about Matt is the fact that he is more than happy to take a strong position and say that violence and discrimination against women and girls is blatantly wrong. One evening, we sat down with a steaming pot of green tea in his home and he spoke about what he saw as the many problems facing women and girls in Uzbek society. He said that he saw many of these issues as being centered around cultural expectations of marriage. In Uzbekistan, women are raised to be good housewives. They are expected to live with their husbands’ families, to wake up before sunrise, sweep the street, cook, and give up their own careers. In rare cases where women do work, they are expected to give all of their income to their mother-in-law and have no control over their own finances. There is also much domestic abuse in Uzbekistan. ‘This happened to my sister,’ Matt explained. ‘My parents forced her to marry someone that she didn’t like. He was physically and verbally abusive and was constantly having affairs with other women. His family was also always criticising her and telling her that she wasn’t good enough. She could not cook good enough, she could not do the household chores good enough or raise the children in the right way.’ Matt explained that as a wife, an Uzbek woman is only expected to care about being a perfect servant for her husband and his family. But ironically she doesn’t take good care of herself, she is criticised, and her husband may use this as an excuse to seek out sexual encounters with other women. ‘When I saw my sister being abused I tried to speak out,’ said Matt. ‘But my family told me that I shouldn’t say anything. They said that because she is married and has children, they have to stay together. ‘What will the neighbors say if they get divorced?’ they said. Part of the problem comes from cultural concepts of virginity where women are expected to be virgins until they are married. If a woman gets divorced, then it is implied that she is no longer a virgin anymore, other men will not want to marry her because she will be considered ‘less desirable.’ It is also considered unacceptable for a woman to not be married. Even if a woman is being domestically abused, she is pressured by social expectations to stay with her husband. ‘My sister accepted the situation, mostly because she didn’t know that she could do anything different,’ explained Matt. ‘This society is so messed up. They’ll say it’s fine for men to come home drunk and beat up their wives and that nobody should say anything. They’ll justify their violent behavior and say maybe they were having a bad day,’ he said. ‘But that’s not an excuse for anyone to hit anyone.’ For Matt, one of the worst aspects of Uzbek society is that women who have been raped are forced to marry their rapist. ‘Society will blame her and say she was wearing western clothes, or that she behaved inappropriately so she provoked the rapist. ‘But what they don’t understand is that it is the rapist is to blame no matter how women act and behave.’ Matt believes that many of these problems can be attributed to traditions and history that come from surrounding countries such as Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, where it is believed that a woman’s life has no value. However, women’s rights in Uzbekistan were not always so repressed. During Soviet times,  the Russians introduced western notions that women should work and be educated. Levels of emancipation were higher, and many women worked in male dominated industries as their equals and pursued academic degrees in technical and engineering sciences. Women were also able to dress more freely like the Europeans. However, after Uzbekistan gained independence from the Soviet Union, some citizens wanted to go back to their old traditions, which also meant reverting back to a conservative religious mindset. As a result, the importance of women’s rights diminished. ‘Now old and sick traditions are re-emerging and becoming stronger,’ explained Matt. ‘This means the popular view is that  a woman should only be a good wife and a good daughter. She should stay at home and should not have any aspirations to continue her education after compulsory secondary schooling. Women are starting to cover up their bodies more and there are getting married at younger ages.’ “Many years ago,’ Matt said, “in Uzbekistan, women fought and sacrificed their lives to be able to take the headscarf off, and now slowly they are starting to put them back on. Women are putting themselves back into a cage.” Matt wants to see his society shift back to protecting and freeing women. He wants the situation for women in his society to better — something which he believes could be achieved if more emphasis were placed on women’s education and less on the need to get married. “If we would do this then our society would be so much more progressive,” Matt claims.

Rabat – In a recent interview with Jeune Afrique, Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz discusses internal politics, the 2019 succession, and Mauritania’s relationship with its northern neighbor.  Notably, the 61-year-old president reflects a willingness to strengthen relations with Morocco, and declares that although nothing is on the horizon, the possibility of a visit is not out of the question. “Our relations with Rabat have been somewhat lethargic, there have been ups and downs, but they are improving and our goal is to strengthen them further,” said the president. According to JA, Mauritania had finally agreed to appoint Hamid Chabar as Moroccan ambassador in Nouakchott several months after Ould Abdelaziz’s nomination. In December, the country designated an ambassador to Rabat, filling a post that had been vacant since 2012. On the prominent Sahara issue, the Mauritanian president stated, “It’s a real headache, we’re going around in circles!” His solution: “There should be a lot of sacrifices on both sides and, above all, a political will to solve this problem by going beyond rivalries between states in the name of a global vision of the Maghreb.” The president also spoke about his view on the Arab Maghreb Union declaring that its creation is a must. “If we do not create it ourselves, we will have failed an important part of our mission, but I am sure that future generations will do it,” he said.

Rabat – One Saudi Twitter user’s photos of two Moroccan maids have sparked online controversy, due to a listing of the women’s qualities that have been deemed  “slave trade,” by other Twitter users. One photo shows Moroccan woman wearing the conservative Saudi garment, the abaya, and facing the camera. In the middle of the photo, the caption reads, “Muslim Moroccan maid–Age: 30– worked five years in Saudi Arabia–knows how to cook–fully experienced housekeeper–Salary: 1500–reason for deportation: does not know how to deal with kids.”  The last line it says that potential customers may keep the maids after they evaluate their work. ????.. ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ?????https://t.co/Vg8XWweGzY#?????? #????????_?????_????? pic.twitter.com/BQ2Y09r9Zb — ???????? ????? ?????

Rabat – More than EUR 106,000  has been collectively raised online to help free Tariq Ramadan. Launched on CotizUp platform, this prize pool aims to help the Islamist scholar, who “is confronted with several cases whose battle will be long and costly.” Organized by the “For the Liberation of Tariq Ramadan,” Facebook page,  the initiative has already raised more than EUR 106,000, far exceeding the EUR 90,000 target. Between “Legal proceedings, attorneys’ fees, appraisals and counter-appraisals (…) the battle will be costly,” said the group, adding that the money will go to Ramadan’s trial.  French police arrested Tariq Ramadan on January 31, after two women filed complaints accusing him of rape in 2017. The police continue to hold him as “part of a preliminary inquiry” into the rape and assault allegations. The Oxford professor denies the allegations, claiming that they are part of a “campaign of lies launched by [his] adversaries.” His wife, Iman Ramadan, believes her husband was targeted by the media. “It is enough to just read the press or turn on the TV and think that he’s guilty,” she stated, adding that she thinks, “he is, unfortunately, a victim of this media lynching and political pressure exerted against him.” Though he was recently hospitalized, the Appeals Court in Paris denied his release after a medical report indicated that Islamic theologian’s health was “compatible with his detention.” Ramadan was initially accused of rape by author and former Salafi Henda Ayari, who reports that the rape occurred in 2012 when both were attending a congress of the Union of Islamic Organizations of France. Another woman stepped forward shortly thereafter and claimed she was also raped by the Swiss scholar in a French hotel in 2009.

Superintendent Shane O’Neil, a policeman in the city of Leicester, said that the building where the shop is located consists of other shop premises “on the ground level and a two-storey flat above it.” According to The Guardian, there might be people not yet rescued or accounted for. Policeman and firefighters are still searching for more people who could have survived. Investigations and searches are underway to determine further casualties. “Once the site is deemed to be safe, a joint investigation with Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service will begin looking into the circumstances surrounding the incident, which at this stage is not being linked to terrorism,” said O’Neil. John Alexander, a  BBC journalist who happened to live only 80 yards away from the building, said “I felt a tremor, what felt like an earthquake shock, and I heard a very low boom that sounded like a very, very fast release of pressure. “I thought my house was going to fall down on top of me and all my neighbors have said the same thing. I saw one guy get pulled out and he’ll be very lucky if he wasn’t killed.” In 2017, the city of London witnessed several terror attacks. In June, a van veered off the road and struck a number of pedestrians on London Bridge, while in May, a suicide bombing attack at the Manchester Arena left 22 dead and 64 others injured.

Rabat – The Spanish border authorities have urged maritime transport firms to withhold their services to members of the Polisario Front seeking asylum in Spain. Previously, Spain has provided separatists with residency cards, according to Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. News outlets affiliated with the separatist group claim that the decision is intended to pressure companies to prevent them from selling travel tickets to the Polisario members awaiting asylum decision from the Spanish government. According to Moroccan media, Spanish sources say the decision reflects “Spain’s refusal to grant temporary residence permits, which was a privilege for those coming from the Tindouf camps, after deciding to discontinue providing political asylum to Sahrawis.” In August 2017, Spain refused to grant political asylum to 54 separatists from the Tindouf camps. When Spain refused to allow them to enter, the separatist group organized a sit-in in the Barajas airport in Madrid to denounce Spain’s decision, according to Al Quds news outlet. Two of the 54 the Polisario members arrived from Cuba, where they were studying medical studies, while the other 52 separatists arrived in Spain via Algeria. According to Al Quds news outlet, Spanish authorities rejected 41 out of 54 political asylum applications. One of the members returned to Algeria, while the other twelve, who were granted asylum, organized a hunger strike in solidarity with their companions. The leader of the Polisario-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is also a subject of an international arrest warrant, issued by Spain for crimes against humanity. According to Tindouf.org, “the Spanish justice is prosecuting Ghali, for ‘genocide, torture, forced disappearances, illegal detention and serious violations of human rights” committed in the Tindouf camps.’” Several members of the separatist front, including SADR’s “prime minister,” Mohamed Ouali Akeik, were also involved in terrorist acts committed against Spanish citizens at the Phosboucraa site in Laayoune in the 1970s. . The attacks resulted in the death of soldiers and the kidnapping of Spanish citizens. Polisario’s attacks on the phosphate conveyor belts occurred in Laayoune between 1974 and 1976. The front attacked conveyor belts in an attempt to stop phosphate mining. Around the same time, Polisario also engaged in violent attacks on Spanish fishing vessels, the Moroccan army, and French nationals.

Rabat – Emma Gonzalez and fellow survivors of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida have been determined since the incident to make their voices heard and to fight against gun violence that has been claiming the lives of innocent people in the United States. The student, who is now leading the students demanding action following the tragedy, took on a National Rifle Association spokesperson at a CNN town hall meeting on February 21. Gonzalez was provided with the opportunity to question gun rights advocate Dana Loesch about her opinions regarding gun control in the US. Addressing Dana Loesch, who is a mother of two, Gonzalez said: “I want you to know that we will support your children in the way that you will not.” The teenager also said, “the shooter at our school obtained weapons that he used on us legally. Do you believe that it should be harder to obtain the semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons and the modifications for these weapons to make them fully automatic like bump stocks?” The NRA spokeswoman has been at the center of the gun control debate. “Well first off Emma, I want to applaud you for standing up and speaking out,” said the spokeswoman, adding that “none of the students should be criticized for speaking out.” “Now, I want to answer your question, and I want to be allowed the opportunity, which is why I am here, to talk and have this discussion with you all and answer these questions.” Defending the NRA, the organization she represents, Loesch said that “none of us support people who are crazy, who are a danger to themselves, who are a danger to others, getting their hands on a firearm.” However, the spokeswoman did little to win Gonzalez or the audience’s approval. According to the British news outlet, Telegraph, numerous American companies have severed their ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA) after public outrage against the gun lobby spread. The February 15 shooting in Parkland, Florida claimed 17 lives while many others were injured. The shooting was the deadliest U.S school shooting since 2012 On February 17, a massive rally in Florida was attended by survivors of the Florida school shooting. Together with parents and numerous local politicians, the crowd, visibly angered by the death toll, protested the president’s stance on gun control and the lack of political dialogue on the issue in Congress. The crowd chanted “shame on you” as they attacked politicians and lawmakers said to have links with the NRA, one of the country’s most powerful interest groups. The gun rights group advocates for gun rights and opposes gun ownership restrictions. The crowd, singling Donald Trump out as one of the politicians receiving huge financial support from the NRA, called for tougher restrictions on guns, with Gonzalez telling the press that gun control is a “matter of life and death”, and “not a political question.”

Rabat – After rumors that Islamic studies will replace philosophy in the baccalaureate examinations surfaced on local media, the Ministry of Education has refuted the false claims in an official statement. Last week, several media outlets announced the aforementioned changes to the professional baccalaureate. Mohamed Hassad, Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laârej signed a ministerial decree suspending the examinations of philosophy in the professional baccalaureate and replacing this subject by Islamic Studies, leading to rumors among the educational sphere. Teachers of philosophy considered this decision to be ideologically charged. In a statement to daily Assabah, the president of the Association of Teachers of Philosophy, Abdelkarim Safir, said that if this decision is put into force, it would go against the national unanimity of the current Charter of Education and Training, as well as the 2015-2030 educational strategy. However, in a statement released on Friday, the ministry made clarifications regarding the allegations.”We have neither removed nor replaced one subject by another with respect to the subjects of the examinations regional and national baccalaureate courses for all cycles and branches,” said the Ministry. For the vocational baccalaureate, the same source states that on the basis of the pedagogical program adopted, the subject of philosophy is taught in common core since the launch of this cycle in 2014.

Rabat – February 25th marks the 60th anniversary of the historic visit paid in 1958 by late King Mohammed V to M’hamid El Ghizlane, a southern Moroccan town. The late monarch delivered a speech in the valley of the Draa river at the marketplace of the M’hamid oasis, stating that he would do anything in his power to unify families and regain the Western Sahara. His speech came only a few years after his return from exile on November 16, 1955. A year later (1956), Morocco gained its independence. The king delivered his speech in the presence of representatives from the Moroccan Sahara tribes.  During the same year, Morocco and Spain signed the Treaty of Angra de Cintra, allowing Morocco to recover part of its southern territories, including Tarfaya and Tan-Tan, after resistance operations conducted by the Moroccan Army of Liberation against the Spanish colonizers. “We solemnly proclaim that we will continue our efforts to reclaim our Sahara, in accordance with our historical rights and the wishes of the inhabitants,” said the late King in M’hamid El Ghizlane. Through his speech, the King reaffirmed Morocco’s sovereignty over the Sahara and the country’s willingness to defend its territorial integrity.  February 25 is also an opportunity to recall the achievements and sacrifices made by the National Liberation Army and populations of the Moroccan southern provinces, who reaffirmed their loyalty to defend their territory from the colonizers, especially during the battle of Bougafer or Saghro in 1933 against the French. Mohammed V’s speech was echoed by his son, late King Hassan II, in April 1981 when he underlined the political context his father’s visit and the profound meanings of the national event. “We remember our father’s visit with pride because it is from here that he called for the return of the Moroccan territories to achieve national unity and we remember the visit, because it was a call that had a great echo and was a lesson in politics and patience from which we now reap the benefits .” Until this moment, Morocco is still fighting to defend its territorial integrity and is working to prove to the international community that its sovereignty over the Sahara is not subject to compromise or negotiations.

Rabat – This week’s round-up will provide the major headlines from Moroccan newspapers, featuring business, political, social, and cultural events. To begin with, Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported on Monday, February 19 that Algeria has canceled an arms deal with Russia due to the decline in oil prices. The arms deal was intended to serve the Polisario’s front interests. According to the newspaper, the decline in oil prices has had a significant impact on the budget allocated for armaments, including funds allocated for the Polisario. The city of Temara has been shaken by alleged rape cases committed by an Imam inside of a mosque, according to Assabah newspaper. The suspect has allegedly raped six children. The parents suspected the imam of inappropriate behavior after their children told them about some of his suspicious requests.  Following Tangier’s deadly crash that involved a freight train and a transporting vehicle, King Mohammed VI has urged the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Transport and Logistics to take the necessary measures to pursue those responsible in the incident, reported Akhbar Al Yaoum on Monday. The incident, which took place at the Beni Makada district, killed 6 people while 14 people were injured.  Al Khabar reported on Tuesday that the Minister of Culture and Communication, Mommed Laaraj is planning to promote Amazigh creativity through a draft decree that is expected to be presented before the cabinet next Thursday. Laaraj asked the government to establish a national book award to promote Amazigh literature and culture. Al Akhbar added that Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani and Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Boussaid have already agreed to provide the project with a large budget to fund the project.  On Friday, Al Massae reported that Moroccan authorities in the North of Morocco have managed to dismantle a drug network that used helicopters to smuggle drugs from Morocco to Europe. On Wednesday morning, Morocco’s Counter-Terrorism Bureau successfully dismantled a terror cell made up of six support groups from the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). According to national newspapers, the Ministry of Interior released that the six suspects are aged between 22 and 42. The cell was led by a former detainee who had previously been arrested on terrorism-related charges, added the statement. The suspects are also suspected of assault and violence against citizens in Tangier. On the same day, Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan was a candidate for the presidency of Morocco’s 2025 World Cup Bid Committee. Citing an unidentified source, Akhbar Al Yaoum added that the Moroccan Minister of Agriculture was going to chair the committee, however, his busy agenda prevented him from being assigned to the task. Therefore, King Mohammed VI appointed Moroccan Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy to chair the Moroccan bid. Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum on Wednesday reported that Morocco has recently increased its presence in Asian countries. At the invitation of Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, the state has had several bilateral discussions with Asian delegations in Rabat.

New York – The recent visit of Moroccan journalists to Israel, along with a mixed delegation of various Middle Eastern journalists, sparked controversy on the Moroccan street and drew condemnation from the Minister of Culture.  The journalists visited with various political circles and received support from Israel’s Foreign Ministry, in response to the popular backlash, based in the perception that such visits whitewash and legitimize those of Israel’s policies which are perceived to be anti-Palestinian. There are several things to be noted about this event, which bypassed international attention, and yet, constitute a significant development: First, Israel is opening up to welcoming press from countries previously considered hostile (including Yemen). This level of transparency is beneficial to everyone, because the journalists can write their critiques as well as any changed perceptions in the aftermath. Under such circumstances, when the journalists are actually on the ground talking to the involved policymakers, their credibility with respect to underscoring any legitimate concerns, human rights issues, or discussions of possibilities of peacebuilding or conflict resolution is significantly greater, not just in Israel, but in the international community than if they write one-sided reviews from their home countries without ever personally experiencing the situation on the ground. And from Israel’s perspective, this constitutes a movement away from a purely defensive PR stand, reliant primarily on criticisms of unfair coverage in the media, as well as an outreach to the world community that is based on issues that have nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – and which, therefore did not in any way change anyone’s understanding or position on that conflict. Confronting criticisms and any misunderstandings directly is the only real way towards changing perspectives and resolving differences. Second, despite the popular outrage and the rebuke from government officials, the most important point of this story came from the journalists themselves: that they are free to go wherever they please, to write what they think is necessarily, and while both the people and their government may disagree with them, they will suffer no penalties from doing their job. That point about the independence of the press is in itself remarkably good PR for Morocco, in the days where members of the press are regularly killed in conflict zones, or thrown in prison for showcasing any difference in opinion from their governments’ official positions, in countries such as Turkey, which imprisoned journalists en masse and closed down newspapers, and Algeria, which, despite its popularity in the West, has enacted restrictive laws against press freedom and penalizes it for blasphemy. Ironically, granting freedom to journalists to engage in actions considered politically incorrect and grossly unpopular boosts Morocco’s image significantly more than restricting them from doing so and only publishing reports favorable to popular opinions. Morocco’s progress on various fronts, particularly in recent times is undeniable. It is participating in UAE’s international food fair, boosting ties with other African countries, such as Kenya,  participating as a host to the signing of the UN World Pact on Migration, and in Doha’s interfaith conference, progressing on transforming Sahara into a solar energy oasis, leading Africa in 4G access, training African IT graduates to ensure continuation of success across the board, successfully battling corruption, enjoying a brilliant success in the growth of its annual Digital Access Summit, and in general is fast on the way to fulfilling its vision of being a bridge between Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, while also rising as a hub of modernity and innovation. The theme reverberating throughout these various accomplishments is pluralism and diversity. None of these international events would be possible without the pluralism of cultures and diversity of opinions and approaches, which drive innovation and progress. The openness that characterizes Morocco’s approaches to cultural integrations, modernity, and outside-the-box approach to collaborations and engagement is already serving it well. However, it  will do so even more as it becomes increasingly perceived as a country tolerant of diversity of political opinions regarding the future of the region – and for that reason the Moroccan journalists who traveled to Israel actually enhanced the image of Morocco. Given that Israel enjoys a number of growing diplomatic relationships with African states, focused primarily on humanitarian aid and training, and green energy-related investments, Morocco’s position in Africa will not suffer as a result of this development, but on the contrary only grow as more and more countries explore approaches to resolving bilateral and multilateral conflicts not through aggression, isolation, and boycotts, but through engagement, discussion, and creative problem solving. Most interestingly, these journalists are coming back with the perspective that many people may not see: and that is, that Israel’s decision-making and political apparatus is not monolithic, and neither is the attitude towards Palestinians or the conflict. This has been a valuable opportunity for these journalists to learn that the diversity of views on this inside Israeli political and social circles is legendary and subject to constant debate and reevaluation. Just as importantly, the lesson to learn here is that Israeli government and the Israelis themselves are not one and the same, which is true for any country on the planet.  A visit to any foreign country is an opportunity to form relations not just with politicians, analysts, or other journalists, but with the regular people, who do not have the power of political brokerage, but rather deal with the  consequences of events often outside their control on a day to day level.  Learning that for all the political posturing on various issues, the regular people prefer to find paths to engagement and peaceful coexistence because that is what is in their own best interests is the most valuable lesson towards approaching any sort of conflict that can come out of exchange of such delegations. Circling back to what provoked such angry reactions to begin with, it can, at first glance, be attributed to two factors. First, the Moroccans are sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians, many of whom indeed suffered various difficulties and indignities as a result of assorted factors. Feeling compassion towards other human beings is wonderful, and the fact that Moroccans overall are warm, engaging, and welcoming people reflects well on them. It is no surprise that they have concern for people who are troubled by assortment of political and social issues, and who have been at the heart of international, and particularly, Middle East media attention for decades. Wanting to show solidarity and support towards the disenfranchised is only natural. The problem is, of course, is when the information flows only one way, the knowledge of all nuances of a conflict taking place far away is incomplete, and the reaction of anger alienates more than it helps. In particular, showing anger towards journalists for visiting ignores the role of the media in factfinding and uncovering truth, whatever it is, rather than supporting or enabling any particular policy or position. War journalists who travel to conflict zones and embed themselves with assorted groups are not endorsing the conflict, or any position of any party in that conflict. They are informing themselves about the details of what is happening, and educating their audiences about the relevant issues. Similarly, the visit of the journalists to Israel is not by itself an endorsement of Israel’s policies, but rather an expression of honest interest in understanding what is perceived as a significant issue. Failing to do so would have been a disservice to everyone involved because good journalism means understanding all perspectives on a particular issue, and engaging in direct contact with the involved participants. Just as importantly, this presents an opening that could be a great opportunity to overcoming the prejudices that not only contributed to the Palestinian issues, but that have stemmed from it. The more Moroccans travel to the region and engage with Israelis and Palestinians on a personal level, the more the issue will be understood, stereotypes of all sides are broken, and honest conversations can be held. The truth is, both sides are likely tired of the endless attention paid to them by Western outlets and agenda-driven NGOs; perhaps seeing the openness of people from other places who are curious, interested, concerned, and involved will be a welcome change from the usual static and repetitive nattering. Moroccans do not carry the same loaded history as many of the Westerners proliferating through the tiny area that harbors so many sad, but also inspiring stories. And their focus on a personal level is improving their own country and facilitating engagement and connections, rather than winning Nobel Peace Prizes and scoring cheap political points. Their anger at the journalists came out of genuine concern. However, the better outlet for strong compassion is not the negativity and drawing back, but rather exploration and positive contribution towards building bridges, overcoming bigotry, and humanizing distanced peoples towards each other. In that, the energy of the street reaction towards the reporters can be channeled towards a very positive end; hopefully, the reporting about the meetings will help to break through the beaten down narrative is that the only way to deal with a problem is by striking out at it. The other issue here is that there is a certain segment of people, that is deliberately fueling populism at the expense of problem solving. In part, it is easier to fuel fear, anger, and criticism at some external situation than deal with internal challenges. And in part, it is a perfect segway for coopting strong energies towards their own nefarious agendas, that ultimately, do not benefit Palestinians, but harm everyone. Those who are genuinely concerned about the plight of the unfortunate and the destitute would focus on solutions for providing them with jobs, resolving security concerns, and empowering them to overcome bad leadership, bad history, and and counterproductive associations and approaches. The focus would be on building something positive. Whenever all of the sentiment is merely aimed at someone else’s expense, to be sure there is some group that is deliberately preventing a rational conversation about the implications of a particular development, be it a media trip or something more, and aiming to empower only themselves by saying the easy things and by creating waves of resentment. Resentment-driven populism never works out well; vision of a positive future for everyone who lives in the Middle East and Africa is a much better way of handling conflict resolution, promotion of human rights, and economic development – and the journalists made an important step in that direction.

Rabat – It is not every day that one touches ground with the rich and gratifying Latin American literature and writers, this time around luck struck, the Embassy of Colombia and the dynamic International University of Rabat -UIR- “conspired” benevolently to bring to Morocco the world-known Colombian writer Hector Abad Faciolince, to talk to students and faculty about his work translated in several world languages. This highly-interesting literary function was aptly organized by the super active and competent Professor Mustapha Bencheikh, dean of the School of Languages and Civilizations and his able staff: Sara Salmi, Habiba Zaghloul and Mouna Kandil.  Hector Abad Faciolince was born in Medellin, Colombia in 1958, to a well-to-do family as the only boy -among five sisters-. He started writing at the age of twelve and never stopped since. He is considered today as a prominent Latin American writer and a talented post-Latin American Boom. His books are available in major world languages: English, French, Arabic, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Romanian, etc; He has published over 14 works, the most known among them are: his bestselling novel Angosta, and more recently, El Olvido que Seremos (Oblivion: A Memoir). His father was a prominent doctor and philanthropist, who worked for government and international organization and travelled around the world generously helping local populations and spreading love and understanding, but he was, also, a, university professor, and human rights activist and prominent leader whose holistic vision of healthcare led him to found the Colombian National School of Public Health which allowed many Colombians rich or poor to pursue their studies easily in this specialty to serve Colombians wherever they are. Hector Abad Faciolince started his presentation talking about his family but mainly his father, who seemingly is his own hero: my father, my idol. At an early age, Hector wrote a letter to his globe-trotting father while away in one of his missions. The latter was pleasantly surprised by his son’s mastership of the words and predicted that he would become a writer and thus he became a world know writer: novelist, journalist and essayist, read in many world languages with much delight and gusto. Hector Abad Faciolince is truly a storyteller and a good one, indeed. During his presentation, he captivated the public with his personal stories. His secret: the choice of words, the nature of the characters, the tone of voice and the freshness of the narration styles. From the word go the public was receptive of his talk because the man is full of goodness and love and that made everyone feel comfortable and predisposed to be enchanted by his wonderful stories and captivated by their boundless magic.  His father Hector Abad Gomez was some sort Robin Hood or Ali Baba, almost taking from the rich and giving to the needy, especially the community of students who were poor but willing to pursue their education. In a word, his father’s generosity gave hope to the poor and his boundless humanity created so much-needed social cohesion. The father not only cared for Colombians welfare but went around the world spreading love and medical care and expertise to the poor. It seems that Colombia was not big enough for this philanthropist and medical doctor goodness to spread his love and affection to the needy. He, indeed, needed a bigger stage and he got it: a big heart for a bigger environment and the world at large benefited greatly from the generosity of this man. The father’s heart wavered between Catholicism and secularism; he was, actually, both, in a very positive manner. But alas, our good hero was the victim of the very thing he abhorred extremism and violence. Like all good heroes, he fell prey to the violence of the extremists for the only reason that he was a good man full of love.  He was murdered by the paramilitaries in a crime that brought about shock in Colombia and other parts of the world. The writer was threatened, himself, and, as a result, he moved to Europe where he stayed for 5 years, first in Spain and later in Italy. We learn from Hector Abad Faciolince that this dramatic event took place in a country torn by political extremism and drug cartel violence and that people die of gun violence as easily as they breath. Guns are easily available in the country and so is cheap violence.  The public moved by the violent death of Hector Abad Faciolince’s father and they were prepared to shed a tear or two, but the author does not want a sad ending to his story and moved on to talk about hope, dialogue and forgiveness in Colombia and, thus, brought about a happy ending to the tale.  His father was very much like Saint Martin of Tours (Latin: Sanctus Martinus Turonensis; 316 or 336 – 8 November 397), who was born in what is now Szombathely, Hungary, spent much of his childhood in Pavia, Italy, and lived most of his adult life in France, he is considered a spiritual bridge across Europe. He is best known for the account of his using his military sword to cut his cloak in two, to give half to a beggar clad only in rags in the depth of winter. Conscripted as a soldier into the Roman army, he found the duty incompatible with the Christian faith he had adopted and became an early conscientious objector. Hector Abad Faciolince successfully captivated, for an afternoon, the audience of the International University of Rabat -UIR- in a wonderful literary intimacy transporting everyone through the air to Colombia, which was known to them only for its wonderful coffee and dreadful drug cartels epitomized in a recent American action film entitled “Colombiana. ”  His talk was a wonderful collective therapy extolling such universal concepts as love, affection and infatuation but also pain, death and loneliness. Everyone left the auditorium feeling light and refreshed and willing to give hugs to everyone else because this wonderful Latin American writer spread around, in words, so much love and forgiveness to go around. Colombia, mon amour. You can follow Professor Mohamedd Chtatou onTwitter: @Ayurinu

Rabat – Twenty-four hours after arresting director of the daily newspaper Akhbar Alyoum, Taoufik Bouachrine, Casablanca’s Public Prosecutor said in statement Saturday evening that the Moroccan journalist was arrested because of “sexual assault” allegations leveled against him. “The services of the judicial police continue their research in the case, has listened to the testimonies of some of the victims and the investigation is still underway,” the statement said. The statement of the Public Prosecutor denied the news that other people have been arrested in relation to the same allegations, adding that Bouachrine’s arrest “has nothing to do with journalism.” A prolific writer, Boucahrine was arrested on Friday while he was in the headquarters of his newspaper. The Moroccan journalist is known for writing scathing and controversial editorials about the leaders of Moroccan parties, especially the current Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Aziz Akhannouch. In an editorial published in October 2015, Bouachrine accused the Minister of Agriculture and his finance colleague Mohamed Boussaid of surreptitiously withdrawing, in the 2016 Finance Bill, the prerogatives of Authorizing Officer of the Rural Development Fund to the Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane, then Head of Government. The two ministers filed a defamation lawsuit against Bouachrine. In a ruling issued on February 12, 2018, the court of first instance sentenced the director of Akhbar Alyoum and Alyaoum24 news website to MAD 45.000 of damages to the two ministers.

Rabat – “I do not believe in special preparations for a game,” Faouzi Benzarti said in his press conference just hours before Wydad’s performance against DR Congo’s TP Mazembe. Mazembe is, without doubt, one of the best African clubs, and meeting them in a determining game, the Tunisian technician knew what his boys were up against: “We’ll’ suffer,” he said, adding that his team will play to win and will deliver  a “just football.” “I know that TP Mazembe is a big club. But so are we.” Yes, so is Wydad Casablanca. The game happened as expected, an encounter between two teams trying to keep the reputation that is theirs on the continental level, to maintain and consolidate dominance over African football. But to Wydad, victory meant a lot more: keep alive the current renaissance of Moroccan football; win the club’s first ever African Super Cup; put a definite end to the counter-performances that have been ailing the squad in the national league. Benzarti had told his boys that winning Saturday’s game would usher them in the club’s history! The Reds would forever remember them. This was not a mere game; it was a call of duty. You give your utmost and claim the pride of those who give you unconditional love. A goalless first half full of thrilling moments; an engaging, tense, and offensive-filled performances from both teams. It truly was an encounter of titans! To win, for both sides, meant the whole world. Wydad controlled much of the game. Cheered and hailed by fans thirsty for a first African Super Cup to decorate the team’s already legendary trophy collection, their mood boosted by the assurance that comes with playing at home, Wydad’s boys played their all to get the ball pass through that seemingly impenetrable Congolese citadel. But to no avail, at least until the 82nd minute. Then came that free kick. When Amin Tighazoui put the ball on the ground, the 28-year-old did not look at the Red Sea that had invaded Mohamed V Stadium. But he knew that all eyes well set on him, that prayers were being said, that scoring would mean entering Wydad’s history through a golden gate. And so he did! In a breathtakingly remarkable moment of Messi-esque inspiration, the Moroccan winger got the ball pass through the wall and lodge itself in the Congolese goal, to the delight and utter pleasure of the thousands of red-clothed fans at the Mohamed V complex. Wydad did not only win on Saturday. It made history. And add Wydad’s Saturday victory to the national CHAN triumph weeks ago, you’ll see that Moroccan football is clearly enjoying its best moments in recent years. And so the footballing renaissance lingers on!

Rabat – After a number of gays and lesbians came out of their shell to demand their rights as citizens of Morocco, a wave of transgenders’ rights campaign followed, demanding the same rights. Moroccan youth, who identify as a “a group of transgender, transsexual, and gender non-conforming individuals”, announced the establishment of their own body in a meeting held in Rabat. This body aims to create a “a new, independent and self-sustaining dynamic, open to all those who are interested in the issues of the transgender community. “ The new Moroccan group wants to fight “against all forms of discrimination,” the group explained, adding its creation comes “in the context of the absence of any will to open a social debate on transsexuality.” “People are clueless about transsexuality. They think that all gender and sexual identity issues are related to sexual orientation. Because of my feminine behavior, they call me gay. I am not gay. I am not even a man,” explained a transsexual girl, who wished to speak anonymously. Aside from wanting to spread awareness on transsexuality, the group complained in a press release that it is “deprived” of the right to legal status, hormonal treatment and surgery. In order for transsexuals to “transition” to their internal sense of gender identity, they undergo hormone intakes and sex reassignment surgery. “There is no possibility to change one’s sex in Morocco,” a transsexual man told Morocco World News, explaining that he had to go to Spain to receive hormone replacement therapy. The Moroccan activists complained for not having access to medical treatment in Morocco and for being “discriminated” against by their families and society. Stigmatization of gay and transsexual community Despite the 2011 constitution’s commitment to “banish and combat discrimination against any person, by reason of sex, color, creed, culture, social or regional origin, language, disability or any personal circumstances,” homosexuality remains intolerable in Morocco and published under article 489 of the Criminal Code, criminalizing consensual sexual conduct between same-sex adults. “It is easier for me as a transsexual man to walk in the public sphere. My friend from the US brought me a bandage that I use to cover my breast. I also cut my hair short and dress like a boy. People easily mistake me for a biological male, but my transsexual female friends suffer a lot. I’ve seen them being beaten up and called offensive names,” another transsexual male told Morocco World News. “Some of my ‘old friends,’ threatened to report me to the police because, telling me that who I am is a sin and should be punished. Despite passing as a boy, I’m always terrified to be recognized for my past gender identity. But I can’t help it, I am a transsexual and this is the only way I can be,” he added. Mustapha Ramid, Human Rights Minister, has condemned the LGBT community several times. While he stated that Morocco accepted United Nations’ recommendation to “take urgent measures to repeal the norms that criminalize and stigmatize lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons,” his discourse indicates otherwise. He has called homosexuals “trash” and recently referred to “homosexuality as a violation of human rights. For him, his position is based on “the kingdom’s constitution and its laws and the international conventions it has signed,” as well as the “national consensus,” which “only the perverts deviate from.” For Aziz Idamine, head of the Moroccan Rights and Freedoms Youth Center, Ramid’s use of these “degrading terms against a minority in Morocco is nothing new to the vocabulary of the minister; he already called journalists ‘traitors’ once and described human rights activists as ‘hateful’.” “Ramid thinks that being a minister of state of all Moroccans is the same thing as being the leader of a small community or political party.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Association of Sexology has appealed to the Moroccan ministry of health, asking the relevant authorities to exempt medical doctors from the delivery of the virginity certificate, a document they say violates both doctors’ oath of medical confidentiality and the right to privacy of the persons (girls) for whom it is delivered. The document, generally required of young girls about to marry, has long been a hot-button issue in various Moroccan circles, especially opposing “progressive” and “conservative” Moroccans on what family and religious values should be. According to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia in its February 24-25 edition, the association of Moroccan sexologists’ recent appeal to the ministry of health drew attention to the fact that the delivering of such a document is a “burden on doctors”, as it puts them in sharp contradiction with their oath of confidentiality. The association also said in its appeal that the document, as it is generally delivered to family members other than to the girls on whom the auscultation test is administered, violates patients’ right to privacy, as well as their dignity and agency. Rachid Aboutaieb, urologist and professor at the Casablanca Medicine Faculty, told Al Ahdath Al Maghribia that their appeal has strong legal grounds. He said that Moroccan civil law does not prescribe the infamous document as necessary for the validity of a marital union, which, he explained, makes the so-called certificate altogether “illegal”. Mr. Aboutaieb, who is also the acting president of Moroccan sexologists’ association, further told the daily that upon administering auscultation on a patient, doctors have the solemn obligation, legally and professionally, to discharge test results to no third party. He called the practice “degrading” towards girls forced to undergo the exam, stressing that doctors who collaborate with parents are acting in blatant disregard of Moroccan civil law, as well as the ethical code of conduct of their own profession. The association, however, acknowledged that the battle against such an embedded practice will not be easy, especially as many families accept the practice as a religious decree, a moral obligation, and a matter of preserving the families’ honor and integrity. In many instances, especially in rural or conservative circles, brides-to-be are forced to go to the doctor in the company of family members and future in-laws, says Al Ahdath Maghribia.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – In its latest report, BMI Research asserts that vehicle production in Morocco is becoming more attractive and efficient drawing more automakers to the favorable operating environment, and expanding the kingdom’s access to both the MENA and European region.   The report expects the vehicle production to reach 468,389 units in 2018, which will result in a16.9 percent increase from current production. The industry is predicted to maintain its current pace with an average annual growth of 19.8 percent from 2018-2022, with an annual production of 988, 477 units. BMI Research highlights the role that Gestamp, a designer and manufacturer of metal automotive components that announced its entry into Morocco on February 2018, will play in improving the country’s supply chain efficiency for automakers by allowing them to source more local components.  Gestamp’s entry followed a similar move by two of its main global partners: Renault-Nissan Group and Group PSA. The proximity of the corporations will allow them to maintain the annual growth with few barriers, such as supply delays and time-consuming import regulations.  Gestamp also joins a fast-developing supplier base, including Magneti Marelli and Linmar Group, which strengthen Morocco’s position as “an attractive production hub.”  Automakers in Morocco will also benefit from the Agadir Agreement, which exempts member countries from custom duties on the condition that 40 percent of the value is added in all member countries.  The BMI research believes that the development of the value chain, the process by which goods are created, in Morocco will positively influence the country’s exports, given the rising demand from Europe and the Middle East and North Africa Regions (MENA). The report predicts that vehicle sales volume in the European and MENA regions will reach 24.33 million units and 5.26 million units by 2022, with a growth average of 2.9 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, over 2018-2022 forecast period.

Rabat – On Friday, the High Court in Port Elizabeth, South Africa returned a verdict in favor of the separatist group Polisario, concerning a Moroccan phosphate shipment detained on May 1, 2017, after a Polisario complaint that the cargo was transported illegally from Western Sahara. The judgment, however, was announced in the absence of the Moroccan party involved. The court decided that the Polisario Front’s Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) is the “owner of all the phosphate cargo currently loaded on the NM Cherry Blossom,” noting that “phosphate ownership has never been legally held by the Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) and/or Phosphates de Boucraa SA.” According to the court, the institutions are not authorized to sell phosphate to Ballance Agri-Nutrients Limited of New Zealand. Additional orders issued by the court denied OCP the power to auction cargo and the right to recover the capital costs of the shipment. OCP was certain that the South African court was planning to politicize the case, adding that the decision does not bring any new developments, according to Le360. OCP does not seem to be outraged over the decision taken by the court. A source within the OCP told Le360 that the decision is positive in many ways.  Referring to Polisario, the source said that “the opposing side attempted to sell the 55,0000 tons of phosphate using all possible means and made contacts with all potential actors.” However, according to OCP, “We managed to block these attempts every time,” they were trying to do so. Therefore, “the decision is favorable to us insofar as it stipulates a judicial sale made at the request of the shipowner.” According to an unidentified source, “Maintaining the amount seized of phosphate has become a source of embarrassment for South Africa, and the decision was taken by default.” In July 2017, OCP Group refused to participate in South Africa trial “that undermines UN resolution process and international law.” “This judicial overreach threatens the freedom and security of international trade, while it contradicts core legal concepts and undermines the United Nations (UN) resolution process. Thus, participating in any trial before this forum would give further credit to a process without legal legitimacy,” said OCP group. The court’s decision contradicts basic principles of international law. The decision also constitutes a “serious and dangerous interference “  that might undermine the negotiation process which has been carried out under the auspices of the United Nations.

Rabat – Counterfeit medicines and expired pharmacy drugs, some illegally manufactured, are being sold without authorization or prescriptions. The issue has now prompted the Ministry of Health to boost public awareness about the effects and dangers of buying fake medications. Moroccan newspaper Al Akhbar reported in its weekend issue that 15,000 poisonings are recorded every year due to unauthorized medicines. According to the newspaper, the Moroccan Network for the Defense of the Right to Health raised concern and awareness about counterfeit and illegally manufactured medicines and their effects in a recent report featured at the second national meeting of medicines and health products. The meeting is being held under the theme “The fight against falsified medicines in Africa.” The February 24-25 meeting is taking place in Skhirat, a seaside town located between Rabat and Casablanca. The network has raised concerns over the medicines being sold in the absence of control of the National Drug Administration, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Health. According to the Moroccan network, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established three categories of falsified or illegally manufactured medicines: the medicines that contain the correct chemical formula but at a lower dose than labeled, expired medicines and counterfeits that may contain toxic or deadly substances. The same source added that falsified medicines account for 1 percent of products in developed countries, 60 percent of medicines in the poorest countries and between 20 to 30 percent in developing countries. According to WHO, falsified medicines account for 11 percent of all medicines sold in developing countries, noting that these medications kill more than one million people across the world. The Network for the Defense of the Right to Health, according to Al Akhbar, added that Morocco is facing a serious issue involving smuggled medications, especially in the eastern region, southern provinces and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.

Amsterdam – The estimated worldwide population of street children lies around 150 million. Egypt has around one million street children in Alexandria and Cairo. These children faced many problems that contributed to their astray. Negligence, child abuse, having siblings already living on the streets, disrupted families, poverty, crime among relatives, drug addiction, selling sex or having sex with adolescents are all identified as risk factors. Few statistics on program strategies are known so far, aside from some UNICEF reports from 2016. Most evidence comes from scientific publications. Assuming that little has changed within a country due to national crisis, the following data might still be accurate for 2018. Living on the streets has significant consequences for the children’s physical and mental health. A study conducted in 2010 in Alexandria and Cairo examined 857 street children. It reported harassment or abuse in 93% of the children by police or other children. Within the same sample, 67% were sexually active with multiple sex partners wherefrom 52% has never used condoms. The final result might be a consequence of lack of education, money and access to sexual health education and awareness. In Alexandria, 90% of the street girls reported sexual abuse. Street girls, in general, have poorer outcomes than boys. This could be due to the dominating male presence in street children and vulnerability of girls. Furthermore, 62% report to have used drugs. The results from Egypt are not unique. It is reported that the same factors and problems occur elsewhere in the developing world. In Tehran, 4.5% of the examined street children were found positive for HIV. A qualitative study conducted in Tehran reports that drug use was more common in children whose parents had drug-use problems. The children report using drug to cope with stress, sadness, pressure, and other problems. Besides sexual and drug problems, other health-related problems were later identified in street children. A follow-up study published in 2017 reported that respiratory problems were highly prevalent (22.4%) as were skin disorders (16.6%). Skin disorders such as lice infestation, scabies and allergic dermatitis result from poor hygiene from living on the streets. Furthermore, the same study in Egypt found that children below two years were the offspring of the street children aged around 12 years. Multiple services are required from the authorities to protect children from street violence. Specifically, stabilizing public health services and ensuring the basic needs of the population can prevent families from falling apart in the first place. This will then minimize the number of street children.

Rabat – As in previous years, Morocco will have to switch to summer time (daylight saving time) in a few weeks. This decades-long tradition of switching clocks back one hour and then forward between the winter and summer months is under review by the European Parliament after several member countries urged the EU to consider abolishing the practice. The European Parliament has backed a possible plan to end daylight saving time across the 28 member states after 384 deputies out of 549 voted in favor of the resolution, which will now be submitted for a final vote.  Daylight saving time was first adopted during the First World War in the UK to give factories more daylight hours to operate in, thereby aiding the war effort. The issue has divided MEPs within the France-based European assembly. An October 2017 EU Parliament study stated that, “while daylight-saving time benefits the transport industry, helps outdoor leisure activities and reduces energy consumption, it is associated with disruptions to the human biorhythm.”    “The lack of sleep that [the clock change] provokes for many fellow citizens poses a real problem of road safety,” said French Greens MEP Karima Delli during the debate on February 8.    “It is the cause of a large number of accidents involving the most vulnerable road users.I hereby think of pedestrians and cyclists,” she added.  However, for the Belgian MEP Hilde Vautmans, losing extra summertime light would mean “that for seven months we lose one hour of light. That would mean the end of beautiful summer evenings with friends on the terrace in the garden, of biking or jogging with therefore a lesser quality of life.”   Daylight saving time has been used in Morocco since 2008 to increase the competitiveness of the national economy by reducing the cost of the energy consumption and facilitating transactions with regional economic partners, mainly Europe. If approved, how will the possible removal of clock changes in winter and summer affect Morocco? Will the North African country follow in the footsteps of its primary economic partner or will it simply keep changing the clocks backward and forward in a ritual that many citizens believe adds no extra value to the national economy and only creates a state of confusion for people and businesses?

Rabat – The Trump Administration is planning to open its new embassy in the holy city of Jerusalem in May in conjunction with the 70th anniversary of Israel declaring independence. International media reported today that two officials in the Trump Administration have told the Associated Press that the American Congress would be informed of the decision on Friday. BREAKING: New US Embassy in Jerusalem will open in May 2018 in celebration of Israel’s 70th anniversary, officials say. — The Associated Press (@AP) February 23, 2018  The US administration’s announcement came after Donald Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the city. The American Vice-President, Mike Pence, had previously stated that the embassy move would occur sometime in 2019. Trump’s decision has sparked a backlash in the region and was widely condemned by Arab and Western countries alike. Leaders, including King Mohammed VI, denounced the US decision, considering it a significant threat to peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel. The monarch sent a letter to the US President on the eve of the decision (December 5), stressing how such a decision would undermine peace negotiations in the region. The King also sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in which he expressed his deep concern over Trump’s decision, emphasizing that such an action would end peace negotiations between the two states.

Rabat – 57 percent of offenders arrested for terrorism-related charges in Spain in the past year were of Moroccan nationality, finds a study by the International Terrorism Observatory. The study indicated that 57 percent of people detained for terrorism in 2017 in Spain were Moroccan nationals, against 28 percent who were Spanish, reported Friday Al Massae daily. Moroccan extremists are the main threat to the security of Spain, followed by Algerians at four percent and Egyptians at three percent, said the same source. 2017 was also marked by 51 police operations and 84 arrests, said the same source indicating that anti-terrorist operations have made remarkable progress last year, following the Barcelona bombings. “The terrorist attacks in Catalonia in 2017 reminded us that the fight is not over and that much remains to be done,” said Consuelo Ordóñez, president of the Collective of Victims of Terrorism. Facing terrorist threats, Spanish authorities have allegedly restricted freedom of speech and made excessive terrorism allegations during 2017, said Amnesty International in its annual report on the state of human rights in countries across the world. “Authorities pressed criminal charges against people who had expressed opinions that did not constitute incitement to a terrorism-related offense and fell within the permissible forms of expression under international human rights law,” said Amnesty in its report published January 22.

Rabat – This Friday in Brussels, at a high-level international conference on the Sahel, Minister of cooperation and foreign affairs Nasser Bourita met with several high officials of the European Union, G5 Sahel (Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Chad, Niger, Mali) heads of state and government, UN and AU representatives, as well as important officials from friend states such as USA, Japan, and the Golf states. The conference, which was held under the auspices of the European Union, allowed the mobilization of € 414 million, a sum that will wholly be allocated to operations in support of the G5 Sahel Joint Anti-Terrorism Force. During the conference, participants also discussed means to strengthen coordination on security-related strategic issues and reinforce effectiveness regarding sustainable development aids in the region. The meeting, Nasser Bourita shortly afterwards told MAP, was also an occasion to discuss other regional and international issues. The EU, key contributor to stability and security measures in the G5 Sahel area, vowed, after this week’s conference, to double its efforts towards financing the region’s joint anti-terrorism force. In this regard, EU officials at the conference assured participants that Europe would increase its support to € 100 million, which, they said, together with other international supports, will help G5 Sahel countries acquire the necessary means to improve security and crush terrorism in the region. “The EU plays a major role in this Sahel alliance which, launched in July 2017, aims to coordinate and channel, in a more effective way, financial help to the region’s most fragile zones,” said a press release after the conference, adding that the aid initiative is open to all international partners that hope to join the anti-terrorism fight.

Rabat – The National Office of Airports (ONDA) achieved a turnover of MAD 3.7 billion in 2017, an increase of 10 percent compared to 2016. With more than 20 million passengers, air traffic showed a strong increase of 11.63 percent compared to 2016, along with an increase in domestic traffic of 11 percent. International traffic increased by 11.67 percent with a significant increase in traffic with Europe at 12.17 percent, said a statement from ONDA. The agency welcomed the “sharp increase” in the number of passengers having passed through the different air terminals of the kingdom. Aeronautical fees recorded an increase of 8.4 percent, reaching MAD 2.98 billion in 2017, thanks to the combined effect of growth in passenger traffic and overflights, with a rise of 7.3 percent, respectively, and the number of flights increasing by 8.32 percent. Non-aeronautical revenues amounted to MAD 752 million, an increase of 18.6 percent compared to 2016. This evolution is mainly due to the growth of commercial revenues, which rose by 23.6 percent including a rise in government fees of 11.8 percent. While 2017 revenues recorded positive growth, ONDA seeks to register even more growth in 2018. Following guideline of the 2018 Finance Law, the office expects income to reach MAD 4.05 billion in 2018, based on assumptions of sustained growth in passenger traffic which is forecast to rise 7 percent. Aircraft departures and arrivals will rise 6 percent, overflights will increase 7 percent and airfreight is expected to increase 10 percent. ONDA council members approved the draft budget for 2018, which would allocate an amount of MAD 2.595 billion to investments, of which MAD 1.66 billion is for the further development of airport capacity, MAD 419 million for airport safety and security, and 249 billion dirhams for airfield operations safety and security.

Rabat – Starting next week, diesel and gasoline prices will drop by MAD 0.205 in all Moroccan gas stations, the Ministry of Energy and Mines released in a statement. According to the same source, the prices of diesel and gasoline have already started to decline from Thursday, February 22. Diesel dropped about MAD 0.12 and gasoline MAD 0.13. Lahcen Daoudi, the Minister of General Affairs and Governance, recently said that prices at the pump in Morocco were “forced to fall,” following the drop of oil prices over the past weeks.   The minister, who closely follows the fluctuations of oil prices on a “daily basis,” noted the decline of the latter from USD 70 to USD 62 per barrel. He also pointed out that prices will remain the same until the end of February. After the liberalization of fuel prices, the ministry launcheda new initiative last September that allows drivers to check the recent fuel price trends at the pump. Daoudi’s solution of showing consumers all available prices will keep them informed by allowing them “to choose the cheapest petrol stations.” The minister insisted the information “must” be available for citizens. However, he stated during a press conference, held in June 2017, that “citizens do not take advantage of the liberalization” of hydrocarbon prices enacted in December 2015. The minister alleged that it was the Moroccan government, rather,that had “not provided conditions for good competition.” He also announced that while distributors can change the price of hydrocarbons, they must alert the ministry before doing so.

Rabat – While the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is set to deliberate the validity of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement on February 27, legal experts are continuously raising concerns about the move, warning the ECJ not to exceed its legal mandate by meddling in politics. Jean-Jacques Nuer, an international corporate lawyer and a member of both the Paris Bar and the Law Society in London has called on the ECJ to comply with the theory of “the separation of powers” ascribed to French Enlightenment political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu. Nuer’s statements were published by the French online investigative and opinion journal, Mediapart on February 22. “We will have to understand – behind this obscure fish quarrel – it is to judge by a court of Justice that the presence of Morocco in the Sahara is contrary to the international law and in particular to that of the people to the self-determination. It is, therefore, a question much more political than legal,” according to Nuer’s article, “Case of the Sahara: Montesquieu is murdered!” In his remarks, Nuer has also referenced the ECJ ruling on the Morocco-EU agriculture agreement. “The CJEU issued a judgment in 2016, ruling that the agreements concluded between the EU and Morocco must respect the relevant rules of international law applicable” in the relations between both parties. Wathelet’s Opinion Poses Issue of Separation of Powers On January 10, Melchior Wathelet, Advocate General of the Luxembourg-based ECJ, made the comments that EU-Morocco fisheries agreement should be declared null and void because it includes Western Sahara. To contest Wathelet”s argument, Nuer said that this decision poses the issue of separation of powers. The lawyer said that the remarks made by the Advocate General “exceeded his mandate describing the situation excess of power.” The author of the opinion said that the Sahara conflict does not require judges but, “provides a field of patience and high-quality diplomats.” “What would be a society where diplomacy would be conducted by the judges if not a government of the judges?” asked the lawyer rhetorically. According to Nuer, this is exactly what has been happening recently, “where a qualification that is neither legal nor factual but simply diplomatic – we know diplomacy is often a balancing act – is violently defeated by one person.” Benefits of EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreements The fisheries ties between Morocco and the European Union date back to 1988. Negotiated four years ago, the fishing agreement provided annual permits without restriction, according to the European Union. Since then partnerships between the two entities have expanded to involve protocols from different fields, including trade activities. According to the director of Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF), Willy Fature, the EU-Morocco fisheries partnership is an important collaboration. Quoted by the Brussels-based news outlet, Europa Reporter, Fature said that “the fisheries agreement is an important mechanism for voicing and mainstreaming.” The HRWF president added that Sahrawi people “have also benefited from the Fisheries Agreement between the EU and Morocco.” Fature, who visited the fisheries port in the city of Dakhla said that “there were hundreds of people, mainly women, working there in the factory,” adding that “fisheries are really a main source of employment for Morocco.”

Rabat – A total of 530 Moroccans sought asylum in Spain last year, many claiming persecution for political, ideological, ethnic or sexual orientation circumstances, according to unofficial data from the Spanish Interior Ministry. About 11 percent of the total number of Moroccans who illegally entered Spain last year eventually sought asylum, according to data from the European Frontier Agency. The number of asylum seekers reaching Spain from the Maghreb is low compared to other nationalities, such as 10,000 citizens from Venezuela and 4,300 Syrians. In 2016, Spanish authorities granted 10 Moroccans asylum, while another 206 were granted “subsidized protection,” a status that provides a travel document, work permit, residency and support for several months. According to Frontex’s 2018 report, domestic conditions in Morocco and the kingdom’s place as a main transit route for migrants heading to Spain have created a surge of departures from Morocco’s western coast in the past year. Large capacity boats, often overcrowded, are able to transport significant numbers of migrants, many who pay large sums of money. Moroccans accounted for the most nationals that illegally crossed into Spain using the Western Mediterranean Route. Their numbers are steadily increasing: 468 in 2014; 631 in 2015; 722 in 2016, and 809 in 2017. They were followed by Algerians and Ivorians. The sea border between Spain and Morocco remains significantly affected, with Ceuta as the most reported departure hub, and Moroccan nationals as the main nationality. Smugglers from 55 different nationalities were involved in the facilitation of irregular migration towards Libya, Turkey and Spain and onwards to the EU, said the report. It added that facilitators were active in 41 different countries, most coming from Turkey (37 percent) and Libya (30 percent). Iraq, Morocco, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Algeria and Egypt were also listed as “countries with significant presence of facilitators,” as together they account for 30 percent of the total.

New York – In reading the comments recently of several Moroccan intellectuals on the need to reform Morocco’s educational system, I was surprised to see that some blame the Arabic language and Islam for the problems that affect it.  In recent years, with the rise of terrorism in most Arab and Muslim countries, we are witnessing the emergence of a new narrative, according to which Arabic and Islam are the major catalysts pushing those who are left behind economically or politically in Morocco toward extremism and jihadism, and not ignorance, extreme poverty, neglect by politicians, corruption, nepotism, or even a catastrophic educational system. The defenders of what I call “anti-Arabism” seek not only the disappearance of the Arabic language in the daily life of Moroccans, but, above all, in the long term to see Morocco adopt a secular educational system inspired by the French system. Underlying their arguments is their desire simply to replace the Arabic language with French in the Moroccan educational system. For them, the main cause of Morocco’s “backwardness” is Arabic; hence there is a need to replace it with French. But the question that supporters of this agenda forget to ask is this: what benefit has the French language brought to the millions of Moroccans who for decades have been abandoned by an elite who live in an ivory tower, an elite who educate their children in foreign schools and do not care about the future of those left behind? As Professor Moha Ennaji eloquently put it in a comment on Facebook, the problem in Morocco is not the language of instruction, but the educational system itself, the training methods, the teaching staff, and the instructional content. If the problem was merely linguistic, why then did a country like South Korea become an economic power based on its national language and not on a foreign language? The answer is simple: they have one of the best educational systems in the world. It is truly lamentable to continue to say that Arabic is the source of the problem and to turn a blind eye to the real deficiencies that have destroyed the Moroccan educational system. To say that Arabic is the main cause of the problems that plague the Moroccan education system is dangerous, because such an assertion implies that this language is synonymous with ignorance and backwardness. Those who continue to demonize Arabic ignore the fact that this language was the vehicle of knowledge for centuries long before the romance languages such as French, Spanish or Italian became languages as we know them today. Perhaps the Muslim scholars of the golden age of Islam wrote in French? It may be necessary to remind the detractors of Arabic that languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, and English borrowed thousands of words from Arabic during the golden age of the Arab-Muslim civilization. For example, Spanish, one of the most spoken languages in the world, borrowed 5,000 words from Arabic. More than 500 words that are used in French come from the Arabic language, which is the third most-borrowed-from language for French after English is Italian. The detractors of Arabic also ignore the fact that without the contribution of this language, the Greek philosophy that the West has adopted as its intellectual foundation for more than six centuries could not have been preserved. It is thanks to the colossal translation and adaptation work undertaken by the Abbassids during the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries that the West, immersed in the dark period of the Middle Ages, was able to gain access to the Greek philosophy of Aristotle and Plato. Should these anti-Arabists be reminded of the role Ibn Khaldun played in the birth of sociology, and that his book Al Moukaddima was written in Arabic? Should we remind them of the role that Al Kindi, an Arab born in Baghdad, played in the transmission of Greek philosophy, in astronomy, medicine and mathematics with the use of Arabic numerals? Should they be reminded that the works written by Al Khwarizmi, the founding father of algebra, were written in Arabic and that the scientific revolution that he brought about over 11 centuries ago was at the origin of all innovations in the field of information technology that the world enjoys today? As long as Moroccans continue to ride this wave of anti-Arabism, nothing will change in this country, and those who pay the price are not the children of wealthy families, but the children of the people who struggle every day to make ends meet. Those who strive to eliminate the Arabic language appear toll have the same goal: to restore and maintain the primacy of French in the Moroccan educational system, as if this language has a magic capable of transforming the masses of those left behind into geniuses. Why do those who want less Arabic in Morocco ask for more French and not more English? Perhaps French is the most spoken language in the world? Maybe it’s the language of business and diplomacy? If these new preachers claim to look after the good of the people and defend their interests, why do they persist in seeking to impose an educational system based on the French for all Moroccans? If these anti-Arabists cared for future generations of Moroccans, they would not denigrate a component of their identity and common history, but fight to give them access to an education adapted to the demands of today’s world, to have the tools to flourish in their professional and social lives and to participate in building a better and prosperous Morocco. Yet to thrive in today’s world, young Moroccans, in addition to their mother tongues, must be fluent not only in French, but especially in English. These detractors of Arabic should stand back and be objective. To say that the Arabic language pushes Moroccan students to become jihadists is a dishonest stance and is unworthy of those belonging to the academic community. Those who defend the French language and believe that the salvation of the Moroccan education system consists in the adoption and universalization of French in Moroccan schools without there being a major overhaul and reform of this system are mistaken in their diagnosis.  Instead this view distorts the debate on the critical need to reform national education. And by distorting the debate, it prevents our country from making the right diagnosis and providing the right solutions. The world is changing. France and the French language are no longer the panacea that can solve Morocco’s problems. Even the French themselves are aware of this. English has become the language of business in France, according to an article published in Le Figaro on July 25, 2017. I am not calling for the elimination of the French language from the Moroccan education system, nor that any one language should be given primacy over another. I myself am multilingual, and I would like the majority of Moroccans to be too.  In fact, I am in favor of further promoting other foreign languages such as Spanish and Chinese. As the late Mehdi El Manjra had said, a people who are not proud of their mother tongue can never move forward. It is deplorable to see intellectuals denigrate the Arabic language and claim that it is the source of all the problems that handicap the Moroccan educational system, instead of pleading for a profound reform to improve that system across the board.

Rabat – Moroccan police have arrested Taoufik Bouachrine, a journalist and director of Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Alyoum and Alyaoum24 news website on Friday.  The prolific and controversial journalist was arrested inside the headquarters of his newspaper. According to alyaoum24, twenty policemen entered the headquarter of the newspaper in Casablanca and arrested Bouachrne. The Prosecutor General’s office issued a communique in which it laconically explained the reasons of the arrest. “This arrest came as a result of several complaints” against Bouachrine. “For the moment, and in order to guarantee the interest of research and its secrecy as well as to preserve the preemption of innocence, it is not possible to communicate the subject of these complaints”. The news went viral on social media networks, mainly Facebook and Twitter. In June 2010, he was sentenced to six months in prison, a MAD dirham fine and 10,000 damages for an alleged scam. A year earlier, he was also brought to the court following a complaint by Prince Moulay Ismaïl for a caricature deemed “insulting.”

Rabat – On Thursday, former FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. According to Blatter, “Morocco would be the logical host” of the 2026 World Cup. The former boss, who has been banned for approving a GBP 1.35 million to French football manager Michel Platini, made his opinion clear through a tweet on Thursday, February 22. The ex-FIFA president wrote on his Twitter that “Co-Hosting rejected by FIFA after 2002 (also applied in 2010 and 2018). and now: Morocco would be the logical host!” The only African country that won the right to host FIFA’s World Cup was the southernmost African country, South Africa, in 2010. Morocco’s newest bid to host the tournament is going to be the fifth for the country, after those of 1994,1998,2006 and 2010. Blatter believes it “is time for Africa again” to host the ultimate global tournament. World Cup 2026: Co-Hosting rejected by FIFA after 2002 (also applied in 2010 and 2018). And now: Morocco would be the logical host! And it is time for Africa again! #Fifa #CAF #@FIFAWorldCup — Joseph S Blatter (@SeppBlatter) February 22, 2018  Morocco’s bid to host the tournament was supported by several African countries and football institutions, including the African Confederation of Football (CAF) that showed an unwavering support for the Moroccan candidacy. In January,  CAF President Ahmad Ahmad said that it is unfortunate that “ a continent with an impressive football history hosted the world cup only once throughout history.” The only African country, which won the right to host FIFA’s World Cup was South Africa. The southernmost African country was a host for the tournament in 2010. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the 2026 World Cup on August 11, 2017. A few days later, Ahmad called on heads of football confederation in Africa to show support for Morocco’s bid. CAF president said that it is a must for Africans to show “clear” and “massive” support for Morocco as it is determined to become the second African country to host the football event. Morocco’s bid might receive a boost. In fact, FIFA in 2010 Ghana, Benin, Togo sought to co-host the enormous tournament, however, Blatter said that FIFA was not considering potential co-hosts  unless there are “exceptional circumstances.” Morocco will compete in the 21st World Cup tournament that will take place this summer in Russia.

Rabat – This summer, between June 14-July 15, 32 nations will gather in Russia to take part in football’s most viewed and most celebrated tournament. Morocco, after two decades of absence from this crucial gathering of national teams, will be part of this highest footballing Mass, with a daunting task of taking on and braving two of world football’s most respected squads. With Spain and Portugal in Morocco’s group, some observers are nonetheless confident that the Atlas Lions can deliver a surprising performance in Russia, with Mexican daily Losandes Mas Desportes even saying with assurance that the Atlas Lions will not be eliminated in the group phase. Mas Desportes’ report is an echo to Hérve Renard’s statements weeks ago that Morocco can and will surprise contenders in Russia. For Mas Desportes, Morocco has a squad that can ably compete with any side in Russia. The Mexican daily, in its analysis of the potentials and strengths of the Moroccan squad, mentioned the technical prowess and managerial talent of Morocco’s Hervé Renard, as well as Juventus’ Benatia’s indisputable positive impact on Morocco’s defensive fortress. “The French technician has become a specialist of African squads. He has what it takes to lead his side very far in the tournament. Mehdi Benatia, the cornerstone of Morocco’s defense, who has played with AS Roma, Bayern and Juventus, is a player to trust,” Mas Desportes wrote. The Mexican daily also said that given that the tactical experience of Hervé Renard–whom they called “the white wizard”–and the footballing discipline of players such as Amrabat, Diar, Mbark Boussoufla, among others, Moroccans can expect their national team to ace the group phase and make it to the next round. Mas Desportes underlined the rebirth or renaissance that Morocco’s national sport has recently experienced, especially referring to the local lions’ spectacular triumph during CHAN 2018. “This success has given them the hope and motivation they needed to compete in Russia,” the daily wrote, adding that the Atlas Lions have no intention of being “mere guests” at the tournament. Moroccan squads were brilliant in the 1986 and 1998 editions, says Mas Desportes, concluding that Hervé Renard’s boys can be expected to be even more brilliant than their elders. “The Atlas Lions gave a bad time to England and defeated Portugal in Mexico in 1986. They played in Mexico as though on their home pitch,” Mas Desportes concluded, as it referred to Morocco’s sensational display at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

Rabat – At the migrant camp near the Oulad Ziane Bus Station in Casablanca, despite the precariousness of daily life, some migrants are still keeping hope alive and expectations very high. Some of them are even dreaming of a possible career of “Professional footballer” here in Morocco or in a European club. “At the Oulad Ziane Bus Station in Casablanca, players have put on their best shoes, spectators, running to the playing field, have left their tents: the match can begin,” reports Le 360 on site on the occasion of a match between Guinea and Cameroon. “We organize ourselves in small communities, playing in teams of five or six. Conditions are from ideal, especially with all the dirt around, but we still play: We play for our own pleasure; we play to forget,” says Djabel Niang, a 21 years old Senegalese who, having left Dakar nearly 3 years ago, still harbors a dream of a successful footballing career. When he left Senegal, he tells reporters, his dream was to cross the Mediterranean and “God willing, reach Real Madrid.” “Football is my profession,” he adds. Despite the toxic smells all around and under the “accusatory and hostile gaze” of some locals, some migrants, having “failed the European dream”, want to go back “home.” “I am fed up with all this. I’ve lost two years of my life,” one of the migrants is quoted as saying. Others, however, in spite of their current conditions, are still hopeful, and are expecting some kind of miracle to help them realize the dreams that brought them there in the first place. They tell reporters that they have a rather complicated relationship with locals: while some bring them food and clothes, some are not welcoming and “even come sometimes to provoke us.” To weather their harsh and stormy lives, they’ve organized in communities, based on their countries of origin. They are mostly Senegalese, Guineans, Ivoirians, etc., and each community has a president and a football team. “We train every day, every evening,” says Chancelin Njike, who is 25 and self-describes as a midfielder. He adds: “Sometimes we organize mini-tournaments among ourselves to create a relaxing atmosphere. At other times we play just for fun. ” Chancelin got himself a baccalaureate in sports-related disciplines before deciding, in 2015, to leave Cameroon where he used to play in the country’s third division. “I hoped to reach Europe, to train, and have a good level,” he further told Le 360’s reporters. In the broken and hesitant voice of somebody humbled by a compendium of difficult experiences, Chancelin tells reporters that he was not as lucky as some of his friends who have made it to Europe and are currently playing for Nancy, in France. He said he had spent two months in a forest in Southern Morocco, narrowly escaped drowning, and witnessed the death of two friends. “I’ve had it. I want to return home. I’ve lost two years of my life,” he says. Unlike Chancelin, Constand Ndassongue, another Cameroonian, aged 19, is beaming with hope. He has unsuccessfully attempted three times to cross to Europe, and yet he has faith that it is possible, that his future can be bright. He tells reporters that his dream is to play football, it doesn’t matter where or at what club, as long as he “shines like Marcelo”, his “Brazilian idol.” “When I’m not playing, I spend time training… to keep in shape,” he said.

Rabat – The fourth edition of African Digital Summit, a Casablanca-based two-day forum (22-23 February), was a total and record-breaking success, according to organizers, especially as this year’s edition gathered an “explosive number” of over 1650 participants, down 500 for last year’s edition. Speaking to the press about the success of this year’s edition, Mounir Jazouli, president of Moroccan Association of Advertisers, expressed his delight at the number of participants, especially stressing that 18 African countries participated in the event this year, out of a total number of 30 countries present. This, Mr. Jazouli said, is a source of pride and fulfillment, as African Digital Summit’s ultimate goal is to be Africa’s reference in the industry. “It is important to note that 18 out the 30 countries that participated are African. This for us is a good evolution, and we’re proud, even if our goal is to very soon cover all the African countries, as we ambition to be the number one annual meeting for digital actors in Africa,” he said. “This was an edition of consolidation,” Jazouli further told the press, also specifying that this fourth edition set the ground for “boosting recognition.” “But boosting recognition requires novelty and innovation,” Jazouli said, explaining that  with new activities such as ‘Open Innovation Program,’ this fourth edition allowed organizers and participants to focus on the forum’s driving philosophy of participative initiatives, with the goal of ensuring a smooth connection between giant groups and star-ups in the digital market. Jazouli concluded that the summit’s objective is “to allow a structured and sustainable cooperation and partnership between the continental or local ecosystem and the established ones… with a particular focus on co-creation, co-innovation, and co-development.”

Rabat – On Thursday, authorities in the city of Fez arrested three suspects for their alleged involvement in kidnapping an eight-year-old boy. Fez’s police managed to arrest the alleged defendants owing to an information provided by the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The suspects involved in the ransom case, freed their 8-year old victim yesterday afternoon after receiving a ransom of MAD 300,000, according to a statement by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). Preliminary investigations show that gang’s mastermind and accomplices were already the subject of a search warrant for different crimes and offenses in several cities across the country. The suspects were placed in police custody while investigations are underway to determine the circumstances of the incident. Search operations are still underway to seize the assets used by the criminals to undermine the safety and security of citizens. In October 2017, Morocco’s police arrested members of a criminal gang suspected of several serious crimes, including kidnapping and demanding ransom. The arrested criminals were reportedly operating in Casablanca, Fez, and Agadir. The Moroccan Ministry of Interior reported that the criminals were kidnapping their mostly wealthy victims and forcing their families to pay ransoms for their release.

Rabat – Morocco has 69.34 percent distribution of mobile networking capability, according to the 2018 OpenSignal report,The State of LTE.” Launched in Morocco in June 2015, three operators make 4G mobile broadband available, positioning the country at the forefront of African telecommunications and 60th in the world in terms of coverage, as 69.34 percent of users have access to the 4G network. At the continental level, Morocco is followed by Côte d’Ivoire at 69.30 percent, South Africa at 68.3 percent, Tunisia 61.38 percent, Egypt at 45 percent, and Algeria at 40.95 percent. Globally, South Korea came in first with 97.49 percent of 4G users, followed by Japan, with an estimated coverage rate of 94.70 percent, and Norway at 92.16. In terms of average connection speed, Morocco maintains  an estimated speed of 15.8 megabits/second (mbps), ranking 4th in Africa and 63rd in the world. The kingdom trails South Africa, Tunisia, and Egypt on the continent, and surpasses speeds in Côte d’Ivoire and Algeria. Worldwide, Singapore leads the ranking, with an average speed estimated at 44.31 mbps, followed by the Netherlands at 42.12 Mbps and Norway at 41.20 Mbps. “That technological diffusion will cross state borders as it has always done,” the report concludes, recalling that just two years ago an average speed of 30 mbps was unheard of except for in a handful of the advanced telecommunications countries. To date, 40 mbps “will likely become an achievable goal” in some regions, the report added. “In the meantime, global operators are keeping plenty busy expanding the reach of their 4G networks. That means when those faster connections finally come, far more people will have access to them far more often.” I’m just playing with the language to avoid redundancy. This is a good sentiment to end on but could you paraphrase it? Unless absolutely necessary, we should try to minimize ending with quotations.

Rabat – The fifth Islamic Conference of Ministers in Charge of Childhood kicked off Thursday in Rabat. Focusing on the theme “Towards a Safe Childhood,” the conference seeks to assess the realities of children living across the Islamic World and how to ameliorate them in future. Describing the importance of the conference in his own words, King Mohammed said, “I firmly believe this important conference is an opportunity to take stock of the real situation of children in the Islamic world, exchange experiences and expertise and ponder the best ways to rise to the growing challenges faced by children.” The monarch outlined the conference aims to reflects “a collective awareness of the numerous, interconnected dangers threatening our children,” and cautioned participants that children’s futures could be “jeopardized if we do not provide them with education, cultural guidance and rehabilitation.” The king Reaffirmed Morocco’s “unwavering commitment” to promoting the rights of children and called on “sister nations” to do the same. Royal Family’s Dedication to Children’s Rights The Moroccan monarch began his speech by tracing the history of the royal family’s involvement in promoting the rights of children. He quoted his father King Hassan II, who said nearly 25 years earlier that a “country’s civilization is gauged by the extent to which it cares for its children.” King Mohammed also highlighted his sister, Princess Lalla Meryem, and her “commendable efforts” to ameliorate the situation of Moroccan children. Since his own accession to the throne, the monarch said that advancing the lives of children has been central to his goals as the nation’s leader. The 2011 Constitution specifies that “the State is expected to provide children with legal protection and to safeguard the social and moral standing of all children, on equal footing, regardless of family status.” Moreover, the constitution also stipulates that the state must provide basic education “to children as a right and shall be a binding obligation for the family and the State.” To enforce these measures, the King committed to creating an advisory council for the family and child, “whose legislative text has been adopted and which I hope to inaugurate soon.”To protect other aspects of children’s lives, King Mohammed also underscored that Morocco adopted an advanced Family Code to strengthen “family cohesion.” “Recognizing that the protection of children and the preservation of their rights cannot be achieved without taking the family setting into account, I have sought to ensure that issues relating to the family and the social environment are also addressed.” He added that this has spurred him to expand the “scope of beneficiaries from the Family Mutual Assistance Fund” to assist “underprivileged mothers who are exposed to neglect and poverty after the dissolution of the marriage bond, and to widows suffering from vulnerability and exclusion.” International Islamic Partnerships  The King described the global scope of the conference: “The interest I take in improving the situation of children at the national level is matched only by my commitment to uphold and comply with the various international agreements and conventions on child rights.” Morocco’s Monarch espoused international cooperation on the part of other Muslim-majority nations, suggesting the creation of “mechanisms” by which Islamic countries can accumulate and share data. “Islamic countries are therefore expected to invest in all sectors concerning child-related issues and challenges, by seeking to combat poverty, tackle the repercussions of climate change, ensure food security, keep abreast of the digital revolution and provide for security and stability.” King Mohammed emphasized the similar challenges faced between countries, the need to promote the “values advocated by our faith,” and, in turn, that Islamic countries should therefore enhance their solidarity and cooperation. He closed by reminding the audience that “today’s children are tomorrow’s citizens” and “Our children will carry the Islamic Ummah’s future if we manage to protect them and give them what they need to achieve fulfillment and be open-minded.” The full text of the speech is available here.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – The Appeal Court in Paris has denied the release of Tariq Ramadan on Thursday, February 22, after a medical report indicated that Islamic theologian’s health was “compatible with his detention.” The renowned Swiss Islamic scholar, grandson of Hassan Al Banna the founder of the Islamic Brotherhood in Egypt, has been in custody at the Fleury-Merogis prison since February 2 for two separate accusations of rape. After he was taken to hospital for treatment of multiple sclerosis on Friday, his lawyers claimed that his health deteriorated since his detainment, and argued that his condition is incompatible with imprisonment in an attempt to attain his release under bail. The lawyers have offered the delivery of his Swiss passport, paying a deposit of 50,000 euros, and the obligation of presenting every day at the police station. The French court ordered a new medical report and found, on Monday, his health to be compatible with his continued detention. The medical expert also said that Ramadan’s pathologies are unlikely to severely deteriorate. Ramadan fully denies the accusation and deemed them to be part of a “campaign of lies launched by adversaries”, which is a sentiment that was shared by his supporters. The scholar’s supporters have been outraged by his confinement, and claim that the entire matter is part of a “conspiracy” against one of the few celebrated figures of Islam in Europe. On the other hand, others claim that the revelation of Ramadan’s health condition last week as an explicit media strategy by his supporters, and argue that the sharing of the medical news coincided with the release of a video of Ramadan’s wife, Iman Ramadan, in which she claimed that her husband has been wronged by the French justice system. French newspaper Liberation claimed that the release of the new information displays “a diabolically efficient sense of timing by Ramadan’s supporters.” The theologian’s accusers, French activist and author Henda Ayari and another woman that was described by the French media as a Muslim convert suffering from a disability, have both declared to the investigators that they have been lured by the “spiritual master” who mentally controlled them, and described appointments that have, allegedly, turned into violent coerced sexual intercourse. If the charges are confirmed, the scholar will face up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person.

Rabat- Morocco has improved just slightly by nine places in the Transparencies Corruption Perceptions Index 2017, compared to 2016, as the Government is making efforts to combat administrative corruption, abuse of power and public funds mismanagement in the country. The index measures perception of corruption in the public sector, using a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is the least. Out of 180 surveyed countries, Morocco ranked 81st with 40 points, compared to its rank at 90th with 37 points in 2016, said the association in a press conference to present the yearly report on corruption in Morocco. In comparison to fellow Arab countries, Morocco ranks 7th, below the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman and Tunisia, said the report. Those nations fared slightly better than Morocco on the index. Among African Union countries, Morocco was ranked 14th, below Botswana, Rwanda, South Africa and Tunisia but ahead of Côte D’Ivoire, Algeria and Egypt. For Transparency Maroc’s Secretary General Ahmed El Bernoussi, the scourge of corruption is still a big problem in the county, noting that since the government’s announcement of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy late 2015, “no measure was made to implement its provisions so far.” “We regret the lack of political will to face corruption,” he said, calling for more accountability for those responsible for it, reported Maghreb Arab Press. Some of the most affected sectors by corruption include justice, real estate, police, administration and health, he said. Today, during the weekly meeting of the State Council, Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, said that his government is giving great importance to fighting corruption. He revealed that a dozen officials are currently being prosecuted for corruption charges and that the Government is currently reviewing a number of laws and decrees to increase transparency at all levels. The government has launched a National Complaints Portal which gives citizens the right to file complaints directly and to follow up on the investigation of particular cases being undertaken by relevant judicial administrations. This year, New Zealand and Denmark rank the highest with scores of 89 and 88 respectively. Syria, South Sudan and Somalia rank lowest with scores of 14, 12 and 9 respectively.

Rabat – The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) considers Morocco as a “very important country” and a “strategic gateway” to Africa, its president Suma Chakrabarti told several national newspapers. Morocco “is a very important country for us, not only as a country of intervention, but also as a gateway to a larger region,” Chakrabarti told the newspaper “Le Matin”, noting that EBRD is trying to do its best in Morocco and intends to do even more by trying to be more present in this country. Chakrabarti told “Aujourd’hui Le Maroc” that Africa could potentially be the next extension of EBRD with Morocco’s leadership, recalling that in the Bank’s history there have been four geographical extensions first towards Mongolia, Turkey, the MENA region and recently in Greece and Cyprus. “The Kingdom really has a leadership position,” he said, noting that several EBRD member countries, including Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan want this financial institution to be more active in Africa, especially in the sub-Saharan region. Regarding the Bank’s action in Morocco, he said that the EBRD has had a variety of large-scale projects aimed primarily at reinforcing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are major job providers. One of the key challenges for SMEs in Morocco, as in a number of countries, is access to bank liquidity, Chakrabarti said, underlining that the EBRD is working to reduce costs and plans to open within the next six months new credit lines for Moroccan SMEs.

Rabat – US TV channel PBS highlighted efforts made by Morocco in the solar energy field, underlining that Morocco is taking advantage of an abundant natural resource, unobstructed sunlight, to power part of the North African nation. “Morocco does have sunlight, about 3,000 hours of sun every year and harnessing that light is an evolutionary leap for the country,” said the TV channel in a news coverage on Tuesday entitled “Morocco turns the Sahara desert into a solar energy oasis.” The TV channel underscored that “King Mohammed VI is making a huge bet on clean energy and the goal is that renewables will power half of this country by 2040. Within this strategy, Noor, the 9-bn dollar solar plant, is the flagship project.” “Glimmering in the Sahara Desert, a first-of-its-kind solar energy plant is so vast, it can be seen from space. From the air, it’s an ocean of reflective mirrors, but on the ground, as we drive into Noor, sunglasses are mandatory protection from the blinding rays,” commented the channel’s special envoy. “Noor uses CSP, or concentrated solar power. Concave mirrors direct the sun to a middle tube to heat an oil solution. The mirrors rotate as the sun moves, like sunflowers. The heated fluid, which reaches 750 degrees Fahrenheit, produces steam to power a turbine,” it explained. The TV channel added that the next phase “Noor 3,” still under construction, will be the highest building in Africa, with 246 meters. It will incorporate a newer technology, where 7,000 flat mirrors bounce the sun’s rays to the tip of the tower. The solar energy is stored in molten salts, which means the plant can keep making electricity for seven hours after sunset, PBS said. “When it’s finished later this year, Noor will provide electricity to over two million people. It has generated high expectations for Morocco and the future of solar power,” it concluded.

Rabat – As Morocco plans to expand diplomatic activities in Asian countries, some view the move as a frustrated reaction to Morocco’s still-pending ECOWAS bid and hostile AU attitudes due to to Morocco’s Western Sahara stance. Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Alyaoum raised the possibility of these connected responses on Wednesday, reporting that Morocco has recently increased its presence in Asian countries, in conjunction with several bilateral discussions with Asian delegations in Rabat, at the invitation of Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Citing two Moroccan foreign affairs analysts, the newspaper added that Morocco’s action “came at a time when Morocco faces serious challenges due to Morocco’s pending ECOWAS membership bid and signs of hostility directed at Morocco’s Western Sahara stance within the African Union.” According to Akhbar Al Yaoum, Morocco is at a political “impasse” with other African nations. However, Moroccan political analyst and expert in geostrategy El Moussaoui El Ajlaoui believes that cooperation with other continents is required. El Moussawi told Morocco World News that “Akhbar Al Yaoum’s use of the word ‘impasse’ is inappropriate. What is really going on currently is that Morocco has solidified its position within the AU and has been playing a central role both within the organization itself and across the continent, especially following reduced participation of the African nations in the south.” El Moussawi added that there is a shift in the balance of power on the continent. In “African French-speaking countries, Morocco maintains its political clout. Morocco’s bid to access ECOWAS is aimed at confirming Morocco’s presence in the African Union and to reaffirm its presence at all levels.” According to the Moroccan expert, there are no diplomatic failures. The fault lies in the absence of communication mechanisms between the government institutions and the public. “There are several errors made by national news outlets and newspapers in terms of transferring information to the public opinion and how they perceive Morocco’s moves.” To strengthen his arguments, El Moussawi, said that the country doesn’t have a foreign affairs spokesman to explain to the public opinion what is going on regarding Morocco’s application to ECOWAS and its diplomatic activities. “Except the statements of the foreign minister, there is nothing else, and here lies the serious problem,” said El Moussaoui. For El Moussaoui, Morocco’s membership in ECOWAS is not as important as its membership in the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD), which is a major regional economic community in the continent. Morocco’s bid to ECOWAS is aimed at reinforcing and reaffirming the country’s political diplomacy in the continent. “Of course, Morocco’s application cannot be accepted immediately, there is an admission process. This action takes time. We cannot expect to be in very easily,”  El Moussaoui added. The Moroccan expert emphasized that though there are some challenges, “[they are] totally normal. Everyone is looking for its interests after all. However, we cannot decode the delay as a failure.” MWN asked El Moussaoui for his opinion regarding a statement made by Ambassador Oladapo Fafowora, the national president of the Association of Retired Career Ambassadors of Nigeria (ARCAN), who said during a lecture that “there is a strong opposition in the country (Nigeria) to Morocco’s application, as it lacks merit.” El Moussaoui said that “This is very normal. We should accept this issue. Senegal, which is a country close to Morocco has been also opposing Morocco’s application. But this is quite normal as every country is defending its interests.” The Moroccan analyst added that we should accept differences as every country is ready to fight for its own interests. In efforts to expand its global influence, Morocco has been looking for more diplomatic ties with other European, Latin American, and Asian countries. While Akhbar Al Yaoum sees Morocco’s strategy as a way to overcome some struggles in the African continent, El Moussaoui said that this action is serving other required interests: the strengthening of Moroccan foreign policy internationally. “The country is attempting to combine and build ties with other alliances, which are very important for the country’s diplomacy.” To this point, Akhbar Al Yaoum agrees, reporting that Morocco is seeking to make this year a special stage upon which to build new relations with the other continents of the world, including Asia.

Rabat – Speaking at a press conference in Moscow on Monday, Algeria’s Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel said that the Western Sahara conflict would be resolved only through an internal dialogue involving “the children of the same country.” When asked by an APS journalist about the world’s crisis and conflicts, Messahel said “We have a course of action. It is the resolution of the United Nations, whether it is for the question of Western Sahara or for the situation in Syria or Libya.” According to Messahel, such conflicts need an “internal” dialogue between “the children of the same country,” referring to the Sahrawis in Tindouf Camps as Moroccans. “There are steps that are proposed at the international level, but we also openly believe in an internal dialogue,” he said, pointing out that “there is no solution outside an internal dialogue between the children of the same country.” Commenting on Messahel’s remarks over the Western Sahara conflict, Moroccan political analyst and university professor Reda El Fellah said that, “This statement is really unexpected and sounds radically at odds with the Algerian Minister’s previous remarks.” According to El Fellah, the Algerian minister of foreign affairs has finally come up “with some meaningful thoughts regarding the Sahara conflict. In his statement, he refers to the framework of international legality as it is set up by the UN resolutions.” He added that Messahel’s remarks are an acknowledgment of Morocco’s sovereignty over the territory. “Messahel recognizes Moroccan political unity and its territorial integrity, said El Fellah, adding that the Algerian minister’s statement “withdraws the statehood juridical and political status from Polisario. According to him, Polisario leaders and Tindouf Inhabitants are Moroccan nationals just like any Moroccan.” To reinforce his argument, the Moroccan observer said that “arguably, the UN normative framework of self determination limits this right to two cases: the first one to people under colonization geographically, ethnically, and culturally distinct from the colonial power (resolutions 1514 and 1541 in 1960), and the second to peoples subjected to racial discrimination, domination, and exploitation (Resolution 2625 in 1970).” El Fellah added that the right for self-determination under normative UN framework “is already given to Sahraoui population” following Morocco’s Green March in 1975. “To be sure, UN texts don’t give any right to secession. In fact, territorial integrity couldn’t be violated if the concerned country is conducting itself in compliance with the principle of equal rights and internal self-determination of its own people.” Based on Messahel’s statement, El Fellah infers that Algeria is in charge of allowing “the inhabitants of the Tindouf camps to return back to their homeland. It confirms also that Sahara issue is an internal affair linked to secession or separatist goals. As a consequence, neither any country nor any international organization can interfere with the Sahara conflict. The first country which should abide by this honest reconsideration is Algeria.” In an unprecedented action, a group of Algerian press outlets, including APS, reported a fake news about Russia’s support for “direct negotiations over Western Sahara and Morocco.” According to APS, Russia’s Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov made the following statement in a press conference attended by Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel: “Russia supports the holding of direct negotiations between the two parties to the Western Sahara conflict, namely the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front,” However, this is statement is not accurate. After lauding the visa waiver agreement for diplomats between Algeria and Russian, Sergei called on the parties to the conflict to “respect the agreements signed” between them, referring to the 1991 cease-fire agreement, which has been recently violated by the separatist group. The Russian minister also lauded the efforts of the United Nations on the Sahara question. Below is the link to the full press conference:

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a message to participants in the Fifth Islamic Conference of Ministers in charge of Childhood, which kicked off, Wednesday in Rabat, under the theme “Towards a safe childhood.” Here follows the full text of the message read out by minister of State in charge of Human Rights, Mustapha Ramid. “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Your Excellency, the Director General of the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Honorable Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to welcome the participants in the Fifth Islamic Conference of Ministers in charge of Childhood Issues, which is being hosted in your second home, Morocco, by the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. First of all, I should like to tell this dynamic Organization and all Member States how much I appreciate the commendable efforts made in the area of child protection. I commend you on choosing Towards a Safe Childhood as the theme for your conference, given the critical importance of child-related issues today. This is a theme which shows a shared commitment to ensuring the safety of children and upholding their universally recognized rights. This conference, which is being held under my patronage, reflects a collective awareness of the numerous, interconnected dangers threatening our children. These are perils which can undermine their potential and put their future in jeopardy if we do not provide them with education, cultural guidance and rehabilitation. Such efforts should contribute to children’s integration into the knowledge and communication-based world, making them open to human civilization and to the changes we are witnessing today. I firmly believe this important conference is an opportunity to take stock of the real situation of children in the Islamic world, exchange experiences and expertise and ponder the best ways to rise to the growing challenges faced by children. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, By hosting this Conference, the Kingdom of Morocco is reaffirming its unwavering commitment to joint Islamic action, particularly when the crucial issue at stake is that of shaping our common future. Accordingly, Morocco is willing to share with all sister nations the experience it has gained in the field of child protection, security and care – an experience which will be presented to you during this gathering. Close to a quarter of a century ago, in 1994, my revered father, His late Majesty King Hassan II – may he rest in peace -pointed out,in his address to the First National Conference on the Rights of the Child, that the future hinges on children, and that the latter embody humanity’s hope for a better tomorrow. He went on to say that a country’s civilization is gauged by the extent to which it cares for its children. Barely a year after that statement, the National Observatory for Children’s Rights, which is chaired by my sister, Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem, emanated from the Conference. Since then, Her Royal Highness has been making commendable efforts to improve the situation and the social conditions of Moroccan children and to promote their rights. In 1999, the Children’s Parliament was created. It has become a school for the fostering of democratic and civic values through the active participation and involvement of children in political life at all levels. Since my accession to the throne, I have sought to strengthen this process by setting up specialized institutions and by passing legislation to promote child protection. As we built on those achievements, we sought to give a strong impetus to the protection of children and the advancement of child issues. Thus, the 2011 Constitution stipulates that the State is expected to provide children with legal protection andto safeguard the social and moral standing of all children, on equal footing, regardless of family status. It also stipulates that basic education shall be provided to children as a right and shall be a binding obligation for the family and the State. The Constitution also provides for the establishment of an advisory council for the family and child, whose legislative text has been adopted and which I hope to inaugurate soon. Consistent with my keen desire to improve the situation of vulnerable groups, I launched the National Initiative for Human Development. One of the Initiative’s core objectives is the improvement of the situation of children, especially among marginalized and under-privileged segments of the population, and to save them from illiteracy, poverty and exclusion. At the same time, I am keen to evaluate and ensure follow up to the National Plan of Action for Children adopted by the interested parties during the Twelfth National Conference on the Rights of the Child. I have also sought to strengthen family cohesion through the adoption of an advanced Family Code that takes into account the best interests of the child and protects his or her rights in all circumstances. The implementation of that Code should be closely monitored and evaluated to address the shortcomings revealed by past experience. To further promote the policy aimed at ensuring child security and protection, a number of related laws have been passed, including the review of the law on granting Moroccan nationality to a child born to a Moroccan mother and a non-Moroccan father, the law forbidding child labor and the legislation on the establishment and management of social welfare institutions. These constructive measures and initiatives have culminated in the establishment of a comprehensive, integrated system that enhances prevention and protection for the benefit of children and the family. This system constitutes our national response to the various issues relating to child protection. Recognizing that the protection of children and the preservation of their rights cannot be achieved without taking the family setting into account, I have sought to ensure that issues relating to the family and the social environment are also addressed. To that end, I ordered that the scope of beneficiaries from the Family Mutual Assistance Fund be expanded to underprivileged mothers who are exposed to neglect and poverty after the dissolution of the marriage bond, and to widows suffering from vulnerability and exclusion. Moreover, the Social Cohesion Fund has started providing services and a number of support groups have been set up to give assistance to women and children in courts and public hospitals and to offer psychological support for children, etc. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, The interest I take in improving the situation of children at the national level is matched only by my commitment to uphold and comply with the various international agreements and conventions on child rights. Morocco was one of the first nations to join the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. That was in 1993. It subsequently ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. My action has not stopped at protecting Moroccan children. I have also sought to make sure migrants are included. To that end, we have adopted a national migration and asylum strategy based on humanitarian considerations. Under that strategy, in the regularization process, priority is given to vulnerable groups, children and family reunification. As regards international protection for child rights, we must draw attention to the tragic situation of children throughout the world, particularly in some Arab, African and Asian countries, not to mention regions affected by wars and ethnic strife, in which children are exposed to displacement and criminal exploitation. Because of these tragic situations, which are a challenge to the conscience of the world, I call on the international community, and the influential powers in particular, to shoulder their historic responsibility towards children. They represent the future of mankind, and it is they who are suffering from violence, exploitation and neglect. I also call on them to take whatever measures are needed – before it is too late – in order to save children from the scourge of war, conflict, epidemics, famine and extremist and terrorist groups, as well as from the tragedies relating to illegal migration. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Not only do our countries share the same principles and values advocated by our faith, which urges us to care for children and safeguard their rights, but they also face similar challenges. Islamic countries should therefore enhance their solidarity and cooperation, pool efforts, share the experience gained in the area of child protection and seek to craft constructive, innovative partnerships that take into account the distinctive features of our countries. Efforts should also be made to involve the actors concerned, including civil society groups. The various forms of violence, exploitation and neglect to which children are exposed – particularly new forms of violence and the employment of minors – require the establishment of a system for reporting violations that involves all the parties concerned, including the family, school and society. Given the physical and moral violence and abuse suffered by children, sometimes at the hands of trusted relatives who deal with them on a daily basis, we need to come up with mechanisms to document this type of abuse and define indicators and data for the development of prevention programs. As you know, guaranteeing the rights of children hinges, first and foremost, on enabling them to enjoy their basic rights to health, education, housing and social protection. These are the same rights mentioned in the Sustainable Developments Goals, which also include an explicit call to combat violence against children. Islamic countries are therefore expected to invest in all sectors concerning child-related issues and challenges, by seeking to combat poverty, tackle the repercussions of climate change, ensure food security, keep abreast of the digital revolution and provide for security and stability. I am confident that the soon-to-be-established advisory council for the advancement of child-related issues in the Islamic world will serve as a powerhouse for suggestions aimed at tackling common challenges in connection with children. Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, You realize, of course, that today’s children are tomorrow’s citizens. Our children will carry the Islamic Ummah’s future if we manage to protect them and give them what they need to achieve fulfilment and beopen-minded. I am sure you are also aware of the magnitude of the challenges facing our children. I am sure that this important conference, which has brought together experienced, competent participants who are guided by a sincere desire to safeguard the Islamic Ummah’s rights and future, will address the various aspects relating to children. I look forward to the adoption of practical, objective and applicable recommendations, together with implementation mechanisms and modes of financing, for the benefit of our Ummah and the future of its peoples. I pray that Almighty God assist you and grant you every success. Thank you. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – Royal Armed Forces (FAR) and the Ministry of Agriculture are investigating the crew of a Turkish ship, after it was detected a few days ago near the coast of Dakhla by the National Control Center via satellites. Daily Al Massae reported in its February 22 edition that the Turkish ship was fishing illegally and without authorization in Moroccan waters. The ship had crossed a long distance in various areas before reaching the coast near Dakhla. Satellite controllers detected the unknown ship in Moroccan waters, a few days ago and alerted the FAR. The latter intervened quickly to intercept the ship, named “Kik Omar.” The elements of the FAR intorrigated the ship’s crew to know the circumstances of the ship’s activity in Morocco without authorization. Moroccan authorities seized the ship’s documents, pending the end of the preliminary investigations with the crew.

Rabat – As the momentum of football’s most celebrated mass draws near, FIFA has unveiled a decision that may- soothe the heavy criticism that the organization came under in recent months. According to a recent ESPN report, FIFA has lifted a ban on voters’ public endorsement of the 2026 World Cup bid. FIFA issued last month what it called “Integrity Warnings,” in which it urged federations to refrain from publicly commenting on the 2026 bidding procedures, including refraining from publicly declaring which bid they support. The restrictive move did not sit well with many football officials with Ahmad Ahmad, Confederation of African Football president, expressing his frustration at being denied the right to support “his continent’s bid.”    Amidst relevant officials’ growing frustration at FIFA’s not-so-impartial code of conduct it sent federations last month, its secretary general Fatma Samoura sent this week a new letter in which she explained to all federations FIFA’s new code of conduct regarding the 2026 bidding procedures. “All public statements by football officials in support if one bidder are admissible provided that they meet the underlying principles of ethical behavior,” Samoura wrote in the letter. “They shall be limited to genuine support for the preferred bidder and contain no statements against the competitive bidder or requests for bloc voting,” She added. “Officials shall consider whether, from a common sense perspective, the nature and form of a statement can be considered as ‘fair’ and ‘not unduly influencing the bidding process,’” the letter specified. Acknowledging that the previous guidelines were “questioned by members of the football community,” Samoura called upon federations to nonetheless uphold “principles of fairness and transparency,” especially by restraining from forming regional blocs.   A move that pundits, while saluting the lift on the previous ban, may see as tacitly addressing itself to the African bloc around Morocco 2026. “Please also accept the offer of a presentation by the competitive bidder, offering both bidders the same format and attendance,” Samoura said. With recent reforms within FIFA, the 2026 World Cup will be the first campaign to convene 48 teams, up from 32. It will also be the first whose bidding process will be marked by the participation of all national football federations, as opposed to the customary restricted circle of FIFA executive committee. The 211 football nations, which form “the FIFA Congress”, are due to vote on June 13 the 2026 World Cup host out of the two contending bids featuring the North American bloc (USA, Canada, Mexico) and Morocco.

By Rabbi Allen S. Maller Rabat – Jewish and Muslim religious groups have condemned a bill in Iceland’s parliament that would ban circumcision for non-medical (i.e. religious) reasons. Even a Bishop in Reykjavik, warned that if it passed Jewish and Muslim people would feel “unwelcome” in Iceland. The draft law would impose a very harsh six-year prison term on anyone guilty of “removing part or all of the child’s sexual organs”, arguing the practice violates the child’s rights. If the anti-circumcision bill passes Iceland would be the first European country to ban the procedure since it was first banned in the Soviet Union. MP Silja Dögg Gunnarsdóttir of the Progressive Party, who introduced the bill in early February, said: “We are talking about children’s rights, not about freedom of belief. Everyone has the right to believe in what they want, but the rights of children come above the right to believe.”  The Icelandic bill says circumcision “involves permanent interventions in a child’s body that can cause severe pain”. Iceland passed a law in 2005 banning female genital mutilation, and supporters of this move have compared it to that law. However, FGM is not circumcision: it is female genital mutilation, and comparing it to circumcision is a slander of both Islam and Judaism. It is important that Muslims and Jews make this distinction clear to the general public. Christianity, Islam and Judaism all teach that circumcision was practiced by Prophet Abraham, who is revered by Christians, Jews and Muslims to this day. However, Christians do not believe circumcision is still a required observance.  But, even during Medieval times, Christian governments never prohibited ritual circumcision for Jews and Muslims living under their rule. Equally, Jews and Muslims never tried to force Christians to circumcise their children.  Only pagan governments like the Greeks and the Romans, or anti-religious secular governments like Communist Russia, have forbidden ritual circumcision of males. These governments are led by people who believe that their own humanistic, rational philosophy is on a much higher level than what has been taught by traditional religions, which they do not believe in. Many European secularists regard circumcision of minors by Muslims and Jews, as a cruel violation of children’s rights. A similar debate is occurring across northern Europe about the issue of ritual slaughter of animals, which devout Jews and Muslims require be performed on conscious animals. This is part of a larger dilemma facing left-wing parties in Europe, which often struggle to balance their stated commitment to minority rights, with a pushy, self-righteous, secularist agenda that is perceived as intolerant by most members of religious groups. It is totally false to compare the custom of female genital mutilation to the religious practice of male circumcision.  First, while there are great medical benefits from removal of the foreskin of a male, especially in reducing the spread of HIV; there is no medical benefit to a female from the removal of her clitoris and labia. In Africa, Jewish and Muslim men have much lower rates of AIDS than uncircumcised Christian men.  Second, there is no evidence that female genital mutilation promotes chastity and preserves a woman’s virtue. Having a considerate, loving and faithful husband does much more to promote a woman’s virtue than female genital mutilation. Third, male circumcision is a religious requirement; female genital mutilation is only a tribal custom, originating in sub Sahara Africa; which is now being spread by Muslim religious extremists to Asia and the West as part of a reaction against the rising rate of girls going to high school and woman going to work outside the home.  Evidence that female genital mutilation is a only a custom comes from the fact that in rural Egypt even Coptic Christians mutilate their daughters genitals. Also female genital mutilation had been denounced by most of the major Islamic scholars in the Muslim world. Finally, and most important of all, male circumcision is derived from the God inspired practice of Prophet Abraham and Prophet Muhammad. God said to Abraham (Genesis 17:7): “I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you… (8-12) “And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual holding; and I will be their God. And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations. This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.  “You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. Throughout your generations every male among you shall be circumcised when he is eight days old,” (Genesis 17: 7-12a) And Allah ordered Prophet Muhammad to follow the religion of Abraham/Ibrahim. When Allah said (Qur’an 16:123)  “Then We inspired you: ‘Follow the religion of Ibrahim, the upright in Faith’.” And part of the religion of Ibrahim is, as is evident from the verses cited above, to practice circumcision. Abraham was an old man when he circumcised himself, thus becoming a good example that one is never to old to do God’s will. As a Hadith says: Prophet Muhammad said: “Prophet Ibrahim circumcised himself when he was eighty years old and he circumcised himself with an axe.” (Related by Bukhari, Muslim &amp; Ahmad.)  Abraham’s first born son Ishmael, was a young boy when he was circumcised, so Muslims do not have to circumcise their son’s on an exact date. A Hadith states: When Ibn Abbas was asked “How old were you when the Prophet Muhammad died?” He replied, “At that time I had been circumcised. At that time people did not circumcise boys till they attained the age of puberty (Baligh).” (Bukhari)  Prophet Muhammad himself selected the 7th day after birth to circumcise his own grandsons: Abdullah Ibn Jabir and Aisha both said: “The Prophet performed the Aqiqah of al-Hasan and al-Hussein (the prophets grandsons) circumcising them on the 7th. Day.” (Related in al-Bayhaq &amp; Tabarani)  Thus, for Jews circumcision is a sign of the covenant that God made with Abraham and his sons Ishmael and Isaac and their descendants for all future generations.  For Muslims it is a sign of their close connection to Abraham which is also celebrated each year during the annual Hajj ceremonies.  For both Muslims and Jews circumcision is a sign that one who submits to God’s commandments and covenant cannot expect a life without some pain and suffering. But when endured for the right reasons pain and suffering always lead eventually to great spiritual benefits.  Rabbi Maller’s web site is: www.rabbimaller.com Rabbi Maller’s book ‘Judaism and Islam as Synergistic Monotheisms: One Rabbi’s Reflections on the Profound Connectedness between Islam and Judaism’ (31 articles by Rabbi Maller first published by Islamic web sites) is for sale ($15) on Amazon and Morebooks.

French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed a new legislation tightening immigration law. He says the changes will speed up the asylum process. But it will make it easier to deport economic migrants, and jail those living in France illegally. As Simon McGregor-Wood reports, the laws have provoked fierce criticism from some human rights groups and politicians within his own party.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – A total of 71 passengers, including 13 women, were rescued from two different inflatable rafts by the Royal Navy of Morocco, operating off the coast of Tangier on Tuesday, February 20. The majority of the men and women aboard were originally from sub-Saharan countries. A source from the military said that the dinghies were drifting in distress due to choppy waves and bad weather. The 71 rescued are the latest in a growing number of men and women making the precarious sea voyage in hopes of crossing the Mediterranean for Europe.  Elsewhere on the Mediterranean on Tuesday, near Spain’s Alborán island, the Spanish search-and-rescue operation Salvamento Marítimo conducted separate rescued a total of 60 people aboard two rafts carrying 33 and 37 passengers respectively.  These are far from isolated incidents. Already since the start of 2018, Morocco-based National Observatory of Human Rights (ONDH) reported in January that over 1000 migrants tried to enter Spain during January 2018.

Speaking on Radio Granada, CEAR spokesman José Carlos Cabrera predicted an “avalanche of dinghies” as men and women attempted to reach Europe via the Andalusian coast in the weeks ahead.  CEAR estimated that half a million people, from Libya westward to Morocco, are on the move and that many of them are preparing to cross into Europe. Cabrera also shared that Spain is not prepared to adequately receive migrants in the medium or long term. Salvamento Marítimo announced in January that their collective operations had rescued 18,937 migrants crossing the Mediterranean in 2017, marking a 182 percent increase since 2016.

Rabat – In their determination to face migratory challenges, which they believe constitute a major global concern, UN member states, excluding the US, have expressed their commitment to signing a non-binding UN World Pact on Migrations. The agreement, still to undergo six rounds of negotiations that will last until July, is expected to be finalized during a summit in Morocco between December 10-11, reports Medias24. The project, according to first draft, calls for “a global agreement on safe, ordered, and legitimate migrations”, with a particular stress on “strengthening cooperation on all dimensions of international migrations.” Like the Paris climate change agreement, the international migrations pact is said to be a reminder to all UN member states that “no country can face global challenges on its own.” “Migration crisis should unite us,” the text says. The US has however declined to take part in the elaboration and finalization of the Project, with many observers associating America’s move to the Trump Administration’s tough and hostile stance on international migrations. Diplomats charged with bringing the plan to fruition have said that the whole idea is to underline “shared responsibilities” when it comes to facing the migratory challenges. Among the 22 proposals to be discussed during the six-round negotiations, special importance is believed to have been given to issues such as protecting women and children migrants, adopting policies that facilitate migrants’ integration in host societies, ensuring access to social services for immigrants, eradicating discrimination in all its forms, etc. With predictions that climate change will bring about new forms of migrations, states supporting the project, while recognizing that negotiations will be “tough” because “immigration is a very sensitive topic for a number of countries”, have saluted the project and called it a long overdue step towards more integration and cooperation in facing serious global challenges.

Rabat – The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has unveiled a new report about the troubling issue of newborn deaths around the world on February 20.  2.6 million babies die before turning one month old, with 2 millions of them dying on the day of their birth. And another 2.6 are stillborn. How did Moroccan babies fare? The report started by highlighting the hardships that millions of mothers, babies, and health worker from a round the world go through.  “Imagine for a moment that you are about to give birth. You are at home, accompanied only by a few members of your family. You are in pain, but you have no access to a doctor, nurse or midwife. You know there is a real risk that both you and the baby you have been waiting to meet may not survive the birth. Even if you and the baby survive, you know that the coming days and weeks will be filled with danger,” read the report Newborn’s death prevention is complicated given the fact that no single drug and intervention can be provided and requires a “system-wide approach”; however, the report maintains that the majority of these deaths could be prevented with a global commitment to newborn survival. “We are failing the youngest, most vulnerable people on the planet – and with so many millions of lives at stake, time is of the essence,” said UNICEF Additionally, Millions of lives could be saved through basic services such as affordable healthcare, good nutrition, and clean water. All of which are out of reach for many. Morocco ranked fourth in the Maghreb region with a neonatal mortality rate of 17.8 per 1,000 live births. This is especially shocking given the fact that Libya ranked first with mortality rate 7.1 per 1.000 live babies, regardless of the country’s current circumstances. Morocco came one step above Mauritania where the rate is 33.7. Although newborn survival is closely linked to the country’s income level since high-income countries have an average newborn mortality rate 3.3 compared to a rate of 27 in low-income countries, it is by no means the only factor. For instance, Kuwait and the United States of America, both high-income countries, have newborn mortality rate of 4, which is slightly better than lower-middle-income countries such as Sri Lanka and Ukraine, where the newborn mortality rate is 5. Given the high numbers and the frequency in which newborn’s death happen, UNICEF refuses to see it as a mere statistic and insist that each and every one of these deaths is a tragedy that can and must be changed, and aims to save 16 million newborn lives by 2030.

Rabat – On Wednesday, Princess Lalla Meryem chaired the closing ceremony of the meeting organized by the national union of Morocco’s women and the national observatory for children’s rights at the Mohammed V National Theatre in Rabat. The event  was held under the theme “Women and children in precarious situations.” During the closing ceremony, the National Coordinator of the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), governor Nadira El Guermai, gave a presentation in which she explained that precariousness, ranked according to gender, age and living conditions, could be defined as a situation of social exclusion and marginalization caused by deprivation of economic and social rights. El Guermai added that, in order to combat precariousness, Morocco has launched several programs to support affected social segments, promote their lifestyle, facilitate their integration and protect them against delinquency.  The governor reviewed the INDH experience  and achievements since its establishment 2005 and which includes a specific anti-precariousness program that benefited a large population, noting that despite all these efforts, there is still a growing need due to social mutations. She also called for pooling efforts to reach an optimal coordination as part of convergence and good governance. Head of high planning commission Ahmed Lahlimi Alami outlined, in a presentation on the state of precariousness, the progress made by Morocco in this anti-precariousness fight field, adding that the Kingdom succeeded in reducing the scope of the phenomenon of poverty and precariousness in the rural and urban zones. After screening an advert on “child brides,” Amina Oufroukhi, a magistrate and official at the public prosecutor’s office, said that this phenomenon deprives young girls from their right to have a decent life, insisting on the pressing need to change the mindset and raise awareness about the fact that the school is the natural place for young girls to evolve. Mohamed Hourani, member of the economic, social and environmental council, presented a roadmap on the fight against precariousness based on four outlines namely knowledge, governance, law policy and policy elaboration, stressing that this roadmap seeks to lay the bases for new alternatives to reinforce the prevention against precariousness mainly regarding digitization, green economy, circular economy and renewable energy. At the end of this ceremony, the Princess posed for a souvenir photo with children representing several associations.  Princess Lalla Meryem has been involved in the fight for the promotion of the conditions of women and children for the past 30 years through the chairmanship of the national union of Morocco’s women and the national observatory for children’s rights. The Princess is leading, through these two institutions, several initiatives aimed at rendering justice to women and children and helping them enjoy full citizenship. Upon her arrival at the Mohammed V National Theatre, Princess Lalla Meryem reviewed a detachment of the auxiliary forces that paid the honours and was greeted mainly by justice minister Mohamed Aujjar, national education minister Saïd Amzazi, state secretary for handicraft and social economy Jamila El Moussali, head of the high planning commission Ahmed Lahlimi Alami, and Chief of public prosecutor’s office Mohamed Abdennabaoui.

Rabat – Experts at CIES Football Observatory has ranked Moroccan international footballer Achraf Hakimi among Europe’s “50 most promising under-20 footballers.” Hakimi is positioned as the 48th in the 50-young footballers’ list. A.C Milan’s goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is leading the list, followed by French  Alban Lafont. The third place was taken by French Kylian Mbappé of  Paris Saint-Germain. The footballer has delivered a great performance with the Atlas Lions during the 2018 World Cup Qualifiers and has big chances to be among the players who will represent Morocco in the World Cup next summer. The footballer made his official debut at the Santiago Bernabeu on October 1, when Real Madrid’s key defender Dani Carvajal couldn’t play due to injury. The footballer netted his first goal for his Spanish team on December 10 against Sevilla, becoming the first Moroccan ever to score for Real Madrid. It is unsure whether Hakimi will make Herve Renard’s list for the 2018 World Cup scheduled for next summer. Al Massae reported on February 19 that t Renard’s list will see some big changes. Some high-profile players will miss the cut for World Cup play as their performances with their local or international teams have not been convincing. This may be the case for Real Madrid’s young star, Achraf Hakimi, who missed several games for his Spanish squad lately.

Rabat – Brain drain is a traditional reality in the global South. Every year, in search of better working conditions, thousands of well-trained professionals choose to move to Western countries.  According to Moroccan outlet Medias24, a new bill that guarantees an easier professional integration for foreign medical doctors in France, and has already attracted a wave of Egyptian and Tunisian doctors, might have a similar effect on Moroccan physicians who, with “under-equipped” and “underpaid” personnel are reportedly facing harsh working conditions. Faced with physicians’ growing temptation to emigrate, and in a move to contain it, Moroccan medical authorities have announced that the French bill will not affect Morocco to a great extent, emphasizing patriotism. Only 20 medicine graduate or established physicians choose to work in a country other than Morocco, according to the National Council of Moroccan physicians. Media 24 has however raised doubts about the fact that Moroccan doctors, unlike their counterparts in Egypt and Tunisia, won’t be tempted by the promising prospects that the French bill allows. “But these reassuring numbers clash with our investigation,” said Media 24 referring to the National Council’s official statistic. According to the report, underpayment and difficult working conditions are the factors making more and more Moroccan doctors consider emigration. “After ten years of study, we are sent to faraway regions for miserable salaries and deplorable working conditions. For those who do not have the means to open a private office or find a job in the private sector, going to France or Germany remains the only way to ensure a guaranteed future,” one of the interviewed doctors reportedly said, complaining that their profession is not duly respected in Morocco. After telling Medias24 that “family reasons” constitute the only thing still keeping him in Morocco, another doctor reportedly said that he knows a number of colleagues who have taken the plunge, specifying that “Had I not got recently married and got a child, I would not have hesitated a moment, because in Moulay Youssef Hospital, where I work, we are short of everything.” The now-famous bill, which was passed in November 2017, allows non-French medical practitioners (be they graduates of French or foreign universities) to be fully integrated in the French Medical establishment and have equal treatments and rights as their French counterparts. “According to our source, this [the bill] will allow an explosion of Moroccan exodus, especially of young or newly graduates who do not have significant professional attachments in their home country,” reports Medias24, stressing that Germany, which has similar legal dispositions for medical doctors, especially as the state even funds language courses for foreign medics, will surely be another attractive destination for Moroccans. “Morocco runs the risk of becoming a medical desert if this trend continues,” Medias24 complains. Moroccans are reportedly known for their patriotism, their unconditional love for Morocco. And while the tempting prospects of emigrating to Europe is a serious challenge, Houcine Maouni, who presides over the national council of Moroccan physicians, is allegedly confident that “Moroccan doctors will not let themselves be seduced”, and that French and German dreams will “fail in the face of Moroccan patriotism.” Mr. Maouni reportedly complained that “Moroccans exercising elsewhere” are depriving Moroccan hospitals of a much-needed asset, with Morocco already “experiencing a dearth of medical personnel with 7.3 doctors/10,000 inhabitants, below WHO’s set norms (1 doctor/650).” He, however, stressed that the situation does not despair him as his Moroccan colleagues “have a deep-seated sense of patriotism.” “Moreover, as Morocco is becoming a medical hub, they will be less tempted to go. The problem here is different from what it is in Tunisia. 45% of Tunisians choose to emigrate because Tunisia provides them with no prospects. For us, there is room for everyone, even if working conditions are generally not optimal,” Maouni said.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – When Omar Elamri met with Apple’s midwest representatives to present his new application, Digitr, the company officials said they had never seen an app “this extensive” from someone so young, and they congratulated the 13-year-old Moroccan-American for his “inspiring” work. Digitr, available for free on the iTunes Store, came about as a paperless way to monitor students in school hallways. Traditionally, teachers would issue paper permission slips for students to leave a classroom unattended. Now, Digitr allows teachers and students to keep track of this electronically via school-issued iPads. Michelle Brunik, a computer science teacher at Minnetonka Middle School East where Elamri studies, said the app lets teachers “effortlessly keep track of students leaving the room” and credited it with “helping students develop time management skills.” “It’s been helpful in taming the traffic of students coming in and out of the classroom, and it allows for better classroom management. It also records data to help administrators, teachers, and parents understand when students are leaving class and why,” Brunik explains in a video on the Digitr website. Elamri was born in New York City but grew up in the American Midwestern state of Minnesota. He admits that, at this point, he prefers the Minnesota Twins to the New York Yankees, although it is also evident that neither baseball team interests him as much as coding does. Speaking over Skype, Elamri describes himself as “school-oriented” and “by nature shy,” but he visibly brightens when discussing different syntax for computer coding and the technical aspects of building Digitr. Elamri began the initial coding for a paperless hall pass in 2016 on the suggestion of a teacher as part of a computer science program offered through the school. Via email, he reflected that he wanted “to start from scratch and create a legit app.” “I love coding and anything Apple. So in between classes and school breaks, I found myself learning other coding applications so that I will be able to create an app worthy of my school.” At the time, Elamri was 12. By January 2017, Elamri had created mPass, an earlier iteration of Digitr. Minnetonka East recognized the app’s potential and deployed it throughout the school. According to Brunik, the application has been “incredibly successful” at Minnetonka, and she believes it would “be a great service to any school setting.” Elamri decided to rename his app Digitr to “reflect its wider commercial application for other schools.” To date, there are 24 schools using Digitr: 19 in Minnesota; two in neighboring Wisconsin; and one each in California, Texas, and Washington. Elamri is quick to thank the middle school teachers who mentored him early on, the public schools he attends, and an after-school club for students who love to code, “Coders Unite.” “If not for the STEM funding in our school, I would not probably have the opportunity to create this app that helps our school and hopefully, can be used by other schools too here in the US and beyond.” The multi-talented teen hopes his story “will inspire many young Moroccans around the world to pursue their passion, keep on tweaking and perfecting their skills, and be a part of making technology serve a better world for the next generations.” Omar’s father Adil, a Casablanca native, told Morocco World News that he hopes his son’s example will serve as a “leap-off point” and “inspire” other young people “no matter the age or religion.”

By Hajare el Khaldi Rabat – An imam in the Temara region has been accused of raping six children inside of a mosque. Amid the parents’ outrage and the childrens despair, the authorities have little help to offer. Temara has been shaken by accusations that an imam, entrusted to convey a divine message to children, instead performed gross sexual acts on the innocent minors. The newspaper Assabah reported that the imam in question had established a kuttab, an elementaryschool in that follows the Islamic tradition, inside of the mosque with hopes of encouraging the children of Douar Southern Aoulad Bennaser to memorize the Quran. Parents from the community met the imam’s seemingly benevolent initiative with great enthusiasm, placing their sons and daughters’ well-being in his hands. However, the parents soon began to suspect the imamof inappropriate behavior when their their children share some of the his odd requests, such as asking them to sit on his lap inside the kuttab. Others reported more serious charges. One family filed a complaint to the General Deputy of the King on charges of rape, only to be met with negligence. Confronted by the authorities’ lack of support and the lack of evidence against the imam, the residents of the Douar decided to take matters to their own hands by forming teams to track the his behavior and accumulate evidence. On Thursday February 15, the families’ nightmare came true when one of the residents witnessed the imam alone with an eight-year-old boy. Sacrificing the child’s safety to gather evidence, the local chose to contact the child’s family, rather than intervene. When the family arrived at the kuttab with other witnesses, they were appalled to see the imam sexually assaulting the child. After the arrest, five other people presented complaints against the alleged rapist, which finally caused the police listen to the children in the presence of their parents. The victims’ identical stories and the imam’s silence convinced the detectives of the legitimacy of the accusations. This is certainly not the first crime of its kind, as news of children’s sexual abuse by religious authorities, teachers, and family members continues to make headlines. The hope remains that this time, after the shock dissipates, real action will be taken to raise awareness about this sexualabuse and provide support those who have been forever scarred by this misconduct.

Rabat – The Court of the Spanish Enclave of Ceuta has released the father of the eight-year-old Ivorian boy smuggled in a suitcase from Morocco.  On May 7, 2015, a Moroccan girl was dragging a heavy suitcase at Ceuta’s border, when, scanning the suitcase, civil guards saw the silhouette of a child crammed in a fetal position, report the Agence France Presse. “My name is Adou,” the boy told the agents in French, according to Spanish journalist Nicolas Castellano, who wrote a book about the young boy’s story. In hopes of saving his 45-year-old father from a more severe punishment, Abou, now 10, told the court on Tuesday that he was forced into the suitcase by a “Moroccan girl.”  The prosecution initially sought to sentence the father, Ali Ouattara, to three years in prison on charges of human trafficking and putting his child in danger. “The child’s life was endangered, he was inhumanly curled up in a tiny suitcase, without ventilation,” judge Fernando Teson said when the trial began. But before going to trial, Ouattara, who had already spent one month in pre-detention jail, told AFP that “I’m very confident because I’m not a human trafficker. I was not going to trade with my own child.” Indeed, by the end of the trial, the judge sentenced the father to a fine of 92 euros, because it was not proven that the defendant “knew how his son was going to be smuggled into the country.” Former professor of Philosophy and French in Abidjan, Ouattara arrived illegally to Spain in 2006 on a makeshift boat with other sub-Saharan African migrants. Having left Côte d’Ivoire in the midst of a crisis, it took Ouattara years to obtain a residency permit, a stable job, and accommodations in Spain before he was able to legally bring his wife and daughter to the country. However, he was unable to bring his son Adou because Spanish authorities deemed his 1,300 euros monthly salary insufficient for the family’s expenses. “The Spanish administration had refused me four times. They said my salary was not enough,” he said. Ouattara continued to explain that Abou was left alone in the Ivory Coast after his grandmother died. “For us, it was crucial for the child to come, we couldn’t live without him, we couldn’t stop thinking about him.” Ouattara decided to pay 5,000 euros to a network of smugglers, to bring his son to him. In May 2015, he was delighted to learn that his son had arrived safe and sound to Spain. Shortly after his son’s arrival, the man was arrested at the Ceuta border post, where he had planned to meet the boy. He said he was “deceived” by the network of smugglers who told him that Abou would be brought to Spain by car and he was not aware that the boy would be smuggled in a suitcase. The young Moroccan woman who carried the baggage is wanted by the court and faces six years in prison. Abou and his family currently live in a Paris suburb.

Rabat – The grace, the beauty of the gestures; his infallibly assuring presence on the pitch; his propensity for impeccable passes; that facility for single-handedly taking upon himself to perforate the fortress of defensive-playing squads—Messi is an emotion.  When a game features him, whatever the result, whatever team he is on, the Argentine has that unique giftedness of making football games what they were meant to be in the first place: a display of beauty and emotion-laden experiences, an anthology of glamorous moments. Messi is anthological.  Messi shone in Stamford Bridge. Despite Kanté’s—who else—almost irreproachable job in overshadowing him, the Argentine genius had moments of divine inspiration in yesterday’s game. He dribbled; gave unbelievable passes; opened the game for his mates.  Most important, he scored Barça’s equalizer, breaking a long-standing spell and propelling himself in the company of players whom no epithet can adequately explain.  Messi’s football has that transcendental elegance that breathes hope. When he is playing, when Barcelona are losing, Barcelona fans, like a soon-to-be-mother facing the turbulence of the delivery phase, and whose great pain is but a pale interlude to the eternal bliss yet to come, turn to Messi to step up, to step in, to equalize, or score the winning goal, or give the ultimate assist. And he usually does. And he did it yesterday.  And they know he will again, because that is what great players do: they reduce the sphere of implausibility and tether you to hope in the most horrendous moments. “Until the last whistle is blown,” their presence seems to be telling fans, “anything is possible.” The Argentine does not only play the beautiful game; he reinvents it. Valverde’s side may not have been the impeccable squad they were some weeks ago, but they had Messi: That was enough to stand in the way of Chelsea’s almost assured victory. Some of us may foreground Christensen’s monumental mistake. But isn’t that the point? Defensive blunders are usually a reflection of an unbearable burden, psychological effect of facing a better squad. Barney Ronay, one of the best sport commentators still around, perfectly captured Messi’s relationship with opponents’ mistakes: “Never panic around Messi. He wants you to panic. He smells your panic and runs into it.” That’s right: Messi’s eventful presence is an invitation to perfection. When his teammates make mistakes, he fixes them. And when his opponents err, well, he duly punishes them.  Yesterday, however, it was Willian, Chelsea’s only imposing Brazilian, who marveled us. It was as though the Brazilian  coach was out there to prove that in that sea of Brazilian players trying to make it to Russia 2018, Tito had not been wrong to trust him.  The titillating touches, the magnificent runs, his projectile-like ability to deftly throw himself in opposing defenses, the long passes, the crosses, the two fantastical moments in which he hit the post, his goal (that goal!)—everything Willian did yesterday bore that inescapable aura of somebody trying to make a statement.  And so, like Mario Götze in the “Brazil 2014” final that saw Germany deny Messi that ultimately sought-after glory with national team, Willian can end his career in peace: his yesterday’s brilliance gave him an individual trophy that few players can claim: being the man of the match in an important game featuring football’s greatest. Willian was the soul of a game in which Messi broke a curse! He can tell his kids that he once outshone the best of his generation. Before the game, Antonio Conté, like any other coach playing against Barcelona’s unstoppable machine of beatific ball possession, had told the press that his side was ready to suffer. And suffer they did. 75% of ball possession for Messi and company in the first half, 70% in the second… The game was a traditional Chelsea VS Barça. Barça kept the ball, but seemed to be at a loss as to what to make of their possession; Chelsea barely kept the ball, but knew what to do when they did have it. Had it been another team, it would have been easy to declare Barcelona officially qualified before the second leg. But this is Chelsea, the only squad that can confer an aura of unattractiveness and impotence to Barcelona’s otherwise magical footballing philosophy. With Chelsea, Barcelona can have 90% of possession and still be knocked out. The two teams have a history, and one, one both sides, charged with unbridled elation and ineluctable frustration. Iniesta’s legendary equalizer for Barcelona in 2009 and Fernando Torress’ crucifying late goal for Chelsea in 2012 are two such examples. So this game is not over; in fact, it has just begun. The second leg, to be played on March 15, will be a final. Which is why we like Champions League. It is another level. It has that (tantalizing?) ability of transforming an otherwise normal or dull week into a festival, or a nightmare, depending on which team passes to the next stage and which side the viewer is on. Both teams still have their destinies in their hands. Chelsea will come to the Nou Camp with high expectations, which Barcelona will be determined to crush. We’ll find out soon enough, in three weeks’ time on both sides.

Rabat – SDX Energy announced in a press release on February 21, that the latest KSS-2 Well drill results on the permit in Sebou, Morocco, reveal low gas saturation incompatible with commercial usage. The KSS-2 encountered 8 net meters of high-quality tank, but the company believes that the well location is too isolated from the reservoir source rock, due to its location on the “upthrown” side of a fault. The KSS-2 is the sixth of nine well projects; four wells have already demonstrated positive results.. In addition, the company assures its investors that the upcoming drills will progress as anticipated. The next scheduled well on the program is the SAH-2, will be located on the “downthrown” side of the fault, a drilling structure similar to those that have produced effective wells for the company. As a result, the corporation projects that the SAH-2 carries a high potential for commercial use.

Rabat – Mohamed Ben Abdelkader, who is delegated minister in charge of administrative reforms, has revealed shocking numbers regarding Moroccan job market. Abdelkader has reportedly revealed that 60% of current professions will wither in coming years, throwing the country in acute challenges of increasing unemployment rate. Among the many professions set to leave the floor to new professions, the minister emphasized that professions like “translator” or “paralegal” (legal assistant) will be obsolete in the near future, Al Massae reports. The minister also said that due to digitalization and huge technological advances in many sectors, jobs demanding physical force will be superseded by new professions, especially ones requiring soft skills. Ben Abdelkader explained the efforts that his department has been making to reform public administration and ensure equal treatment as well as better working conditions, underlining that the government is committed to reforming administration and improving working conditions as it is convinced that productive work cannot be separated from workers’ satisfaction.

Rabat – After operating as Casablanca’s largest waste site for the past three decades, the Médiouna landfill will be closed by the end of next April, as reported by the Moroccan daily Al Ahdath Al Maghribia in its recent February 19 edition. Spreading over an area of 70 hectares, Mediouna, which is located about 20 kilometers from Casablanca, has served as the main landfill for the city since 1986. An estimated quantity of 3,500 tons per day of household waste is generated solely from economic capital, the largest producer of waste in Morocco. This waste totaled 1.4 million tons in 2017, down by 8 percent from 1.8 million tons in 2016. “In addition to household waste, more than 3,000 tons of hospital, industrial, and unshelled rubbish are illegally delivered to the site daily by 750 tipper trucks. The overwhelming smell from the site stretches over miles, reaching not only the surrounding areas like Médiouna, Bouskoura, Nouaceur, Mohammed V airport,  and also more distant areas like Sbata, Lahraouiyine and Tit Mellil,” an unidentified environmental expert told Morocco World News. In this 70-hectare landfill, where the average height of waste is about 50 meters above the ground level, several traditional waste disposal methods are still in use, such as burying the waste to reduce the volume of space that it occupies. However, the expert pointed out that the odors emanating from the landfill and pestilential fumes carried by the winds could be the cause of serious respiratory diseases for local residents, who are exposed to multiple sources of air pollution. Several studies have raised concerns about the potential increased risk of bladder, brain and hepatobiliary cancers and leukemias near landfill sites. “As long as the landfill is not regulated, toxic chemicals can leach into the groundwater, leading to serious problems of ground-water contamination,” he warned. The daily reported that Mediouna’s landfill will be replaced by a new regulated dumpsite in the vicinity, covering an estimated area of ??35 hectares belonging to the municipality of the Metropolis, Casablanca. The local development company in charge of waste management in Casablanca, SDL Casa Prestations has entrusted this task to the companies “Mecomar” and “Derichebourg.” Another call for tenders is expected next March. The newspaper adds that the new landfill will require the mobilization of a budget ranging from EUR 273 to 455 million, about MAD 3 to 5 billion. The State Secretariat for Sustainable Development has pledged a contribution of MAD 220 million, compelling the mayor to finance the rest, which does not exclude the possibility of seeking loans from European banks. Upgrading the dumpsite will take around 18 months. Meanwhile, the garbage of the capital will be poured over an area of ??7 hectares. Although the construction of a new regulated landfill, the expert said that it will “condemn Mediouna once again and these 35 hectares will only solve half of the problem of waste management in a city with 4 million population.” His “radical solution” consists of providing each region of Casablanca with its own landfill. A definitive closure of the Mediouna landfill andplans to open a new regulated dumpsite in compliance with international standards was initially planned in 2015. After 33 percent of the site was effectively covered with soil, the company managing the site since 2008, ECOMED failed to rehabilitate the entire area. In the meantime, trucks have continued to dump thousands of tons of waste every day.In addition to housing the landfill, which provides a livelihood for significant numbers of waste pickers, Médiouna also serves as a shelter to many homeless people and contains the largest cemetery of Casablanca, Al Ghofrane.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled, on Wednesday morning in Tangier, a terror cell made up of six extremist supporters of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). According to a statement by the Ministry of Interior, the six suspects arrested by Morocco’s Counter-Terror Bureau, are aged between 22 and 42. The cell was led by a former detainee who had previously been arrested for terrorism-related cases, added the statement. The suspects are also suspected of assault and violence against citizens in Tangier with the help of sticks. The initial investigation conducted by BCIJ shows that the cell had close ties with another cell dismantled on February 1 in Tangier and Meknes. The terror group was planning to conduct attacks with the aim of undermining the security and stability of the country. BCIJ members were able to seize weapons, sticks, military trousers and electronic devices. The six members of this terror- cell will be brought to justice at the end of the investigation conducted under the supervision of the Prosecutor General’s Office.

Rabat – In the wake of  the corruption accusations surrounding Benyamin Netanyahu, several Israelis were arrested in what the police are calling “Case 4000.” Seven Israeli members of Netanyahu’s innermost circle were arrested less than a week ago on charges of bribing regulators, fraud, money laundering, corporate breach of trust, among other charges. This circle includes Shaul Elovitch, a close friend of the prime minister who runs an Israeli telecommunications giant named Bezeq Group. Nir Hefetz, Netanyahu’s former family spokesperson for many years also figures among the persons arrested, on suspicion of obstruction of justice and accepting bribes. A lawyer for Elovitch told CNN: “Shaul Elovitch vehemently denies the suspicions against him. We suggest that you be patient and do not rush to conclusions. We are certain that when things clear up, it will be possible to realize that he did not commit any offense.” However, several Israeli news outlets reported on Sunday that Netanyahu, who denied any wrongdoing, is not currently facing any charges, though he and his spouse are expected to be questioned,. On the other hand, at the annual Munich Security Conference attended by Netanyahu, he said “the arrests of members of his close circle revealed yet another futile investigation, a contrived bubble that will burst.”

The video shows women attending a public concert in Saudi Arabia, a scene unimaginable in the country only a few months ago. “Some women even took of their head scarves, allowing their hair to hang loose.” In this concert venue, women and men are separated as required by law, but the fact that women are able to attend is a revolution in the conservative kingdom. The young Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman introduced a lot of major social changes, deemed progressive, in his country. After introducing many reforms in favor of the Saudi women, they are now officially allowed to legally start their own businesses without the consent of male guardians.

The charter document was negotiated by party leaders who represent a majority of members in the House of Representatives. The charter, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), will serve as a guide which creates well-defined legislative priorities regarding important domestic and external issues. The charter document is based on five pillars: a participatory approach, efficiency, transparency in management, solidarity in terms of accountability and dialogue with partners, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said on Monday in Rabat. The six majority parties that form the  current governing coalition which concluded the new agreement include the Justice and Development Party (PJD), the National Rally of Independents (RNI), the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP), the People’s Movement (MP), the Constitutional Union (UC) and the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS). According to MAP, coalition party leadership outlined the importance of mobilizing their respective parliamentary and party resources to advance important initiatives including government reform, advancing democratic principles and the rule of law in society, the further consolidation of advanced regionalization, and strengthening administrative transparency and integrity. The document signed on Monday also aims to improve governance, encourage the development of Morocco’s economic model and to promote employment opportunities. The charter will also advance sustainable development in the kingdom while reinforcing human development priorities that will help shrink regional disparities. Recently, Moroccan media outlets have reported on a simmering political crisis and infighting between party leadership of the coalition parties. The reports of coalition drama arose recently following the absence of RNI ministers from key government meetings, including the governing council which took place on Thursday, February 8. To respond to the crisis allegations, El Othmani said that “there has been no government crisis” and the majority wants to remain consistent and in agreement with the priorities that meet citizens’ aspirations for education, health and employment. According to the head of government, “it is normal that differences exist between the majority parties given the specificities and references of each party,” he said, noting that diversity within coalitions and parties is healthy.

Rabat – A unit of the Marine in the high seas of Tangiers arrested two Spanish drug smugglers, aged 59 and 32, together with their Moroccan accomplice. The Royal Marine unit, which had discovered considerable quantities of hashish in the vicinity of the incident site, allegedly intercepted the three men late on Sunday night as they navigated in a forbidden zone. An investigation is being conducted to determine the three men’s association with the discovered quantities of hashish as well as their presence at night in a forbidden area, says Efe, a Spanish outlet. Meanwhile, the three accused are held in custody for “illegal navigation.” “It is forbidden to navigate in this zone,” the police told the press, while specifying that the site is notorious for being an exit point for drug traffickers, as well as migrants’ boats. Sunday’s arrest comes as Spain’s war on illegal drugs reaches its peak, especially in the Cadix province, a place known for being a safe haven for drug dealing and similar illegal activities, reports says AFP. According to the Spanish ministry of interior, 40% of drug smuggling that make it to Spain arrive through the Cadix province. Recently speaking to the press, Juan Ignacio Zoido, who is Spain’s interior minister, vowed to eradicate drug smugglings and other criminal activities that have taken Cadix hostage in recent years. “This zone will no longer be under the sway of criminal activities,” the minister said, stressing that the government will ensure the restoration of order and rule of law, and that “every criminal act will be duly punished.” Earlier this month, a group of about 20 people is said to have broken into the local police, overpowering two guards and “freeing” an alleged ringleader of a criminal group.

Rabat – The 193-United Nations Member States unanimously elected on Tuesday the Moroccan ambassador to the UN, Omar Hilale, as the Chairman of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization for the 2018 year. The election of Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN reflects Morocco’s unwavering commitment to the peaceful settlements of conflicts, the primacy of political solutions, the importance of mediation and the need for conflict prevention. According to Maghreb Arab Press, this election also an acknowledgment of the eminent role that Morocco plays in the framework of UN Peacekeeping Operations, especially in Africa, in which Moroccan peacekeepers have been participating since 1960. The Special Committee, which convenes together all Member States and United Nations observers, is of great importance in the framework of the United Nations legal architecture. The committee pays a special attention to the consideration of proposals relating to the maintenance of international peace and security, the peaceful settlement of conflicts, cooperation between the UN, international and regional organizations, as well as United Nations reform and assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions. The Committee’s new session is currently taking place from February 20-28 under the theme “Exchange of information on States’ practices concerning the use of negotiations and investigations.” This session is an opportunity for Morocco to share its experience in this area, concluded MAP.

Rabat – Following the deadly plane crash that claimed the life of all the 66 people on board, on Sunday in a mountainous region of southern Iran, King Mohammed VI sent a message of condolence and compassion to Iranian President Hassan Rohani on Tuesday.  In his message, the King expressed to the president Rohani his “heartfelt condolences and sincere feelings of compassion, as well as his solidarity with and compassion for grieving families and the brotherly Iranian people.”  The monarch has also reaffirmed his sympathy for the Iranian leader “in this painful moment, praying God to grant him and the victims’ relatives patience and comfort.”  The Aseman Airlines flight, which carried 60 passengers, including one child, and six crew members, disappeared from radar screens about 50 minutes after taking off from Mehrabad Airport in Tehran to the southern Iranian city of Yasuj, some 780 kilometers south of the Iranian capital.  Authorities said that rescue helicopters struggled to land in the crash site in the Zagros Mountain because of “heavy fog and emergency workers were trying to reach the area by land.” Shortly after the incident, Iran lambasted international sanctions that have long prevented it from buying new aircraft or spare parts from the West as its commercial passenger aircraft fleet has aged, causing regular air accidents in the past decades.

El Othmani echoed earlier statements made by the State Secretary for Transport, Mohammed Najib Boulif, who said road safety improvements are a priority for the government. Last week, the transport secretary revealed that the number of people killed on roads in Morocco decreased by 2.62 percent in 2017. To fulfill these expectations, El Othmani believes that, “these measures must be direct and part of education,” adding that the government is giving great importance to the road safety project and is committed to fully implementing a strategy that includes road surveillance, fines for violations and educational outreach.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – An Iraqi court on Monday sentenced one Turkish woman to death and 10 other women of various nationalities to life in prison for their affiliation with Daesh, or the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). Presiding judge Abdul-Sattar al-Birqdar said that the “court has issued ten verdicts of life in prison against ten women after convicting them of terrorism, and sentenced to death by hanging another terrorist who holds Turkish citizenship.” The women were between the ages of 20 and 50, and all were arrested in the Iraqi cities of Mosul or Tal Afar.  Although the defendants’ state-appointed lawyers insisted that their clients had been “duped” by their husbands and family members, the women were found guilty of Article IV of Iraq’s anti-terrorism laws. The verdicts can be appealed but trials such as this raise the issue of judicial process for those accused of belonging to Daesh and the degree to which these women were active participants or bystanders. Moreover, the trial also raises the broader question of why non-Iraqis are being tried in Baghdad rather than in their countries of origin.  Journalist, author, and activist Azadeh Moaveni gave her reactions to the BBC, bluntly stating that there was “no chance” these women would receive a fair trial in Iraq.  The current Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad and its militias have been charged with human rights abuses in their policing of the areas formerly held by the so-called Islamic State.  Referring to the Iraqi government’s sectarian political system, she said that “the bar for [female prisoners’] treatment is very, very low.”   A security source told AFP that there are 509 foreign-born women currently detained in Iraq, as are 813 children.  However, their governments have been slow to ask for them back. According to Moaveni, the governments of Morocco, Tunisia, Europe, and the Gulf are not extraditing their women to be tried in their native countries. Rather, she says, foreign governments are “delegat[ing] the problem to the Iraqi government.”  Last month, a German woman of Moroccan descent was sentenced to death in the same Baghdad court for connections with the jihadist group.  In December 2017, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared final victory over Daesh, after announcing that Iraqi forces had fully regained control of the Iraqi-Syrian border.  However, the jihadist group remains active and continues to carry out attacks and suicide bombings on both the Iraqi government and civilians. Late on Sunday, February 18 near the oil-rich northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, at least 27 Iraqi militiamen were killed in a Daesh ambush. Although the government has regained territorial control of the so-called “caliphate,” present-day Iraq is far from post-ISIS.

Rabat – On January 10, Melchior Wathelet, Advocate General of the Luxembourg-based ECJ (European Court of Justice), made the comments that EU-Morocco fisheries agreement should be declared null and void because it includes Western Sahara.  “The fisheries exploitation by the EU of the waters adjacent to Western Sahara established and implemented by the contested acts do not respect the rights of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination,” said Wathelet in his January legal opinions, stressing that his concerns were grounded in a firm belief that any such exploitation should primarily benefit the population of Western Sahara.  Although Wathelet’s comment came as no surprise to European legal and political experts—he was behind a similar move that targeted Morocco-EU agricultural agreements in 2016—it came at a particularly crucial moment, especially given the fact that the European Commission and several other relevant authorities had made it known that they were more inclined to secure a long-standing strategic partnership by renewing the fisheries deal that is set to expire in July 2018.  But while not binding on the ECJ, the Advocate General’s legal opinions are usually highly valued, heeded and, more often than not, adopted by the court. And so, one week from now, on February 27, as judges of the ECJ convene to deliberate on the “legality” of EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, will they, in total disregard of international law and outright dismissal of expert’s overwhelming unanimity on the indispensability of Morocco-EU relations, decide to side with Wathelet?  For many experts, partnership with Morocco is an asset that the EU cannot, should not, afford to lose. The Morocco-EU fisheries agreement, which was initiated in 1996 and has since known four renewals, entails the exploitation of Moroccan fishing products by about 120 vessels from 11 EU countries (Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, etc.). And for many such countries, cooperation with Morocco should not only be preserved; it should be strengthened. Morocco, they argue, is not just a crucial trade partner, but it is also an indispensable ally, especially in terrorism and migration-related matters. The Spanish government, for example, has recently declared that renewing the deal will be critical in advancing bilateral relations between the two countries. Willy Fautré, a human rights advocate and EU politics expert says that Morocco is “an asset that EU cannot put at risk.” For him, if EU decides to follow Wathelet in annulling the fisheries deal, it will lose an effective tool of “inducing positive changes” in Moroccan domestic politics. The agreement, Fautré points out, is an essential “instrument of soft power” for the EU in Morocco. And so ending the fisheries deal would create unwarranted “tensions” and “undermine EU’s bargaining power.”  But while politicians and EU officials object to Wathelet’s opinions by pointing out Morocco’s centrality as an EU financial and trade partner, legal experts and academics are pointing towards the legality of the whole ongoing procedures, questioning ECJ’s right to meddle in the EU’s foreign policy with third parties.  In this highly contentious dossier, as the ECJ embarks upon the troubled waters of international politics, ECJ judges, says Jeanne Laperrouze in a recent op-ed article, will have to answer a set of fundamental questions: “Is the ECJ legally competent to deliberate on EU’s deals with third countries? Does an association such as WSC (Western Sahara Campaign) have the right to challenge the legality of an international agreement?  As a reminder, WSC, which is a UK-based pro-Polisario lobbying group campaigning for the right to self-determination of Western Sahara, was the same that filed the charge against the supposed illegality of EU-Morocco fisheries deal. The charges were first addressed to Britain’s High Court of Justice which, deciding that it was incompetent to deliberate on such a dossier, chose to transfer the issue to ECJ, asking for legal counsels.  “Only those who are subjected to international law (states and organizations like the UN or the EU),” writes Laperrouze, “have the legal competence to demand that an international agreement be annulled.” For her, neither ECJ nor WSC have the right to question the legality of an international agreement. So, by interfering in the issue, the ECJ will be acting in blatant disregard of international law, given that such a move is the sole prerogative of the UN’s Security Council.  Jean Claude Martinez, a law professor at the Panthéon-Assas University, a leading law faculty in France, has also said that “the arbiter role” in a disputed territory should be left to the UN. As such, he suggests, aside from ECJ’s lack of legal competence in the present dossier, it is even more ironic and inconceivable that EU should prejudice its long-standing partnership with Morocco on the basis of claims by a third party that has no judicial personality. Following the Advocate General’s recommendations would be “ludicrous”, Martinez writes, underlining that such a move would embolden other secessionist movements elsewhere, setting “dangerous precedent.” Therefore, he concludes, “ECJ judges should make the right call” by not interfering with the renewal of the fisheries agreement, which in turn, he contends, will prevent “a chain reaction that risks shaking the EU at its core.”  But more important than all these objections from legal experts and informed observers is the official position of the European Commission.  A number of senior officials at the organization’s governing body have recently raised doubts on the “hidden agenda” of the Advocate General’s position, calling his opinions “politically motivated” and ignorant of “the depth and richness of Morocco-EU relations.”  More importantly, the DGMARE study, a European Commission-sponsored investigation, has recently come to the conclusion that the deal is “vitally important” as a key factor in promoting peace, security, and unprecedented socio-economic development in southern Moroccan provinces, the locale of the disputed agreement.  With annual yields of 83,000 tons of fishing products amounting to €80 million in financial returns, the agreement, according to the study, is “efficient”; has a “positive impact” in the lives of local populations; and “contributes to the socio-economic interests” of all parties involved. The study has also found that 75% of the economic benefits of the agreement are enjoyed by locals, with numerous jobs (170,000 direct employment and 500,000 indirect employments) created in recent years.  What is more, colossal investments by the Moroccan government to modernize infrastructures and improve living standards in the South are no longer subject to dispute. This is clearly an essential element that invalidates the Advocate General’s claim that the agreement does not benefit the local people.  For the European Commission, after Brexit, there is a self-evident and pressing need to maintain and-if need be-strengthen relations with strategic partners. Should ECJ judges fail to disavow Wathelet’s position, the EU will be losing an invaluable asset which has continuously proven indispensable in helping Europe on various critical fronts. Morocco, too, would surely be affected, but the Kingdom can, in time, turn to another partner to exploit its huge maritime resources.  Therefore, in a week’s time, the task of ECJ judges will consist in reversing the doomsday clock that the Advocate General has initiated. Or, as Jean Claude Martinez has so pithily put it, “on February 27, it will be a great folly to break the agreement.” The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent any institution or entity.  © Morocco World News.

The individual, 31, was active on the internet since 2004, by regularly publishing contents supporting openly Daesh, said the same source. The suspect shared on the internet the content of this terror organization inciting to jihad, as well as photographs and videos showing executions of American soldiers by jihadist shooters, the statement added. According to the Spanish Interior ministry, “the person nabbed in Murcia had been involved for three years in a process of dangerous radicalisation, to such an extent that he could participate in terrorist acts.” Since the beginning of 2015, a total of 269 suspected terrorists have been arrested by the Spanish security services or in collaboration with foreign countries.

Rabat – Just a few more months separate football lovers from the ultimate global tournament which begins on June 14. The coach of Morocco’s national football team, Herve Renard, is expected to name his final squad for the upcoming friendlies that his team will play before the World Cup begins. Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported yesterday that Renard will soon announce the roster of players for the friendlies against Serbia on March 23 in Turin and against Uzbekistan on March 27 in Casablanca. FIFA called on each of the 32 teams that will compete in the World Cup to select 35 players for their friendlies before the World Cup in accordance to its new match regulations. According to the newspaper, Renard’s list will see some big changes. Some high-profile players will miss the cut for World Cup play as their performances with their local or international teams have not been convincing. This may be the case for Real Madrid’s young star, Achraf Hakimi, who missed several games for his Spanish squad lately. Several other Moroccan players were absent from major games with their international clubs due to injuries, including Sofiane Boufal, Romain Saiss, Oussama Tannane and Aziz Bouhaddouz. Renard has only a few months to think about his final squad for the World Cup tournament. When the tournament begins, the Atlas Lions will first battle Iran on June 15. Its second game on June 20 is against Portugal, while the last first round match for Morocco will be against Spain on June 25. Injured players that miss games may provide an opportunity for new faces to steal the spotlight on a global stage. Moroccan standout stars of the recently concluded African Nations Championship (CHAN) tournament include Ayoub El Kaabi who delivered a great performance, including a hat-trick against Guinea, for the host and title winner, Morocco. The Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) is currently negotiating to set up other friendlies with top-ranked teams, including Argentina. FRMF was also hoping for a friendly against the Belgian national football team, but the Belgian football federation denied its request. In December, Youssef Hijoub, a Moroccan FIFA agent, said that the Belgian team declined FRMF’s invitation due to security concerns.

Rabat – Lahcen Daoudi, the Minister of General Affairs and Governance, said that prices at the pump in Morocco were “forced to fall,” after global oil prices have dropped sharply in recent months.   However, since Friday, average prices at the pump have actually dropped. The diesel registered a drop of about MAD 0.17 and MAD 0.15 for gasoline. Daoudi who follows oil price’s evolution on “daily basis,” noted the decline of the latter from USD 70 to stand at USD 62 per barrel. He also pointed out that prices will remain the same until the end of February before fluctuating again. After the liberalization of fuel prices, the ministry launched, last September, a new initiative allowing drivers to check the evolution of fuel prices at the pump. Daoudi’s solution of showing consumers all available prices will keep them informed by allowing them “to choose the cheapest petrol stations.”  The minister insisted the information “must” be available for citizens. However, he stated during a press conference, held in June 2017, that “citizens do not take advantage of the liberalization” of hydrocarbon prices enacted in December 2015.  The minister alleged that it was Morocco who had “not provided conditions for good competition.” He also announced that while distributors can change the price of hydrocarbons whenever they want, they must alert the ministry before they do so.

Rabat – In a message addressed to the 3rd parliamentary forum on social justice, King Mohammed VI urged participants to take concrete actions to address social disparity and the challenges that have been hindering the progress of Morocco’s development model. The two-day symposium opened on Monday in Rabat, convening stakeholders and parliamentarians to address recommendations on the new development model related to social and spatial  justice. In his message, King Mohammed VI  recalled a speech that he delivered in October 2017 during the opening of fall legislative term.  In that speech, the King told  that Morocco’s development model was no longer responding to the demands of citizens. In his Monday message to the participants of the parliamentary forum, the King repeated the sentiment,  saying, “It has become clear that our model, which contributed to countless tangible economic and social achievements, is no longer able to respond to citizens’ growing demands and needs.” The monarch added that the development model currently in force cannot “reduce social and inter-regional disparities.” Therefore, the current development model could not help Morocco to curb social disparities and ensure social justice. Subsequently, King Mohammed VI called on the participants to make more efforts to face the challenges that hinder the progress of the country’s development. According to the King, social justice can be achieved only through the application of several key factors. Calling on the participants for a review of the model, the King specified that this review would be aimed at more “than just isolated sectoral reforms, or a reshuffle of certain economic projects and social programs.” According to the King, the country needs an “integrated vision to shape the legal system underpinning it.” This strategy, according to the monarch, “needs to carry a strong impetus for the new model in order to help address the challenges that harden development progress” and “address weaknesses and gaps revealed by past experience.” Therefore, the sovereign advised stakeholders to take into consideration the societal changes in Morocco.  King Mohammed VI has also addressed the issues facing Moroccan youth. According to the King, stakeholders need to put the youth issue “at the heart of the desired development model.” In his message, the King urged the parliamentarians to come up with measures intended to “improve the situation of our young people, who are our real asset and the country’s  everlasting wealth.” The King also called on the participants to consider shifts in mentality and how this strategy can help to achieve development. “I firmly believe that the success of any vision hinges upon a change in mentalities,” said the King, adding that  “this is the only way to continue promoting the development the country is witnessing in various sectors and at the same time to set the stage for a new culture based on entrepreneurship, self-reliance and accountability.” King Mohammed VI approved of the theme of the  edition of the forum:”The challenges of social and spatial justice and the components of the new development model.” “Your choice reflects a keen awareness of this topical subject which involves many interrelated issues that call for an innovative, holistic approach. The aim, ultimately, is to find practical, applicable solutions to citizens’ real and pressing problems and to achieve balanced, equitable development for all, in a serene, stable environment.” “No meaningful economic and social development is possible if public service institutions do not discharge their mission properly,” said the King, urging the participants to strive harder to engage public and private sectors in innovative, effective partnerships in order to boost “comprehensive development” that would serve the interests of cities and promote investment. “I must insist, once again, that revisiting the Moroccan development model is an issue which concerns all Moroccans and all of the nation’s forces – individuals, institutions, political parties, trade unions, civil society and professional institutions,” he stated. King Mohammed VI told the participants that the country has all the assets that would help it to achieve more progress, including human resources “as well as  well-established institutions. This means we can embark, in a bold, responsible manner, on a constructive dialogue regarding a development model that satisfies all Moroccans. The King has also called on stakeholders to voice any proposal that would benefit the country’s development.”

Rabat – According to the chargé de mission at the Royal Office, Youssef Amrani, human security has always been Morocco’s top priority. Amrani made the declaration during a meeting held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, which was marked by Morocco’s participation. During the three-day meeting held February 16-18, Amrani said that human security has been a central issue for Morocco. Amrani told attendees that Morocco has been working diligently to develop measures to combat poverty, particularly among the young. Amrani also outlined the work of Morocco’s Initiative for Human Development (INDH), which was initiated by King Mohammed VI in 2005. The initiative aims at providing all social groups the conditions they deserve for a “dignified life.” INDH constitutes, according to Amrani, “the matrix of the Moroccan societal project, which is itself built on the fundamentals of political democracy, economic efficiency and social cohesion.” Amrani also emphasized that the changes that have been occurring in the world, including globalization, the changing nature of transnational conflicts, sectarian threats and the technological revolution “are making borders more exposed to multiple risks.” These multidimensional risks, he argued, can cause significant damage for human security in terms of climate change and the stability of states. Recalling Morocco’s achievements relating to climate issues, Amrani said that the country’s interest in climate issues and their importance regarding national development and policy strategies was confirmed by hosting the COP 22 climate conference in Marrakech in 2016. Amrani, who was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), added that these numerous threats have direct results for the security of States. “The security of States, the preservation of territorial integrity and the building of strong democratic States are fundamental conditions to guarantee human security and counter external aggressions.” He emphasized that human security and counter-terrorism require a multi-sectoral approach. The deconstruction of jihadist discourse and the prevention of radicalism, he argued, are essential to immunizing populations, especially young people, against the hype of extremism, and the necessary promotion of a tolerant and balanced Islam in the region. The Munich conference is an annual symposium that convenes international participants to discuss international security policy. The meeting gathers about 350 senior officials from more than 70 countries, including Morocco.

By Hajare Elkhaldi Rabat- After long discussions, alterations, and strenuous public outcry, Morocco’s House of Representatives has finally adopted a long-awaited law to fight violence against women. However, what may seem a bright light at the end of a long legislative tunnel may actually be a train that quashes the hopes of millions of Moroccan women.  On Wednesday, February 14, several media outlets reported the news as if it were the government’s love letter to Moroccan women: draft law 103-13 103-13 represented a major step towards achieving gender equality.  The Minister of Family, Solidarity, Equality and Social Development, Bassima Hakkaoui, declared that this bill “is part of an ongoing process to strengthen democracy and achieve parity, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution aimed at combating all forms of gender-based discrimination,” according to MAP. Hakkaoui maintained that the bill would offer preventive measures and increase penalties against those who commit violent acts against women.  Under the shiny headlines, a disappointing reality remains: while the law increases prison time and fines for certain acts of violence, such as when the violent person is a relative of the victim or if the victim has a disability, it does nothing to protect women, ensure that those in charge of women’s security execute their duties, or offer concrete services to victims of violence.  Currently, the Moroccan criminal law does not allow the police to intervene in domestic disputes unless there is an imminent threat of death, a policy aptly described by the infamous catchphrase “is there blood?” Furthermore, prosecutors are incapable of investigating cases of assault and battery unless the woman provides a medical certificate that proves that she has been incapacitated for more than 20 days due to the injuries.  The law has also failed victims of violence by doing little to help women face the aftermath of violence. Stephanie Willman Bordat, human rights activist and founding partner of Mobilising for Rights Associates, told Morocco World News that the law should have also set up tangible services for women who flee violent situations.  In reality, women victims of violence often run from violence to insecurity, as the law does not provide them with shelter, health, or legal advice and assistance. “Why should someone who beats up his wife get to keep the house? If you take a human rights approach, the woman and the children should stay and the violent person should be the one to leave,” said Bordat.   One of the few changes that this law offers is the criminalization of sexual harassment in public spaces, expanding the  crime beyond the realm of the workplace.However, the law does not mention sexual violence.  As a matter of fact, only three percent of rape cases get reported. In addition to the stigma that still surrounds rape and the victim blaming that rape survivors endure, Borat maintains that the law, which still criminalizes sexual relationship outside marriage, is a key deterrent, as women risk getting prosecuted. “Victims of rape will continue to suffer in silence,” concludes Bordat. The Alternative Movement for Individual Liberties (MALI) declared, shortly after the bill’s approval, that it should also deal with the issue of marital rape, a criticism that has received consensus among women across Morocco, according to Bordat. Nevertheless, many have mocked this amendment, calling the notion of spousal rape illogical and incomprehensible;many also found it contradictory to the teachings of Islam, following the prophet’s Hadith, “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses [and does not come], and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.”  This raises the question: how can the government reinforce laws  that cover  matters to which a substantial amount of citizens remain, sometimes adamantly, oblivious? Is it wiser to wait for social change eventually followed by the law, or push first for legislative reform?  To this Bordat responded, “People will always find a host of excuses to justify violence against women, but that does not exempt the government from doing its job. The government is still obligated to make marital rape illegal and provide services for women who suffer from it.”  Additionally, while examining the public’s opinions, it is crucial to assess who gets to speak. In fact, given the stigma that surrounds the topic and the intimidation that women might face, their opinions and experiences often get lost in a spiral of silence. “The change is already here,” said the human rights activist, “the decision makers like to say that people are ignorant and that change should be slow. We think reality is actually the opposite. Social practices and social behaviors are way more advanced, the problem is not that the people are behind, the problem is that the law doesn’t respond to the current social realities,” she maintained.  In the absence of government action, women turn to NGOs that have been working on establishing local systems, working with local police and prosecutors to create a better response system and treatment for violence cases locally.  Bordat added that NGOs need to continue advocating for a real legal change, but until that happens, many aspects of the legal process should shift in order to counter the lack of political will. “There is a lot that should be done in terms of what a real law should entail and the role of MPs in a democracy: show up for votes, serve their citizens, and improve the lives of the people they represent, and this should be made clear to the representatives,” she said.  Meanwhile, the years of delay have resulted in an incomplete law that attempts to embellish Morocco’s image in the eyes of the west and human rights organizations, while perpetuating the idea that men are superior to women and can behave however they please without consequence.

Transparency International’s 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index gave Morocco a score of 37, below the global average score of 43. On a 0 to 100 scale, the lower the number, the greater the perceived level of public sector corruption. The kingdom ranked in the middle, 90th out of 176 countries. For El Othmani, an important factor in the proliferation of corruption is the fact that, “those who perform their work the best they could receive minimum wages, while those who do not work enough receive wages above their effort,” he said. He indicated that wage justice is an important factor when discussing reform efforts. A study conducted by e-GRH’s recruitment platform ReKrute on job satisfaction found that 60 percent of workers in Morocco lack motivation in performing their jobs due to their salaries. El Othmani stressed that combating administrative and financial corruption is a gateway for the realization of social justice, because of its “great role in strengthening development and strengthening equity,” he said during the 3rd Inter-Parliamentary Forum on Social Justice. Minister of Justice, Mohamed Aujjar, indicated in late January that his department is working on 61 projects to battle corruption at the legislative and institutional levels. The Department of Justice is working on “adopting practical steps and approaches,” including the consolidation and restructuring of the departments responsible for financial crimes, both in terms of infrastructure and in the workforce. Meanwhile, El Othmani further indicated that private enterprises have “a major role in fighting corruption,” since it is crucial for the private sector to capitalize on social justice and development in order to develop sustainable economic models. To encourage private businesses to continue fighting injustices, the 2018 Financial Law has established several measures for their benefit, said the Head of Government. Speaking on the Finance Law, Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Boussaid, had previously indicated that the principal foundations of the law are based on four essential elements: support to the social sectors and industrialization, support public and private investment and SMEs, the implementation of regionalization and the reform of administration and governance, and the acceleration of the reform process.

Rabat – The worldwide transport firm, Uber, will suspend activity in Morocco beginning February 23. The company released its announcement on February 19 on the Uber Blog. Emphasizing its decision to suspend its activities in the country, Uber said that “Unfortunately, since our launch in Morocco, almost 3 years ago, we have not had any clarity about integrating applications like Uber into the existing transport model.” “That’s why we make the difficult decision to suspend our activity in Morocco,” read the statement. Recalling the achievements made by its services in the country since its launch, Uber said that “nearly 19,000 regular users travel with Uber, while approximately 300 drivers use our application.” However, “the current regulatory uncertainty does not allow us to provide a safe and reliable experience that meets the requirements of our customers, both drivers and passengers.” The company said that it will provide the 300 drivers for whom Uber’s application was a source of income with individual support “to overcome this difficult transition.” The company has expressed its desire to maintain their services in Morocco as the North African country “ranked among the 50 most innovative countries, according to Bloomberg Innovation Index.” The American firm added that the country deserves more developed regulation, which encourages innovation and competition. “Our partnership with COP22 in November 2016 enabled us to facilitate more than 10,000 hybrid and electric vehicle trips in less than a week. And we know that there are still many opportunities to put our technology at the service of mobility in Morocco.” In the past few months, taximen in the city of Casablanca have been staging protests against what they call the “unfair competition” of Uber and Careem. The taxi drivers of Morocco’s economic hub claim that they are victims of Uber and Careem and that they are determined to remove these transportation services from Morocco.

Rabat – Maroc Telecom Group total revenues dropped slightly in 2017 to MAD 34.96 billion, a 0.8 percent drop compared to the MAD 35.25 billion recorded in 2016, according to the Group’s 2017 annual results. At the end of 2017, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to MAD 17.16 billion, up 1.5 percent from MAD 16.91 billion in 2016. The group’s adjusted net income share reached more than MAD 5.87 billion in 2017, up 4.4 percent compared to the previous year. This increase is partly the result of resistance to VoIP mobile applications by some consumer segments in Morocco, and also due to the substantial growth in net income from international operations. International activities recorded a turnover of MAD 15.73 billion, up 2.7 percent over 2016. “The Group’s large capacity to control costs and its profitable investment policy have enabled it to improve its margins, particularly in African subsidiaries,” said the Chairman of the Group’s Executive Board, Abdeslam Ahizoune, explaining that the group has invested more than MAD 8 billion in sub-Saharan Africa to establish new digital networks and to introduce mobile technology innovations for consumers. Similarly, Maroc Telecom’s customer base grew by 5.5 percent last year, reaching 57 million customers. During 2017, the Group’s activities in Morocco generated sales of more than MAD 20.48 billion, down 3.6 percent compared to 2016. Maroc Telecom mobile services, which numbered 18.5 million customers at the end of December, rose by 0.9 percent last year, generating a turnover of MAD 13.33 billion, down 5.5 percent, compared to 2016. Fixed line service, on the other hand, recorded sustained growth of 5.2 percent reaching 1.7 million lines. Fixed line service and Internet connectivity achieved turnover revenue of MAD 8.96 billion, up 1.5 percent compared to 2016. “Maroc Telecom’s earnings growth demonstrates its resilience and agility in anticipating market developments,” said Ahizoune. Adjusted operating cash flow also increased by 3.1 percent, as well as capital expenditures of approximately 23 percent of revenues, excluding frequencies and licences. Maroc Telecom’s outlook for 2018 should see stable revenue and EBITDA.

Rabat – Algeria has once again canceled a major arms deal with Russia due to “the decline in oil prices,” according to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae. Al Massae reports that the Russian arms deal had intended to serve the Polisario Front interests, as the separatist group was eager to receive military equipment and weapons from Algeria to boost its military capacity. According to the newspaper, the decline in oil prices has had a significant impact on the budget allocated for armaments, including funds allocated for the Polisario. The decline in oil prices stymied plans for the separatists’ leader, Ibrahim Ghali, who intended to build a headquarters in the region’s buffer zone of the region and later relocate some of the Tindouf camps in the region. Since taking office as the head of the Polisario Front’s alleged Sahrawi Arab  Democratic Republic (SADR), Ghali started planning to shift the group’s headquarters.. However, Ghali’s plan did not please some members of the separatist group. According to Al Massae, members of the Polisario considers Ghali’s project a waste of public money. Moroccan news outlet Le360, reported that Algeria canceled a similar deal with Russia in December due to the decline in oil prices. Morocco’s eastern neighbor was expected to receive an important shipment of arms, many of which would have been subsequently delivered to the separatist group. One source with Le360 said that the separatist group rejected Algeria’s reasons for canceling the Russian arms deal.  Certain “hawks” within the Polisario alleged that Algeria had refused to renew its arms supplies with the separatist group due to the pressure from French President Emmanuel Macron during his recent visit to Algeria.   The Polisario accused Macron of intervening with Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to cancel the arms contract with the Polisario. On December 6, 2017, Macron visited Algeria in order to discuss the Western Sahara issue. On the eve of his visit, Macron told the Algerian daily El Khabar that he was in favor of opening up a “dialogue between Morocco and Algeria around the Sahara issue,” as “the resolution of this crisis represents a major challenge for the integration of the Arab Maghreb.”

Brussels  – Ministers of Agriculture and Fisheries of the 28 member States of the European Union, meeting within the EU Council Monday in Brussels, have given a mandate to the European Commission to negotiate a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, said European sources. The Council adopted this mandate unanimously by its members, an EU spokesperson told MAP. A recently published retrospective and prospective evaluation report of the Morocco-EU fisheries agreement recommended that the European Commission renew this agreement as it was “effective in achieving its objective of sustainable exploitation.” The report considered that the fisheries agreement has also achieved its goal of supporting the sustainable development of the sector. It also noted that the implementation of the sectoral support of the fisheries agreement is proceeding at a very satisfactory pace, recalling that the regions of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab and Laayoune-Boujour-Sakia El Hamra account for 66% of the total amount of sectoral support, approximately 37 million Euros. As regards the economic benefits for the EU, the report mentioned a good return on investment for the Union and emphasized its relevance to the needs of the EU. The report sent to the European Council and Parliament urged the renewal of the fisheries agreement, which will expire in July 2018, as it represents “an instrument for in-depth cooperation with Morocco, which is heavily involved in South-South cooperation” and to “complement its actions in favor of the sustainability of stocks within regional fisheries organizations”. The fisheries agreement between Morocco and the EU entered into force in 2014 for a 4-year period. It gives European vessels access to the Kingdom’s Atlantic fishing zone in exchange for a yearly financial contribution of 30 million Euros granted by the EU in addition to 10 million Euros as ship-owners contribution.

Rabat – World famous vlogger Nuseir Yassin or Nas Daily, shared five of his famous one-minute videos during his visit to Morocco, which celebrated the food, culture, and story of US’ first friend. Sponsored by Royal Air Maroc and Joby Camera accessories, Daily arrived in Morocco with five of his fans from Mongolia, New Zealand, Poland, India, and Syria. All travel expenses paid, Daily and his team embarked on a journey to discover Morocco. First thing on the list: food. In a Facebook post, Daily said that he almost never makes videos about food, but Moroccan food is “too royal” to overlook. From tajine to couscous,mint tea to snails, the vlogger dubbed the famous Moroccan dishes a “royal experience.” The video, entitled “The Most Royal Food,” has attracted more than 793 thousand likes and over 2 thousand comments. The comments on the video came from all around the world, sharing their experiences in Morocco. “Moroccans are the most welcoming and simple people I have ever met. I went to the desert, and people that live in houses made out of mud will offer you bread, sweet oil, and mint tea. They received me as if they were expecting someone. Kids were happy, just because someone would play football with them. The most simple and happy people I have ever met,” Joaquín Llamazares said. His post received over 600 likes. After their stomachs were filled, Daily and the other video producers explored Moroccan culture in Fez and the University of Al Quaraouiyine. “When you think of the oldest universities in the world, you think of Harvard, Cambridge, and Oxford. But all of these are wrong,” Yassin said, introducing to his worldwide fans to the oldest operating university in the world: Fez’s University of Al Quaraouiyine.
 In the Facebook video, viewed over 1.8 million times, Nas explained that “The university was founded by a Muslim woman 1300 years ago. It offers a library and a top-notch education, and its students were Jewish, Christian, and Muslim.” “This is surprising to you and to me because we don’t hear about this stuff anymore,” he said. The Palestinian-born vlogger added, “If we were once great, we can be great again.” Roaming in the city of Fez, Nas met Ahmed Ghareb, an unlicensed tourist guide. Nas recounts his story as a 41-year-old guide, who’s never been to school and got arrested four times for unlicensed work, but also as someone who worked with tourists so much that he learned seven languages, including English and German. Ghareb’s story attracted more than 650,000 views. Some of the commentators even asked Yassin where to find Ghareb, including Oran Aviv, who wrote in the comments section, “So how does one find Ahmed since you have convinced all of us to go visit Morocco!” Yassine responded saying, “Go to Fez, Morocco, and then go to the tannery (one of the oldest in the world) and look for a tour guide there! You’ll find Ahmed!” Nas and his team departed from Fez to Tangier to discuss “the US’ first friend…not someone you’d expect.” Nas later reported that “Morocco was the first country to recognize the US as an independent country and for the last 250 years the two countries have been trading together.” He visited the first US diplomatic house outside of the US, which is situated in Tangier. “Right now in the news, we hear about the US trying to limit, disparage, and even ban Muslim countries, but how quickly we forget that the first country to recognize the US is a Muslim one,” he said, concluding his visit to Morocco.

Here follows the full text of the message read out by the King’s advisor Abdellatif Menouni: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to send you this message at the opening of the third session of your Parliamentary Forum. Since I ascended the throne of my glorious ancestors, I have taken a keen interest in social justice issues and have, therefore, always granted your Forum my patronage. I commend you on choosing “the desired development model and the stakes of social and inter-regional justice” as the theme for this session. Your choice reflects a keen awareness of this topical subject which involves many interrelated issues that call for an innovative, holistic approach. The aim, ultimately, is to find practical, applicable solutions to citizens’ real and pressing problems and to achieve balanced, equitable development for all, in a serene, stable environment. As I have pointed out, what we need to do today is to solve problems and refrain from stopping at the diagnosis phase, however important it may be. Ladies and Gentlemen, In my last address to Parliament, I mentioned the factors hindering our development model and called for it to be revisited, using a collective approach. It has become clear that our model, which contributed to countless tangible economic and social achievements, is no longer able to respond to citizens’ growing demands and needs, nor can it reduce social and inter-regional disparities. It cannot, therefore, help achieve social justice. By calling for a review of that model, we are seeking more than just isolated sectoral reforms, or a reshuffle of certain economic projects and social programs. In fact, we are aiming for an integrated vision to shape not only a model for the achievement of the country’s political, economic and social development, but also a system for full-fledged central and local governance, including the legal system underpinning it. This vision should provide strong impetus for the new model, help overcome obstacles hindering its development and address weaknesses and gaps revealed by past experience. In this regard, all stakeholders should take into account the societal changes occurring in Morocco and, as a result, place the youth issue at the heart of the desired development model. Concurrently, we should ponder the most effective ways to improve the situation of our young people, who are our real asset and the country’s everlasting wealth. I firmly believe that the success of any vision hinges upon a change in mentalities. This is the only way to continue promoting the development the country is witnessing in various sectors and at the same time to set the stage for a new culture based on entrepreneurship, self-reliance and accountability. With the same resolve, we need to focus on reforming public administration. No meaningful economic and social development is possible if public service institutions do not discharge their mission properly in terms of serving the citizen and promoting investment, especially as regions, local governments, investment centers and other parties are playing a growing role in spurring development. At the same time, we should strive harder to engage the public and private sectors in innovative, effective partnerships to promote comprehensive development. I must insist, once again, that revisiting the Moroccan development model is an issue which concerns all Moroccans and all of the nation’s forces – individuals, institutions, political parties, trade unions, civil society and professional institutions. By the grace of the Almighty, Morocco has highly skilled human resources as well as solid, well-established institutions. This means we can embark, in a bold, responsible manner, on a constructive dialogue regarding a development model that satisfies all Moroccans. I want to tell all the stakeholders concerned that they are free to contribute objective ideas and proposals. There are neither limits nor conditions to this broad national debate, provided it is in keeping with the Constitution and with the nation’s immutable values enshrined in it. I expect this collective effort to bring about a profound shift in modes of thinking and in the way we address development issues and manage public affairs. It should signal a real break with practices in which time is wasted, development opportunities are lost, reforms impeded and creativity and innovation stifled. Let us keep in mind that Morocco went through difficult times in the past, as with the structural adjustment programs in the 1980s. Throughout its long history, and building on a sovereign will, our country has always managed to overcome obstacles and rise to the various development challenges facing it, thanks to national mobilization and to the sacrifices and combined efforts made by all Moroccans. Ladies and Gentlemen, By turning the spotlight on a key aspect of the question of social and inter-regional justice, this important forum has touched on an essential dimension of the development model we aspire to craft, namely the social and local dimension. As you know, achieving justice between groups and regions has always been at the heart of my political, economic and social policy. It is the ultimate goal of the initiatives and large-scale projects I have launched. The main objective is to improve the daily life of our citizens, in an environment characterized by justice, equity, human dignity and equal opportunity. These values and principles are enshrined in the Constitution. The aim is to help bring about a society committed to solidarity, in which all citizens enjoy security, freedom, dignity, equality and social justice – one in which rights and obligations go hand in hand. However grand ambitions may be, and whatever commitment one may show, the achievement of social and inter-regional justice remains a long, arduous process in all countries. It requires regular evaluation of outcomes and continuous updating of long-term objectives, as well as the development of implementation means and mechanisms. During its first session, the Forum sought to contribute to this objective through the adoption of the Rabat Declaration on Social Justice. In the same vein, the House of Councilors continued to be engaged in the preparation, on a participatory basis, of the Moroccan model for social and inter-regional justice. I am sure you realize that the achievement of social justice requires that a number of key factors be kept in mind. They need to be addressed in a serious, objective and innovative way, particularly the following: the problem of social and inter-regional disparities and the link with the constraints weighing on the management of tax and social security systems; the issue of universal access to basic social services and facilities, this being one of the pillars of social justice; the need to have institutions that are imbued with the values of solidarity and social justice and that contribute to solving citizens’ real problems and responding to their concerns and urgent demands. Ladies and Gentlemen, These are some of the challenges to be tackled in order to achieve social justice – a goal closely related to the development model used. We are aware of the close correlation between the promotion of development and the efficiency of the administrative system. I am sure you will address these and other issues in a wise, clear-sighted, objective and impartial manner, while being invariably guided by the desire to serve the common good. I hope this session of your Forum will lead to practical proposals and recommendations which will contribute to the formulation of an efficient, effective development model that fulfills the needs of Moroccans, achieves the desired social justice and helps us keep abreast of the changes unfolding in Morocco and the world at large. I wish your conference every success. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat- Several Moroccan associations cancelled their intended solidarity meeting in support of the controversial French scholar, Tariq Ramadan on Saturday. The associations announced their intended meeting for Ramadan, who is currently being prosecuted and jailed by French authorities for sexual assault and rape, earlier this week.  The solidarity meeting was expected to take place on Saturday, February 17 at 5 p.m. at the Mohammed VI Theater in Casablanca, after receiving approval from the borough of Roches Noires, represented by Islamist PJD member Nourredine Qarbal.  “We had all the documents and permissions but we were told that a stamp on a notice delivered by the Ministry of the Interior was missing,” Abderrahmane Lahlou, a member of one of the seven organizing associations, told the media outlet le360, while several people gathered in front of the theatre.  Hicham Abkari, director of the Mohammed VI theater in Casablanca, told the media outlet that the solidarity meeting was not banned.  “There is a missing document, and if all the pieces are provided, they can organize their event,” Abkari said from behind the theatre’s main gate. In line with the meeting’s spirit, the lawyer Abdellah Hatimi, from the Moroccan Association for the Defense of the Independence of Justice, said that “the French justice is not independent and Tariq Ramadan should not remand in custody since there is no evidence of wrongdoing.” Hatimi also pointed out that all members of the organizing committee, knew Ramadan closely as they welcomed him during his multiple stays in Morocco. Many prominent figures were expected to feature in the event, such as Abdelatif Hatimi, Jawad Iraqui, Abderrahmane Lahlou, and Abdelali Hamiedddin, a member of PJD political bureau, who had earlier said that he only accepted the invitation to “talk about the ideas” of the controversial scholar.  The announcement of the event sparked an online backlash, as many argued that it’s not appropriate to hold such a meeting in light of the allegations of sexual violence against Ramadan, who remains in French custody.  “We expressed our solidarity with Saad Lamjarred…with Tariq Ramadan…The two may be innocent (pending judgment)…but what does it mean to be in solidarity with a person accused of rape and sexual violence?…Solidarity with what? With sexual violence? With sexual frustration? How can we simply accept normalising rape and sexual violence?” wrote the Moroccan sociologist Sanaa Elaji.   “They all say they are Tariq Ramadan… How could we know if they are really Tariq Ramadan… Let us wait for the justice decision and see how many Tariq Ramadan are among us,” wrote a human rights activist, Fadwa Rajwani.  Ramadan, who is the grandson of the Muslim Brotherhood’s founder, was accused of rape by author and former Salafi Henda Ayari in 2012, on the sidelines of a congress of the Union of Islamic Organizations of France.  She was the first woman to attempt to bring Mr. Ramadan to justice, saying she was adamant to “carry this fight till the end, whatever the cost.” She was later joined by a woman named Christelle, who stepped forward claiming she was also raped by the Swiss scholar in a French hotel in 2009.  The 55-year-old theologian has firmly denied wrongdoing and accusations that he sexually assaulted the two women in 2009 and 2012, claiming that these allegations are part of a “campaign of lies launched by [his] adversaries.”

Rabat – After a few months after Saudi women received the right to attend mixed-gender sporting events and drive cars, women in Saudi Arabia have now been officially sanctioned to legally start their own businesses without the consent of male guardians.  The new policy marks a major step away from the strict guardianship system that has existed for decades, under which Saudi women who wish to do any government paperwork are subject to the guardianship of male members of their families – usually their father, husband, or brother. “Women can now launch their own businesses and benefit from [governmental] e-services without having to prove consent from a guardian,” the Ministry of Commerce and Investment said in a recent statement.  “No need for a guardian’s permission. Saudi women are free to start their own business freely,” Abdel Rahman Al Hussein, Ministry’s spokesman, said in a tweet.  The easing of restrictions on female entrepreneurship comes under the vast programme of reform that has been spurred by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. His “Vision 2030” plan for economic and social reforms has notably enabled women to carry out certain administrative procedures on their own. These reforms were largely welcomed both at home and abroad, but they are also being met by some discontent in ultra-conservative circles.

Rabat – Morocco ranks 58th in the 2017 Open Budget Index (OBI), a ranking within the larger Open Budget Survey published by International Budget Partnership (IBP).  The OBS aims to provide independent and comparative analysis of the core democratic institutions in 115 countries around the world. Three criteria are considered in this ranking: the availability of public budget information; opportunities for public participation in the budget process; and the role and effectiveness of the supervisory institutions.  The OBS accomplishes this by reviewing key documents and ranking each participant country on the availability, and corresponding transparency, of its national budget information. The documents collectively reveal government priorities and proposals, executed expenditures and actual revenue, and a final accounting of the government’s management of public resources for the fiscal year.  With 45 points out of 100, Morocco is considered the most transparent country in North Africa and the second in the MENA region after Jordan. The score also falls within the OBI average global range and matches the median score. In Africa, Morocco ranks seventh behind South Africa, Uganda, Senegal, Ghana, Namibia, and Kenya.  According to the OBS, fewer than 25 percent of participant countries provide complete budget information. The index notes that Morocco remains in the category of countries where budget transparency is still insufficient.

Rabat – The newly appointed “prime minister” of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Mohamed Ouali Akeik, was one of the seven perpetrators of terrorist attacks committed against Spanish citizens at the Phosboucraa site, Laayoune in October 1974. Polisario members’ attacks in Phosboucraa resulted in the death of soldiers and the kidnapping of Spanish citizens. Polisario’s attacks on the phosphate conveyor belts occurred in Laayoun between 1974 and 1976. The front attacked the conveyor belts in an attempt to stop phosphate mining. Polisario also engaged in violent attacks on Spanish fishing vessels, Moroccan army and French nationals. Polisario’s targeting of Spanish citizens continued during the 1980’s, and claimed the lives of 300 civilians, according to Spanish news website La Opinion de Tenerife, which gives a detailed account of the attacks and the names of the victims. After the Western Sahara’s return to Morocco’s sovereignty in 1975, the Polisario used the assassination of Spanish civilians as a tactic to put pressure against Spain and punish it for signing a fishing agreement with Morocco 1976, which tacitly recognized the Western Sahara as Moroccan territory. According to Spanish website El Confidencial, 300 Spanish citizens, most of whom fishermen working in the waters of Laayoun, lost their lives as a result of Polisario’s attacks. According to Moroccan news outlet Le360, the so-called prime minister of the self-proclaimed republic, who was just appointed to the position by the separatist leader Ibrahim Ghali on February 5, was involved in a series of serious alleged crimes, including the kidnappings of Spanish citizens working in the Phosboucraa site. At the time, the site was administered by Spain during its colonization era. These attacks caused the death of a Spanish soldier, Angel del Moral, two Spanish citizens, Canarian entrepreneur Antonio Martin and physician Jose Sastre Papiol. The series of attacks were ordered by Ghali, who was then the head of the “Sahrawi Army.” In October 2015, the Canary-based newspaper, La Provincia, published a report, which marked the anniversary of the terrorist attack against Spanish civilians. La Provincia also published a press report by journalist Diego Talavera. The report included press accounts about the perpetrators of the terrorist acts, including Ouali Akeik, laureate of the Churchill Military Academy in Algiers. La Provincia’s reports aimed at determining both the exact circumstances of the attack and the release of the seven alleged terrorists, who were held in detention at a Las Palmas prison in October and November of 1975. The author of the report said that the seven members of the Polisario “were freed in the framework of the exchange of detainees, between the Spanish authorities in the Sahara and the Polisario front.” Le360 added that the seven Polisario members were handed back by Colonel Diego Aguirre on November 21, 1975, to Ibrahim Ghali and Mahfoud Ali Beiba, on the Algerian border with the Moroccan Sahara. In January, Canarian Association of Terrorism Victims (Acavite) received King Felipe VI of Spain to brief him about the history of attacks committed by the separatist group during Spain’s colonization. Polisario’s guerrilla attacks resumed throughout the 70s. Acavite president, Lucia Jimenez, also discussed with the King the situation of widows and orphans in the Canary Islands as a result of Polisario’s guerrilla attacks.

Rabat – An Iranian commercial plane crashed on Sunday, February 18, in a mountainous region of southern Iran, claiming the life of all the 66 people on board, Iran’s state media reported.  “After searches in the area, unfortunately, we were informed that the plane crashed. Unfortunately, all our dear ones lost their lives in this incident,” Mohammad Tabatabai, public relations director for Aseman Airlines, told state broadcaster IRIB. The Aseman Airlines flight, which carried 60 passengers, including one child, and six crew members, disappeared from radar screens about 50 minutes after taking off from Mehrabad Airport in Tehran to the southern Iranian city of Yasuj, some 780 kilometers south of the Iranian capital.   Authorities said that rescue helicopters struggled to land in the crash site in the Zagros Mountain because of “heavy fog and emergency workers were trying to reach the area by land.”  The Aseman Airlines ATR-72, is a twin-engine turboprop used for short-distance regional flying, but operates also in international routes.  Following the deadly incident, Iran lambasted international sanctions that have long prevented it from buying new aircraft or spare parts from the West as its commercial passenger aircraft fleet has aged, causing regular air accidents in the past decades.

Rabat – Amidst heavy criticisms targeting Trump’s stance on gun control, the President, in a recent tweet following a high school shooting that claimed 17 lives, has blamed the FBI for not properly following up on warnings regarding Nikolas Cruz’s deviant and violence-prone behavior, therefore leading to the Wednesday school shooting. Trump has linked the Federal Bureau’s “unforgivable” missteps to Russia investigation, saying that FBI failed to properly follow up on leads regarding the Florida shooter’s intentions because the bureau was allegedly too busy trying to prove a Russian collusion that the President says does not exist. “Very sad that the FBI missed all the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They’re spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign—there is no collusion,” Trump tweeted, adding that the FBI should “get back to basics and make us all proud.” On Saturday this week a massive rally in Florida marked the attendance of survivors of the Florida school shooting, together with parents and numerous local politicians. The furious crowd, visibly angered by the death toll—the Florida shooting is the deadliest U.S school shooting since 2012—as well as the president’s stance on gun restrictions, chanted “shame on you” as they attacked politicians and law makers said to have links with the NRA (National Rifle Association), the country’s most powerful lobby that supports lax laws on gun control and advocates for gun rights. The crowd, singling Trump out as one of the politicians receiving huge financial support from the NRA, called for tougher restrictions on guns, with Emma Gonzalez,  a senior at Florida high school, telling the press that gun control is a “matter of life and death”, and “not a political question.” And although Trump’s FBI criticism may easily be said to be aimed at undermining the heavy criticism targeting the president’s Russia and NRA linkages, there seems to be, this time, legitimate grounds to Trump’s scathing FBI statements. The Bureau has recently admitted to have not taken appropriate actions that could have prevented the Florida shooting, saying that they had not properly followed up about Nikolas Cruz when one of his relatives contacted the Bureau on January 5 to inform about his “gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” But the January 5 call was but a tip of the ice berg in the long series of warnings that both the Federal Bureau and the local police received from numerous sources regarding Cruz’s deviant behavior as well as his inclination to violence and self-harm. According to CNN, Cruz’s stepmother, who died last year, used to the call local police on a regular basis to complain about Cruz’s “threats, self-harming, and violence-prone behaviors.” An unidentified informant is also said to have contacted authorities regarding inappropriate comments and YouTube videos attributed to Nikolas Cruz.

Rabat – A joint committee of Moroccan and Spanish fishery experts are exploring partnership and investment opportunities in the southern Moroccan city of Dakhla. The four-day visit kicked off on February 15. The visit is an opportunity to “support and defend common interests in the framework of the Fisheries Agreement between Morocco and the European Union (EU),” Lamine Hormatallah, the southern provinces regional president of the General Confederation of Moroccan Entreprises (CGEM) told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). He added that the committee is planning another meeting to examine developments in the sea and fisheries activities and the potential cooperation between the two parties with the aim of completing the project of the renewal of the agreement and to address the challenges posed. Hormatallah has also underscored the importance of this meeting and the role of the marine fisheries sector as an essential lever for development in the southern provinces. The Moroccan-Spanish joint delegation visited an industrial unit for freezing and packing fish in Dakhla, where they learned how the plant works and the processing of sea products. A meeting was also held at the Regional Investment Center in the city of Dakhla, attended by economic operators from the region. During this meeting, the members of the delegation were informed of the potential for sea investments carried out by Morocco to develop the region, according to MAP. The fisheries ties between Morocco and the European Union date back to 1988. The four-year fishing agreement provided annual permits without restriction, according to the European Union. Since then partnerships between the two parties have strengthened to involve protocols from different fields, including trade activities. According to the director of Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF), Willy Fature, the EU-Morocco fisheries partnership is an important collaboration. Quoted by the Brussels-based news outlet, Europa Reporter;  Fature said that “the fisheries agreement is an important mechanisms for voicing and mainstreaming.” The  HRWF president added that Sahrawi people “have also benefited from the Fisheries Agreement between the EU and Morocco.” Fature, who visited the fisheries port in the city of Dakhla said that “there were hundreds of people, mainly women, working there in the factory,” adding that “fisheries are really a main source of employment for Morocco.” The EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement is due for a renewal next July. Both Morocco and EU are ambitious to renew the agreement. In January, Morocco’s Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture held talks in Brussels with the European Commissioner for Environment, Karmenu Vella, about the importance of the agreement. The EU and Moroccan officials have both agreed that the agreement is “essential for both parties.” However, Morocco-EU agreement has long been denounced by Polisario, a separatist group from the southern Moroccan provinces. The front has been urging the European Union to compensate the Polisario for the “exploitation” of natural resources in Western Sahara without its permission.   The renewal of the agreement, however, is welcomed by many states, including Spain and Denmark. On January 15, the Danish government informed its Parliament that it will accept the European Commission’s proposal to renegotiate the fisheries agreement with Morocco. The legal advisor of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), Melchior Wathelet, said in a January legal opinion issued on Wednesday that the Fisheries Agreement concluded between the EU and Morocco was “invalid” because “it applies to Western Sahara and its adjacent waters.” The advisor’s opinion has been strongly denounced by Moroccan and Spanish professional Fishermen. To respond to Melchior’s remarks, the fishermen issued a joint statement, saying that the adviser’s opinion “this deal guarantees the respect of international law and human rights; and since the opinion of the general council is not binding, we hope that EU Justice Court will adopt a position in support of the deal.” “Moroccan and Spanish fishermen are surprised by the political motivations of this advisor,” their communiqué added. They also called on the UE to favor the renewal of the fisheries deal, which will expire later this year, in July. They urged the UE representatives to guarantee and “preserve the atmosphere of friendly and beneficial relations” that have so far characterized the said deal.

Rabat – Here is a look at the major news that made headlines in Moroccan newspapers. This round-up includes business, political, cultural and social news covered by Moroccan newspapers this week. The big headline in national newspapers was the arrest of three “dangerous” individuals affiliated with the Islamic-State (ISIS), including a member of the separatist Polisario Front. The suspects, who were caught on Thursday, February 15, were plotting to undermine Morocco’s security through terrorist attacks they planned to carry out in several major cities.  The leader of the cell is a member of the separatist Polisario group, according to Assabah. The newspaper reported on February 16th that Morocco’s Counter-Terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) managed to seize electronic devices and an Identity card of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), from the house of the leader of the suspected three-ISIS related cell. The search operation also led to the seizure of a military uniform and flag connected to the Polisario. Abdellatif Hammouchi, the head of Morocco’s Directorate of National Security (DGSN,) warned security officials, heads of districts, and heads of the judicial police about using phone applications that he described as “dangerous.” These applications are using advanced techniques, which are able to make fake phone calls using numbers registered in the victim’s devices. The applications are also able to mimic the person’s voice, reported Al Massae on February 16. According to Al Massae newspaper, the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) is planning to build ten new surveillance posts on the Moroccan-Algerian border, in order to reinforce security in Morocco’s eastern provinces. The border surveillance centers with Algeria are aimed at countering smuggling rings, as well as preventing infiltration of terrorist elements in the region. Assabah is reporting that 1700 Saudi nationals were victims of alleged sextortion and cybercrime activities committed by Moroccan citizens in 2017. The newspaper said that Saudi nationals, including women, were victims of blackmail by Moroccan criminal bands operating in two unidentified cities. The alleged sextortion cases have, according to the paper, led to severe depression for eight of the Saudi nationals who fell victim to the blackmail.  The same paper reported that Morocco has managed to dismantle a baby-smuggling ring, which was operating in Khouribga, a city in the Beni-Mellal region. The ring was alleged to have been pressuring mothers of newborns to sell their babies, forcing them to sign contracts to give up their children.  The national newspapers have also reported on Jacob Zuma’s resignations, which made the headlines nationally and internationally on Wednesday night. Zuma was replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa who took office on Thursday after being voted in by the National African Congress. A 13-year old middle school boy from Benguerir, a city near Marrakech, attempted to commit suicide as a result of the “Blue Whale Challenge,” an infamous social media craze that incites its users to commit suicide, reported Al Ahdath Al Maghribia on February 12. This dangerous game has allegedly already caused the death of two Moroccan children, reported Assabah in December 2017. Assabah reported in its December 29th issue that the first victim of the game was an 8-year old boy from Hay Mohammadi, Casablanca. The second tragic account occurred on Thursday, December 28 in Casablanca’s Douar Rhamna. The victim was a 12-year old girl.  The same newspaper reported this weekend that another girl has joined the list of young Moroccans who have been entrapped by the “Blue Whale Challenge.” The new victim is a high school student from Bengurir. The child’s school’s director discovered that the girl was participating in the deadly challenge after he noticed the whale’s drawing on her hand. The director then called the student’s parents, advising them to take her to medical experts. According to Akhbar Al Yaoum’s weekend edition, Morocco’s stores of gold has remained stagnant for decades. Morocco’s total value is estimated at USD 910 million. Morocco’s reserves are 22 tons of pure gold. The North African country, according to Assabah, is ranked 11th in the Arab world in total gold holdings, while it is ranked as the 59th globally. Al Akhbar reported this weekend that a court in Sale has sentenced three young defendants from the city of Essaouira to seven years in prison. The defendants were involved in terrorism-related crimes. Al Ahdath al Maghribia reported that the General Directorate of National Security opened an investigation to arrest suspects of a fraud network which was active in in several cities in Morocco. The investigation was opened after the arrest of one of the network’s members by police authorities in Tetouan.

Rabat – “Associations pay a 30 percent tax rate, while private schools pay only 17 percent,” said Mustafa El Khalfi, the minister in charge of relations with parliament and civil society, on Friday. “The tax system deals with associations ‘unfairly,’” said El Khalfi, pointing out the enterprises’ benefits from higher tax reduction than that offered to NGOs. “The civil society will not be able to play an effective role in the field of health and education, as long as the associations do not benefit from support,” he said, as reported by Telquel Arabi . For the minister, the current tax and financial system is “unfair to associations” because it “considers entrepreneurship better than associations.” He indicated that the possibilities offered to associations are limited. “Moroccans can invest in private education and benefit from a tax reduction of up to half,” he said. He also gave the example of press contractors. “They can benefit from a reduction of up to 45 percent, while workers in literacy programs do not benefit from any tax-free reduction, zero percent,” he said. The government spokesman stressed that the reform of the civil society system, is “conditional on the reform of the tax system.” Speaking on the 2018 Fiance Bill, Minister of Finance Mohamed Boussaid said that Morocco will take further tax measures for the promotion of private investments. In this sense, Boussaid presented a number of tax measures for companies, whichinclude taking the first step in the progressive taxation of companies (SI), which will help fuel the monetary capacity of SMEs. In addition to implementing taxation measures relating to seawater desalination buildings and the raising of marine living beings , other measures intervene at the level of the value-added tax (VAT). This includes the recognition of the tax neutrality of participatory products, the promotion of youth employment up to a maximum of MAD 10,000 for every ten employees (up from the current limit of five employees), andexemption from the income tax (IR). Boussaid also discussed regionalization measures, as the government will increase the SI and regions RI from 3 to 4 percent, in addition to the general budget appropriations, bringing total support to MAD 7 billion.

Rabat – A Sale court has sentenced three Essaouira terrorists who planned  an attack on the Gnaoua World Music Festival to seven years in prison. The Criminal Chamber of First Instance in charge of terrorism cases sentenced the three jihadists to seven years in prison on Thursday, as reported by the daily Al Akhbar in its weekend edition. The court sentenced the first defendant to three years in prison, while the other two were sentenced to two years each. The three terrorists were arrested in June 2017 by the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ). They were planning terrorist attacks on the city’s world-renowned Gnaoua festival, in addition to the Jewish cemeteries in the city. When the ISIS-affiliated cell was dismantled, the BCIJ seized knives and computer equipment at the jihadists’ homes. The Central Bureau also found texts in which the three terrorists pledged allegiance to the leader of the Daesh terrorist organization, Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. Since 2002, the BCIJ has dismantled 167 cells, including 46 affiliated to ISIS; 2,963 suspected terrorists, 277 of whom already had criminal records, have been arrested and referred to the judiciary courts.

Rabat – “Sahara: What does Algeria want?” asked, bewildered and confused by Algeria’s “structural hostility towards Morocco”, a reporter at Le 360. The sentiments of confusion and exasperation expressed in said report are, considering the latest updates in the Western Sahara question, evident in Algeria’s clear position, which seems to be oriented towards undermining any prospects of a viable political solution. Algeria, contrary to its official title at the negotiation table, is anything but an “observer”. On Thursday this week, as part of the prerogatives delegated to him by the UN Secretary-General, Horst Kohler, the UN’s Secretary General’s personal envoy for the Western Sahara question, met, in Berlin, with AbdelKader Messahel, Algeria’s foreign affairs minister. Although the UN speaks in its guidelines of a peaceful and viable political solution at the convenience of both parties involved, Algérie Presse Service, a pro-government Algerian francophone news outlet, said: “During his meeting with the UN Secretary General’s personal envoy, Mr. Messahel stressed that the Western Sahara Question ‘is a matter of decolonization whose resolution should foreground the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to exercise their self-determination.’” This self-congratulatory and illusory message, given that the same outlet, on January 27, called Western Sahara “the last African colony” and Morocco “a colonial occupier”, should come as no surprise: Algeria is by no means an observer state, it has an agenda of its own which, by and large, is the primary source of the political stalemate to which UN negotiations have so far led. Algerian foreign policy’s professed hostility towards Morocco has been a fait accompli for some decades now, and until Algiers truly embraces the “observer” or “facilitator” position that it should adopt, the stalemate is yet to continue, exacerbated and fed by illusive and self-delusional foreign policies of self-interested states masquerading as observers and so-called “friends” of an inexistent oppression. So indeed: What does Algeria want?

Rabat – Prominent Islamic Scholar Tariq Ramadan was hospitalized on Friday night for treatment of his multiple sclerosis, according to the support committee working on behalf of the Swiss scholar. The scholar has been held in custody since January 31 after two women separately accused him of rape and sexual assault. The 55-year-old has firmly denied the accusations against him. Ramadan said that the claims against him are part of a “campaign of lies launched by his adversaries.” Ramadan is suffering from multiple sclerosis and has appealed the decision by French authorities to keep him in custody. He is being held as “part of a preliminary inquiry” into the allegations against him. “The Paris Court of Appeals ordered an independent medical report on his state of health and postponed their decision to February 22,” according to Swissinfo. Ramadan has been accused of rape by author and former Salafi Henda Ayari, who accused him of raping her in 2012 when both attended a congress of the Union of Islamic Organizations of France. Shortly thereafter, another woman claimed she was raped by the Swiss scholar in a French hotel in 2009.

Rabat – Expectations are high for Morocco. The North African country has vowed to build seven new stadiums if selected to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Morocco is planning to build six 40,000-seat stadiums, in addition to a seventh 100,000-seat stadium in Casablanca. The new stadiums will be in addition to five stadiums already in existence in the country. Two others are now being built in Tetouan and Oujda. Rachid Talbi Alami, Morocco’s Minister of Sports and Youth, told Moroccan news outlet Media24 that the construction of the stadiums and the renovation of older existing ones will cost between USD 800 million and one billion. Talbi told the press in a press conference earlier this month that Morocco selected 12 cities to host the enormous tournament. The 12 cities chosen to host the international tournament are Casablanca, Marrakech, Tetouan, Nador, Meknes, El Jadida, Fez, Oujda, Tangier, Agadir, Rabat and Ouarzazate. “Morocco has already embarked on a vast and ambitious investment program in the areas of infrastructure and hotel industry that meets the needs of the local population in the first place,” said Elalamy. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017. Ahmed claimed, “Morocco has all the assets to organize a major world event, and it would be an honor for all of Africa if Morocco wins the right to host the 2026 World Cup.”

Rabat – The Royal Armed Forces (FAR) have announced plans to build ten new surveillance posts on the Moroccan-Algerian border in order to reinforce security in the kingdom’s eastern provinces.  The border surveillance centers along the frontier with Algeria are designed to counter several threats, including drug smuggling rings, migrant traffickers, as well as to prevent infiltration by terrorist elements in the region, according to Moroccan newspaper Al Massae. The new centers will be equipped with sophisticated ground and air surveillance equipment that will include 33 border surveillance cameras that will be operational around the clock, seven days a week. In October 2017, Algeria announced the construction of a border wall along the Moroccan-Algerian border, intended to fight contraband smuggling and trafficking as well as to strengthen the country’s international security. The announcement was made only a few days after Morocco announced its intention to launch its first reconnaissance satellite. Algeria’s is also building new monitoring posts along the shared border region between the two countries, including posts near the Moroccan cities of Oujda, Berkane, Taourirt and Jerada. Morocco’s new border observation centers will be operational next April, allowing Morocco to increase the level and quality of internal security and border surveillance, added Al Massae.

Washington D.C. – The shooting that took place on Wednesday in Florida, which claimed the lives of 17 innocent children, is yet another tragedy highlighting the dangers of gun ownership to the safety of Americans. T he massacre, another in the series of gruesome mass school shootings that have swept the United States in recent years, raises the question of who or what is the greatest enemy of America and Americans peace and way of life? Is it immigrants and terrorists who come from abroad or is it guns which are the real threat to America? The enemy that threatens the national security of the United States and the individual security of American citizens does not come from outside, as many claim, but comes from within U.S. society itself. In just the first 6 weeks of 2018, there have been 18 mass shootings killing scores of people and shattering countless families. In 2017, 346 mass shootings, including the Las Vegas shooting which claimed the lives of 48 innocent people and left 200 others injured, shook the United States. Yet Republican lawmakers refuse to discuss that, for the wellbeing of their constituents and their fellow citizens is seemingly of little concern to them. Instead, what seems to matter most for them is their careers and their prospects for reelection. And for them to be reelected, they need the funding of special interest groups, such as the National Rifle Association, which contributed $5.9 million to Republican candidates in the 2016 election cycle, according to Politico. Ironically, after every mass shooting, American lawmakers express their sorrow and sympathy for the families of the victims and send their prayers to them. Following Wednesday’s tragedy many lawmakers from the Republican party, who receive lavish funding from the gun ownership lobby, expressed their sympathy towards the families of the victims, but shied away from opening the debate over gun control. But is that what American taxpayers need from their elected officials? Are their prayers enough to avoid more deadly mass shootings in the future? Will these prayers prevent more violent criminals from owning guns and cowardly killing innocent people? American President Donald Trump’s Tweets following the shooting differed not at all from the rhetoric adopted by most members of the Republican party following every human tragedy. He simply expressed his sympathy towards the families of the victims, but pledged nothing at all to stop this lunacy. Yet, one can imagine what might have been the President’s message had the perpetrator of the vicious attack been a Muslim or a recent immigrant. The President would have quickly labelled it as a terrorist attack and said that the attack vindicates his Muslim bans and his tough stance on immigration. But because the author of the attack – a 19-year old white teenager with alleged white supremacist sympathies – does not fit the common narrative about international terrorism, the American President limited himself to expressing sympathy towards the families of the victims. A staunch supporter of gun ownership, the US President, like most members of his party, has neither the courage nor the willingness to address the call for reasonable gun control measures. Addressing this question does not appeal to their electoral bases nor will it advantage them in the elections. Opening a real debate over the need to reform gun ownership in the country would be anathema to the National Rifle Association, which provides significant financial support to many members of both houses of Congress. Some of the responsibility for the continuing shooting tragedies is also borne by the American media. While watching CNN on Wednesday night, I was shocked and perturbed when Anderson Cooper said we will not reveal the identity of the attacker, on the grounds that he does not want to give him publicity. As a regular viewer of his show, I remember how quick he has been to reveal the identity of perpetrators of mass shootings with Arab or Muslim-sounding names. This double standard used by American media and US politicians when reporting or talking about mass shootings depending on the origin and religious persuasion of the attacker sends the wrong message and does not help Americans feel safe in their communities, their schools, their workplaces, their public transportation, their places of worship, etc. This double standard not only fails to steer the debate in the right direction to address the causes and the easy access to guns, but serves as more fear-mongering among the American public and creating the illusion, not supported by any statistics, that the real enemy that threatens their safety and wellbeing is the “immigrant,” rather than a neighbor or class-mate with unfettered access to the deadliest firearms. It is ironic that a young person under 21 cannot buy a beer but can easily buy a deadly gun such as the one used in the Florida terrorist attack. In addressing or even discussing Wednesday’s massacre of innocent school children, Americans must be honest with themselves and define the action for what it is. What happened was an act of domestic terrorism. The perpetrator had a premeditated plan to terrorize innocent people and kill as many possible. For America to put an end to these repeated tragedies that shatter many lives and break the dreams and plans of many innocent people, it needs to engage in an honest and candid debate. The real debate must center around gun control and American politicians and the media must tell the American people the truth. The American people need to know the truth. The facts are that the ownership of firearms causes results in several thousand innocent lives lost every year. According to statistics provided by the State Department, less than 300 people died as a result of terrorist acts on US soil between 2002 and 2015. Meanwhile, over 11,000 people lose their lives every year as result of mass shootings and gun-related attacks. These figures show that no matter how many billions the U.S. government spends to fight terrorism, it will not make Americans safer as long as politicians do not have the courage to face the real debate head-on. The reason for this failure to provide security to American taxpayers is the persistence of a false debate and a false “diagnosis” of the problem that continues to emphasize that the real threat facing Americans is incoming immigrants, especially those from Muslim-majority countries. Americans would be much safer if their politicians had the courage to admit that the real enemies of the U.S. do not come from outside but from within. But judging by the ongoing debate surrounding the reform of the immigration system, the rhetoric used by the current American administration and its obsession with curbing immigrations from Muslim-majority countries, there seems to be no sign that America is ready to embark on the right debate, a course that will save many innocent lives in the future. Instead it seems that the same stigmatization of Muslims will continue to be the dominant subject regarding the safety and security of the American people. A report prepared by the Department of Homeland Security in January singled out Sunni Muslim immigrants as being “at risk” of engaging in terrorist attacks and called on the American government to impose “continuous surveillance” and vetting on Muslim immigrants living in the United States. The document misleadingly suggests that the propensity to violence of Sunni Muslim immigrants is the biggest threat facing America. Meanwhile, all the available statistics prove that the threat facing Americans every day is not “Islamic terrorism” but lax American laws that impose little or no restriction on gun ownership. Americans would be better served and better off if their politicians enacted laws that imposed more severe restrictions on guns. However, it appears that Republicans are unable or unwilling to open a real debate about gun control, for they know this kind of debate would not be appealing to their electoral bases, which cling to the right to gun ownership without hindrance. It is simply more availing to stigmatize immigrants and demonize Muslims. As long as long as American politicians prefer to twist the facts to cater to their bases rather than focusing on the real threats facing the country, it is delusional to think that a real debate on arms control will take place anytime soon, and mass shootings will continue to claim innocent lives. Meanwhile, one thing is sure, immigrants and Muslims, in particular, are not the greatest threat to America’s way of life.  Rather, what threatens the U.S. social fabric and its future is the greed and selfishness of a category of politicians whose only concern is to achieve their own short-term goals no matter how detrimental for the common good of all Americans.

Rabat – A recent investigative report, conducted by the Canadian media TVA, revealed that three Canadian nationals who were busted two years ago for importing 95 kg of cocaine into Australia were only pawns in a vast operation involving at least 12 people in Quebec, Morocco, Mexico, and Peru. The Australian Border Force arrested the Quebecers Isabelle Lagace and Mélina Roberge along with another man from Quebec, André Tamine, on board a cruise liner headed from England to Australia. Lagace and Roberge gained international notoriety chronicling their seven-week luxury cruise vacation on Instagram. Authorities said they were arrested when the ship finally docked in Sydney in August 2016, calling the 95-kilo bust Australia’s biggest-ever seizure of narcotics carried by passengers of a cruise ship or airline.  Lagace was sentenced to seven and half years behind bars, while Roberge and Tamine will stand trial on February 26 in Sydney.  According to media reports, the “three Quebecers are believed to be nothing but simple pawns in an alleged conspiracy.” The investigation found that a 48-year-old businessman was planning to seduce Roberge, 24 years his junior, after he told her about a trip to Australia that could put an end to her financial difficulties and fund her dream: plastic surgery. According to the authorities, the businessman denied any link to the import of cocaine into Australia The Australian police are also investigating a 31-year-old French citizen, who met Roberge and Lagacé in Casablanca, where he operates a small computer company also based in Nice and Montreal.  Authorities said that both Roberge and Lagace are believed to have returned from this trip with at least EUR 8000.

Printed by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the report added that 6.8 percent of Moroccan-owned companies are located in Turin, the capital city of Piedmont in northern Italy. These companies are mainly operating in the construction and trade activities. Chinese investors residing in Italy trail the Moroccan community with 52,000 new firms.

Rabat – The leader of the ISIS-terror cell busted by Morocco’s Counter-terrorism Bureau (BCIJ) on Thursday, February 15, is suspected of having ties with the separatist Polisario Front. Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported on Friday that the defendant has been involved in separatist activities in the Tindouf camps. According to the newspaper, the Polisario-linked suspect was coordinating with separatist members of the front and members of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) to undermine Morocco’s security through terrorist plots. Citing an unidentified source from the Central Office for Judicial Research, which is affiliated to the General Directorate for International Security, Assabah added that the BCIJ seized electronic devices and an identity card of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), from the house of the leader of the suspected three-ISIS related cell. The search operation also allowed the seizure of a military uniform and a flag of the separatist group, Polisario. Preliminary investigations carried out by BCIJ showcase that the three defendants were plotting to commit terrorist operations in several Moroccan cities, touristic hubs, and security headquarters. The suspects were operating in the cities of Laayoune, Sale, and Marrakech and have pledged allegiance to the ISIS caliphate. When the BCIJ members accessed the devices seized from the houses of the suspects, they found out that the defendants were visiting websites affiliated to the ISIS groups. The suspects were also frequenting websites that provide tutorials on how to make homemade explosives and bombs. The suspects told investigators that they learned how to make explosives and were planning to attack sensitive places in the country to kill as many people as possible. In April 2017, BCIJ Head Abdelhak Khiam told the press that more than 100 members of the Polisario Front have joined ISIS. “Terrorist organizations and criminal networks travel all along the Sahel region,” blaming Algeria for the lack of security cooperation that would help to end this issue. Khiam echoed his remarks in an interview with the French-based newspaper Le Monde earlier this month. “The problem is the absence of collaboration with the Algerians and the existence of an area controlled by a terrorist group,” he said, referring to the Polisario Front. Khiam said that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is still controlling southern Algeria and Mali, which is a threat to Morocco and the entire region. According to the BCIJ head, “even if there are differences [between the two organizations], they defend the same ideology.”

Rabat- The Criminal Chamber at the Court of Appeal in Rabat acquitted former Moroccan Guantanamo detainee Younes Chekkouri on Thursday. In May 2017, the Court’s First Trial Chamber had sentenced Chekkouri to five years in prison for “setting up a criminal gang and undermining the internal security of the State.” Moroccan authorities had incarcerated Chekkouri on conspiracy charges when he arrived in Morocco in September 2015 following his release from the U.S. military detention facility in Cuba, where he had been detained for nearly 14 years. Following his preliminary hearing, the investigating judge in charge of terrorism cases ordered his prosecution while allowing him to be free on bail in response to a motion from his defense. Pakistani security officers arrested Chekkouri in December 2001, as he attempted to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border with other suspected al-Qaida fighters. He was later turned over to U.S. forces. He previously told the Associated Press that he attempted to cross to Afghanistan to continue his study of Sufism, which he had been pursuing in various countries across the Islamic world, including Sudan, Yemen, and Syria.

Rabat- The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has called on King Mohammed VI immediate intervention to prevent the “Judaization of Jerusalem” operation. The news was confirmed by Palestinian Shehab News Agency, which is affiliated with the Hamad movement.  “We call on King Mohammed VI, Chairman of the Al Quds Committee, to intervene immediately and promptly to prevent the permanent violations of the enemy government, which seeks to Judaize Jerusalem and change its demographic and urban characteristics,” said a statement by Hamas. Hamas message to King Mohammed VI came a few months after Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the area. Trump’s recognition was massively condemned by Arab and Western countries alike. Leaders, including King Mohammed VI, denounced the US decision, considering it as a threat to peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel. The monarch sent a letter to the US President on the eve of Trump’s decision (December 5), stressing how such decision would undermine peace negotiations over the region. The King also sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in which he expressed his deep concern over Trump’s decision, emphasizing that such an action would end peace negotiations between the two states. Despite the Arab and Western condemnation, Trump is standing firm on his decision. On February 11, Trump told the Israeli newspaper, Israel Hayom. Reaffirming his decision on Jerusalem, Trump told the Israeli newspaper that ‘by taking Jerusalem off the table I wanted to make it clear that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and as for specific boundaries, I would support what both sides agree to.’

Rabat – The sovereign nation of Morocco will never accept being reduced to the same level of militant separatist groups like the Polisario Front.  This is, according to Moroccan political observer El Moussaoui El Ajlaoui, “an important point that the UNSG’s Personal Envoy, Horst Kohler, failed to take into account.” Giving Morocco and the rebel group on the same level, and giving the Polisario Front the same weight that Morocco carries in the international community affords the separatist group recognition it does not deserve, El Ajlaoui told Morocco World News on Wednesday. While talks mediated by Kohler are presently being held in Berlin regarding the conflict, El Ajlaoui believes that “politically, Morocco is not seeing any progress.” Representatives from both Mauritania and the Polisario separatist group already met with Kohler, while Algeria is likely to be brought in next, as Kohler was expected to receive the Algerian minister of foreign affairs, Abdelkader Messahel on Thursday, February 15, according to Algeria’s news agency APS. However, Morocco- a main party in the conflict- has been reluctant to attend the Berlin negotiations with the Polisario, as the separatist front has been carrying out illegal military maneuvers in the region over the past few months. El Ajlaoui argues that Morocco ought to be in charge of setting rules of negotiations for issues that fall within its national jurisdiction, and that Kohler’s choice to hold indirect negotiations in Berlin is fundamentally unjust. After he was appointed as the UNSG’s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, “Kohler showed his willingness to end the conflict. King Mohammed VI received him in Rabat after his appointment, which proved that Morocco does not have any problems with the current Personal Envoy of the UN nor with the former ones.” Morocco, however, does not like the approaches adopted within the UN.” Morocco decodes this strategy as a danger that would affect its sovereignty over the territory, as the country considers the only solution to solve the Western Sahara conflict to be the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. Referring to Kohler’s strategy to involve the African Union and the European Union in the conflict, El Ajlaoui said that Morocco could never accept this strategy, as the North African country sees the United Nations as the only body with the legitimacy to pass judgment on the territory. Kohler’s strategy was not looked upon favorably by El Ajlaoui, who explained this move as a mean to apply pressure on Morocco, rather than being a measure to find a solution to the conflict. Ajlaoui told MWN that the idea of holding negotiations in the city of Berlin is not productive, and argued that “it is time for the UNSG’s Personal Envoy to make his tour” of the pertinent region itself. Therefore, on February 14, Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that Morocco has sent an official invitation to Kohler, who will likely arrive in Morocco on Friday. The Moroccan government, however, did not make any official statement on its official news agency about any such invitation to Kohler. The idea of indirect negotiations with the separatist front has been unwelcomed by several Moroccan political analysts, including Reda El Fellah. Mohamed Chtatou, a Moroccan political analyst and university professor believes that the idea of indirect negotiations with Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania is “a joke.” This idea has been “continuously repeated, but it is leading to a dead-end,” according to professor Chtatou. He argues the Polisario must be forced to negotiate with Morocco directly on the basis of the Autonomy Plan, which is “the one and only” viable means of ending the conflict in Western Sahara. While the separatist front is eagerly seeking independence, Morocco considers its Autonomy Plan as the only solution to the conflict. Several European and African countries, lauded Morocco’s plan submitted to the UN in 2007, describing it as the serious and credible basis for a negotiated solution to the Sahara issue. Subsequently, Morocco has long shown its willingness to negotiate a political settlement for the conflict, according to Chtatou. The country “has never closed the door for earnest discussions or negotiations it is the Polisario that always refuses to talk, of course we all know who pulls the strings from behind the curtain and does not want a political solution,” referring to the main supporter of the Polisario Front, Algeria. Slamming Polisario’s activities in the region, Chtatou said that the front “has nothing to offer but successive neighs,” whereas Morocco has succeeded in making notable progress in its Moroccan southern provinces that have come through its development investments in the region to the benefit of local peoples. According to Chtatou, those in the Tindouf  Camps “want to come back to Morocco, but they are prevented from doing so and are thrown in jail.” “It is clear that the Polisario has lost its credibility, and will soon lose Algeria’s support. [Algeria itself] is in bad [financial] shape and [appears to be] on the verge of bankruptcy, which might lead to an Algerian Spring. If this happens, the Polisario will be orphaned.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI on Friday addressed a congratulatory message to South-Africa’s President-elect Cyril Ramaphosa, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). In his message, the King expressed his “warmest” congratulations  and sincere wishes to Ramaphosa for full success in his high office, and “ fulfilling the aspirations of the fraternal South African people for further progress and prosperity.” The King has also reaffirmed his determination to work with the newly elected President to consolidate relations between the two countries, which have recently been promising, with the two countries vowing to open a new chapter of fruitful cooperation “based on constructive dialogue and mutual esteem.” This cooperation, according to the King, will “bring these relations to the level of historical ties uniting the two peoples, serving their interests and promoting the unity and development of the African continent.” Ramaphosa was named President of South Africa after the resignation of Jacob Zuma. Born in 1952, Ramaphosa is a businessman, a politician and a trade unionist. He took office on Thursday after former president Jacob  Zuma was forced to leave the presidency by the African National Congress, which has long accused him of corruption. The 65-year old newly appointed president served as the Deputy President of South Africa from 2014 to 2018. Ramaphosa was voted into the presidency of the African National Congress in December 2017. Ramaphosa was also the president of the National Planning Commission.

Rabat – In a statement released on Thursday this week, the Ministry of Interior revealed Moroccan government’s recent humanitarian operations in the regions and localities hit by recent low-temperature levels and heavy snowfalls. All necessary means—human and logistical, the statement said, were deployed by the Moroccan government to assist citizens in affected regions in their daily struggles to confront the consequences of the recent waves of heavy snowfall and cold weather. MAP, which reported the on the government’s considerable effort to contain the damages caused by the unfortunate events, said that the move was “pursuant to the instructions of HM King Mohamed VI” and marked a joint collaboration between the Ministry of Interior and relevant committees and services. “The watch and coordination center of the Ministry of Interior, in coordination with the provincial monitoring and watch committees, worked to continuously assess the situation on the field, provide updated data, take the necessary measures and coordinate the intervention operations by various parties in order to mitigate the impact of bad weather on the population,” MAP said. A total of 65,632 families—roughly 370000 people—are said to have benefitted from the humanitarian aid dispatched to concerned localities. Regarding efforts to open up affected regions, the statement noted the reopening of all roads (5,800 km classified and 1,100 km not classified), as well as the reopening of all the 526 villages touched by the cold wave. Meanwhile, robust medical services were also dispatched on the field. MAP specified in its report that “a total of 34,825 people benefited from field hospitals, out of which 25,902 beneficiaries are from Chichaoua and Tinghir provinces and 8,923 from Midelt,” underlining that “403,352 health services were offered to the inhabitants of the regions concerned through the organization of 2,879 medical visits by the mobile medical units, and 83 medical caravans.” The program also monitored the health status of pregnant women. A total of 3,742 pregnant women are said to have been identified, including, MAP stressed, “391 in the delivery phase who were provided with healthcare.” A further 7,223 homeless people are also counted to have been among the beneficiaries. Some landlocked regions benefitted from a total of 54 helicopter interventions from the Royal Gendarmerie, the Royal Armed Forces, and the Ministry of Health, with the aim of “evacuating urgent cases” and providing supplies and foodstuff to other affected citizens, the statement of the Interior Ministry said, adding that 22 provinces benefitted from an assistance program run by the Ministry of Agriculture, with nearly 30,000 farmers receiving 93,186 quintals of subsidized fodder.

Rabat – The Attijariwafa Bank group continues to win awards as it confirms its leading position in Morocco’s banking and financial sector. American Global Finance magazine named the organization as “Morocco’s Best Private Bank” for the year 2018.  Global Finance, which regularly ranks the top banks and other financial services, selected the winners using  “input from a panel of experts and feedback from industry analysts, corporate executives and technology specialists.”  Global Finance also considered other criteria i.e. transaction volume, market share, scope of global coverage, customer service, competitive pricing and innovative technologies.  At the regional level, the South-African banking group Standard Bank, which is now active in 20 African countries and is by far the continent’s biggest bank by assets, is taking the lead after clinching the award of “Best Private Bank in Africa.”  “Private banking is back on the right track, with rising assets and shrinking costs. But with wealth creation shifting from the West to Asia, and tax havens under continued attack, it needs a new long-term raison d’etre. Our global group of winners are finding some answers,” Joseph D. Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance said. According to the magazine, these awards have become a “trusted standard of excellence for the global financial community.”

Rabat – The bodies of three Moroccan victims who died in a fire in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates were repatriated today for burial in Morocco. The 38-year-old Moroccan citizen and her two children, aged 4 and 6, died of suffocation following the breakout of a fire in the building where they lived in Sharjah. Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Migration Affairs, in coordination with the Moroccan Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of the Kingdom to Dubai took the necessary administrative steps and measures for their repatriation. The fire broke out on Monday in an apartment building in Sharjah, UAE officials have confirmed. Five victims died in the fire, including a 40-year-old Pakistani woman an a 35-year-old Indian man. “As soon as the accident was reported to the Sharjah Police Central Operations Room, units from the Civil Defence and Anjad rushed to the scene and arrived within two minutes,” . Brigadier Mohammed Rashid Bin Bayat, head of operations at Sharjah Police told Gulf Today. The police began evacuating the residents but could not save all the victims, including the Moroccan woman who worked in the Sharjah Ladies Club, and her two children, Bayat said. Initial reports suggested the fire might have started from an air-conditioning unit. “The fire gutted an apartment on the first floor of the building and its smoke spread in the whole building,” Colonel Sami Khamis Al Naqbi, director-general of Sharjah Civil Defence, told Gulf News. Abdullah, a worker at the nearby supermarket, told the Khaleej Times that “the Moroccan woman used to come down every morning to take the two children to school in her Nissan Murano, which was seen parked just outside the supermarket. Even yesterday she bought groceries.”

Rabat – Nearly 1700 Saudi nationals were victims of alleged sextortion and cybercrime activities committed by Moroccan citizens in 2017, according to the Saudi newspaper Makkah. The newspaper said that Saudi nationals, including women, were victims of blackmail by Moroccan criminal bands operating in two unidentified cities. The alleged sextortion cases have, according to the paper, led to severe depression for eight of the Saudi nationals who fell victim to the blackmail. Some have had suicidal thoughts. The eight alleged Saudi citizens were saved from further pain and embarrassment owing to “the intervention of the Saudi embassy in Morocco and the Moroccan Directorate of the fight against cyber crimes,” added the newspaper. The embassy of Saudi Arabia in Morocco has reportedly received 420 blackmail complaints, while it has managed to handle some similar sensitive cases in a confidential manner at the request of the victims. The perpetrators often ask their victims of sums of money ranging from MAD 1,250 and MAD 7,500,000 depending on the financial situation of the victims, added the newspaper. The alleged cybercrime gangs track their victims on social networks to study their financial status, photos and activities before blackmailing them. The gang then contacts their male victims using fake female profiles on social media, utilizing third-party videos or anonymous online content to trap the victims. Once the victims perform acts of a sexual nature, the blackmailers record them while online and threaten to post these video clips or photos online. Facing potentially significant embarrassment, the victims are then pressured to pay the amounts of money demanded by harassers. In 2017, the Moroccan General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced several measures to counter e-crimes. The security bureau has reportedly received numerous complaints about sextortion and defamation on the internet and theft of credit cards. Al Massae reported in February 2017 that criminals usually target victims from Morocco and abroad by using fake profiles to trap individuals and people of different ages. Other cybercrime perpetrators operate on Facebook and other social media sites, claiming fraudulent employment and/or retail announcements which require victims to make payments and to submit credit card information. A British study in 2016 found that 30 percent of all global cases of online sextortion originated in Morocco, especially from the city of Oued Zem, which was labeled the “capital of sextortion.”

Rabat – “La messe est dite”, the French say. This now clichéd adage captures a situation in which, as Enoch Powel reminds us, there is an inherent pointlessness about wanting to change an already decided course of action.  FIFA has said the mass after defending anyone from doing so. Last month, in a so-called impartial bidding-guidelines-letter that was addressed to all federations, but implicitly targeted Morocco, FIFA and its chief vowed impartiality in the whole bidding process. All federations, the so-called impartiality warnings said, should not show any sign of preference for this or that bid. Should they have any preferences—as they always do—FIFA exhorted federations to keep these preferences to themselves. “Please, don’t go public,” was in essence, FIFA’s message to federations. “All officials are requested to refrain from expressing publicly their personal opinion about the merits of one or more bids during the bidding process,” said FIFA in its “Integrity Warnings” it sent federations just a month ago. Weeks later, at a conference in Casablanca, as Morocco was holding CHAN 2018, Gianni Infantino, FIFA’s chief, reiterated, verbatim and with the tyrannical commitment of a fanatic, the same guidelines to CAF’s executive body. However, according to Al Akhbar in its 16th February edition, Infantino has reportedly had an interview with ESPN, an American media giant, especially in the sporting world. In the interview, Infantino, forgetful of the “Integrity” he so fervently called on others to uphold, engaged in a series of congratulatory and laudatory messages to American football (or soccer?) and the U.S’s 2026 bid. “The USA does not need to host the FIFA world cup to improve its football. This country has all the means and infrastructures to be counted as one of the giants of this sport [football],” Infantino is said to have told ESPN. But no, Infantino was not quite done. Like a kickboxing legend, he had his final tricks, his best North America 2026-friendly tropes, the coup de grace which, when given, is aimed at knock outing the opponent. Here it comes, unabashed, triumphant, and so childishly seeming to have forgotten what he told others just some weeks ago: “Hosting an event of this stature allows hosting countries to improve the competitiveness of its football infrastructures. But the US lacks nothing. The country has high-level infrastructures which greatly contribute to its developing football culture.” But one is not sufficiently exhaustive when one is exuberantly in love. And so Infantino had to tell ESPN what he thought of America’s absence from the 2018 World Cup just around the corner. “America’s absence from the 2018 World Cup is a bitter failure, comparable to that of Italy. In this kind of events, it is important that a great nation like the U.S. be present.” Which, if a you’re a lover of the beautiful game, compels the question: Is there any chance that Infantino—unwittingly, to his credit—mistook Football for American football? Or was he just trying to please his ESPN interviewers? Compare America’s halting “soccer” team to the monumentally legendary Squadra Azura? Really, Infantino? That America is a great nation, no one can deny that. Some political commentators would even tell you that the US is not only a great nation; it is the only superpower in diplomatic history, so far anyway. But a football (in our sense of the word) giant? Not quite sure. But that is the trick of love: it magnifies the virtues of the loved, ignores her defects, and idealizes her to the point of phantasmagorical imbecility. This whole 2026 bidding campaign is turning into the epitome of tediousness, a boring play by equally boring actors. Were the decisions all Infantino’s, the biding process would be nothing but a second-hand play in a second-hand theater, like presidential elections in many sub-Saran states: the winner is known before the vote.  Perhaps it’s time to ignore Infantino’s warnings, perhaps it’s time that Morocco—and any other bidder for that matter—abides  by the rules when they are fair, and ignores them, or circumvents them, when they are lopsided and so obviously biased. To representatives of Morocco 2026: ignore this series of partial and self-interested sermons; delight in the fact that Africa and the Arab world (hopefully) will be supportive; do not, as you recently said, refrain from using the Trump factor; be unabashedly confrontational. After all, when you’re the little David facing three Goliaths, and when, this time, god (FIFA) is on Goliaths’ side, you have to be unapologetic about getting supports, whatever that takes.  FIFA, like the Pharisee preacher in the now dull biblical episode, is telling federations: “Do as we say, and not as we do.” Don’t listen to them. Or, if you do decide to listen to them—because you might have to—listen selectively.

Rabat- After several national media outlets reported that the giant Coca-Cola company is preparing to shut down its plant in Tangier because of sugar subsidies cut, the group has just cleared things up about its business in Morocco.   The Moroccan-based Coca-Cola Export Corporation said in a statement that it “categorically denies the allegations reported by media outlets about shutting down its business in Morocco.” “Some national news outlets quoted an anonymous source claiming that following the government policy to cut sugar subsidies, the Coca-Cola Export Corporation – Morocco branch will have to cease its production activities in Morocco,” reads the press release. The group added that the company “reserves the right to resort to the competent authorities to protect its interests and its image, to which this false information has caused prejudice.” After quoting ministerial sources, namely Lahcen Daoudi, the Minister in charge of General Affairs and Governance, the Moroccan daily newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia said in its February 16’s issue, that the Coca-Cola Company will shut down its plant in Tangier with the aim to move its business to Turkey following the government’s decision to cut sugar subsidies. Asked by the daily on the reimbursement of sugar subsidies that many manufacturers benefit from, Daoudi explained that the state recovers its due in the soft drink sector, but that is not the same thing for other manufacturers of juices and pastry. While some Moroccans consider the government’s subsidizing of staple goods as a necessity to preserve the purchasing power of lower- and even middle-class families, others applaud the government’s willingness to relieve the state from the constant pressure of subsidizing goods. The government has justified its decision to end sugar subsidies, particularly granulated sugar, on the grounds that it is not the poor people who benefit from subsidies, but rather the big companies who consume large quantities.

Rabat – During a visit to Chefchaouen in Northwest Morocco, an Irish tourist bargained his way into buying a holiday souvenir for €52. He later discovered that it was a historic antique from the Ice Age, worth more than €33,000. The Irish Times recounted today the story of the Irishman, under anonymity, who visited Chefchaouen in 2006. In an antique shop that sold mostly “Islamic and Roman items, a high, carved figurine “that looked Chinese” caught his eyes. The antique originally cost €70. However, the Irishman was able to bargain with the shop’s owner and hammered out a deal at €52. Once back in Ireland, he began trying to identify the origin of the item. He thought that “the figurine was wood painted with lacquer and represented the Chinese Emperor Yongle,” wrote the Irish Times,  adding that “he had a hunch that it might date from the 15th-century and said that his constant speculation had his wife driven mad.” His wife convinced him to get the piece professionally seen to assert its origin. They visited a specialist company in Oxford, England and paid over €550 for a radiocarbon dating test, a test used by scientists to determine the history and age of the item. The results of the test found that the piece was not actually carved from wood but rather from the horn of a 25,000-year-old “wooly rhino” an extinct species of rhinoceros that was common throughout Europe and northern Asia during the Pleistocene epoch period. In 2011,  the oldest known wooly rhinoceros fossil aging back to a 3.6-million years was discovered in the cold Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that it existed there during a period the climate of the earth began to warm. The Irish Times wrote that “the most plausible theory for the carving is that fossil came to light in 15th-century China and a craftsman used the horn to make the carving. In imperial China, jade and rhino horn were commonly carved to create decorative objects of great beauty and high value.” The Irishman, a self-employed carpenter, learned from Mealy’s – Auctioneers &amp; Agents of Fine Art &amp; Antiques, one of Ireland’s leading Fine Art Auctioneers &amp; Valuers that the antique is worth up to €33,776. He decided to auction it off on March 6.

Rabat- According to a study by the Ministry of Family, Solidarity, Equality and Social Development, the number of people aged 60 and over will almost double by the year 2050, to an estimated 10 million. The over-60 population by then will represent 25 percent of the nation’s population. The study entitled, “The new life of elderly people in Morocco in the face of social change,” revealed that aging and the elderly will be a principle component of the kingdom’s future demographic profile.   Despite this aging trend in the population, the study further reveals that medical and social support, already a current challenge today, will continue and grow in the coming years. The challenge of caring for the elderly will become more acute particularly in a context marked by a growing nuclearization of households,  especially in urban areas, and the growth of residential mobility among young and middle-age Moroccans. Additionally, the current challenges facing public health systems will have a significant impact on the care of older people in the coming years.  “Households will have more financial difficulties because of the expenses of people in this age category, usually judged to be non-productive,” notes the joint report. The situation is compounded by the fact that 64 percent of the elderly do not have their own resources, and 34 percent survive solely on an income barely covering their daily needs. Without family solidarity and support, the majority of the elderly suffer significant hardship in economic terms, indicates the study.   The Minister of Family, Solidarity, Equality and Social Development, Bassima Hakkaoui, stressed in an October 2017 report that Morocco is far from being able to cope with the needs of its aging population.   The report presented a troubling snapshot on the conditions facing Morocco’s elderly. Poor life conditions, a lack of medical and financial assistance, neglect by their children, and a fragile life expectancy from health conditions like diabetes or hypertension have lead more than 7 percent of people over the age of 60 to feel that they are victims of “social exclusion.”  In order to meet the resulting challenges arising from this analysis, the ministry recommends a number of measures: improving the supply of collective accommodation for the elderly, strengthening the provision of health care, developing of social assistance training, monitoring and evaluating an integrated public policy regarding the elderly. The ministry report called for mobilizing sufficient resources to improve the conditions of the elderly in homes and social welfare institutions.

Rabat – This past Wednesday, Tangier Royal Gendarmerie and customs services seized 25 million tablets of “Tramadol” painkiller packed in boxes at Tanger Med port.  Local authorities reported today that the opioid pain medication came from Asia, and was destined for African countries. An investigation has been opened to identify the network involved in this international trafficking, and samples of the tablets were sent to the Royal Military Police Forensic Science Institute for analysis. In previous operations in 2017, the Royal Gendarmerie seized more than 40 million tablets and capsules of “Tramadol,” packaged in containers in the same port, also sent from Asia for distribution on the continent. Illicit tramadol is extremely addictive, and can cause seizures and permanent damage, according to Tramadol’s own Abuse Help website. Unauthorized prescription drugs cause 100,000 deaths a year in Africa, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). While WHO estimates that one out of 10 medicines in the world is unlicensed, figures in Africa may be as high as seven out of 10. “To sell fake medicines, you need a clientele. The ailing poor are more numerous in Africa than anywhere in the world,” Marc Gentilini, an expert on infectious and tropical diseases, told Agence France Presse. About 57 per cent of these drugs – which includes 125,868,567 individual units – arrived on the continent via seaports, said Action against Counterfeit and Illicit Medicines in its 2016 report.

By Neil Buckland Rabat – In simple terms, the term ‘exchange rate‘ refers to the value of one currency for the purpose of conversion to another, and this can have an impact in various sectors of the commercial world.  From purchasing currency for international travel and buying overseas goods to trading currencies through the foreign exchange, exchange rates can directly influence how much we spend in certain circumstances. They can fluctuate wildly, while in the case of flexible exchange rates countries adopt a monetary system that determines base rates according to supply and demand. This brings both advantages and disadvantages, including the following: In many ways, flexible exchange rates acts as automatic stabilisers in any domestic economy. More specifically, these rates can be adapted to suit the wider, macroeconomic climate, to compensate for disproportionate changes in inflation and economic output. This enables central banks to leverage exchange rates as part of their monetary policy, particularly in instances when they are looking to stimulate growth. There are instances where this can be counterproductive, however, and actually considered as a distinct disadvantage. In a volatile economic climate where countries have large surpluses or deficits, for example, flexible exchange rates can cause huge volatility and actively destabilize the global markets. The issue of volatility in the financial marketplace is an interesting concept, and it can be considered as an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your outlook. In general terms, flexible exchange rates lend themselves to high levels of volatility, as the shifts in the base rate are far more frequent and significant that the underlying fundamentals may imply. From the perspective of forex trading experts, however, volatility can be leveraged to secure a competitive advantage. This is because the currency is considered to be a derivative asset class, and one that can enable traders to hedge against specific pairings and profit even in a depreciating market. We’ve already said that flexible exchange rates allow for more agile and effective monetary policies, but they also enable banks to introduce autonomous strategies.  These policies can subsequently be deployed to address problems relating to inflation and output, while forming the basis of quantitative easing programs during times of austerity or recovery. In the case of trade, countries can use flexible rates to counter rising inflation without impact on their partners. Similarly, they don’t have to import their trade partners’ inflation rate, which is the case when using a fixed exchange rate. © Morocco World News. All Rights Reserved.

By  Brendan Ng Rabat – “Disposable streets, Styrofoam bridges and façade works.”  These are a few of the many colorful terms used in Angola to describe the Chinese infrastructure projects that have begun to crop up in recent years.  Over the past two decades, roads, bridges and buildings have been erected at an astounding rate as part of what scholars have dubbed “the Angola Model.” Under the Angola Model, Chinese firms carry out public works projects on behalf of the Angolan government, and Angola uses its natural resources as collateral for this development.  By some metrics, this agreement appears to have been a massive success. In recent years, Angola has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia in becoming China’s top supplier of crude oil. In turn, Angola became the fastest growing economy in the world, with an incredible annual GDP growth rate of 11.1% last decade.  There’s just one small problem – the pace of Chinese construction during this boom has been nearly matched by the rate at which these projects have gone on to crumble, collapse and disintegrate.  In theory, there is a brilliant symbiosis to this exchange – Angola is able to turn its copious stores of oil into the physical infrastructure its people desperately need, while China can leverage its construction expertise to keep up with its ever-increasing national demand for oil. In reality, business has not been nearly so mutually beneficial. China has indeed acquired vast amounts of oil, but Angola remains largely underdeveloped. Chinese firms are not only signing lucrative contracts for construction projects, but they are receiving equally lucrative contracts to rebuild these hastily thrown together roads, bridges and buildings when they inevitably collapse.  Earnings for the ultra-rich decision makers in the country have continued to rise in spite of these developmental failures. As Rafael Marques de Morais describes in his essay The New Imperialism: China in Angola, “some responsibility for these failings goes to [Angola’s] institutionalized culture of corruption, incompetence, and disregard for public safety.”  Angolan elites appear to be more than content to skim billions off of Chinese oil contracts, even as billions more are being effectively stolen through sub-standard construction. This phenomenon is situated within a larger effort by the Chinese government to augment its role as both an economic and political stakeholder on the African continent. At the 2015 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Johannesburg, China committed to provide $60 billion of funding to African nations, effectively tripling its previous commitments in the region. Since then, from constructing monstrous new cities, to supporting agricultural modernization, China has begun to engage countries across the continent on numerous fronts. Recently, China appears to have taken a particular interest in Morocco. On the heels of the 6th session of the Morocco-China Joint Committee for Economic Cooperation held last Thursday in Rabat, representatives from both countries declared a broad commitment to increased economic partnership. At the conference, top Moroccan and Chinese economic officials held discussions focused principally on the possibility for “bilateral ventures in infrastructure development.”   In light of what has taken place in Angola since the turn of the century, the Moroccan people have a reason for caution as Chinese enterprises turn their attention towards the kingdom’s newly discovered oil stores. Similarly to Angola, Morocco is governed by a dominant class of elites. Although King Mohammed VI has recently taken steps to push back against misconduct by the country’s ruling class, corruption has still been classified as “rife throughout the economy” by Freedom House, as recently as last year.   Morocco is a country that has been blessed with natural resources, and appears to be poised to develop significantly on the back of these resources (in conjunction with its burgeoning tourism industry).  As can be seen in Angola, however, these sorts of gifts can be squandered by corruption, incompetence and mismanagement – a brighter future is not guaranteed. Unless government officials and industry leaders commit to putting profits from Morocco’s natural gifts towards the public good, it is unclear whether the Moroccan people will ever see any of the benefits they have been promised. As such, the tragic possibility emerges that disposable streets, Styrofoam bridges and façade works may begin to appear 8,000 kilometers to the north of Luanda all too soon.

Rabat – Seeking to decrease U.S. financial contributions to UN-led operations, the Trump administration unveiled, earlier this week, a 2019 budget proposal calling for a substantial cut in the U.S. financial share in peacekeeping missions and similar global operations. The Department of State, in the new budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2019, envisions cutting more than half of American contributions to global affairs, especially peacekeeping and international cooperation missions in the Middle East, with the move more particularly targeting UN missions in Lebanon, the Golan Height, and MINURSO in Western Sahara. “The Fiscal year 2019 request reflects the administration’s commitment to seek reduced costs by reevaluating the mandates, design, and implementation of peacekeeping missions and sharing the funding burden more fairly among UN members,” said the budget plan. “MINURSO may achieve slight efficiencies in civilian staffing as well as light reduction in the force,” read part of the proposed plan as it addressed the Trump’s administration’s plan for Western Sahara. The Trump administration’s budget blueprint for fiscal year 2019 proposes to cut MINURSO’s budget by more than half, namely from $18.4m to $8.4m. MINURSO, which was established in 1991 under UN Security Council resolution 690 and whose mandate was renewed in 2015, is charged with “monitoring the ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario” as well as ensuring the organization of a referendum at the convenience of both parts. Since the US is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations—under UN charter America is responsible for 28.5% of the peacekeeping budget—many observers have predicted negative ramifications for world peace if the Trump Administration’s budget is to pass congress. Meanwhile, US officials speak of America’s current limited funding capacity. Speaking to the press earlier this week, Douglas Piktin, acting director of the State Department’s Bureau of Budget and Planning, said: “Because we are looking for greater costs containment at the UN more generally, we do have lower funding level than the full peacekeeping estimate.” He however added that the estimated numbers for FY 2019 are subject to change. The Trump administration is notorious for its lack of faith in the UN. Late last year, in December, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador at the UN, spoke up against the UN’s “inefficiency and overspending,” adding, in the outcry that followed Trump’s Jerusalem statement, that “We [the U.S.] will no longer let the generosity of the American people be taken advantage of.” So while the State Department associates this decision to slash America’s contribution to global peacekeeping missions with a severe budget constraint, critiques have raised concerns about the Trump administration’s being a seething hotbed of poor strategic thinking and short-sighted foreign policy guidelines, all of which, they say, has been harming America’s leadership position in international affairs. In a statement released this week about the US 2019 budget for global peacekeeping, The Better World Campaign, an organization seeking to reinforce UN-US cooperation, said: “The Trump Administration is proposing unwise and disproportionate cuts to US foreign affairs spending, which would undermine American leadership globally, including at the UN and its agencies.” The statement also stressed “the importance of robust foreign affairs spending and continued support for the UN.” The president however did not seem to have been bothered by mounting criticisms of his foreign policy. Trump is said to be focusing more on domestic fronts, especially increasing US military spending and building new infrastructures. “This will be a big week for infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in our country,” Trump tweeted on Monday.

Rabat – The Coca-Cola Company is preparing to shut down its plant in Tangier with the aim to move its business to Turkey, the Moroccan daily newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia said in its February 16’s issue. Quoting ministerial sources, the newspaper said that the reason behind the company’s decision is the government’s decision to cut sugar subsidies. According to the same source, Lahcen Daoudi, the Minister in charge of General Affairs and Governance, confirmed the American company’s decision to leave the country. “This issue is currently under consideration between the Government and the Professional Association of the Soft Drink Industry,” he said. Asked by the daily on the reimbursement of sugar subsidies that many manufacturers benefit from, Lahcen Daoudi explained that the state recovers its due in the soft drink sector, but that is not the same thing for other manufactures of juices and pastry. While some Moroccans consider the government’s subsidizing of staple goods as a necessity to preserve the purchasing power of lower- and even middle-class families, others applaud the government’s willingness to relieve the state from the constant pressure of subsidizing goods. The government has justified its decision to end sugar subsidies, particularly granulated sugar, on the grounds that it is not the poor people who benefit from subsidies, but rather the big companies who consume large quantities. At the timing of writing, the Coca Cola Company has not issued any statement confirming the information reported by the Moroccan daily. If the decision were to be confirmed, about 38,000 employees that work for it would lose their jobs and Morocco would have to import the carbonated soft drinks.

Rabat- The Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI) will allocate USD 700,000, almost MAD 6.4 million, to Paraguay to improve six health units in the southern departments of Guairá and Caazapá to reduce child and maternal mortality, reported state press agency MAP.   Paraguayan Minister of Health, Carlos Morinigo, and the Moroccan Ambassador to Paraguay, Badreddine Abdelmoumni approved the donation on Tuesday, February 13. The amount donated will be used to renovate the infrastructure and equipment of three Family Health Units (FHU) in Guairá and three others in Caazapá. In addition, one FHU from each department will be provided with delivery services, laboratories and radiology rooms, which will benefit approximately 50,000 people. Starting next week, a Moroccan delegation will supervise the work in the health centers concerned. Pregnant women are the main beneficiaries of these FHU, dedicated to providing adequate birthing conditions. Due to the fact that infant mortality affects 17 children out of 1000 in Paraguay, the donation should positively impact the fight against infant mortality (Citing UNICEF’s November 2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)).

Rabat- Morocco is now among 45 countries facing water scarcity, according to World Resources Institute water scarcity map, which reveals Morocco’s critical situation. Although Morocco is still far from the “extremely high” ratio of water withdraw to supply, as the case in many Middle Eastern countries, the kingdom is still considered in water deficit. Morocco’s volume of water has dropped by 80 percent to reach 500 cubic meters per inhabitant per year, against 2,500 cubic meters in 1960, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and United Nations data. According to L’Economiste, the establishment of a governmental emergency program that aims to provide drinking water for areas that are mainly reliant on vulnerable water sources and ensure the irrigation of fruit trees. In order to preserve water resources, a multi-year strategy has been developed. The national plan to secure water availability in Morocco demands an investment of MAD 200 million by 2030. Three sectors are primarily responsible for the overconsumption of water, namely, agriculture, industry, and households. Today, 40 percent of world’s population is concerned by water scarcity; North African and Middle Eastern countries are especially affected, as water resources are becoming increasingly scarce, due to dry weather conditions and demographic growth. At the same time, over 80 percent of wastewater is discharged into rivers and the sea without any cleanup, representing the misuse of a sustainable source of water, energy, and other recoverable materials. Meanwhile, the demand for water is rising year after year, and need increases parallel to population growth. Morocco also figures among the regions that are running out of drinking water, which will impact several sectors, particularly agriculture and urbanization, in addition to affecting the country’s overall GDP.

Rabat – The 19 year old gunman, who  fired  at his former high school in South Florida on Wednesday, killing at least 17 students and adults was transferred today morning to county jail after being questioned overnight. The suspect, Nikolas Cruz, 19, was transferred to the county jail, awaiting his first hearing. He faces charges of 17 counts of premeditated murder. Under Florida law, Cruz could face death penalty if convicted. He left at least 14 people injured, some of whom are in a critical condition, reports CNN. “This has been a day where we’ve seen the worst of humanity. Tomorrow is gonna bring out the best in humanity as we come together to move forward from this unspeakable tragedy,” Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie told the same source. Cruz had been expelled from the high school over disciplinary issues. His former classmate, Eddie Bonilla said that “Cruz loved showing off guns” while other classmates told the media outlet that “they were not surprised at the identity of the shooter.” The masacre is considered the deadliest shooting at a U.S. school since 2012.  US media reports that students had to hide behind their desks to avoid being shot. “I had ran in, thinking the teacher was behind me, but he was not. I heard the gunshots, and I heard the shooter walk down the hallway,” a student told CNN. One of the victims of the shooting is Football coach Aaron Feis, according to the school’s football program, Denise Lehtio. “He threw himself in front of students as bullets flew Wednesday at his alma mater,” said Lehito, adding that “he died the same way he lived — he put himself second.” CNN reported that a law enforcement official said that the FBI received “at least two alleged threat reports about Cruz.” One of those was about  “a YouTube channel that read I’m going to be a professional school shooter.” In a twitter post on Thursday morning, US President Donald  Trump said that there were signs that Cruz was ‘mentally disturbed,” calling on US citizens to report similar people to the authorities.

By Ahlam Bensaga Rabat- When Virgin Atlantic airlines served a menu to its passengers with a number of dishes displayed, one dish named “Palestinian couscous salad” ignited an online war among Israeli passengers.  “Palestinian couscous salad inspired by the flavors of Palestine” did not appeal to the tastes of one Israeli customer, as evidenced by photo he took of the description and  shared on his Facebook account, reported the Times of Israel news website. “I thought this was an Israeli salad…obviously [Virgin Group founder Richard] Branson showing his true colors…Israelis must boycott Virgin and Israel must ask for an explanation. When I complained the stewardess tried to take back the menu from me.”  This has fueled an online backlash from Pro-Israelis who accused the airline of negating the Israeli nation and siding with Palestinians. Following Israeli social media users’ increasing complaints about the controversial dish, Virgin Atlantic changed the dish’s name into “Couscous salad,” removing “Palestinian” from the menu. This move started a fire of online outrage from the pro-Palestinian party. Couscous,originally a North African dish typically made of grains of crushed durum wheat, vegetables, and meat, can be found in Israeli cuisine under the names “Jerusalem couscous” or “pearl couscous.” For its part, Virgin Atlantic described its “couscous salad” as a dish made of maftoul which the airline believed to be a relatively unknown ingredient. “We recently introduced a maftoul salad on board our flights. It includes a mix of maftoul and other couscous, complemented by tomatoes and cucumber and seasoned with parsley, mint and lemon vinaigrette.” Palestinian supporters joining the conflict on Twitter claim that maftoul is a Palestinian dish and that Virgin Atlantic is still serving the dish while denying its original name, “Palestinian couscous,” stated BBC news. Virgin Atlantic justified its use of the description “couscous salad,” clarifying: “We were aware that maftoul is not a widely known ingredient – so the dish was listed as a ‘Palestinian couscous salad,’ and later as a ‘couscous salad.’ We’d like to reassure all customers that our sole intention was to bring new flavors on board, and never to cause offense through the naming or renaming of the dish,” reported BBC. Supporters of the Palestinian cause took to Twitter to express their displeasure at Virgin Atlantic’s decision to remove the word “Palestinian” from the description.   Thanks @intifada for bringing us this disgraceful @VirginAtlantic erasure of #Palestinian from their menu. Bending to pressure from those who can’t stand any reminder of #Palestine. It’s what we mean by cultural #genocide. Come on @richardbranson https://t.co/03LoCTtws7 — James J.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – Although WhatsApp is based in the United States, most of its billion-plus users live outside the northwestern hemisphere.  The majority of instant messaging subscribers live across South America, Asia, and Africa. Indeed, according to the Wall Street Journal, WhatsApp has over 200 million active monthly users in India, and 1.3 billion users worldwide. Bought by Facebook in 2014 for USD 19 billion, WhatsApp includes many of the standard features of Facebook’s Messenger application and other social media platforms, such as Snapchat and Instagram. However, WhatsApp’s strategy diverges from the pack: its low-data consuming communication allows its users to send messages and use less data than its competitors do. Additionally, it includes the “group chat” function, enabling users to integrate multiple themed conversations into a low-bandwidth framework. And for those concerned about privacy, WhatsApp advertises “end to end” encryption, promising its users absolute privacy – even from WhatsApp itself. “I used WhatsApp to plan my entire wedding,” says Asmae, 32, a Casablanca-native living in France at the time. She used the application to coordinate with family members, caterers, and musicians – all from her apartment in Grenoble. For her, WhatsApp meant more than simply social media: she used it as a business and administrative tool. WhatsApp has outflanked its competitors in the emerging markets, especially across the consentient of Africa. In Zimbabwe, for example, WhatsApp accounted for nearly half of the country’s internet traffic. According to Quartz, 44% of all mobile internet usage went to WhatsApp. WhatsApp’s success has caused tensions with various mobile companies, that believe the internet sensation is cutting into their revenue. Several governments have intervened as well to try to curb their nation’s use of the data-based communications. In Morocco, for example, the government tried to impose an unpopular ban in 2016, also limiting the use of Skype as well. The government’s move inspired widespread protest, as users of the applications complained that the government was trying to protect the profits over mobile companies over the pockets of its citizens. However, WhatsApp is not to be written off and has, in fact, started to evolve to meet the demands of the vast majority of its users. In January 2018, WhatsApp launched a new android-only business application. So far, it has been rolled out in the United States, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. “Our new app will make it easier for companies to connect with customers, and more convenient for our 1.3 billion users to chat with businesses that matter to them,” WhatsApp says. Within its first two weeks of release, over 500,000 users installed the new business-oriented app.

Rabat- For the first time since rape accusations surfaced against him, Tariq Ramadan’s wife spoke out and claimed that her husband is a “victim of a media’s lynching.”  In a video posted on the Facebook page “For the Liberation of Tariq Ramadan”, Iman Ramadan said that “he had full confidence in justice and unfortunately justice wronged him.” She indicated that since he was still being held by police investigators in Paris, his family has been prevented from visiting him or calling him by phone. “I’m not sure right now that he’s receiving a fair and just treatment.” In the opinion of his wife, Ramadan was targeted by the media. “It is enough to just read the press or turn on the TV and think that he’s guilty,” adding that she thinks that “he is unfortunately a victim of this media lynching and political pressure exerted against him.” “There are so many lies at this point that it became unbearable,” his wife said. “ I am torn between reading what the press says about him and hide in my bubble waiting justice to be served.” French police arrested Tariq Ramadan on January 31, after two women filed complaints against him last year, accusing him of rape. The police continue to hold him as “part of a preliminary inquiry” into the rape and assault allegations. The Oxford professor denies the allegations, claiming that they are part of a”campaign of lies launched by [his] adversaries.”

Rabat – Egyptian Pop singer Essam Karika recently posted a video on his Instagram account in which he praised King Mohammed. His Moroccan followers deemed the song “insulting” to the king due to Karika’s particular choice of words. Essam Karika’s musical dedication to King Mohammed VI did not go as smoothly as he might have expected, as it received bitter criticism from Moroccans on social media over his use of the expression “Ragel daah” as he chanted “we all love this man.” Moroccan social media users considered the expression meaning “this man” to be disrespectful and “insulting” to the King’s status.The Egyptian singer later removed the video from his Instagram account and apologized to the Moroccan nation for the song, adding that his intention was purely to express his genuine love and respect for King Mohammed VI. “No one asked me to take down the video song…my immense love for Moroccan people has prompted me to apologize,” he told Dream, an Egyptian television channel during an interview. Karika uploaded a video to apologize for the controversial song, saying that his world darkened when he realized he offended Moroccan people. “I foremost apologize to King Mohammed VI and to the whole Moroccan nation,” he said in the video uploaded by Akhbar Maghribia YouTube channel.

Rabat- Several Moroccan associations are coming together to organise a meeting in solidarity with the controversial Islamic scholar, Tariq Ramadan, who is being prosecuted and jailed by French authorities for sexual assault and rape.  The solidarity meeting is expected to take place on Saturday, February 17 at 5 p.m. at the Mohammed VI Theater in Casablanca, after it was greenlighted by the borough of Roches Noires, administered by Islamist PJD member Nourredine Qarbal.  Co-organized by a group of associations headed by Al Massar, the event will feature prominent figures such as Abdelali Hamiedddin, Abdelatif Hatimi, Jawad Iraqui, and Abderrahmane Lahlou.  However, Moroccan media outlets report that the meeting was originally scheduled  unbeknownst to Hicham Abkari, the director of Mohammed VI theater.  “I was not privy to that. For almost a year, I’m no longer responsible of setting up the theater programming,” he told Le360. Hamieddine, a member of PJD political bureau, said he only accepted the invitation to “talk about the ideas” of the controversial scholar. The announcement of the event sparked an online backlash, as many argued that it’s not appropriate to hold such a meeting in light of the allegations of sexual violence against Ramadan, who remains in French custody.  “We expressed our solidarity with Saad Al-Majarrad…with Tariq Ramadan…The two may be innocent (pending judgment)…but what does it mean to be in solidarity with a person accused of rape and sexual violence?…Solidarity with what? With sexual violence? With sexual frustration? How can we simply accept normalising rape and sexual violence?” wrote the Moroccan sociologist Sanaa Elaji.  Ramadan, who is the grandson of the Muslim Brotherhood’s founder, was accused of rape by author and former Salafi Henda Ayari, who accused him of raping her in 2012 on the sidelines of a congress of the Union of Islamic Organizations of France.  She was the first woman to attempt to bring Mr. Ramadan to justice, saying she was adamant to “carry this fight till the end, whatever the cost.” She was later joined by a woman named Christelle, who stepped forward claiming she was also raped by the Swiss scholar in a French hotel in 2009. The 55-year-old theologian has firmly denied wrongdoing and accusations that he sexually assaulted the two women in 2009 and 2012, claiming that these allegations are part of a “campaign of lies launched by [his] adversaries.”

Rabat – As winterisation missions continue in various isolated regions in Morocco, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani opened today’s Government Council thanking “the invisible soldiers” who risk their lives to give aid to snow-capped villages. A number of employees from various ministerial departments, administrative and institutional “worked in critical conditions to provide aid in a number of regions,” said El Othmani. The Royal Armed Forces, the auxiliary forces and others departments  “have made great efforts to lessen isolation, deliver aid, and take care of a number of areas that have been surrounded by snow,” Othmani indicated. He pointed out that all of the departments and institutions concerned conducted a “special mobilization mission,” responding to royal instructions. A statement from the Ministry of Interior indicated that King Mohammed VI ordered government officials to take steps to open up affected areas and provide assistance to inhabitants. Othmani said that, under the instructions of the King, the Government follows “almost daily and continuously the situation of citizens in the snow-encircled areas.” “The work was persistent,” he said, adding that “due to heavy snowfall, the roads were cut off, resulting in some losses,” referring to a staff member of the Ministry of Equipment, who had been seriously injured during his work and later died. However, “despite the challenges imposed by harsh weather conditions,”  Othmani said that “there are soldiers who work in very critical conditions and who deserve our special greetings, for the big role they play in providing aid.” According to a statement from the Ministry of Interior, Morocco’s winterization relief project has  provided aid in form of food, blankets, and medical assistance to a total of 51,710 families across several provinces since November 2017. The aid mainly centered in the provinces of Al Haouz, Al Hoceima, Beni Mellal, Azilal, Boulemane, Chefchaouen, Khenifra, Ifrane, Midelt, Taourirt, Taroudant, Taza, Tinghir, Sefrou, Chichaoua, Guercif, Errachidia, and Ouarzazate

Rabat – Morocco will invest USD 40 billion in renewable energy sector projects by 2030, revealed Minister of Energy, Mining and Sustainable Development Aziz Rabbah on Wednesday. $30 billion will be dedicated to renewable energy electricity generation, said the minister, an affirmation that the transition to renewables in Morocco is well underway. Rabbah revealed that the share of electricity produced in Morocco from wind and solar resources had reached 13 percent in 2016. In 2009, that figure was just 2 percent. As part of Morocco’s plan to achieve 52 percent renewable energy electricity generation by 2030, the country has established several vocational and technical training programs and centers in the field of renewable energies. Rabbah was speaking in Casablanca at the first edition of the International Congress of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating (CIFAC). “The creation of these training centers will strengthen the dialogue between industry professionals and public authorities,” said Rabbah. This year’s solar energy expansion program will see the expansion of the Noor Laayoune I and Noor Boujdour I plants to bring them up to 2020 planned capacities. The chairman of the Executive Board of the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy, Mustapha Bakkoury, announced in late January that the “large project of Midelt” is advancing on schedule and that the construction of that and other solar power plants will start no later than early 2019. In terms of wind energy, Bakkoury said that 2018 will see the commissioning of plants that will produce capacities of about 300 megawatts, as well as the launch of new projects in Midelt and Taza “which are expected to reinforce the 42 percent target for 2020.”

Rabat- “The Republic of Indonesia is interested in investing  in Moroccan phosphate to meet its national demand for fertilizer,” said Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdurrahman Mohammad Fachir. Indonesia is interested in Moroccan products, including phosphate that “will allow us to meet the national demand for fertilizer,” said Fachir, reported Indonesian newspaper Jakarta Globe. The South Asian  country’s interest in Moroccan phosphate comes as China sees its production slow. Although China will continue to dominate the industry globally, it will see an unspecified portion its market share lost to Morocco due to the Kingdom’s “strong pipeline of projects and the largest global reserve,” said a recent report by BMI Research. According to the report, “Forecasts from the International Fertiliser Industry Association (IFA) suggest that phosphate rock and phosphoric acid production will grow by about 10 percent and 12 percent respectively between 2016 and 2021, with large capacity additions in Morocco and Saudi Arabia.” Morocco currently account for 73.5 percent of the world’s 68 billion tonne total phosphate reserves. The report adds that the “IFA claims that between 2017 and 2021 the fertiliser industry will invest close to USD110bn in more than 65 new production units of phosphate, potash and nitrogen, increasing global capacity by 90 million tonnes of products.” Over this same period, BMI predicts that China will continue to lose ground due to “unprofitable operations and more stringent environmental regulations consolidating the industry. Phosphate production in Morocco accounts for 90 percent of the domestic mining industry activity. The kingdom possesses over 50 billion tonnes in proven phosphate reserves, with only 30 percent of the country having been surveyed. Consequently, the report highlights there is room for enormous potential. The largest player in the game is Office Cherifien Des Phosphates (OCP). It owns three main Phosphate rock deposits, in at Khouribga, Ghantour and Boucraa. The Khouribga site is the biggest producer, offering 18 billion tonnes per year. In March, OCP announced a USD 370 million investment to develop the world’s largest phosphate pre-treatment plant at Oulad Fares. In addition to this, OCP announced it would use USD 1.8 billion to finance two new projects in the Beni-Mellal-Khenifra region. The result of these projects is expected to represent an increase in production at Khouribga, causing an output of 38 million tonnes by 2025.

Rabat – Malian President, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, expressed “his sincere thanks” on Tuesday to Morocco’s King Mohammed VI for training 500 Malian imams. “I sincerely thank King Mohammed VI for this initiative that trained 500 imams in Morocco,” said the Malian head of state during a meeting at the presidential palace in Bamako with a group of 300 Malian imams who have just completed their training at the Mohammed VI institute for the training of imams, morchidins and morchidates. “The young people who were selected have received multidimensional training in Morocco and, in turn, will be able to train Malian imams,” Keïta said in the presence of Malian Minister of Religious Affairs and Worship, Thierno Hass Diallo, and several religious leaders. In addition to the 300 imams received by the head of the Malian state, 200 others are currently in Morocco for continued training. The first group of Malian imams began their training in Morocco in November 2013.  In addition to basic Quranic studies, the imams learn about the life of the Prophet Mohammad, and study Arabic grammar, as well as Communications and Computer Sciences. Abdel Islam Lazaar, Director of Training for the Malians imams previously said that “the purpose of this training is to help the imams exercise their functions properly in their home countries and to be able to recognize ideas that are harmful to Islam.” With an investment of EUR 3 million, Morocco trained these Malian Imams for two years, with full room and board at the training center. Mohammed VI institute for the training of imams, morchids and morchidates has received applications from the countries of Nigeria, Gabon, Maldives, Chechnya, France, Spain, and Russia for imam training.

Rabat – “At the age of 14, my brother broke my two front teeth because he didn’t like the way I walked,” recalled O.A, a gay man from Fes. His years of suffering was filmed in a 4 minute video, painting in broad strokes the discrimination he faced from his parents, siblings, schoolmates and teachers. A’s first encounter in a lifelong series of oppression, harassment, and abuse was with his mother. “My mother would put hot pepper in my tongue so that I would behave like the boys from my neighborhood, like a man,” he said while walking in the Medina of Rabat, his back facing the camera. But at a tender age, O.Awas ignorant of the gender roles that society has imposed onto him and expects him to abide by. “I wasn’t aware of what a man is and what a woman is.” Once in school, O.A came to face abuse far greater than that of his mother.  “Teachers would humiliate me several times and my classmates would call me very offensive nicknames. I knew I was different.” As a result, O.A started missing classes. “[The abusive treatment] used to affect me, because school is supposed to be a place for forgiveness,” he said, taking a breath before continuing, “people should be raised to accept and not reject each other.” But his escape from school did not end his suffering. “In the streets, people would cuss at me and beat me with stones,” O.A said in a darkened room and the camera still facing his back. Unable to tolerate more abuse, O.A started taking a long, deserted road to reach home. “Instead of walking 500 m to reach home, I walked 1 km.” O.A found solace in “friends who would accept him for his homosexuality.” The time spent with them served as an escape from a family that would “play with his mind and manipulate him into believing that he’s a shame.” My brother would tell me that seeing me makes him want the ground to open and be buried in it.” O.A never confessed his homosexuality to his family. “I have done nothing wrong.” Last year, abuse reached a point that O.A couldn’t handle. “I was facing scolding from my father and brother. I used to stand up to them and leave the apartment, but eventually I had to go back because I had nowhere to go.” O.A , like many gay men in Morocco, got “beaten, suppressed […] I cried and I hurt and there was no law to protect me from my family.” Despite the 2011 constitution’s commitment to “banish and combat discrimination against any person, by reason of sex, color, creed, culture, social or regional origin, language, disability or any personal circumstances,” homosexuality remains intolerable in Morocco. “If I go to the police, I would be the one to be jailed,” O.A said. Morocco has repeatedly imprisoned men under penal code article 489, which punishes homosexual conduct with sentences between six months and three years in prison and fines of MAD 120 to 1200. Mustapha Ramid, Human Rights Minister, had condemned homosexuality several times.   He called homosexuals “trash” and recently referred to “homsexuality as a violation of human rights. For him, his position is based on “the kingdom’s constitution and its laws and the international conventions it has signed,” as well as the “national consensus,” which “only the perverts deviate from.” O.A left home and moved in with his friends who accept him for who he is. He had to quit school. He found a job and had to begin his life from scratch, before moving to Slovakia.  By the end of the video, O.A said that “by telling my story, he is not seeking attention or pity, [he is] telling it to say [he is] gay and that [has] the right to live as any other human being in society.”

Rabat – 25 books have been banned at Casablanca’s International Book Fair (SIEL) for undermining Morocco’s territorial integrity and blasphemous content.  News of the exhibition of a book that displays the Moroccan map without the Sahara has sparked outrage on social media during the last 24 hours. According to Hassan El Ouazzani, the Chief of the Book Directorate at the Ministry of Culture, the organizers retrieved the book entitled “Summary of the General History of Africa” immediately after noticing the error. In its edition on Wednesday, February 14, newspaper Assabah declared that the ban covers 24 other books that feature atruncated Moroccan map, the Polisario flag, or disrespect the three monotheistic religions. “The commission of control represents the various governmental sectors,” states El Ouazzani, affirming that it is opposed categorically to any contents undermining the territorial integrity of the kingdom and religions, namely Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. This response has done little to calm people’s anger on social networks, especially as SIEL’s guest of honor, Egypt, has displayed the aforementioned banned book in its exhibitions this year.. Many have declared that this incident should not go unpunished, and those responsible for the event, including Minister of Culture Mohamed Laaraj, must be held accountable.

By Hajar El Khaldi Rabat – Red sweeps the stores, flower shops adorn their bouquets, and bold writings on windows’ shops declare “LOVE IS ON SALE” All the signs indicate that love, supposedly, is in the air.  Whether you believe in the celebration of this sentiment or not, you can’t help but notice its manifestations across the streets, on social media, and in your friends ludicrous red outfits, February 14 remains a day where warm sentiments meet controversy. With the rise of a celebration that is alien to Moroccan traditions, a key question begs for an answer: do Moroccans truly celebrate love, or is it a mere attempt at seeming “modern”? A History Drenched in Blood  Although Valentine’s Day is known nowadays as an occasion where love is celebrated, mainly, through the exchange of gifts between lovers, its history is quite morbid. Historians agree that Valentine’s Day has its roots in ancient Rome where the Roman feast of Lupercalia, which dates back to 300 BC, took place every year between February 13 and February 15. How did the romans celebrate, you ask? One of the gruesome rituals involved sacrificing a dog or a goat and using the skin to whip women, as it was believed that this would increase their fertility. Quite romantic, huh? This pagan tradition was expelled in the 5th century, and replaced with the celebration of a martyr called Valentine who was executed by the roman Emperor Claudius II, also known as Claudius the Cruel. While the reason behind beheading can’t be confirmed and several legends have been attributed to this celebration, people like to cling to the version where a Saint Valentine went against the emperor’s ban on marriage for men in the army, and continued to marry young couples; which eventually cost him his head. Spreading the Love  In the 15th century a 21-year-old Duke, allegedly, sent the first Valentine’s Day card ever to his, underage 16 years old, bride from prison under the title “Farewell to Love”. A couple of centuries later, the holiday turned into a consumer-oriented celebration that intended to showcase one’s social class. In fact, while common folk confessed their love through card exchange, aristocrats engaged in more refined and expensive activities. With the rise of industrialization and the developments in printing and mass production, the celebration spread across Europe, then the United States, and eventually to the Arab World. “Love is Dead, and Consumerism Killed it” In order to get Moroccan’s opinions on this celebration, I visited the flower market in Rabat where vendors were more than willing to give their take on the matter. At the market, flowers embellished the street as the bouquets left their usual stand inside the shops and spread across the sidewalk. The clients’ turnout might lead you to think that the vendors would be avid fans of this celebration; however, their opinions had another story to tell. “We Moroccans express love throughout the year; we don’t need a specific day to display our love, nor do we need this kind of gifts to show it,” declared Fouad, a florist in his early 40s. “By love I don’t only refer to romantic love; the love we have for our families, neighbors, and for each other is far more important,” he explained. A younger florist, Abdeslam, joined our conversation to express similar cynicism toward the occasion, and stated that Valentine’s day has little to do with real love and more to do with social pressure and couples’ desire to show those around them that they, too, are loved. “It’s not about how you feel for me. What can you give me? That’s Valentine’s Day in a nutshell. “Most of our clients on this day are young people, although the price multiplies four times this time of the year, because, in all honesty, older people knew how to love. Our parents held on to our traditions and religion and knew that you cannot limit love to a day or put a price on it,” said Fouad. “Now love related merchandise is everywhere, yet actual love is hard to come by.” An Act of Rebellion While some see it as commercial festivity that pushes people to conform to western ideals, others view it as an opportunity to share love in a world saturated with hatred, as well as an opportunity to fight against religious extremists’ voices that do not cease to intervene in individuals lives. As a matter of fact, in communal societies, where relationships are regulated through traditional social rules, life revolves around the group and any attempt at uniqueness is often ostracized. While Moroccans have no problem expressing warm sentiments toward their friends and relatives in the form of hospitality and empathy, interpersonal expressions of love between individuals often feel awkward and out of place. This shows, for instance, in the way Moroccans linguistically express their love. In fact, they often use French or English and find sentimental expressions in the Moroccan dialect to be cringe worthy. Furthermore, love is often ridiculed and seen as sign of weakness especially when it comes from men, on the other hand, women are raised to abide by traditional gender roles that prevent them from expressing their emotions first. In addition to a law that criminalizes relationships between consenting adults, store bought love seem to be Moroccan’s best shot at love for the moment.

By Ahlam Bensaga Rabat – Theater piece, “Allah Islah” written by Youssef Lahrichi and performed by 19H THÉÂTRE troupe addresses women’s situation in patriarchal families of Morocco through satire embodied in comical acts.  Lahrichi’s theater piece, “Allah Islah”  had a successful start on January 26, with another impressive showing on February 10. It is to have its third and last performance on February 23. “Allah Islah” was first performed on January 26 by 19H THÉÂTRE in Fédération des œuvres laïques (F.O.L.), Children Theater in Casablanca, and has been successful ever since. It attracted 360 spectators, reported 2M television channel.  “The play has been successful so far […] it provides the audience with laughter as well as with subjects that interest them,” said Youssef Lahcini, the play’s writer and producer,  to 2M. The piece portrays a mother, three daughters and an authoritative father who rules over the household. The father is a controlling character who uses fear-based tactics to dominate the female members who are forced to submit to the father’s wishes. Throughout the performance, it becomes clear that there is no direct communication between the girls and their father. Iman Hadi, 19H THÉÂTRE member who played the mother’s role told 2M, “The play tackles many problems that Moroccan families face, and primarily addresses the lack of communication within the family.”  The play touches on the psyches of women with overly controlling fathers. Lahrichi told Telequel news website,“When girls are raised the way the daughters in the play are portrayed, they become ‘frustrated’ and ‘victimized’ members in society who lack confidence in themselves.” The play’s title “Allah Islah” refers to a Moroccan expression that literally means “may god repair.” Lahrichi explained to Telequel, “When we see parents accompanying their children we tell them ‘Alalh Islah’, which means may god bring out good from these children[…] sometimes we don’t raise children well so we can only hope for God to guide them the right way,”.  The piece addresses realistic social issues about Moroccan women and patriarchy in a comical way to provide entertainment and send a “message” to the Moroccan society at the same time, Lahrichi told 2M. The theater piece received positive feedback from spectators, as 2M reported. A commentator said, “The performance was excellent […] the script is ingenious and well written. It talks about issues concerning women and family in Moroccan society.” “The play was full of laughter and full of ‘messages’,” said another. 19H THÉÂTRE troupe will perform “Allah Islah” for the last time on February 23 in Casablanca’s Theater, Fédération des œuvres laïques (F.O.L.) at 8 pm. 19H THÉÂTRE troupe was created in 2015 by a group of young artists and comedians in 2015;  Rime Aitelhaj, Imane Hadi, Mehdi Boumalki, Ayoub Naim, Samya Mengad, Sadik Soukaina, Sanae Assif, Hicham Echouhani, Fatine Rahhou and Hind Bennani.

Rabat – The Moroccan Minister of Justice, Mohamed Aujjar, said on Tuesday that some 33,168 inmates are held in pre-trial detention, representing 40 percent of the total prison population.  When a member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) asked the minister about the issue of pre-trial detention during a preliminary session held in the House of Councillors, Aujjar stressed that the rate of pre-trial detention varies between 40 and 43 percent, despite the ongoing efforts made by the Ministry of Justice to curb the practice. The ministry has also submitted a new Code of Criminal Procedure to the General Secretariat of the Government in order to develop new options for the nation’s penal policy. The code includes alternative measures to the practice of pre-trial detention and custodial sentences, added Aujjar. Reevaluation of penal guidelines, according to the minister, is aimed at utilizing pre-trial detention as an exceptional measure whose implementation is only authorized once other alternatives have been exhausted, other options remain unenforceable, or if the appearance of a conditional release may influence the course of any related trial. Prison Space at Capacity Aujjar also said that the total number of detainees in prison nationwide has now reached 82,512. In May 2017, Mohamed Saleh Tamek, the Delegate General of the Penitentiary and Reintegration Administration said that prisons in Morocco no longer have the capacity to house the soaring number of inmates. The Delegate General warned that the overcrowding of prisons is not only obstructing efforts that have been made to create safer and more humane conditions for inmates, but also endangers prison staff.

Rabat – The government is preparing a plan to grant a monthly MAD 1,000 payment to one million Moroccan families, as a solution to eliminate or drastically reform the Compensation Fund. The proposed subsidy payment was announced today by Minister Delegate for General Affairs and Governance, Lahcen Douadi. In response to an oral question in Parliament, Douadi noted that the challenge facing government finances today is the lack of targeting in government subsidies (transfer) payments. “We have budget envelopes, but the problem with the compensation system is that it does not benefit the people who need it the most,” he said. “A poor person is not supposed to use 100 bottles of butane gas a day,” he said in reference to big companies that benefit from the Compensation Fund’s support of butane gas purchases. According to the minister, granting one million Moroccan families an average monthly payment of MAD 1,000 would cost the state MAD 12 billion. He added that the MAD 20 billion that the government already spends on national welfare programs, taken together, represent a significant portion of Morocco’s national budget. These include the Compensation Fund, One Million Schoolbag and Tayssir programs, and support for widows and divorced women. For the Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, lowering government spending and decreasing the government’s budget is inevitable. He reiterated the importance of spending reforms during an intervention in the Parliament on January 23. “The government is working to unify the data on all its programs, before tackling the identification of classes benefiting from social programs, in order to reform the Compensation Fund,” according to Daoudi. El Othmani acknowledged dysfunctions in the compensation system, saying that it often benefits the rich more than it does vulnerable Moroccans due to a lack of eligibility requirements. He pointed out that the compensation fund represents a significant source of government spending and a principal cause of government debt, as nearly MAD 200 billion was spent on the fund between 2011 and 2015.

Rabat – At Morocco’s invitation, Personal Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General Horst Kohler is expected to visit the country on Friday, February 16, for talks with Moroccan officials about the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco has reportedly sent an invitation to Kohler to discuss details of the future negotiations over the Western Sahara conflict. The invitation aims to examine thoroughly the details of the upcoming negotiations, according to an unidentified diplomat quoted by Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. Kohler is set to meet with officials of the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation to discuss his vision and his proposals that would help end the four-decade-long conflict over the region. Kohler, who sent invitations to the parties to the conflict in January, hopes to devise a new vision and strategies to find a mutually acceptable solution to end the conflict. In January, Kohler held talks in Addis Ababa with the African Union Commission Chairperson Mussa Faki Mahamat and Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame about the Western Sahara conflict. The Personal Envoy hopes to provide the African Union with the opportunity to propose solutions that could help resolve the conflict permanently. El Moussaoui El Ajlaoui, a Moroccan political observer and an expert of African affairs told Akhbar El Yaoum that “the rules of negotiations should be made in Morocco and not in Brussels, Berlin, or Addis Ababa, because Morocco is a major part of the conflict.” According to El Ajlaoui, Morocco will refuse the UN’s vision to involve other parties in the conflict, considering it a lobby against Morocco. Kohler’s meetings with the African leaders came four days after his official meeting with the EU’s High Representative Federica Mogherini, in Brussels on January 9. During the meeting, the two high officials “exchanged views on the relaunch of the UN peace process for Western Sahara,” according to an official statement by the European Union External Action. A few weeks after his African-European visits, Kohler sent invitations to Morocco, Mauritania, the Polisario, and its supporter, Algeria for “indirect negotiations,” a move highly welcomed by the separatist front and its supporter. However, Morocco denied any direct or indirect negotiations with the front due to the continuous provocative actions carried out in the region. Despite Morocco’s absence from the negotiations table, Kohler has received a delegation of the Polisario Front, led by the separatist group leader, Ibrahim Ghali in Berlin, Germany.  On Thursday, February 8, the UNSG Personal Envoy also held consultations on the Sahara issue with a Mauritanian delegation led by Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Isselkou Ould Ahled Izid Bih. The meeting with the Mauritanian delegation was attended by Mauritania’s advisor to the presidency, Mohamed Lemine Ould Dadde, and Jaroullah Inallah, director of international cooperation at the Foreign Ministry, reported Mauritania’s official news agency, AMI.

By Sarah Goodman Rabat – As the former president and first lady of the United States unveiled their respective portraits on Monday in Washington D.C., Barack and Michelle Obama offered a glimpse of how they want their legacy to be seen and remembered. The Obamas’ portraits follow an established Washington tradition: the National Portrait Gallery has commissioned portraits of outgoing US presidents and first ladies since 1962. However, the Obamas are an unprecedented couple and they continue to break new ground in terms of representation and whom they entrust to represent them. Just as Barack and Michelle Obama became the first African American couple to be featured on the walls of the Presidential Gallery, so did Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald become the first black artists to create official presidential portraits for the Smithsonian Institution. Reflecting to the audience, Michelle Obama admitted to feeling “a little overwhelmed” by occasion. “As you may have guessed, I don’t think there is anybody in my family who has ever had a portrait done, let alone a portrait that will be hanging in the National Gallery,” she told the press, celebrities, and politicians present. “I’m also thinking of all the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who … will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution,” she added. “I know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls.” Both Wiley and Sherald are portraitists who specialize in painting African Americans and in rendering aspects of black culture. Neither of the Obamas had seen the finished product before the unveiling took place. Mr. Obama, for his part, seemed delighted with the painting, showing him leaning forward intently while seated, suspended in a verdant backdrop of vines and flowers. Kehinde Wiley is known for august portraits of African American figures and has formerly painted such icons as Michael Jackson, Grandmaster Flash, and the Notorious B.I.G.  The former President admired the artist’s approach to challenging “conventional views of power and privilege,” although he asked Wiley to resist painting him “like Napoleon.” “I have enough political problems,” said Mr. Obama to laughter from the audience. While less famous than Wiley, Amy Sherald has honed another approach to African American portraiture. (Until relatively recently, she maintained a side job waiting tables at a restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland.) Michelle Obama appears seated, wearing a sleeveless white dress with several geometric, quilt-like patterns. Although Sherald selected a more subdued palette for her painting, her subject appears no less regal. The former first lady’s hair, arms, and face are different gray shades, which is one of Sherald’s signature ways of painting the skin tone of her African American subjects. The artist has described the influence that black and white photography has had on her style of portraiture. At Monday’s ceremony, Barack Obama thanked Sherald for painting his wife “so spectacularly” and capturing the “grace, beauty, intelligence, charm, and hotness of the woman that I love.”

Rabat – The third millennium saw the advent of the digital revolution in a very spectacular way: computers invaded every home and place of work, the Internet became as important  as a morsel of bread, if not more. Satellite television revolutionized our taste, hype and culture and smart phones affected greatly our social habits. Thus, information and communications technology – ITC – became part and parcel of our daily life. Today, we all wonder, earnestly, how did we cope with life before this revolution? Back in the 60s of the last century, the visionary Canadian scientist Marshall McLuhan prophesized the future omnipotence of ITC by arguing that the world will become a “planetary village” and so it became. The distances have shrunk dramatically allowing constant exchange between people and giving international trade an incredible boost, very beneficial to humanity at large. This technology affected positively almost every area of our civilization: telemedicine has developed tremendously, electronic  education spread all over the campuses and artificial intelligence has known quite a positive metamorphosis: driverless cars have made their apparition, drones are becoming normal accessories of life and sophisticated robots are rolling off assembly lines and apparently some of them can display humor and basic feelings. For Henning Meyer, editor-in-Chief of Social Europe and a Research Associate of the Public Policy Group at the London School of Economics and Political Science, presents the digital revolution in the following words. “The digital revolution, used here as shorthand for broader technological change, is one of today’s most hotly debated topics in politics, economics and business. It makes politicians wary about which preparatory policies to pursue, economists ponder productivity increases and trade unions think about the future of work. We are undoubtedly faced with large-scale disruptions in many areas that require adjustments. Most people, however, are struggling to get a firm grip on the subject. They ask: what does this all mean for me and the organizations I am part of? What does technological change mean for my job? What kind of policies could be pursued in order to address these new challenges? To analyse exposure to the digital revolution and potential policy solutions you need to start breaking it down into manageable dimensions. Three areas in particular warrant special attention: What are the forces shaping the application of new technologies? What does the digital revolution mean for the future of work? And what kind of policies could help to address these issues?” ITC is definitely making our lives easy; we can communicate  at will and on end, work from our homes and pay our standing bills online. We can consult our bank accounts day and night and make whatever transactions are necessary, including stock market operations. We can order food or a call a cab, buy an airline ticket and purchase any desired goods, any time we want and we can, also, choose our life partner as we want him or her to be. The digital revolution is, of course, also, affecting greatly the economy: stock markets are all digitized to ease operations and to avoid potential crushes ahead of time. Of course, we all remember the horrific crush of the Wall Street on October 29, 1929 known as the Black Tuesday that ultimately led to the Great Depression that lasted until 1941 worldwide. Social media has become an important aspect of our lives. We can talk to family and friends anytime, exchange photos and documents,  play online, etc. Facebook has a membership of 3,5 billion around the globe; it is a social media for work, education,  gossip and the pursuit for narcissistic  inclinations. But, it is, also, a real forum of debate and discussion along with other social media and the home of cyber democracy in which people can express freely their ideas and criticism in total anonymity. Thanks to the social media, the Arab Spring materialized  and brought hope of change to this world suffocated for ages by harsh dictatorships and stifling tribal and patriarchal systems of governance. Prior to the advent the social media, demonstrators were easily detected by mukhabarat (political police) and arrested before they  opened their mouth. With social media they were able to plan their protest, specify the venue and inform the world before the police knew and arrested them. They had, also, the possibility to stream  their activities to the world to see and react to. In many ways one can say that social media was the powerhouse of the Arab uprisings. In this regard, Heather Brown (journalist specialized in Arab media), Emily Guskin (journalist specialized in Hispanic media market) and Amy Mitchell (Director of   Journalism Research) argue quite rightly. “Almost immediately after the Arab uprisings began, there was debate over the role and influence of social media in the ouster of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the imminent overthrow of Mubarak. In covering what some deemed the Facebook or Twitter revolutions, the media focused heavily on young protesters mobilizing in the streets in political opposition, smartphones in hand. And since then, the violent and sectarian unrest in Syria has brought increased attention to the role of citizen journalism. Social media indeed played a part in the Arab uprisings. Networks formed online were crucial in organizing a core group of activists, specifically in Egypt. Civil society leaders in Arab countries emphasized the role of “the internet, mobile phones, and social media” in the protests. Additionally, digital media has been used by Arabs to exercise freedom of speech and as a space for civic engagement.” So, the applications of ITC are very beneficial  because in many ways they are making life easy to everyone  and what’s more computers are taking over many tasks and jobs done by humans and this however could have a negative effect on the long run if humans lose their bread winner occupations that could, ultimately, antagonize them and make them detest the use of machines. The explosion of ITC all over the world is creating knowledge societies in which knowledge can be used by people equally to improve their lives and further their legitimate desire of better living conditions. Hence, UNESCO calls, with much strength, for building knowledge societies worldwide to create opportunities of wellbeing, wealth and happiness to all humans equally. “Knowledge and information have significant impact on people’s lives. The sharing of knowledge and information, particularly through Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has the power to transform economies and societies. UNESCO works to create inclusive knowledge societies and empower local communities by increasing access to and preservation and sharing of information and knowledge in all of UNESCO’s domains. Knowledge societies must build on four pillars: freedom of expression; universal access to information and knowledge; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity; and quality education for all.” This concluding article returns to the broad question that motivates this special issue of Studies in Comparative International Development: Will the Digital Revolution constitute a revolution in development? In addressing this issue, we explore a number of common themes emphasized by the different contributions: The future of the North-South divide, the role of the state in promoting digital development, the transferability and adaptability of specific information and communication technologies, the challenges and potential benefits of controlling digital information, and the developmental effects of digitally enabled communities. We argue that the Digital Revolution’s ultimate impact on development will depend on several key variables, including the extent to which these technologies foster within-country linkages among different sectors and socioeconomic classes; The degree to which new technological applications may be customized or transformed to advance local development; And the outcome of political contests between organized interests that are promoting different ways of organizing and governing the global digital economy. While it is difficult to fully assess a transformation while living in the midst of it, research on the social, political, and economic implications of the Digital Revolution will constitute an important agenda for development scholars in the years to come. The author also argues ICTs should not be limited to just computers and Internet, but offer a variety of learning solutions. The paper covers current initiatives designed to bring ICTs into African schools, including their successes and failures. Unwin advocates focusing on using ICT for education instead of just educating people on how to use ICTs. The author also advocates locally produced content so the curriculum is relevant. The paper discusses other principles of good practice as well. Unwin concludes by proposing a framework to put his principles into use. The paper includes criticisms from Malcolm Gladwell and others claiming social networking is low-risk participation. The author also discusses how readily Africa has adapted to mobile phone technology. Wasserman argues these phones have begun to bridge the digital divide. While the paper still points out limitations, it argues the technology has still changed Africa’s social practices. The article then discusses areas where mobile phones have made an impact in participation in government on both a national and local level. Wasserman also describes the business impact of mobile phones. Finally, the author examines the continent’s preference to use the technology to connect with local friends and family instead of the global network. The use of computers would push for general artificial intelligence, more sophisticated  and more risky, a move that could rekindle machine phobia among humans as a result of the legitimate  fear of seeing intelligent machines dominate humanity like in science fiction  films. In this particular case, alas, the digital revolution could herald the end of humanity. Another negative side effect of the digital revolution  is that social media is somehow destroying the social fabric. Children spend most of their time on social media and neglect socializing with their parents and discussing their problems  with them. Maybe in the future the concept of family will change dramatically to become anonymous of belonging and identity no more. You can follow Professor Mohamed Chtatou on Twitter: @Ayurinu

Rabat – A friend to whom I can refuse nothing wrote to me asking my opinion about what he called the degradation of the notoriety of Islam. The question took me by surprise. In fact, the impression I had was contrary to his perception. For me, Islam was making a strong come back, a surge unprecedented since the first centuries of its advent. I thought that fewer Muslims were challenging the foundations of their faith. I was thankful to my friend for his question because he gave me a new perspective. I decided to review the dominating religious discourse. I analyzed the data based on how rational, coherent, historically sound, and objective it was. This was especially important considering the “faithful” who are making news promoting, fighting, dying, killing, and seeking political power through Islam. To address my friend’s question in a manner pertinent to his concerns, I tried to understand what made him ask that specific question. I assumed he must have supposed that Muslims are going through some sort of cultural or identity crisis and/or that their religion has been suffering from some fatal ailments. Maybe he saw signs that Islam was undergoing a sudden anarchic multiplication of malign ideological outgrowths or that it is splitting into competing segments. Perhaps, just as many others, including Muslims, my friend must have difficulties identifying which is the authentic Islam from the feuding scores each of which claims it, alone, is the true one, and therefore, the only one entitled to prevail. This conviction of prevalence would not have been a problem were it of a pure intellectual nature. It appears that the multiple rites and sects of the faith that have been until recently celebrated as being able to coexist, and may actually have done so at times, has suddenly and unexpectedly diverted from their peaceful trajectories. As a matter of fact, after long centuries of complete darkness and silencing of the mind, the aura that maintained the myth and sacredness of religious discourses, started to dim and to allow clearer visibility. Religious discourse grew vulnerable, exposed to the close scrutiny of all. The spread of education, literacy and of information technology as well as satellite television broadcasting freely from non Muslim countries exposed flaws in religious discourse to a wider majority. The once well kept secrets that empowered the privileged few could now reveal their incoherence, ambiguity, lies, and their treachery. Women are among those formerly excluded who have stepped in with force. In fact, the entry of women to the field has already had significant impact in many countries including Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. The hard line discourse has given way under collective political ideological pressure placed by women and other new scholars. Increased literacy rates have stripped the old scholars of the myth they had built around themselves for centuries. New scholars have brought voices and attitudes to the population. While the denial of reason, of intelligence, of questioning and of challenging is rejected, the right to know, to be listened to and to require relevant and updated answers is being claimed. Furthermore, propositions of translations into vernacular and local varieties of the Arabic language that have gone viral on social media have demythologized texts. No wonder, the gatekeepers of the religious temple have opposed and are opposing these translations and these programs with utmost violence. Likewise, doubt, which is a prohibited intellectual faculty to the layperson in the religious tradition, has become unavoidable as scientific information has become more accessible. New information challenges many fundamentals of the rigid religious discourse about the universe, creation, biology, physiology, history, psychology, sociology, etc.. The stubbornness of religious scholarship has thus become its major foe. The discourse of the religious establishment and of its leading scholars has become esoteric, inaccessible, and unreliable. Books about the end and the death of the major pillars of the religious heritage are widely circulated. New profiles of scholars trained in religious matters but also in the modern human sciences are entering the discourse. Arguments deconstructing the foundations of common knowledge, beliefs and convictions have never been as accessible to as many as they are nowadays. One such example is the reduction of the dominating religious discourse of all peoples in North Africa and the Middle East into one origin, namely, that of Arabia. Kurdish, Amazigh, Yezedi, African and other origins are forced into a conception of the region that either acknowledges its Arabism or is treated as heathen, sold out to Western ideologies and interests, and anti-Islam. The forced overlap of a faith onto a racial condition in defiance to historical and geographical facts that have been occulted for centuries but which science has proved wrong has led this religious discourse to absurd theories positing the Arabic language and race as the prototypes of all others in the region. Such discourse has thus defeated its own agendas and has become responsible for its own decay and degradation. The role social media is playing in this transformation of the relationship of individuals and groups to religion and religious discourse is of paramount importance. In addition to providing platforms to all the trends, sects, rites and to all types of attitudes and cultures, social media has also exposing the private lives of leading figures of the opposing parties. Whether through fake news, fabricated images or through reports of actual events, social media has disclosed the contradictions and hypocrisy of manipulative opinion leaders. Cases of lecherous behaviors bother men and women who teach and claim modesty, chastity, loyalty and generosity. One issue that is being discussed is the invitation of Muslims to engage in jihad. The paradox lies in that those proselytizers campaigning for jihad do not engage in it themselves nor do they engage their own offspring to sacrifice their lives in exchange of better ones in the thereafter in compliance with their propaganda. Instead, they collect huge amounts of money from their campaigns and spend it on themselves and on their children to enjoy the pleasures of life on Earth. Such discourse is especially appealing among younger generations and adolescents who have difficulties relating to the mainstream way of life both in their own societies and in foreign countries, which are predominantly Christian. This is due to the chronic insufficiency of socializing institutions, the lack of success models, the unavailability of viable opportunities, school failure, idleness, unemployment, marginalization and discrimination. Other reasons are more subjective and include perceived racism that may be real at times, a deep feeling of pain resulting from being left out. Not the least of all these factors is the culture in which wealth and luxury are the measure of worth and relevance of humans. The consequent disappointment, feeling of loss, hopelessness and despair of all the categories of factors create situations conducive to the positive response to the radical and extremist discourse of these propagandists of fundamentalist attitudes. Claims of the urgency of drastic reforms of millenary legislation deeply rooted in the tradition of religious teachings and commandments are not only being discussed and claimed but actually acted upon and implemented. The social status of women that is being transformed away from the mainstream religious tradition in many countries is but one example. Overt challenges of religious ideologies and imposed behaviors are witnessed in the most suppressive and oppressive regimes and more people, women and men, are standing up against them and taking huge risks to their freedom and their lives. Resistance is, however, literally deadly and is justified by the obligation to maintain the status quo that is presented as the divine will and natural order. The confrontation is among trends that limit the approach to tradition to acceptance, total adherence and submission and those that range from questioning it, submitting it to criticism, and to reasonable adaptation and updating to calls for the total removal of the religious factor from the public sphere. Religion, for the latter trend, is and should remain a private variable that has to be kept away from legislation, politics and professional and social ethics and morality. The argument is that throughout history the closest religion had been to any of these spheres, the consequences were the rise of egocentrism, ethnocentrism, hatred, exclusion of minorities, excessive exploitation of humans in diverse forms of forced labor, abuse of the dignity and physical integrity of humans, monopolization of power and of wealth by a few that do not hesitate to impose their authority by coercion and extreme violence. Increased accessibility to new and critical versions of history has disclosed the absurdity of many accounts that had been held at face value to be self evident and which were manipulated to support and maintain convictions and beliefs and to justify the status quo and the rule of dynasties, tribes, other groups. The crisis which my friend, who must be waiting for my response to his query, has mentioned must be one of the types that accompany every metamorphosis and renewal. In other words, it is the pain that heralds radical change. The syndrome that transformation is underway in societies in which Islam has been part of the culture for so long it has shaped mindsets, behaviors and imagination and in which people are aware they have either to reinvent their religion to make room for contemporariness and modernity or it will slip out of their control  before they can see it disappear or turn into something they would not be proud of. The crisis may be the symptom of the attitudes that support ignorance, imitation, the skill of reproducing models, of mistrust, of fear and of essentializing marginal issues. This is to invest the universe of knowledge, creation, innovation, critical thinking, responsibility, solidarity, acknowledgment of the centrality of the human, the prominence of reality over any transcendence, confidence, responsibility and accountability.

Rabat – While Madrid has agreed to respond to the Amazigh World Assembly’s (AMA) request concerning the use of chemical weapons by King’s Alfonso XIII military during the Rif War from 1921-1926, the language used by the foreign minister demonstrates that Spain continues to refuse to apologize to the Moroccan people for the use of prohibited chemical weapons. In a video posted on AMA’s YouTube channel, the Spain’s Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said that “as a result of the request of the king, they were received in the Spanish embassy to submit their demands and also examine possible ways of cooperation;we will see the follow up to this question.”  The head of the Spanish diplomacy was answering a question raised during a parliamentary meeting by Joan Tarda, member of the Esquerra Republicana, who for more than a decade has been at the forefront of efforts aimed at pushing the Spanish government to admit its use of chemical weapons in the Rif war.  While the Spanish Minster used diplomatic language, showing his willingness to hear AMA’s demands, he fell short of expressing his country’s readiness to admit its wrongdoings during the Rif war and apologize to the Moroccan people for the use chemical weapons on the civilian population in the Rif region. The AMA request calls the Spanish authorities to make an official apology to the Rif people and to compensate the victims or their dependents. A previous letter concerning the same topic was submitted by AMA to King Felipe VI on February 12, 2015. The AMA calls coincided with the call addressed by another Moroccan ONG. According to Middle East Monitor, the Moroccan Centre de la Mémoire Commune, la Démocratie et la Paix (Center for Common Memory, Democracy and Peace) called on the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs to make good on his pledges to respond to the requests of Moroccan civil society organizations calling on Spain to shed light on its use of chemical weapons against the Moroccan population of the Rif region between 1921 and 1926. It seems that Spain is still not ready to open an investigation on this incident during its colonial period in northern Morocco.  Following the crushing defeat of Spanish troops in the Annoual battle in July 1921, which resulted in the death of over 14,000 soldiers at the hands of the Moroccan resistance led by Mohammed Bin Abdelkrim El Khattabi, historians, and many Spanish and foreign observers report that Spain used chemical and toxic gas indiscriminately against the civilian population of the Rif. British scholar Sebastian Balfour and Spain María Rosa de Madariaga are among the scholars that testify to Spain’s chemical retaliation, which was intended to inflict the maximum damage to the population in the Rif by targeting the most populated towns and villages and intensifying attacks during market days. The attacks represent an egregious violation of the Treaty of Versaille of 1919, which prohibited the use of chemical weapons, and to which Spain was a party.  This violation of international law has left long-lasting disastrous effects on the population of the region. As of today, the pervasiveness of cancer in the population of the Rif is the highest among all Moroccan regions. Though no empirical study has established so far a causality between the use of chemical weapons and the prevalence of cancer in the region, many believe that this prevalence is due to the use of chemical weapons. According to Reuters, 80 percent of cases of larynx cancer in Morocco are found in the Rif region.

Rabat – Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita participated on Monday, February 12, in the ministerial meeting of the anti-Daesh coalition held in Kuwait, shedding light on the terrorist threats facing Africa. “[We must] take stock of our joint struggle against ISIS, to define the guidelines that will help renew our commitment, to consolidate in the future our base of achievements and to continue our joint action in the face of this persistent threat,” he said in a call for the Arab coalition. According to a report by the American think tank, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, between 58 and 300 Moroccans have fought with ISIS in Libya, some of whom are seeking to return to the country undercovered. And while Iraq has taken full control of the Iraqi-Syrian border, nearly 6,000 African ISIS fighters are expected to return to Africa, posing continental and national threats. “We observe that many of these fighters are trying to return to their countries of origin or residence, or to re-deploy to third countries where they aim to strengthen their ranks in terrorist organizations in different regions of the world, “explained Bourita, calling for “particular attention to the changing situation in Africa.” Africa remains one of the first targets of deadly attacks, he said, revealing that between January and October 2017, 343 terrorist attacks have resulted in more than 2,600 victims. Faced with such a threat, “Africa has taken its responsibility to fight and eradicate terrorist threats.” Bourita also called for greater vigilance in terms of the dynamics of the terrorist organization, specifically “the evolution of its structures, its ability to mobilize sympathizers and to lead attacks around the world.” Morocco remain convinced that the transnational nature of the threat “requires comprehensive, cooperative, and united efforts,” as the only way to formulate effective methods to fight terrorism. Bourita said that Morocco’s anti-terrorist bodies have successfully dismantled many terrorist cells targeting not only in Morocco but also in its neighboring countries. “This has indeed earned the kingdom international recognition as a stable partner and a true vector of security.” He told the members of the coalition that Morocco had made the strategic choice to promote solidarity-based on South-South, North-South, and triangular cooperation, “which is reflected in the implementation of concrete projects with several countries in areas essential to stability and human and sustainable development.” He recalled that Morocco’s strategy in the fight against terrorism and radicalization has become a reference in the United Nations today.

Rabat – One of UK’s biggest charity organizations (and a Polisario supporter), Oxfam, as been accused by the Times for covering a 2011 investigation that showed that two of its workers involved in a sex scandal were appointed to senior humanitarian roles in Haiti. A leaked document from the Times shows that Haiti’s national director and senior Oxfam workers paid local prostitutes for sex, some of them underage girls. Allegedly, a “full-on Caligula orgy” took place at Oxfam’s headquarters in the earthquake-devastated nation, where the NGO was giving aid to locals. The head of mission in Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, was forced to resign when Oxfam learned of the abuses. Oxfam “allowed Mr Van Hauwermeiren a ‘phased and dignified’ resignation in 2011 to protect the charity’s reputation,” wrote the Times. “Despite being asked about Mr Van Hauwermeiren, Oxfam did not pass information about the circumstances of his resignation to the French charity Action Against Hunger when it hired him as its mission chief in Bangladesh in 2012. He remained with the French charity until 2014,” it added. After the scandal made headlines, Oxfam’s deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned, admitting that allegations about Hauwermeiren sex affair,was raised in the UK headquarters before he moved to Haiti, but not handled properly. “I am desperately sorry for the harm and distress that this has caused to Oxfam’s supporters, the wider development sector, and most of all, the vulnerable people who trusted us,” she said. Haiti’s president commented on the incident on Monday saying that “there is nothing more outrageous and dishonest than a sexual predator who uses his position as part of the humanitarian response to a natural disaster to exploit needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability.” Meanwhile, UK government is threatening Oxfam to cut its funds, reports the Guardian. The European commission, which also gives as much funding as the UK government to Oxfam  said that “We are ready to review and if needed cease funding any partner who is not living up to the required high ethical standards.”

Rabat – A map featuring a Morocco without the Sahara has allegedly been displayed at the Casablanca book fair. According to reports, an editor from Egypt—a country which was invited as special guest at the SIEL (Book and Editing Salon)—displayed a book entitled A Summary of General African History. The book is said to be about national liberation movements and to have allegedly featured the Polisario-proclaimed Saharawi republic as an example of such nationalist movements. Hasan El Ouazzani, director of the book fair told the press, in the aftermath of the incident, that the said book was removed from its stand as soon as the “provocative message” was noticed by organizers. As news of the sensitive and contentious incident sparked numerous controversies on a number of media, the organizing committee of the event released a press statement to reassure Moroccans that adequate measures had been taken to prevent an incident such as this. “The organizing committee of the Casablanca Book Fair reports that the Monitoring Committee has monitored all the books displayed in the publishers’ gallery, and it has confirmed that the book has not been present in those galleries. The Directorate confirms that the joint committee of various government sectors has been working for three months in accordance with the legal standards governing the exhibition and in accordance with the requirements of the related terms of services, as well as the provisions of the Press and Publication Law. The Committee had withdrawn some of the copies that were to be exhibited”, said the press release. But these belated cautionary measures did not prove sufficient enough to soothe the tension and uproar that the incident had already provoked in the country. Observers and commentators have pointed out that giving the green light to such a book at an important national cultural event deserves to be harshly reprimanded as it is an unforgivable blow to the kingdom’s territorial integrity, with some adding that a map such the one featured in the book fuels the propagandists’ chimera of an impossible republic. Commenting on the organization committee’s reassuring message, which it found unconvincing, Le 360, one of the country’s leading francophone outlets, fumed: “Had this reprehensible incident taken place in some place overseas, it could have been understandable… But this violation of our territorial integrity has happened under our nose, and we deserve due clarifications from relevant ministry.” “This can’t be left unpunished”, the outlet concluded, particularly stressing that more vigilance and caution will from now on be required to prevent the “enemies of the kingdom” from having the kind of visibility and ‘legitimacy’, however bogus, that this unfortunate incident may have given to their cause.

Rabat – Although online launchings have gained wide currency with entrepreneurs, Morocco has still not passed a bill that allows such a practice. But according to recent reports, online launching will soon be realizable in Moroccan business world. Announced nearly 5 years ago, the project of modernizing entrepreneurship was only submitted to the assessment of relevant ministers late last January. The reform, which will be implemented by the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC), seeks to facilitate and shorten the required procedures to launch a business in Morocco. “Since its announcement, we were starting to despair, as this reform had been adopted everywhere else but in some few African countries. The question now is what agenda implementation will follow. But whatever that is, this [the reform] is surely going to be a step forwards in facilitating the creation of national or international SMEs and small businesses, which, discouraged by our bureaucracy, often chose the informal sector”, said a stake-holder in a Casablanca-based giant company and who, later fuming about the long time it is taking to implement the reform, said that the idea of launching a company online is nothing but “a humbug.” The new bill, however, specifies that it will soon be possible to launch a business in just 24 hours. The bill also delegates all relevant authorities to the OMPIC which will coordinate and monitor all the required administrative steps to launch a business online. It is expected that OMPIC will alleviate the inefficiency and administrative nonchalance which prevailed in previous institutions charged with implementing the new bill. “Although its implementation is faced with unnecessary delays, once the new bill is approved by the Government Council, Morocco will quickly become a country that is connected and responsive to industrial or commercial financing”, said an OMPIC worker. The OMPIC informant also explained that once the bill is adopted, company’s statutes can be accessed online, which, he stressed, will put an end to the traditionally slow and inefficient requirements of old bureaucratic norms. Creating a business will no longer take one week or 20 days, or the often financially demanding step of hiring trust companies, explained the informant before adding, quite optimistic, that: “All the online steps will allow [entrepreneurs] entry in the commercial register and very quickly launch their business.” The implementation of the new bill is said to be expected in the second half of 2018, as still needs to be adopted by parliament and then published in the Official Bulletin. Before then, as the OMPIC is still committed to shortening the delay for launching businesses, the current procedures are as follows: acquiring a negative certification (48h), legalization and registering the company’s statutes (1 week), registration in the commercial register (48h), publication of the launching in a in the Official Bulletin and a local newspaper, and affiliation to the CNSS (24-48h).

Rabat – The Swedish fashion group H&amp;M was compelled to remove a set of Children’s socks from its stores, after receiving complaints claiming that the garment has a logo motif with a jackhammer supposedly resembling the prints of “Allah” if viewed upside down, Swedish media outlets reported. “The print on the sock depicts a Lego figure and that it would resemble a sign for something else is entirely coincidental. But since customers have responded, we have chosen to remove the socks,” says Petra Buchinger, head of press relations at H&amp;M. She added that H&amp;M is “constantly looking over its range, and that it strives to offer products that they think customers will appreciate.” The incident comes just weeks after the clothing giant was slammed for racism over its advertising of “coolest monkey in the jungle” hoodie that featured a black child model. “We have learned from the event with the sweater and have further strengthened our internal routines,” noted Buchinger. The ad sparked a widespread backlash for what many said was an “insensitive association between the young model and a hateful slur against black people.” In response, Members of South Africa’s Economic Freedom Fighters ransacked several H&amp;M branches in South Africa, tearing down displays and throwing clothes around, while staging demonstrations at other branches. Shortly after the outrage broke out, the Sweden-based group apologized in a statement adding that the image has been removed from all H&amp;M channels.  “Our position is simple, we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry,” the apology reads.

Rabat – While Morocco’s Minister for Human Rights Mustapha Ramid bluntly condemns consensual sexual relations out of wedlock, his counterpart in the justice department Mohammed Aujjar has declared that “Consensual sexual relations between adults do not concern society,” calling for respect of private and personal life.   In an interview conducted by the media outlet Hespress, Aujjar suggested another reading of the premarital sexual relations debacle that continues to raise many heated debates in Morocco, saying,”Consensual sexual relations between adults, without violence, do not concern society,” though the exercise of individual freedoms should be in accordance with the society’s values and respect public space.  “Freedom is a sacred value, and everyone can practice it according to their own convictions; but we must remind ourselves that we live in a Muslim and conservative society, which implies the respect of public space. We must always triumph for freedom, and for respect of private and personal life, but the exercise of these freedoms should not go beyond public space. “Consensual sexual relations, for example, between adults without violence, do not concern society… But they should not provoke the feelings of others, and whoever wants to exercise his/her freedom will do so; but he/she must respect others,” the minister explained.  The debate over sexual relations in Morocco has increased in intensity since 2012. After a group of Moroccan activists called on the Ministry of Justice to repeal article 490 of the Penal Code, authorizing premarital sexual relations between adults. Under the current Penal Code article, Moroccans can be jailed up to one year for having sexual relations outside marriage, especially if neighbors file a lawsuit against an unmarried couple. However, the couple is only arrested if the suspects confess or are “red-handed” by authorities during the sexual act.  However, foreign couples are exempt from this law, or at least they are not a part of the equation, given that there is no law that actually allows or forbids foreign couples from booking one room for two adults without a marriage contract.  A study conducted by the Moroccan Health Ministry in 2007 indicated that “36 percent of young Moroccan men have had sex outside marriage, while the number of unmarried young women who have lost their virginity is much lower, at 15 percent.” The actual percentage of people having sex before marriage is undoubtedly higher, as few people would honestly answer such a question. The criminalization of premarital sexual relations is mainly based on Islamic law, which bans unmarried people from engaging in sexual activity. In December 2012, 22 feminist organisations called to repeal Penal Code Article 490, which prohibits sexual relations outside of marriage in Morocco. Following these demands, former Justice Minister Ramid, who belongs to Morocco’s ruling Islamist party, declared his opposition, saying that “these sexual relationships undermine the foundations of our society.”

Rabat – The number of people who were killed on roads in Morocco decreased by 2.62 percent in 2017, State Secretary for Transport Mohammed Najib Boulif said on Monday in Rabat. During a Road Security Standing Committee meeting, appropriately marking National Road Safety Day, Boulif shared initial statistics, which reveal that 3,499 fatalities were recorded in 2017 against 3,593 in 2016.  According to Boulif, the number of fatalities due to road accidents recorded in urban areas last year reached 943 accidents, representing a 4.17 percent year-on-year decrease. More than 2,550 other people were killed in rural areas, recording a 2.03 percent decrease. In 2017, 89,998 traffic accidents were reported, representing 9.99 percent rise compared to 2016. However, the number of fatal road accidents totaled 3,085 in 2017, representing 2.47 percent. Boulif added that 9,175 people were critically injured due to road accidents in 2017, representing a 1.51 percent year-on-year increase. The number of light injuries recorded during the same year reached 119,138. Despite great efforts and measures which have been taken to minimize road accidents, road mortality is still a huge problem in Morocco. Eighteen people were killed and 1,309 were injured in 1,309 road accidents in urban areas in May 2017 alone. These accidents were mainly ascribed to pedestrian and driver errors, driving under the influence of alcohol, excessive speeding, and not respecting rules of right-of-way, according to the General Directorate for National Security (DGSN). A statement issued in February 2018 by DGSN says that 1,469 people have already been injured, including 83 seriously, in 1,108 traffic accidents that occurred in urban areas on January 29 to February 4, 2018.

Rabat – Contrary to what has been reported by Moroccan media recently, The National Rally of Independents (RNI) has not been boycotting government meetings, said Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid on Tuesday. In the last few days, several Moroccan news outlets questioned the absence of RNI’s ministers from government meetings, including the recent government council that took place on Thursday, February 8. RNI officials were not in attendance at a meeting chaired by Saad Eddine El Othmani in Oujda on February 10, which led to speculation among opposition parties and press. In a statement, which was received by Morocco World News on Tuesday, Morocco’s Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS) criticized both the RNI and the Socialist Union of Popular Forces political parties for boycotting the governing council meeting. In the press release, the PPS voiced its “rejection of political and partisan practice that does not respect constitutional missions.” PPS added that “the political bureau of the PPS has addressed the negative interactions that have recently occurred between the majority parties, to the point of arousing unprecedented and inappropriate reactions, in a total lack of respect for constitutional duties.” Ramid, who is a member of the Justice and Development Party, said that RNI members, in fact, have not been boycotting government meetings. The minister voiced his remarks on the sidelines of the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) forum held in Rabat on Tuesday. The minister emphasized that “all the ministers who were absent from the government council on February 8 were taking care of other duties.” “My RNI friends told me that there was no boycott.” During El Othmani’s visit to Oujda, Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture and Secretary General of the RNI, called El Othmani to reassure him that there is no boycott, but that he was in fact engaged in other projects, said Ramid. “So far, we are not aware of any boycott, and if so, it is not acceptable,” he added.

Rabat – In the wake of the protests in the Oriental region against social injustices and after the deaths of three miners, the Wali of the region has created an “outline of an ambitious plan of socio-economic development of the province.” The release of a comprehensive action plan comes two days after the head of government’s visit to Oujda.  Mouad El Jamai, the Wali of the Oriental Region and governor of the prefecture of Oujda-Angad, said on Monday in Jerada that he prepared an outline for a plan that would meet the expectations of citizens. The plan, presented at a meeting with youth representatives in the province, includes “effective measures that place the citizen at the center of the agenda and meet residents’ expectations in terms of employment, improved living conditions and life, accompanying social changes and preserving the environment.” He said that it includes emergency measures including the creation of some 1,000 jobs, out of which 300 would benefit workers involved in clandestine coal mines. If the plan is implemented, and with the active support of local stakeholders, the mining city will see the launch of an expansion of the city’s industrial zone that will house various economic production units and micro-enterprises that will generate about 1,500 additional jobs in the short term. The plan will also better organize the work of miners by connecting them with mining companies and cooperatives while offering them the opportunity to market and sell their coal production to the National Electricity Board. Meanwhile, the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) will open a new branch at its headquarters in the province which will identify and support specialized proposals by stakeholders and entrepreneurs who wish to start job-generating projects. Projects will benefit from technical assistance and project promotion. In parallel with these emergency measures, an employment program was set up to create 5,000 direct jobs in several sectors, including agriculture with the mobilization of 3,000 hectares of land for farming. This plan also includes 108 projects to reinforce the infrastructure, fund road construction, and support education, health, water and electricity sectors. The comprehensive development program, which will span 2018 to 2023, promises a reduction in social and economic disparities in the region with an overall program cost of MAD 500 million dirhams. The INDH will also work on creating recreational sites in the city, including a swimming pool, library and a youth center. The plan also includes the establishment of a project support fund for designated at-risk populations including young people in the province, unemployed miners, as well as single and destitute women who lack family support. In terms of urban development, the plan will focus resources in high-poverty neighborhoods and it includes the creation of a mining museum in Jerada to preserve the heritage of the province, while “other projects will soon see the light of day,” said the Wali. Under the plan, the region will see the extension of the Practical School of Mines and the construction and the equipping of a vocational-technical school, envisioned as an Institute of Applied Technology (ISTA) of Jerada. The institute will recruit and train unemployed young adults for careers in the thermal stations. In the health sector, the emphasis was placed on strengthening the human and physical resources of the Jerada Provincial Hospital. This includes the assignment of three doctors specializing in cardiology, respiratory diseases and rheumatology, the organization of medical caravans for the region and the addition of two ambulances for the benefit of the Provincial Delegation of Health. The Wali said that steps were taken to initiate an investigation into the HOM liquidation process and the immediate suspension of five mining licenses. In terms of problems related to unpaid water and electricity bills, accommodation will be granted to consumers regarding the payment of arrears and their rescheduling, late payment penalty forgiveness, and the application of monthly invoicing on the basis of an accurate monthly consumption. Additionally, there will be a distribution of low-energy usage lamps for families in need. The National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) is also committed to the installation of prepaid meters in urban areas, after completion of regulatory procedures. The Wali concluded that three power station units (1, 2 and 3) of the Jerada thermal station were closed because of their negative impact on the environment. The fourth unit is still used as it meets international standards.

Rabat – Bulgarian authorities arrested a Moroccan national on suspicion of links to the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), according to Sofia News Agency. The suspect, who was the subject of a search warrant by Interpol-Rabat, was arrested in the Bulgarian-Turkish border. According to Interpol, the suspect named Naufal Zahri used to work in the Department of Mechanical Engineering attached to the General Directorate of Lily Bearings in Syria. According to Sofia News Agency, the suspect was allegedly in possessions of a belt of explosives, hand grenades, firearms and ammunition. On Tuesday, February 13, Bulgarian news outlet The Sofia Globe reported that the regional count in the Bulgarian town of Haskovo ordered the Moroccan to be kept in custody for 90 days. Roumyana Arnaudova, the spokesperson of the Bulgarian Prosecutor-General’s office told the state’s National TV on Tuesday that “ninety days was the timeframe for dealing with a request for Zahri” to be repatriated to Morocco. The spokesperson added that the Moroccan suspect was the subject of a search warrant on several charges, including the setting up of a group to commit acts of terrorism, the illegal use and possession of firearms directed against the national security and public order in Morocco, receiving training, raising funds and recruiting large groups of people to join ISIS. The suspect was already arrested once in Bulgaria in January 201 for illegally crossing the border with a group of people, including women and children. Zahri was then sent to a detention center in the town of Harmanli. Zahri’s documents, which were falsified through the replacement of photographs, included a Syrian passport, a Syrian identity card, a Spanish identity card, a Syrian driving license and a family status document. Investigations by the Bulgarian authorities showed that the suspect was the subject of a search warrant by Interpol. During the investigation, Zahri denied the charges against him, claiming that he lived in Syria for four years with his family. The defendant admitted that he was aware of the search warrant issued against him in Morocco because he lived in Syria, and this what led to his escape. Anton Popov, the lawyer of the Moroccan suspect said that Zahri did not want to return to Morocco. “He fears being killed in a prison in Morocco,” said the lawyer. Popov added that Zahri did not want to be repatriated to Morocco, but instead wanted to be tried in Bulgaria and serve any prison sentence in this country.

Rabat – The situation of sub-Saharan migrants in Algeria is alarming, according to a recent RFI report. Public insults, daily humiliations, en masse expulsions, in Algeria, RFI reports, undocumented sub-Saharans live in a constant climate of fear and apprehension. RFI reported on February 12 that a considerable number of sub-Saharan migrants were packed in what looked more like a sinister detention camp than a migration center in an Algiers suburb, as they awaited expulsion from the country. Between January and February of this year, 2 to 3 thousand migrants are said to have been forcibly, and in some conditions humiliatingly, deported from Algerian territory. The migrants are said to have been arrested during night patrols monitored by Algerian Police. They are later packed in Zeralda and other centers established for the purpose of such operations, from where they are allegedly “packaged” in military trucks that “ship them” to Arlit in Niger. “We are badly treated, and I’m really scared,” one of the deported migrants told RFI, later explaining the inhumane treatments to which they were subjected and fuming about the rampant racism sub-Saharans face in Algeria. There are rumors of migrants being expulsed from Algerian and left at the mercy of the desert between Arlit in Niger Niger and Tamanrasset in Algeria, where, if they are lucky enough, after hours or days of walk, they can supposedly come across NGO or UN-sponsored missions that host and help migrants in such desperate conditions. According to RFI, IOM (International Organization for Migration) claims to have saved more than a thousand sub-Saharan migrants from the unspeakable misery and precarious life pervading the daily experiences of sub-Saharan migrants in Algiers and surrounding areas. Algeria’s migration policy has “hardened”, RFI concluded, citing Abdelmoumène Khelil, a Human Rights activist who said that it is high time that “a public debate on integrating migrants” be held in Algeria.

By Ahlam Bensaga Rabat – After two months spent imprisoned in Israel, young Palestinian “child activist,” Ahed Al-Tamimi is to face trial on Tuesday, February 13 for shaking her fist at Israeli soldiers. Recently-turned 17-year- old Ahed Al-Tamimi, known as “the icon of Palestinian resistance” against Israeli occupation in West Bank punched two Israeli soldiers upon discovering the soldiers shot her 14-year-old cousin in the head with a rubber-coated bullet, which put him in a medically-induced coma. After a video showing Ahed striking and kicking Israeli soldiers went viral, a group of Israeli Military forces barged into Tamimi’s household in the village of Nabi Saleh at 4 am on December 19, 2017, and detained Ahed for “assault” and “incitement” against Israeli security forces.  Shortly afterwards, Ahed’s mother Nariman and her 20-year-old cousin Nour who also appeared in the video were held in custody. Nariman was charged for posting videos of her daughter’s protests against Israel on Facebook, and was accused of “incit[ing] others to commit terrorist attacks”, said The Guardian News website. Her cousin Nour was also detained for taking part in the incident, but was set free on bail worth USD 1.400, said the Amnesty International news website. The judge denied bail for Ahed, saying: “The gravity of the offences of which she is accused does not allow an alternative to custody,” as reported by The Guardian. Ahed’s 17-year old cousin Musab Firas Al-Tamimi was killed by a shot to the neck during a skirmish that occurred in Deir Nitham, Ahed’s village on January 2018. Al-Tamimi was referred to as “the first to be killed by Israel in 2018” by Al Jazeera News channel.  Al Jazeera reported that the Israeli army imprisoned and killed several members of the Al-Tamimi family, and noted that the family has known for conducting anti-Israeli occupation protests for years.  Ahed’s father Basseem Al-Tamimi is also an activist against Israeli settlement in Palestine. He was sentenced for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers in 2012, but has since been released. Basseem defended his daughter, telling the Al-Arabiya news channel that Ahed “stands for a cause,” yet admitted he was saddened by her imprisonment.  During an interview titled “Is a slap an act of terror?” by BBC news channel, Israeli politician, Oren Hazan, said that slapping Israeli soldiers was indeed an act of terrorism and that he would kick Ahed Tamimi’s face if he could. “If I was there, she would finish in the hospital. For sure […] nobody could stop me. I would kick, kick her face, believe me,” he said. Hazan was slammed for his statement on social media. An Israeli poet named Yehonatan Geffen dedicated a poem to Ahed, in which he compared her to Anne Frank, famous diarist and Jewish victim of the Holocaust as well as to Joan of Arc, a historical heroine of French revolution against British rule.  His first comparison met with considerable criticism from Israelis. One of them said, according to Israel National News: “The State of Israel will not grant a platform to a man who compares a girl who perished in the Holocaust and a heroic warrior who fought the Nazi regime with the brat Ahed Tamimi, who attacked a soldier,”   The Israeli poet later apologized to his nation for “the comparison”, as confirmed by Israel National News. Ahed Tamimi’s two months of captivity have ended and she is set to go to trial in an Israeli Military court on Tuesday 13, 2018. Ahed’s supporters congratulated her on her seventeenth birthday which she spent in jail on January 31. Irish artist, Jim Fitzpatrick,dedicated a copy-right free Logo painting to Ahed Tamimi, in which she was portrayed standing and holding the Palestinian flag. On her side it says “ There is A Real Wonder Woman” Fitzpatrick explained his work in a video interview on YouTube: “It’s my effort to raise awareness so they can’t simply kill this little girl […] I thought there is a real wonder woman, and it’s this kid. So that’s what prompted me to use the logo.”

Rabat – After Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) seized an estimated 541 kilograms of cocaine in Casablanca’s port on Sunday, February 11, the laboratory of the Scientific Police revealed that the concentration ratio of the drug reaches 97 percent.  The Interior Ministry said in a statement sent to Morocco World News on Monday evening, that this concentration ratio reflects “the high value of the amount of drug seizure.”  In a statement, BCIJ announced that its forces managed to seize the large shipment of cocaine which was concealed in a container of goods from South America.  During the operation, BCIJ members arrested six suspects including a Brazilian national who is suspected to be the mastermind of the ring.  The police have also seized five cars that were prepared to transfer and then transport the seized cocaine. Significant sums of foreign and Moroccan currencies were also seized, added the statement.  The BCIJ investigation showed the danger posed by this particular criminal network, which likely has been taking advantage of Morocco’s unique strategic position that joins the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean, close to European countries, according to the statement.  Under the supervision of the public prosecutor, the investigation will continue to determine the full circumstances of the case and to arrest any other possible suspects involved.

Rabat – Maclean Letshwiti, President of the Botswana Football Association (BFA), has expressed his support for the Moroccan bid to host the 2026 World Cup. The news was confirmed by Botswana’s news outlet, Weekend Post. “Maclean Letshwiti is expected to throw his weight behind Morocco for their bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said the sports news outlet. Botswana has joined the list of African countries that have voiced their full support for Morocco’s candidacy, several of which did so during the sidelines of CAF’s 40th Ordinary General Assembly that took place recently in Casablanca. Tunisia, Algeria and Nigeria have welcomed Morocco’s bid. The CAF congress that was held in Morocco last month saw African member states “setting fire to the desire of hosting the showpiece on African soil, eight years from now,” according to the Weekend Post. BFA has also supported the bid, emphasizing that, “it is only through cooperation and hard work that the world showpiece can return to Africa once more.” The President of the African Football Confederation, Ahmad Ahmad, has shown strong and firm support for Morocco’s candidacy since the submission of its bid in August 2017. During CAF’s 40th Ordinary General Assembly, Ahmad said, “I can reassure you that I will not be neutral. I say it loud and clear.” His statements come in response to remarks from FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, who had earlier urged CAF to remain neutral: “I ask you to do everything possible to make the process as healthy as possible. It is about our credibility.” Ahmad, who was quoted by Cafonline.com, said that, “There are many World Cup procedure manuals in relation to the various FIFA reforms, ethical requirements and regulations.” Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017. Ahmed claimed, “Morocco has all the assets to organize a major world event, and it would be an honor for all of Africa if Morocco wins the right to host the 2026 World Cup.” Morocco will compete in the 21st World Cup tournament that will take place this summer in Russia.

Rabat – Morocco is the largest donor for the construction and maintenance of mosques in France, according to a report released by the French Senate based on figures provided by the French Ministry of the Interior.  The report finds that between 2011 and 2016, the Moroccan government allocated EUR 6 million, including wages to imams, to help finance mosques in France, where the secularism forbids the state from funding the establishment of any places of worship, according to a French law issued in 1905.  Morocco ranks just ahead of Saudi Arabia–whose financing is estimated at about EUR 3.8 million–and Algeria, whose contribution amounted to some EUR 2 million.  These foreign investments represent only about 20 percent of financing for mosques in France, the remaining 80 percent came from the French Muslim community. Whereas private donations from members of France’s Muslim community fund the majority of small mosques, big mosques are usually funded by other Muslim states especially Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Turkey.  The report states that there are about 2,450 mosques in France, mainly located in major cities. Sixty-four percent of these mosques are less than 150 square meters.  The report notes that there are between 3 and 6 million Muslims in France, among whom almost 2 million are practicing; this figure makes Islam the second largest religion in France. A just-released opinion survey by Institut Français d’Opinion Publique (IFOP) reveals that 56 percent of French people believe that Islam is compatible with the values of their country, while 43 percent believe the opposite.  This indicator that illustrates that the integration of French Muslims within France is still a work in progress. On the other hand, this same survey reveals that 70 percent of the population would not be in favor of creating a tax on halal products whose revenues would be used to finance French Muslim organisations.  In an interview with the French weekly newspaper Le Journal Du Dimanche (JDD), president Emmanuel Macron said that he will lay the foundations for the organization of Islam in France in the first half of this year.  “We are working on structuring Islam in France and also on how to explain it,” said Macron. He added that his objective is to “find the heart of secularism, the possibility of being able to believe as not to believe in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having free consciences.”

Rabat – Forty-six percent of Moroccans are believed to suffer from sexual dysfunction, according to Moroccan professor and sexologist Ahmed El Mansouri. The professor made his remarks during a symposium held in Marrakech under the theme of  “Spousal Rights: Sexual Dysfunctions in Marriage and its Effects.” El Mansouri, who was quoted by Moroccan newspaper El Massae, said that “46 percent of Moroccans suffer from sexual impotence,” adding that 75 percent of Moroccan women are not satisfied with their husbands’ sexual performance. Sexual dysfunctions, also referred to as impotence can have serious consequences if left untreated. According to the expert, this issue can cause depression, which might lead to suicide. El Mansouri said with the presence of medicines, this issue can be easily solved. Sexual dysfunctions can also be treated through surgeries nowadays, added the sexologist. The professor has also warned women about mocking their husbands for their sexual dysfunction. El Mansouri has also encouraged Moroccans to marry at a young age to avoid the issue of sexual dysfunction. According to Cleveland Clinic, a multispecialty academic hospital in Ohio, sexual dysfunction is classified in four categories: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders and pain disorders. The symptoms of sexual dysfunction include erectile dysfunction, retarded ejaculation and early or premature ejaculation. There are several factors that can cause sexual dysfunction, including physical and medical conditions, as well as psychological conditions.

Rabat – A 13-year-old boy has been officially identified as the first victim of the “Blue Whale Challenge” an infamous social media craze that incites its participants to commit suicide. Ibrahim, a 13-year-old middle school student from Benguerir, is “the first victim of the challenge, officially recognized by the authorities,” Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reports in its February 12 edition. The young boy is currently receiving mental help at the University Hospital of Casablanca, where he is being supervised by a specialized medical committee. The ‘game’ reportedly consists of 50 tasks to be accomplished over 50 days. It starts by telling its users to wake up at unusual hours to watch horror movies, listen to sad songs, and insult their parents. The tasks get gradually more extreme throughout the 50 days, finally ending with suicide incitement. The child said that he downloaded the “Blue Whale Challenge” application on his phone out of curiosity. Jumping from challenge to another, he managed to “win” 30 tasks out of the 50 imposed on him. “At first, it was easy,” he said. But as the game progressed, the challenges became more and more difficult. Ibrahim was instructed to carve a whale in his arm using a blade and hammer a nail in his thigh and foot. He had to travel to deserted places in the middle of the night and drive a motorcycle at excessive speeds. As he advanced in this dreaded “game,” the child was slowly falling into depression. When he realized that the challenges he was taking were no longer just “fun and games,” Ibrahim decided to stop playing along. He then started received disturbing messages threatening to kill his family, as he had already given details to the game moderator  about his environment, his family and his daily life. The young teenager also suffers from severe depression, says the newspaper. His parents were concerned about his mood shift, as he showed lack of appetite, significant loss of weight, and a lack of interest in his studies. They decided to take him to see a doctor. And as the nurse in charge was preparing to inject him with serum, she noticed a strange wound, shaped like a whale on his arm. The nurse immediately alerted her superiors, prompting a general mobilization within the Benguerir public hospital. The local authorities were then alerted and the boy had to be transferred to Marrakech for a more appropriate follow-up and then on to Casablanca. Ibrahim is currently in good hands, the paper says. The local authorities have held a meeting with the security services and health services of the city to prevent the repeat of such a tragedy.According to Assabah newspaper, two Moroccan children were victims of the game in late 2017. The first alleged victim of the game, was a 8-year old boy from Hay Mohammadi, Casablanca, and the second was a 12-year-old girl from Casablanca’s Douar Rhamna. Many teenagers, across the world have fallen prey to this dreadful challenge. The game was reportedly created in 2013 by its alleged mastermind Ilya Sidorov, a 26-year old Russian postman. Sidorov was arrested in June 2017 by Russian authorities. Since its creation, the game caused 130 deaths in Russia, while in Algeria, 5 children aged between 11 and 16 have  taken their own lives.

Rabat – EU ministers have called on Morocco and 54 other countries listed in the gray zone to comply with the EU’s tax transparency standards by the end of 2019, having also removed several states from the Paradise Papers blacklist. The 55 countries on the gray list have all assured the EU of their collaboration as well as their willingness to apply the standards of good tax behavior issued by the Union’s financial advisers, reported Agence  France Presse (AFP) today. Meanwhile, EU finance ministers removed eight countries from its 17-country tax haven blacklist after “they committed to cooperating on tax and abiding by EU standards. The Paradise Papers were a massive document leak carried out by International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). It revealed a vast tax abuse network of over 25,000 companies owned by individuals from 180 countries, stemming all the way back to 1950. “Eight jurisdictions have been removed from the EU’s list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, following commitments made at a high political level to remedy EU concerns,” an EU statement said. These countries include Barbados, Grenada, South Korea, Macau, Mongolia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Panama. The remaining blacklisted countries are: Bahrain, Guam, Marshall Islands, American Samoa, Namibia, Palau, Saint Lucia, Samoa and Trinidad, and Tobago.  Most of the 13.4 million documents were leaked from Appleby, a law firm based in Bermuda. The 119-year-old company assists wealthy clients in circumventing millions of dollars in tax burden by placing ownership of assets–including companies, private aircraft, real estate, and yachts–in small tropical islands that “charge zero taxes and [do] not ask many questions,” says The Guardian.

Rabat – 2017 was an impressive year for Morocco’s aviation sector and the aerospace business. Morocco’s national airport authority (ONDA) announced last month that more than 20 million passengers passed through one of the kingdom’s 17 airports in 2017. The growth was most dramatic at Tangier’s Ibn Battuta Airport where passenger traffic was up by 26 percent compared to 2016. Saiss Airport in Fes opened its stylish new terminal. With thousands of soccer fans from across Africa having traveled to the kingdom for the recently completed African Nations Championship (CHAN) tournament, Morocco may have another busy year at its largest airports. So, some interesting facts and figures about aviation, airplanes in Morocco and the kingdom’s aerospace industry. 1. 54 – The number of aircraft in the Royal Air Maroc (RAM) fleet. The flag carrier of Morocco has a fleet that mixes short-haul (Brazilian-made Embraer E-90s), medium-haul (Airbus A320s, Boeing 737s, 767s), and long-haul jets (Boeing 787 Dreamliners). 2. RAK – The Marrakech Menara Airport terminal has received numerous awards for its unique design and passenger experience. Skytrax named the facility the fifth best airport in Africa (2017). An Italian news website, TGCOM24, named the airport one of the 11 most “beautiful and futuristic” in the world, also last year. 3. 850 – The number of monthly scheduled RAM flights within Africa. Morocco’s airline flies to more than 30 African countries. It’s nearly 5,000 miles from Casablanca to Cape Town, South Africa. There are currently no nonstop flights between the two destinations. 4. 11,000 – The number of aerospace jobs in Morocco. French aviation sector manufacturer Daher just opened its new Tangier plant, dedicated to production of metal and composite aircraft components. 5. 4,671 miles (7,518 km) – The distance of Royal Air Maroc’s longest nonstop flight: Casablanca (CMN) to Sao Paulo (GRU), Brazil. 6. April 1975 – Royal Air Maroc becomes the first airline based in the Arab world to fly a commercial flight to New York City. 7. 747-400 – RAM has one Boeing 747 jet. Nicknamed ‘The Queen of the Skies’, 747 jets are increasingly being phased out as commercial passenger jets, but the cargo transport version is still popular. The iconic jet will still be used by heads of state, including King Mohammad VI of Morocco, the American president, and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. 8. Royal Air Maroc history (RAM) – Formed by a merger between Air Atlas Company and Compagnie Chérifienne de Transports Aériens Maroc in 1953, the new entity later took the name Royal Air Maroc in 1957. 9. Mohammad V Airport (CMN) – Morocco’s largest airport welcomed about 9 million passengers last year. Last spring, Emirates began Dubai-Casablanca service using the double-decker Airbus A380. It was the first airline to have scheduled air service to North Africa using the largest passenger jet in service. 10.  Marche Verte – The Royal Moroccan Air Force aerobatic and demonstration team was formed in 1988 and performs for air shows and national celebrations. Like the US Air Force Thunderbirds and Spain’s Patrulla Aguila, they represent the nation’s finest military pilots.

By Johanna Higgs and Amal Ben Hadda Rabat – Throughout the world, sexual harassment is a serious problem. Whether it be lecherous staring, inappropriate comments, unwanted touching, or any other form of degrading, sexually humiliating behavior, women throughout the world are forced to endure this disgusting behavior from men, often on a daily basis. It is an enormous problem. Leaving the home may be an uncomfortable and stressful task for a woman because of the persistent fear that she is going to be targeted by one, or perhaps even hundreds of men as she goes about her day. Going to work, school or into any public space, she can be met with harassment. She notes that it seems like a joke for the various men that she passes in the day, something of a game for them. To leer lecherously or to make overt, very obvious sexual innuendos towards her, seems to be something fun for them. A man will laugh with his friends as she passes by and then most likely, doesn’t think twice about his actions again. However, she cannot forget his actions. It’s no joke for her and there is certainly nothing funny about it. Rather it’s insulting, degrading, and violating. As the behavior is repeated over and over again, it starts to take a severe psychological toll and she will fear going outside. It’s the type of behavior that no one would want projected towards their mothers, their sisters or their daughters. It is the type of behavior that nobody would want projected towards themselves. Yet despite this, so many people make excuses for sexual harassment. They dismiss it, they assume that it’s not that big a deal or they very blame the person who is being harassed. These apologists of sexual harassment suggest that sexual aggressors are too ‘weak’ to control themselves. They suggest that these men cannot be rational human beings and are rather instead like some kind of creature who is incapable of control. In this way, the sexual aggressor is able to justify his actions, on the basis that he is unable to control himself which he then believes entitles him to sexually harass and assault whoever he pleases. Women, from all over the world, are expected to just simply understand this. Women are expected to know that there are men who consider themselves far too weak to be able to control their sexual impulses and she is expected to understand that should she happen to get in his way, then it is she who bares the blame for his bad behavior. Then there is the other problem with those who acknowledge sexual harassment but deny the harm caused by it. They criticize women who tell their stories of being harassed and suggest that they are exaggerating or making unjustifiable claims. They suggest that being a victim of sexual harassment is really not that bad. They mock her, how silly she is to think those aggressive stares, those lecherous comments or those men who stand too close to her on public transport should make her uncomfortable. Yet, as she steps out of the house once again it begins. The leers, the sexually aggressive behavior that doesn’t end until she returns home. Regardless of what a woman does, whether she stays home or goes outside, women are always blamed as victims of sexual harassment. The situation cannot go on like this any longer. These dangerous attitudes that excuse sexual harassment incite violence. They incite rape and offensively suggest that women are just simply objects for male entertainment. There needs to be more public discussion across the globe, more campaigns and many more efforts to teach men, that sexual harassment causes harm. Politicians needs to be encouraging of harsher laws and there needs to be much more social condemnation of such bad behavior. Both men and women need to be active in speaking up with their friends and families to make it known, that sexual harassment and in fact any bad behavior towards women, won’t be tolerated. Furthermore, women, who still believe that it’s culturally or religiously acceptable to be harassed by men, need to know that both men and women deserve to have equal rights. No woman deserves to be harassed and anyone who says otherwise has been brainwashed. Regardless of a man’s culture or his religion, he must be responsible for his own acts. Bad behavior from men should not be tolerated on the pretext that they are born male. We need to tell men who allege that they are unable to stop themselves from harassing women, that if they are too ‘weak’ to keep their lewd stares and disrespectful comments to themselves, then it is him that should not be walking freely in the street. If he feels that there is no way that he can stop himself from projecting obscene, sexually degrading behavior at others, then it is him who deserves to lose his freedom, not women. We need to do this because sexual harassment is offensive. It makes its victims feel uncomfortable and makes one feel that they do not want to leave the home. There is no excuse to make another human being feel this way.

Rabat – The northern city of Tangier has established itself as the gateway to Africa in one of the most dynamic countries in the region, according to Spanish business newspaper Cinco Dias.

According to the business paper the city has managed to reinvent its development strategy in just a decade in order to become the gateway to Africa and an industrial platform connected to the world.

Introducing the northern city and its emblematic history, Cinco Dias  said that  people who already visited Tangier have explored “a city of memory, equally divided, of counterculture and marginality, with a clear evidence of development in terms of green areas, residential areas, urban planning, high-speed rail, transport and hotels.” 


Cinco Dias believes that the progress of the city was not a “coincidence.” The development of the city came as a result of the policies proposed by King Mohammed VI to develop the region.

In this regard, the Spanish newspaper underscored the importance of the 10-year old Tanger  Med Port, which is internationally considered as one of the major ports in the world.

According to the  Spanish source, Spanish business people have an “irresistible temptation” to invest in the Tangier region. Fifty-eight Spanish firms have already launched their projects in the city, including Antolin Group (specializing in the manufacture of cars pieces” said the newspaper.

In this regard, the newspaper has quoted the General Director of Antolin Group,  Jesus Pascual Santos who said that “Morocco is one of the most attractive countries in Africa, with a GDP showing sustained growth, political stability, good infrastructure and a
 a geostrategic situation that links between Africa and Europe.”

Santos has also lauded the efforts carried out by Morocco to attract more foreign investors, adding that the investments made by the group Antolin, operating in Morocco since 2005, have resulted in a platform of excellence.

He further states that Antolin established a center in Morocco, which is part of the Antolin design network. With the aid of advanced technology, the center has been helping customers in the development of their projects.

Speaking about the Moroccan staff working in favor of the center,  Santos said that the Moroccan technicians  “have demonstrated great professional competence in developing the doors of the Renault Captur model manufactured in Spain.” Antolin’s General Directory added that the center aims at improving the staff capabilities in order “to have an increasingly qualified workforce and to attract projects with a higher technological value.”

The newspaper recalled in its publication that the Tangier Med port hub is attracting several industrial projects, including Tangier’s Free Zone, Tanger Automotive City, Renault Tanger Med, Tetouan Park and Tetouan Shore.

The newspaper also mentioned other major businesses that chose to invest in Tangier, including Suardiaz, Alsa and Siemens Gamesa.

The president of Renault Morocco, Marc Nassif,  described the city’s industrial ecosystem as “excellent,”  while Ala Maroc’s  general manager Alberto Perez welcomed the success of his business, which has been operating in the city since 1999 in several cities. The
 success, according to Perez, is a result of the services and collaboration offered by the Moroccan government.

Quoted by the newspaper, Siemens Gamesa Managing Director Markus Tacke said that Tangier plant is “fundamental” to the group’s development, adding that its construction follows a business logic.

Tacke reinforced his argument, saying that  Siemens Gamesa invests in countries offering great business opportunities, noting that such opportunities “are present more than ever today in Morocco.”

Rabat – A young teacher in  Sidi Bennour, a city 166 kilometers away from Casablanca, presented her students with a gift of warm socks and rain boots to help them endure the cold snap.  The cold weather took the kingdom by literal storms as temperatures have sharply dropped throughout the country in the last few weeks. Some regions have been especially harmed by these weather conditions as snow isolated them in hazardous circumstances. King Mohammed VI has mobilized the government and instructed it to redouble its efforts to come to the rescue those in need. Last week, about 1,100 families in douars in Ifrane have benefited from food aid and blanket distributions. While temperatures drop and government help pour in, some individuals chose to take matters into their own hands and help those around them to soften the harshness of the cold weather. One example is a young teacher who offered her students a gift of warm socks and rain boots in the AL-Ziyaniya school in Sid Bennour city, which is located in the Casablanca-Settat region. According to the pictures shared on social media, the teacher placed the gifts on the students’ desks before the class started in order to surprise them. This present, although it might seem small, offers a glimmer of warmth in conditions that have caused around 900 schools to temporarily close their doors.

The King has also offered his best wishes and“further progress and prosperity  to the brotherly Iranian people.” King Mohammed VI has also expressed  his willingness to “work hand-in-hand” with the Iranian leader to give a new impetus to the existing bilateral ties and relations of cooperation between  Morocco and Iran to the best interests of  the “two brother peoples.” Thousands of Iranians flocked to the streets on Sunday, February 11  to mark the 39th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution just weeks after protests rocked cities across Iran.

Rabat – After her mesmerizing blind audition on the popular reality TV show The Voice, the French Muslim singer Mennel Ibtissem announced on Friday, that she has stepped down from the singing competition following online controversy over her two-year-old tweets criticising the French government.  The 22-year-old French national of a Syrian-Turkish father and a Moroccan-Algerian mother bedazzled the Voice France judges on February 4, with her interpretation of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah in English before transitioning into Arabic, with the Hallelujah refrain replaced with “Ya Ilahi,” which translates to “My God.” The video went viral with more than 1,600,000 views on YouTube, and led her becoming a potential candidate to win the competition. Shortly after her acclaimed performance, Ibtissem has sparked fury and received an online backlash for posts she made on social media following the 2016 Nice Lorry attack. “It’s become a routine, one attack a week! And to remain always faithful the ‘terrorist’ took his identity papers with him. It’s true that, when you’re planning a dirty move, you always take your papers with you!” she wrote in August 2016, in a now-deleted tweet.  “The government is the real terrorist,” Ibtissem added.   The association of victims for the 2016 Bastille attack, which killed almost 90 people, said in a statement that Ibtissem’s comments were “unacceptable.” TF1, the TV channel that airs the show in France, was urged by many Ibtissem’s detractors to eliminate her from the competition.  Other users came to her defense, claiming that she was being fiercely criticized on the basis of being a Muslim. Following the online backlash, Ibtissem posted an apology video on Facebook in which she expressed her regret, stating that her comments had been taken “out of context,” and that she would no longer compete in The Voice.  “I have faith in the future of humanity; I have faith in a future full of love, peace, and tolerance. I have faith in my country, France… But these last days have been very difficult for me, a lot of tension; I’ve hidden my desire to spread love, peace and tolerance,” the rising singer said.  “I’ve never meant to hurt anyone, and the idea that I would do so on purpose pains me a lot.”

Rabat – Morocco paid a regular budget assessments of 1,312,582 US dollars to the UN for the year 2018, said United Nations (UN) spokesperson Farhan Haq on Thursday. Morocco made this payment on February 7, which makes it one of the first 47 Member States of the UN to pay their regular budget assessment in full within the 30 day due period specified in Financial Regulations 3.5, which that ends on February 9. This payment came as a favorable response to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who invited states members to pay their dues for the UN regular budget. The contribution of each member country is determined based on an assessment that takes into account the Gross National Product (GNP), income per capita, and external debt of countries for fixing the quantum of contribution. This assessment is done every three years. The current time period for assessment is for the years 2016-2018. The General Assembly decided that percentage shares must range from a minimum of 0.001% to a maximum of 22%. Countries designated as the “least developed” contribute a maximum of 0.01%. Similar assessments apply to the peacekeeping operations. For the later, adjustments are made for average per capita GNP compared to global average GNP. In 2017, Morocco ranked 14th among troop-and police-contributing countries, with a total of 1,610 military, police and civilian personnel assigned to UN peacekeeping operations. “We are grateful to Morocco for its continued contribution to the maintenance of the United Nations peace and its commitment to contribute to preserving peace and security,” asserted Nick Birnback, a spokesman for United Nations peacekeeping, in an interview with MAP.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has seized an estimated 541 kilograms of cocaine in Casablanca’s port, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). In a statement, BCIJ announced on Sunday, February 11 that its forces managed to seize the large shipment of cocaine which was concealed in a container of goods from South America. This latest seizure is another example of close international cooperation to combat drug smuggling and it demonstrates the ongoing commitment on the part of BCIJ to uncover drug trafficking rings, added the statement. A sample of the seized cocaine was sent to a laboratory of the Scientific Police to determine the concentration ratio of the drug. During the operation, BCIJ members arrested six suspects including a Brazilian national who is suspected to be the mastermind of the ring. The police have also seized five cars that were prepared to transfer and then transport the seized cocaine. Significant sums of foreign and Moroccan currencies were also seized, added the statement. The BCIJ investigation showed the danger posed by this particular criminal network, which likely has been taking advantage of Morocco’s unique strategic position that joins the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean, close to European countries, according to the statement. Under the supervision of the public prosecutor, the investigation will continue to determine the full circumstances of the case and to arrest any other possible suspects involved.

Rabat – Morocco was unanimously re-elected as president of the African Water Association (AfWA) on Saturday in Bamako for a second term through 2020. This re-election took place at the Association’s General Assembly in the presence of the acting Director General of the Electricity and Drinking Water Office (ONEE), Abderrahim El Hafidi. “This vote evidences renewed confidence placed in Morocco to continue to lead this prestigious association,” El Hafidi told Maghreb Arab Press, noting that this is also a recognition of Morocco’s unique abilities in the field of water management.  Furthermore, El  Hafidi noted that the re-election of the Kingdom at the head of this association reflects the credibility that Morocco enjoys within the African community.  AfWA aims to coordinate the search for knowledge and latest developments in the technical, legal, administrative and economic fields surrounding water policy and to promote the exchange of information on methods, processes and procedures of drinking water production, supply and sanitation.  Home to the second driest area of land on earth – Wadi Halfa, Sudan – and being itself the second driest continent in the world, Africa has an urgent need of an action plan that would solve endemic water scarcity. Currently, one-third of the continent’s inhabitants lack access to safe drinking water.  Morocco had previously tabled its “Water for Africa” initiative in the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) in Nigeria on November 2017, with the aim of “encouraging and mobilizing political, financial, and institutional actors to design and implement a priority action plan for water security of the African continent. The Executive Board adopted the Moroccan initiative and integrating it into its work agenda.  “Water for Africa” also seeks to improve the living conditions of African peoples by strengthening their resilience against the effects of climate change.

Rabat – One month after Morocco introduced a flexible exchange rate system, the Moroccan dirham appreciated by 0.3 percent against the euro and fell by 0.59 percent against the dollar, according to the latest weekly indicators of the week from February 1 to 7, published Saturday by Bank Al Maghrib (BAM). The Central Bank’s indicators for this week also show that net international reserves are set at MAD 239.2 billion, which slightly decreased by 0.4% compared to the previous week, but with a 4.1 percent decline on a year-over-year basis. During this period, Bank Al-Maghrib injected MAD 43 billion in 7-day advances through a call for tenders and granted MAD 3.4 billion to the support program for the financing of the SMEs, the Moroccan central bank said. On the interbank market, the weighted average rate was 2.25 percent, while the volume of trade returned from MAD 5.3 billion to 3.8 billion, BAM said. Bank Al-Maghrib injected an amount of MAD 44 million in the call for tenders for 7-day advances on February 7 (value date of February 8), notes the bank. On January 15, Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance officially widened the band in which the Moroccan dirham trades against a basket of currencies, 60 percent for the euro and 40 percent for the dollar, from ±0.3 percent to ±2.5 percent. Over a timeframe of 10 to 15 years, the ministry explained that it will move towards a free floating currency. According to BMI Research, a Fitch Group firm that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis, Morocco’s new reform is “unlikely to prompt a sharp currency sell-off, limiting near-term risks to growth and inflation.” The group also pointed out that this move is “likely to help the country in its efforts to attract greater investment to the kingdom and diversify trade, while the risks of disorderly depreciation are well contained given the country’s robust financial buffers.”

Rabat – A confidential document proves illegal activities carried out by the separatist Polisario front in the region, and the embezzlement of international humanitarian aid intended for the region.  The document, received by Moroccan news outlet Le360, says that the separatist Omar Boulssen, an alleged human right activist, funds young people in the region to spread the front’s separatist ideologies. The activist, according to the document, lives in Las Palmas, Spain, where he transfers money to his separatist group. Boulssen’s strategy is to attract a large number of young people to receive support for the so-called “separatist cause” and to engage them in devastating activities against Morocco’s sovereignty. Boulssen has been supervising several pro-separatist activities in support of the front, in collaboration with the Coalition of Sahrawi Human Rights Defenders (CODESA) headed by the representative of the Polisario, Aminatou Haidar. Boulssen, who has been funding young people in carrying out illegal activities in the region, also supports pro-separatist associations inside the Tindouf camps, inside southern regions, and in Morocco’s northern cities. This strategy, which has been long supported by the Polisario, aims to undermine the stability of Morocco, provoke Morocco’s government, and support demonstrations in the southern and northern regions of Morocco. The front and Boulssen support these illegal activities through financial aid and “monthly salaries” transferred to institutions, associations, media outlets, students, and separatist detainees, added the document. The separatist institutions receive a monthly budget of around MAD 820,000 to spread propaganda in the region. These associations claim to be active in different relief efforts, including supporting detainees, women, children with special needs, media, and providing equipment. But, according to the document, these activities are not the only actions carried out by these associations. The associations are also inciting Sahraoui people to denounce the “exploitation of natural resources” in Western Sahara. The document reported by Le360 added that 17 associations active in southern cities receive monthly support from the Polisario front, as well as seven media outlets, 44 detainees, and a group of students along with other members of the front, some of whom were involved in the Gdim Izik incident. The document says that Aminatou Haidar, Ali Salem Tamek, Brahim Dehan, Sidi Mohamed Dadech, Hassanah Aalia receive EUR 500 monthly to spread separatist ideologies.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, and Scientific Research has announced the launch of “Tadkik” (audit), an online service devoted to students who will sit for baccalaureate exams in the 2017-2018 school year.  The service, which will officially launch on Monday, aims to provide baccalaureate students with a reliable and up-to-date student profile database, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The ministry statement said that the goal of the service is to avoid any profile errors which could potentially alter candidates personal data and scores. The ministry recommends that all applicants verify their data before collecting invitations to take baccalaureate exams. More information is made available at the moudamadris.com website, a platform dedicated to Moroccan students. The process of verifying a student’s data is done through the examination of applicants’ electronic applications, which contain personal data that has been entered into a school management system and approved electronically. If there is a data error in terms of a student’s data, the candidate must correct the error and submit the application again for correction, signed by the candidates and their guardians within established deadlines. Morocco’s national 2018 baccalaureate examination period will take place June 5-8, according to the ministry. 325,191 Moroccan students took baccalaureate exams during the 2016-2017 academic year, according to a statement released by the ministry in June 2017. The graduation rate for the 2017 academic year reached 62.5 percent, compared to 61.72 percent in 2016, said the ministry. Some 49,490 students graduated during the retakes, which were held July 11-13.

Rabat – Fifty-six percent of French people believe that Islam is compatible with the values of their country, according to a survey conducted by the French-based polling firm, the Institut Français d’Opinion Publique (IFOP). The survey results, which were published today by the French weekly newspaper, Le Journal Du Dimanche, show that the majority of French people think that Islam is compatible with their society, while 43 percent believe the opposite. A similar survey conducted in September 2016 showed that 56 percent of French people saw Islam as incompatible with the country’s values, while only 44 percent of respondents thought that Islam is compatible with their society. According to the newspaper, notwithstanding this apparent development, “Islam remains a major topic that brings a cleavage” among French people according to their political sensitivities and biases. The survey responses indicate a sharp divide based on political affiliation. 63 percent of Republicans supporters and 62 percent of National Front (Front National) supporters believe that Islam is incompatible with the values of French society. However, 73 percent of Socialist Party supporters and 60 percent of those of la France Soumise, as well as 58 percent of la République en Marche supporters, think the opposite, according to the survey. Ifop also surveyed French people about the proposal to add a tax on halal food. The idea of the food tax was first proposed in 2016 by an association representing French Muslims to fund mosques and to combat radicalization among young people. The effort was in response to concerns in France about the financing of mosques in the country as well as to a series of terror attacks that France witnessed over the past few years, according to British news outlet The Independent. In this regard, a large majority of French people (70 percent) are opposed to the “tax on halal” proposal, while only 29 percent support the idea. In 2016, former French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said in an interview with the French newspaper Liberation that the majority of French people see Islam as incompatible with the values of the Republic. The prime minister noted the importance of demonstrating the opposite. “Certain people don’t want to believe it, a majority of French citizens doubt it, but I’m convinced that it’s possible.” However, the former prime minister said that French society can “demonstrate that Islam, a great world religion and the second religion of France, is fundamentally compatible with the Republic, democracy, our values and equality between men and women,” said Valls in the Libérationinterview.

Rabat – With the arrival of young Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman in the Saudi leadership, a lot of major social changes, deemed progressive, are taking place. After Saudi women were allowed to drive cars and attend football stadiums, a senior member of the top Muslim clerical body said that Saudi women need not wear the abaya, usually black loose over-garment robe, to cover up their bodies in public. Sheikh Abdullah al-Mutlaq, a member of the Council of Senior Scholars, the highest religious body in the country, said in an interview with a local broadcaster on Friday that Muslim women should dress modestly, but not necessarily the abaya. “More than 90 percent of pious Muslim women in the Muslim world do not wear abayas,” Sheikh Mutlaq said, adding that “we should not force people to wear abayas.” This issue has already provoked a heated debate among Saudi social media users with mixed reaction on social media. For some the ‘Fatwa’ is another indication of the Kingdom’s efforts towards modernization; however, other users regard this decree as another step towards destroying Islamic values. #??????_???????_???_??????? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?? ???? ?? ????? ????????? ???????? ???? ?????? ???? ???? ??? ???? ????? ? — ???????? .????

Rabat – Police authorities in the city of Sale dismantled an organized crime ring on Saturday, arresting four individuals involved in smuggling migrants. The arrest of four suspects by the judicial police was made possible following a detailed investigation, read a statement by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The investigation also enabled authorities to identify 21 migrants, including four women and two children who were hiding in an apartment in the Sidi Moussa neighborhood of Sale. The investigation showed that one member of the criminal ring had gathered migrants from several Moroccan cities in a Sale apartment, waiting to transfer them from the city to a boat that was also seized during the suspects’ arrest. The migrants reportedly had given MAD 12,000 to the criminal ring. The defendants remain in custody while the investigation continues under the supervision of the city’s public prosecutor. The investigation will also seek to identify all accomplices suspected of being involved in the smuggling ring. Illegal immigration has reached crisis levels in recent years. People wishing to reach Europe, including Moroccans, place their trust in gangs of smugglers who in turn demand large sums of money for a promise to deliver them to the European continent. Many of the migrants, however, eventually find themselves either stranded in Libya’s migrant detention centers, or worse, trafficked by human trafficking gangs.Some migrants were sold in human slave markets in 2017. Several thousand more drowned in the Mediterranean Sea last year.

Rabat – Anger is mounting over the arrival of five Moroccan journalists to Israel on Monday, triggering yet another fueled debate in the Moroccan public sphere around the prospects of Moroccan normalization of Israel’s cultural and political action. The Moroccan delegation, along with four other journalists from Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, traveled to Israel on Monday for a six-day visit “to help open a window on #Israel and its people for readers across the #Arab world,” Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yuval Rotem said. According to the official social media page of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this visit seeks to give the delegation “a closer look at Israel, its policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and coexistence among the various micro-components through meetings with leaders from various political circles in government departments and the Knesset.” The Middle East Eye claims that, far from being as innocent as the Foreign Ministry of Israel claims, the Israeli state has long since waged war on boycott movements, in a systematic move to promote and normalize its culture and controversial position in the international scene. This type of visit often draws outrage from the Moroccan public, who accuse Arab visitors to Israel as polishing Israel’s image in Morocco. It seems that Israel is dabbling in unanticipated policy that could lead the country to soften its relations with Arab States.Morocco seems to be an appealing target for this campaign. Israel has now hosted four Moroccan delegations. It has it reopened flights with Morocco after a 13-year halt, during which air traffic between the two countries was completely blocked and economic exchanges between the two states seem to prosper. But this does not necessarily imply that Morocco is taking up a “come what may” attitude. “The regional situation has considerably changed and it would be ‘foolish’ to view the matter through the lens of Arab patriotism,” said Amazigh activist Mounir Kejji, who is also a member an organization dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism and strengthening cultural ties with Israel. “Morocco knows what is best for its interests and right now, the Jewish lobby controls considerable power in the world. Morocco will not simply turn a blind eye on where the profit lies and fight for a cause at the cost of its own advancement.” Below the radar of politics, this visit has had great impact on the Moroccan journalism body. In an official reaction to the journalists’ visit, the National Syndicate of Journalists accused the five Moroccan journalists of violating the values of the profession. “Arab attitudes against the Israeli occupation are based on humanitarian and human rights principles, the most important of which are respect for human rights, freedom of expression and opinion. These are the principles advocated by most journalists throughout the world, which are constantly violated by the State of Israel.” The syndicate affirms that the visit falls in the political propaganda of Israel, and has nothing to do with the practice of journalism. But journalist and activist against anti-Semitism, racism and discrimination, Boubker Outaadit says that the issue cannot afford to be mixed with Arab populism. “Journalists are free to go to whatever country they want. The constitution guarantees us this right. It has nothing to do with one’s own beliefs or perceptions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Nevertheless, the information minister of the Palestinian Authority holds firm that “siding with Israel and its terrorism marks a departure from the Arab rank and the decisions of the Council of Arab Ministers of Information.” The visit “constitutes a departure from the official and popular Arab position that considers Israel a state of occupation, racism, ethnic cleansing, and extremism,” said the ministry. Its counterpart in Morocco considers the issue tightly linked to the stance of the ordinary Moroccan citizen. Indeed, a substantial proportion of the Moroccan population, political parties and NGOs firmly support the Palestine cause. The King serves as the president of al-Quds Committee and civil society in Rabat and Casablanca are known for organizing the largest street demonstrations in the Arab World in the support of the Palestinian cause. The latest of these demonstrations occurred in the wake of Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem; over 50,000 Moroccans staged a mass demonstration in Rabat, blocking roads and waving Palestinian flags. “The ministry condemns actions of the five Moroccan who traveled to Israel. They have gone against the popular opinion in regard of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” Minister of Culture and Communication Mohamed Laaraj said. The Palestinian Authority called on the Arab Journalists Union to take “punitive and deterring measures” against the journalists and their outlets. And Laaraj indicated that his department is working on setting up policies that would prevent Moroccan journalists from visiting  Israel. For Kejji, this would be synonymous with creating a “dictatorship.” “If the government wants to prevent people from flying to Israel, then why not put a travel ban on Afghanistan or Iran  […] countries that fund and support terrorist groups,” Kejji said. Nevertheless, public controversies around the underlying reality of the Israeli political and social order have existed for years in Morocco. With every new confrontation with Israel, the debate surfaces and spirals into a war of words between the supporters of the two parties.

Rabat – As the Chinese New Year quickly approaches, it appears good tidings have arrived early in Rabat. Following the 6th session of the Morocco-China Joint Committee for Economic Cooperation on Thursday, representatives from both countries announced a broad commitment to increased economic partnership moving forward.  Moulay Hafid Elalamy, the Moroccan minister of industry, investment, trade and the digital economy, met with visiting Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Qian Keming to discuss possible future areas for bilateral cooperation, with a particular emphasis on infrastructure construction and the creation of new industrial parks. Following the proceedings, Chinese Ambassador to Morocco S.E. Li Li stressed the importance of political trust between the two nations, noting “the higher the level of mutual political trust, the more fruitful bilateral cooperation will become.” These talks aimed to further strengthen Sino-Moroccan relations, which have already reached an all-time high in recent years.  In June 2016, King Mohammed VI waived visa requirements for Chinese nationals visiting Morocco during his visit with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping in Beijing, which resulted in a 760% increase in Chinese tourism to Morocco over the next fourteen months. Late last year, Chinese firms announced a new investment of $11 billion into the creation of “Mohamed VI Tangier Tech City,” a new factory district that aims to generate 100,000 new jobs in the Tangiers area.  This increased Chinese activity in Morocco as of late is situated within a larger effort by the Chinese government to increase its role as both an economic and political stakeholder on the African continent. At the 2015 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit in Johannesburg, China committed to providing $60 billion of funding to African nations, effectively tripling its previous investment in the region.

By Majid Morceli San Francisco – In the last few weeks, there has been much talk about Morocco’s world cup chances to be awarded the organization of the world cup. There are those who said that Morocco’s chances are high, considering the world is not very fond of the American president. Others say that the American administration has not fully backed the North American joint bid, whereas Morocco has a full support of the Moroccan government. Many analysts stated that Moroccan infrastructure was no match for that of North America. Others stated that Morocco is a land of soccer and should be awarded the organization of the tournament — omitting that the most popular sport in Mexico a country with 123 million people is indeed soccer.  In the U.S., there are 30 million people involved with soccer. When the US organized the world cup in 1994, the stadiums were at full capacity throughout the tournament, I attended few games myself, and the atmosphere during the games was impeccable, and the stadiums were full.  While the latest CAF 2018 championship was a success, we simply cannot compare the organization of an African event with a world event. Needless to say, only games featuring the Moroccan team were sufficiently attended by soccer fans. The other games were practically deserted. Let us also remember that the organizers did not charge fans any fees to attend the CHAN 2018 games, which likely have increased attendance. While much of what has been said is true and makes sense in a perfect world, none of the analysts — or at least those I have read so far — mentioned what I think would be the ultimate factor in deciding who will be awarded the organization the FIFA World Cup.  It is the strength of the relationship between the candidates and the voting countries that will determine the final outcome. Of course, the benefits the voting countries will garner in return for their vote must also be considered in this case.  Morocco understood very early on that the vote will be based on who you know and not on what infrastructure you possess. We do not live in a perfect word where common sense prevails. Voting countries will ask themselves who will benefit them the most. Voters are much less interested whether president Trump is for or against Muslims. Saudi Arabia, the so-called guardian of the pillars of Islam just awarded president Trump a $400 billion business deal regardless of his proven animosity toward Muslims. The United Arab Emirates bluntly stated that president Trump has every right to ban Muslims from certain countries from entering the U.S. South and North American countries will most likely vote for the North American bid for obvious reasons, just as Africa will probably side with Morocco. Some believe that Europe will vote Morocco due to proximity, though other than Spain and France, I cannot be assured that the remaining European countries will vote for Morocco. Their relationship with North America is much more beneficial to them. Proximity would be the least of their concern when submitting their vote. Let us not forget that even if a certain country has an issue with president Trump’s behavior, Canada and Mexico could not be discarded as factors. The 50 Asian countries of FIFA do more business with North America and their majority will vote against Morocco. As an example, every single soccer uniform or accessory eventually sold to fans will probably be made in Asian countries which will create jobs in Asia.   Will Morocco be able to convince enough countries that it is in their benefit to vote for us? One thing is certain: time is running out, and Moroccan organizers are wasting it. when dealing with rest of the world, old habits will have to change. So far, we have yet to see or hear how Morocco can make it beneficial for the majority of countries to vote for us.  The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent any institution or entity.  © Morocco World News.

Rabat – As the freezing weather continues to cause discomfort and mass suffering in mountainous regions across Morocco, aid also continues to pour in. On Thursday and Friday, some 1,100 families in douars in Ifrane Province have benefited from food aid and blanket distributions to cope with the effects of the cold snap. About 50 families in the commune of Tazguit, 70 families from the Habri zone in the commune of Ben Smim, and another 972 families of Bakrit and Tasmakt Tifwatine, in the commune of Sidi Lmakhfi, received relief supplies to lessen the life-threatening effects of the prolonged cold snap. This operation was supervised by the governor of Ifrane Province, Abdelhamid Al Mazid, who was accompanied by members of the newly-formed provincial watch and monitoring committee, created to monitor the effects of the cold snap. “This operation followed Mohammed VI’s instructions given to the government departments to continue the mobilization and deploy more efforts to mitigate the negative effects caused by snowfall and heavy rains, as well as the sharp drop in temperatures in some prefectures and provinces of the Kingdom,” said head of the watch committee, Salah Mikou. He further indicated that this initiative will last several days and will affect several douars and municipalities in the province of Ifrane affected by the bitter cold. Aid provided to the stricken areas of Irfan comes after the Head of Government announced earlier this week that “an exceptional mobilization” has been put in place by various authorities responsible for opening the roads to areas isolated by heavy snowfall. The massive relief mission will benefit about 514,000 people across 22 provinces. Various departments, including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of National Education, the Royal Gendarmerie, and the Auxiliary Forces and Civil Protection will monitor its progress.

The survey, according to El Othmani, has shown the existence of new unexplored and unmined minerals: lead, zinc and copper. “In light of this study, the opportunity will be allowed for the legal exploitation of these various types of minerals existing in the region of Jerada,” said El Othmani who was quoted by several Moroccan news outlets. These new mining and exploration opportunities will benefit the population of the region, and will offer the region’s inhabitants new employment opportunities, added El Othmani. El Othmani has also promised the suspension of illegal mining activities in the region, which led to the deaths of three local miners recently. During the meeting, the head of government announced the launch of an industrial zone for Jerada, which will provide young entrepreneurs in several business sectors with the opportunity to carry out their projects. El Othmani also announced that 3,000 hectares will be made available for agricultural activities. One thousand hectares will be for the benefit of land title holders, while 2,000 hectares will be for the sake of new young farmers. According to El Othmani, this measure is aimed at improving responsible environmental development in the region while supporting sustainable economic activities.

Rabat – The number of printed books in Morocco during 2016-2017 increased by 16 percent compared to 2015-2016. Established in 1985, in Casablanca by the late King Abdullah Al Saoud of Saudi Arabia, the King Abdul Aziz Al-Saoud Foundation for Islamic Studies and Human Sciences plays a key role in terms of research and documentation in Morocco. On February 7, the foundation displayed a report on books published between 2016 and 2017, revealing 3390 publications as a total which amounts to 16 percent, including novels, study books, religious books and printed articles written in various languages. The report highlights statistics of published books in Arabic, stating that these works have steadily increased since the 1980s when human sciences and literary textbooks went through a major “Arabization,” while works written in French declined.   In 2016-2017, books published in the Arabic language dominated, and those published in both Arabic and French received the widest readership. Arabic leads publication statistics, making up 81.88 percent of 2016-2017 works–amounting to 2,405 titles, while French works are at 14.54 percent (427 titles),  English at 0.75 percent (22 titles), Tamazight at 2.25 percent (66 titles), and Spanish at 0.58 percent (17 titles). For a local language, Tamazight takes a share of merely 2.25 percent in the total of published titles,  a weak presence in contrast with French and Arabic. Though Morocco has historically depended upon Islamic religious books imported from Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt and Lebanon, the report shows that the publication of religious works in Morocco has increased by 9.23 percent, equating to 271 titles. The database divulges Morocco’s growing attempts to publish local works in relation to Islamic studies to avoid importing religious textbooks that promote “radical Ideologies” and instead produce titles relevant to local Islamic traditions. Titles dedicated to other religions score only 0.27 percent, a total of 8 titles. Other disciplinary texts include of literature, history, politics, education, economy, psychology, sociology, science, art, law, and management, among others. Literaature made up 24.17 percent (710 titles), Law takes 14,61 percent (429 titles), Society 7,52 percent (221 titles), Politics 5,75 percent (169 titles), Arts 3,51 percent (103 titles), Philosophy  3,44 percent (101 titles), Education 1,80 percent (53 titles), Geography  1,67 percent (49 titles), Economy 0,82 percent (24 titles), Sciences  0,48 percent (14 titles), Management  0,34 percent ( 10 titles), and Psychology  0,14 percent, only four titles. Several genres fell under the category “others” in the report, including works in translation and travel books, as well as an emerging genre in Morocco under the name of “feminist literature.”   Works of “feminist studies” or “feminist literature” reached 26 titles, focusing on women empowerment through tackling issues of sexuality and women’s rights in Muslim countries. As for works in translation, Arabic remains the predominant language. Around 160 titles and 181 titles were translated into Arabic, while French translations composed 63 percent and 14 percent were in Spanish. English, German, Italian and Portuguese translations hold a marginal position of 8 percent.

Rabat – Moroccan-born fashion designer Paul Marciano has been accused of sexual harassment and abusive behavior by supermodel Kate Upton. Inspired by the #metoo movement, the 25-year-old model called out the co-founder of Guess on social media late in January. She wrote, “It’s disappointing that such an iconic women’s brand @Guess is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director #metoo,” “He shouldn’t be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women #metoo,”  she captioned the Instagram post. Marciano has denied all sexual harassment claims. The model received massive support from her fans. The post, “liked” over 60 thousand times, prompted other women to speak out against Marciano. “I worked for him for only 5 months because it was an intolerable work situation. He used his power to pressure women I worked with and it was…disgusting. Thank you @kateupton for this,” Yolanda Edwards, creative director of Condé Nast Traveler and Brides, commented. Aside from speaking out on social media, Upton did not provide more elaborate details on the allegations until Time published an interview with her on Wednesday, in which she claims that Marcianosexually harassed her at the beginning of her career, when she was 18. She told the Time that “after the first day of shooting the Guess Lingerie campaign on July 25, 2010, Marciano said he wanted to meet with me.” During this meeting, Marciano “forcibly grabbed my breasts and started feeling them — playing with them actually,” She explained that she pushed him. “He said, ‘I’m making sure they’re real.’” “He continued to touch me in a very dominating and aggressive way, grabbing my thighs, my arms to pull me closer, my shoulders to pull me closer, my neck, my breasts, and smelling me,” the model said, explaining that photographer Yu Tsai  was present during the meeting but that didn’t stop Marcelo from sexually harassing her. He then attempted to kiss her. “At one point he forcibly grabbed the back of my head so that I could not move and started kissing my face and my neck. I remember not wanting to say “Get off of me” because I didn’t want to open my mouth to say anything because I didn’t want him to be able to put his tongue in my mouth. I had two options: do everything I could to wiggle away and avoid his pursuit, or punch the CEO of Guess. So I decided to just wiggle away,” she told Time. But the 65 year old businessman continued pursuing her, she said. She rejected all of his maneuvers, and Tsai offered to walk her to her hotel. A month later, during another shoot with Guess, Marcelo began pressuring the model to see him. “As soon as I went up to my hotel room, Paul started calling me asking to come up and see how my room is. I politely declined several times.” The next day she learned that she was fired. “Someone had called my agency to say I had gotten fat and would not be needed on set [that day]. I was devastated, especially because at this point no one from Guess had even seen me.” When she was selected for Guess advertising campaigns again, Marciano’s text messages became more aggressive. “All the language he used was extremely dominant and possessive.” Tsai, who was helping her avoid encounters with Marcelo was fired from Guess soon after. Upton began working with another photographer, Ellen von Unwerth, who also helped her avoid one-on one encounters with Marciano. Having seen that there was no way to reach the model, as she constantly refused him, Marciano allegedly humiliated her before firing her. “I had a final shoot [in May of 2011], and he was outwardly rude and degrading the entire time. He said I was “disgusting” and started telling people how unprofessional I was by spreading rumors that I was drunk on set and partying every night, which of course I wasn’t. I was then told to leave because Paul said, “Get that fat pig off my set.” Speaking to Time, Marciano said that Upton’s accusations are “absolutely false” and “preposterous.” “I have never been alone with Kate Upton,” he continued. “I have never touched her inappropriately. Nor would I ever refer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner.”

Rabat – Head of Moroccan Agency Board of Sustainable Energy (MASEN) Mustapha Bakkoury and Belgium’s Minister of Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development Marie Christine Marghem ran a meeting in Brussels on Thursday, February 8, to discuss south-south cooperation and exchange expertise within a framework of renewable energy and sustainable development. During the diplomatic meeting, Bakkoury discussed Morocco’s interest in solidifying its relationship with European Union and shared Morocco’s plan of installing a south-south strategy to become a catalyst for African continent’s Energy force, as King Mohammed VI formerly vowed. “I had the opportunity to observe with admiration Morocco’s deployed efforts in the domain of Renewable Energies and Sustainable Development during the COP22 in Marrakech,” Marghem professed. As a matter of fact, Morocco plays a key role in Belgium’s 2016-2020 Bilateral Co-operation Programme, according to Kingdom Of Belgium Foreign Affairs, and Development Cooperation. Morocco’s principal renewable energies are solar energy and wind energy;King Mohammed VI recently set future goals for Morocco’s renewable energy production in January 2018, aiming to achieve 42 percent of renewable energy capacity by 2020 and 52 percent by 2030. The wind is now under Morocco’s wings, as its dynamic plans make it a strong candidate for Wallonia-Brussels’ Cooperation agency APEFE ( Association for the Promotion of Overseas Education and Training) and the Wallonia Export-Investment Agency’s future investments in 2018, as highlighted by the Wallonia website. Belgium will launch several projects in the kingdom this year, including business, economic and cultural-exchange programs for the year 2018.

Rabat – A millionaire Saudi woman made a marriage offer announcement on a live program aired on Al Resala TV channel.  In a phone call to the live program, the forty-year-old woman said she is looking for a husband even though he is already married. “I’d have no problem with a polygamous marriage, if the man can treat me and his first wife equally.” However, she expressed her reluctance to marry a young single man, because “I feel it would be unfair to him,” she added. The woman said that she is rich, but her happiness is never completed without a man she trusts on her side. “I inherited millions from my father after he died. When he was alive he never allowed me to get married, as he worried that men would only want to marry me because of our fortune,” she said.  She desperately wished to get married because she wants to have a child, that “I can hold in my arms.” During her phone call with the program presenter, the woman explained that she didn’t want a man who is interested only in her money, but a husband who treats her well and with whom she can have a child. The Saudi woman told the TV show presenter that she wishes to find a right match through the program.

Rabat – Abdessadek Bouchtaoui, lawyer of the long-detained Hirak Rif activists, was sentenced by Al Hoceima’s court of Appeal, Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum has reported. The court pronounced its verdict against El  Bouchtaoui, charging him with “insulting officials and representatives of the authority while on duty” and “threatening public bodies.” The court has also accused El Bouchtaoui of “inciting activists to commit crimes” and to organize “unauthorized protests.” The news was also confirmed in a Facebook post by Mohamed Aghnaj, a member of the defense committee.  The court has also announced verdicts ranging from five to 20 years imprisonment against seven activists for their involvement in unauthorized protests in the Rif. Two of the seven detained activists were sentenced to 20 years in prison for setting fire to police residences, and for using violence against law enforcement, reported Spanish news agency, EFE. On January 16, Casablanca’s Court of Appeals sentenced seventeen protesters to prison terms ranging from 10 months to 3 years after their involvement in “unauthorized demonstration and disobedience.” Approximately 400 Hirak activists were arrested in a crackdown on protests held in Al Hoceima province between 2016 and 2017 following the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck.

Raba – During an informal press conference Wednesday in Rabat, the Minister of Youth and Sports lambasted some religious practices during children’s holiday camps. Rachid Talbi Alami, who made a scathing attack on the performance of Al-Fajr and Friday prayers on children’s holiday camps, is said to have been particularly addressing his criticisms to scout organizations sympathetic towards the PJD (Justice and Development Party). “It is forbidden to wake children up at 3 am during holiday camps for performing Al Fajr prayer”, the minister told journalists on Wednesday. Rachid Talbi Almi, who is a known sympathizer, and member of the executive committee of the Centre-Right party RNI (National Rally of Independents), also said in his conference that “We cannot tolerate that children be expected to sit in the sun during Friday prayers.” He also announced that his ministry is working on programs aimed at countering such practices and especially conceived for holiday camps, warning that “Associations that do not respect the rules and regulations that the new programs will introduce won’t be authorized to organize holiday camps.” Some associations and observers have perceived the minister’s comments as a “not-so-veiled hostility” towards associations and youth organizations close to the PJD. Sâad Hazim, president of Ar-Rouad, one of the associations that the minister’s comments supposedly targeted, is alleged to have retorted to Talbi Alami’s remarks by saying that they are “statements full of fallacies. The first one being the allegation that those children are forced to perform Al Fajr, which is a lie.” He allegedly explained that children who take part in the activities organized by his association are not forced to do anything. “They spontaneously perform their prayers, having been used to doing so in their family homes.” “Children can’t be prohibited from praying, just as they can’t be told to pray, as many of them have not yet reached the legal age for that”, Sâad Hazim was quoted as also saying. Sâad Hazim, however, seems to share the Youth and Sports Minister’s opinion on children’s prolonged exposure to the sun during Friday prayers. “I do not remember that we ever put children in such a position.” “I am of the minister’s opinion when he lambastes the singing to children of lyrics that do not correspond to their age”, Hazim concluded, citing, by way of example, the singer Chaabi Zina Daoudia, whose lyrics and songs he deemed inappropriate and “incompatible” with a very young audience.

Rabat – Morocco’s national railway company (ONCF) has ordered 30 Prima electric locomotives from the French multinational transport company, Alstom. According to a statement issued by Alstom, the deal between the French multinational and the Moroccan rail company is the result of an international tender launched by ONCF in March 2017. The contract signed between ONCF and Alstom is worth EUR 130 million. The locomotives that Alstom will supply Morocco will be manufactured in Alstom’s Belfort plant, read the statement.

Rabat – A year of investigations carried out by Guardia Civil de Melilla has led to the arrest of 4 members of a prostitution ring that exploited Moroccan women “in conditions close to slavery.” Elements of the Guardia Civil de Melilla arrested and jailed four members of a prostitution ring that exploited Moroccan women, Europa Press TV reported today. The dismantled network was composed of three men. Its leader is a 40-year-old Moroccan man. A woman was involved while a fifth suspect is currently under investigation. During the dismantling of the prostitution network, the police found family records, a Spanish passport, money, several documents and mobile phones. Pimps were also in possession of three kilograms of hashish and doses of cocaine. .@guardiacivil ha desmantelado en #Melilla una organización dedicada al tráfico de seres humanos con fines de explotación sexual y laboral https://t.co/h3QWYBjVm6 pic.twitter.com/0s5WTdZJyD — Europa Press TV (@europapress_tv) 8 February 2018  The Guardia Civil got wind of the case earlier last year. The suspects targeted women with very limited economic resources, and brought them into Melilla with a promise of a better life. Once there, these foreign and undocumented women were forced to engage in prostitution in two apartments of the same building. The victims, including minors, suffered “conditions close to slavery.” In a press release issued Friday, the Guardia Civil said there is no information on the number of women who may have been exploited by the dismantled network. But previous findings by Spanish NGO Melilla Acoge reveal that about 1000 Moroccan women work as prostitutes in the Spanish city. Women are forced into prostitution because of “misery and complicated personal situations,” according to the NGO.  Most prostitutes are widows, divorced, have children to support, or come from families without financial means. “A lot of us think they want to leave,” said the NGO, recognizing that abandoning a life of prostitution is difficult.

Rabat – After being suspected of hiding drugs in her stomach, a Brazilian woman was arrested on February 1 at the Mohammed V International Airport.  The national police (DSGN) said in a statement that the alleged trafficker, aged 59, was arrested upon her arrival onboard a flight from Sao Paulo. The suspect was later sent to the Ibn Rochd university hospital in Casablanca where a quantity of 750 g of cocaine, 89 pills, was removed from her stomach.  The alleged trafficker remained in custody in order to complete an investigation led by the public prosecutor, according to the same source.

Similarly, in December 2017, a quantity of 1.455 kg of cocaine was found hidden in the underwear of a 33-year-old Brazilian national.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has officially denied rumors that Morocco held direct negotiations with the Polisario Front. The Moroccan government spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, further reaffirmed on Thursday that no meetings between the two parties to the Western Sahara conflict are planned. In a press briefing held on Thursday in Rabat following a cabinet meeting, El Khalfi denied “categorically” the rumors reported by news outlets affiliated to the separatist group. Earlier this week, several of these news outlets reported on initial direct talks between Moroccan and Polisario representatives in Berlin in the presence of the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler. El Khalfi added that these sources claiming knowledge about “this kind of issue are desperately trying to hide the Polisario Front’s recent repeated failures at all levels.” While the front is desperate to hold talks over the Western Sahara conflict, Morocco has made its position regarding the idea of negotiations clear after Polisario’s repeated illegal maneuvers in the buffer zone of Guerguerat. “There are absolutely no direct talks [between Morocco and Polisario] and nothing is planned in this regard,” said El Khalfi, who was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The government spokesman made a similar statement on January 26, reaffirming that Morocco has made its position clear concerning direct or indirect meetings with the separatist group, refusing any meeting following their illegal operations in Guerguerat. In January, Kohler sent an invitation to Morocco, Polisario and the other parties to the conflict (Algeria and Mauritania) in hopes of opening another round of negotiations in Berlin, Germany. Kohler’s proposal was welcomed by the separatist group, while the Moroccan government was reluctant to meet with Polisario leadership following the group’s provocative in the region.

Rabat – A recent Jeune Afrique report has pointed towards Morocco’s intention to introduce a motion that would call for the expulsion from the African Union of the Polisario Front-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. “In the corridors of the AU, Moroccan diplomats are not unforthcoming about their intention to introduce, with time, a motion requesting the exclusion of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR)”, Jeune Afrique wrote. These allegations, should they be true, are hardly surprising. In a recent report, BMI had already predicted that Morocco, now being in the ascendant in continental affairs, was finally close to having almost all the necessary means to make such a move. BMI said that Morocco’s AU membership “alarmed” and “hardened” the Polisario Front which negatively perceived the triumphant return of Morocco to continental affairs as an official and integral player. Morocco’s “home-coming” story is rather remarkable. Until 2016, the Kingdom was not part of the African Union, having left the organization in 1984 amidst disagreements on the Western Sahara question. The kingdom was readmitted in January 2017, which many observers have attributed to King Mohamed VI’s “Pan-African vision” endorsed by an Africa-centered foreign policy and a certain belief that “Morocco’s future belongs in its continent.” The Kingdom has since gained in prominence in continental dealings, with many African leaders and commentators agreeing that Morocco’s return is a “positive force” and an “added value” to the organization. And, to add insult to injury for the Polisario Front, Morocco was elected late last month to AU’s Peace and Security Council, which, according to BMI, showed “growing support for the kingdom among its African pers.” “The two-year membership will give the country significant leverage over the organization and may help Rabat influencing more AU members to back a motion, signed by 28 AU members on July 18 2016, calling for the SADR’s suspension from the AU,” said the BMI report as it commented on the possible implications of Morocco’s rise to strategic prominence by securing a vote to AU’s organ in charge of security and conflict-related issues. “Given the results of the elections that saw Morocco win a seat in AU’s PSC, they [Moroccan diplomats at the AU] have some reasons to believe that such a motion would be approved”, Jeune Afrique further noted in their report of Morocco’s alleged motion to be introduced to the AU. In effect, on January 26, when Morocco bid to replace Algeria in AU’s PSC, 39 countries voted in favor, whereas only 16 abstained. There are suggestions that Morocco now has the means to influence the decisions made in AU’s most strategic deliberations, especially given King Mohamed’s professed Pan-African orientation in his foreign policy, the enormous efforts invested in securing a strategic position in Africa, and the numerous bilateral treaties that Morocco has signed with its African peers over the recent years.                                   The only challenge standing in the way of Morocco’s reported plan to introduce the alleged motion remains to convince a number of countries that have not yet been supportive towards Morocco’s position on the “Western Sahara question.” But that, Jeune Afrique suggested, no longer seems like a mountain to climb. “Although the votes [for the seat in the PSC] are electronic and therefore secret, Morocco knows who the abstainers are and plans to launch an intensive lobbying campaign to convince them”, Jeune Afrique wrote. Morocco is also said to be deploying an armada of Moroccan senior officials and diplomats known for their “pragmatism and professionalism” and revered in African circles of foreign policy experts and practitioners.

Rabat – Spain’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Alfonso Dastis, has once again reassured the Spanish parliament that Morocco is not exploiting the territorial waters of the Canary Islands. According to the Spanish official, “development and prosperity in Morocco are legitimate objectives that Spain should respect and encourage.” Dastis’ pronouncement was made in the plenary session of the Spanish Congress, as reported by the Spanish news outlet Europa Press on February 7. The minister’s remarks came in response to a question asked by a parliament member from the Podemos Party, Mira Pita. The parliamentarian urged the minister to use diplomatic powers to “prevent” multinational companies from exploiting the natural resources of a marine area that is considered a “cetacean sanctuary.” The Podemos parliamentarian claimed that the waters between the cities of Tan-Tan and Sidi, where oil exploration projects are carried out by the Italian company, ENI, belong to the area ‘taken away from the Sahrawi people.” According to the MP, Morocco’s decision to give exploration rights to ENI would “violate the 2005 agreement of delineation of waters between Spain and Morocco.” To respond to Pita’s accusations against the Moroccan government, Dastis said that Morocco and Spain have not delineated their waters. Instead, both countries are acting in accordance to standard equidistance principles. The minister reinforced his statement by emphasizing that applying this criterion would further prove that the waters are undoubtedly within the jurisdiction of Morocco. The minister added that the actions of both Spain and Morocco must be in line with international laws, which require respect for the environment, reported Europa Press. Dastis also recalled his talks held with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs about this issue. Dastis said that he and Bourita both agreed that Morocco wants to “continue to talk about this issue in a spirit of respect and mutual trust.” Dastis echoed a statement he made in January during a meeting with Canary Islands President Fernando Clavijo, where he reaffirmed that Morocco is not exploiting the Canary Islands waters. Speaking at the congress, Dastis said the Spanish Embassy in Morocco is “closely monitoring” the issue and diplomats are in contact with local authorities. “The Spanish government is willing to inform the Canarian authorities with transparency as it recently did in a meeting with the regional president, Fernando Clavijo.”

By Hajar El Khaldi Rabat – Eighty-eight percent of Moroccan children use the internet daily. Worldwide, a new child joins the internet every half a second, and a total of 175,000 children go online for the first time every day, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).  Although the internet holds undeniable benefits and has become an essential element in daily life, it also has a potentially damaging dark side.The internet carries a host of risks for these new youth users, including cyber-bullying, access to harmful content, sexual exploitation, and the misuse of private information.  Laurence Chandy, UNICEF Director of Data, Research and Policy declared, “Every day, thousands of children are going online for the first time, which opens them up to a flood of dangers we are just coming to appreciate, let alone address.” In order to tackle this issue, Chandy maintained that governments should put more efforts into understanding and protecting “children’s online lives,” in addition to formulating policies and approaches to eliminate the most notorious dangers.  According to the report, children compose one out of three internet users. Efforts to protect this significant demographic  from digital world hazards, guard their personal information, and increase their access to safe online content have been insufficient The UNICEF report holds the private sector, mainly in the technology and telecommunication industries, as primarily responsible for spearheading a, due to the high impact that their industry products exert on children. Nevertheless, the report also maintains a sweeping collective responsibility, as it states that the obligation to protect children in the digital world lands on everyone, including governments, families, schools, and other institutions.  Children’s daily internet usage in Morocco has reached 88 percent, exceeding average internet usage at 60 percent, according to a 2016 survey conducted by research firm Averty in partnership with Kaspersky Lab.  In 2016 alone the study revealed that 60 percent of Moroccan children internet users were affected by computer security threats, such as viruses, privacy violations, and data loss.

Rabat – Following an investigation that exposed Chinese espionage in the African Union (AU) headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, AU Chairman Moussa Faki said Thursday in Beijing that he didn’t believe China would spy on the bloc’s headquarters, suggesting it was “a ploy to destabilize relations,” reported AFP.  The investigation, conducted by French newspaper Le Monde Afrique, claimed that over the last five years, all the AU servers were connected to other servers located in Shanghai. The organization’s technical staff later discovered that every night between midnight and 2 a.m., computer servers would reach a peak in data transfer activity.  Each night, the secrets of the AU were being stored more than 8,000 km away by a supposed diplomatically of Africa. After a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Faki said that these allegations are “all lies.”  “No maneuvers could distract and divert us from our mission of strengthening relations with China,” he said, adding that the African Union would open a new office in Beijing later this year with the support of Chinese government., He did not disclose which party would fund its operations. Chinese officials have previously denied espionage on African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa calling the report “sensational” and “absurd,” as well as an attempt to “divide China and Africa.”   The $200 million complex was built by China and donated to African Union in 2012. According to Le Monde Afrique, the computer systems were fully equipped by the Chinese, allowing them to open an undocumented portal that gives Chinese administrators access to the AU’s computing system.  An AU official, who spoke to Le Monde on the condition of anonymity, said that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British intelligence agencies (GCHQ) have also had their share of surveillance on the AU building, according to documents gathered by the daily in collaboration with The Intercept.

Rabat – Mohammed Abdennabaoui, president of the Prosecutor General’s Office, has ordered all public prosecutors to prepare, within one week, a detailed report on “the arrest and physical coercion for the settlement of traffic violations,” after several citizens complained about that on social media. In recent days, citizens have taken to social networks to speak out against the arrest of people who have not paid their fines for traffic offenses. According to several posts, motorcycle drivers found themselves handcuffed for unpaid fines. Abdennabaoui reacted to citizens’ complaints and issued a statement on February 8 clarifying citizen’s rights. In some cases, such as the accumulation of unpaid and repetitive fines, prosecutors can exercise “coercive constraint” on offenders. But, this procedure is tightly controlled by law, Abdennabaoui, said. Offenders must be informed of the judgment legally and can only be arrested starting 30 days after the warning is issued. Public prosecutors also need a judge’s agreement before exercising coercion. Abdennabaoui said that this practice is “an infringement of the legal procedures” in the penal code.

Rabat – As snow and rainfall are making travel impossible to and from several mountainous and rural regions in Morocco, delaying travel plans for thousands and causing schools to shut down, the Government has launched an “exceptional mobilization,” to respond to the consequences of the cold wave. Snowstorms have prevented travel on 38 national roads and shut down almost 900 rural schools. A statement given by the Ministry of Interior indicated that King Mohammed VI ordered government officials to take steps to open up affected areas and provide assistance to inhabitants. Following King Mohammed VI’s instructions, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani tabled the question during February 8 Governmental Council. He said that “an exceptional mobilization” has been put in place by various authorities responsible for opening the roads to areas isolated by the fall of heavy snow. This mission will benefit about 514 thousand people in 22 different provinces. Departments from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of National Education, the Royal Gendarmerie and the Auxiliary Forces and Civil Protection will monitor its progress. However, the Head of Government explained that despite these efforts “there are difficulties in some areas, mainly due to insufficient numbers of available snowplows.” These snowstorms, which reached up 200 centimeters, have caused damage in areas “where it hasn’t snowed for at least 50 years.” But El Othmani is optimistic. For him, “this does not prevent us from intervening,” by providing medical, shelter and food aid. El Othmani confirmed that more than 600 doctors, and nearly 2,000 nurses were mobilized to provide medical assistance to areas isolated due to snow and heavy rain. Additional healthcare has been made available to pregnant women, and 373 women in the delivery phase have been treated in general or specialized maternity hospitals, while special helicopters were mobilized to evacuate urgent cases to nearby hospitals. “The affected areas have also benefited from large quantities of food supplies, including flour, rice, sugar, tea, salt, oil and milk as well as blankets to fend the cold,” El Othmani Said. Student houses, boarding schools, hospitals, medical centers, and orphanages were supplied with blankets, according to a statement from Mohammed VI Solidarity Foundation. Despite all of these efforts, King Mohammed VI see that there is more to do to provide comfort for the rural areas of the country. El Othmani agrees and in turn stressed that aid will continue until the weather returns to normal.

Rabat- Morocco’s House of Councilors reportedly refused to provide the National Coalition for the Preservation of the Arabic Language “any form of subsidy” during a meeting on February 5, attended by only 3 of the eleven members of the office. The Coalition, which is mostly backed by the Party of Justice and Development (PJD), had requested a grant to support its fifth National Congress of Arabic Language, expected to take place March 9-10, according to sources cited by Moroccan news outlet Maghreb Intelligence. While the Coalition did not disclose the solicited amount, it is thought to be around several hundred thousand dirhams. After the Council’s decision, Fouad Bouali, the head of the National Coalition for the Preservation of the Arabic Language, expressed his regret regarding “the position adopted by an institution that is expected to represent the nation and support all activities that involve cultural, intellectual, and linguistic issues.” “This is the first time we asked for a grant to organize the 5th edition of the congress, we didn’t expect our request to be denied as the council is used to fund other activities despite being limited in scale,” Bouali told Morocco World News. The president of the coalition said he didn’t receive yet an official decision, hoping that the legislative body would reconsider it. Bouali noted that the annual event of Arabic Language will revolve this year around the “Linguistic choices and the new model of development in Morocco” and will see the presence of many political figures including the head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani, in addition to Moroccan intellectuals and academicians. Even though the house of Councilors chairman, Hakim Benchemmass, is an executive member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) and known for his anti-PJD stance, Bouali refused to give the decision a political dimension. Eight members of the House of Councilors, among whom are the former Minister of Handicrafts Abdessamad Kayouh and Neila Tazi, an advisor on behalf of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), refused to attend the meeting, according to a report by Assabah. They have accused Benchemass of putting the House of Councilors under the supervision of PAM, which could “endanger the independence of the Chamber by subjecting it to external directives.”

Rabat – In order to finance the first phase of the Nador West Med (NWM) project, the government is set to attract at least MAD 30 billion of private investments.  Coming from Moroccan nationals or other interested foreign investors, these funds are expected to be entirely disbursed for the first phase of the multifunctional site which is being constructed and will include a port and other kindred industries. “The project, given its conception—particularly its geographic location, will definitely attract other national and foreign investments, and will be a key factor in generating huge riches and numerous jobs, particularly for the Eastern part,” said senior employee at Nador West Med S.A, the company charged with developing, managing, and promoting the giant project. “Today, it truly is a race against the clock that has been declared in this first phase, and the works are going as initially planned, with a long-term development-oriented vision. Port infrastructures as well as the sea area associated with this first stage are set to be operational by mid 2021,” an informant noted. The government, for its part, as a crucial contributor to the realization of the project through the Hassan II funds, the Special Agency of Medideteranean Tangier, and the National Agency of Ports, is expecting the creation of 100,000 to 115,000 direct and indirect jobs by 2034, as well as massive revenues for public treasury estimated between 15 and 22 billion by 2021-2034.  The site will receive a wide range of activities—storage, hydrocarbons and logistics-related industries, for example. “According to the latest estimations, global investments in this first stage, public and private, are set to be around MAD 70 billion by 2034,” said the source.  As far as public investment is concerned, MAD 10 billion will be invested in the infrastructures, while 5 billion will go to the superstructures.  MAD 4.5 to MAD 5 more billion will also be invested in the motorway and railway linkage projects (these estimations are yet to be confirmed by studies set to be conducted by Morocco’s Railways Society (ADM) and the ONCF). MAD 3 more billion will be disbursed for maintenance and planning works in the project area. It should be noted that the Nador West Med project is being realized in the strategic bay of Bettoya, 30 km away from the town of Nador. The site is comprised of port infrastructures in duty-free zones, of a duty-free industrial platform on a total surface of 1500 ha and a development zone covering about 2,500 ha (at the time of study).  Concerning the port infrastructures, it is the consortium consisting of Morocco’s SGTM, Turkey’s STFA and Luxembourg Jan De Nul (JDN) which won, by means of an international call for bids launched in 2015, the bid for completing the first stage of the Nador West Med project.

Organized by the French Institute, the tribute, under the theme “Mohamed Choukri, in the present time”, will include an introductory screening of the documentary, “Choukri, a Sincere Man”, directed by Driss Deiback.

After the film is screened, filmmakers, writers and researchers will analyze Mohamed Choukri’s legacy during a roundtable discussion. Panelists will discuss what remains of his heritage and how the author has helped enrich and advance the literature of human psychology. “We miss Mohamed Choukri a lot, particularly given that writers no longer face reality with passionate bodies and souls,” said the events curator, Mustafa Akalay.

Rabat – A delegation of five journalists arrived in Israel on Monday, February 5 at the invitation of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Moroccan delegation, along with four other journalists from Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, commemorated the Holocaust amid the presence of senior Israeli officials.  According the official pages of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs on social media, the visit aims to give the delegation “a closer look at Israel, its policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and coexistence among the various micro-components through meetings with leaders from various political circles in government departments and the Knesset.” The official spokesman in Arabic for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hassan Kabia received the delegation, which started its visit at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center “Yad Vashem” where senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs talked about current issues. The delegation is also set to visit the holy sites of the three Abrahamic religions, as well as mixed Arab-Jewish cities like Acre, Al-Nasera, and Haifa. While Morocco does not have official ties with Israel, Moroccans seem to be a primary target for such invitations, especially over the last couple of years. In November 2016, seven Moroccan journalists visited Israel at what was described as an attempt to “polish Israel’s image in the Arab media.” These visit are often accompanied with outrage from the Moroccan public who accuse a number of Moroccans of being at the forefront of polishing the image of Israel in Morocco. According to Ynet, the online outlet for the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronot, one of the journalists declared, “I was extremely afraid of coming. We are under pressure from the Arab media, religious people and propaganda about the Palestinian issue.” Read Also: Seven Moroccan Journalists Visit Israel to ‘Improve’ its Image in Arab World

Rabat – Morocco’s National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) issued a statement on Wednesday announcing the withdrawal of Kosmos Energy and Capricorn Exploration and Development from Cap Boujdour, a headland where the companies were carrying out offshore projects on the northern coast of Western Sahara in southern Morocco. According to the statement, the two companies are said to have withdrawn from the Boujdour Maritime Licence, an agreement binding all companies operating in the area. ONHYM added that Kosmos Energy has been focusing on new projects, especially in West Africa, where oil was recently discovered. “Kosmos Energy has decided to continue its process of withdrawing from certain regions in the initial phase of the oil exploration process,” said the statement. ONHYM added that such decisions are common in the oil industry. “Investors regularly seek to limit and improve risk sharing and allocate capital in connection with oil exploration.” The statement added that a number of operations of this kind have taken place in recent years in various permits granted worldwide. “Despite its strategic decision and its interest in the Boujdour Maritime zone, Kosmos Energy will supervise the seismic acquisition work and the processing and interpretation of 3D seismic until the submission of the final report to ONHYM,” added the same statement. According to ONHYM, the Boujdour Maritime licenses granted to the companies were the subject of extensive 2D and 3D seismic work and the drilling of an exploration well. “However, despite the consistency and quality of these programs and given the size of the area, additional work is needed to further refine the potential assessment.” The statement added that both ONHYM and Kosmos Energy are convinced that there is real potential in the Boujdour Maritime area and that the chances of making hydrocarbon discoveries remain possible. Kosmos Energy, according to ONHYM, is leaving the door open to the possibility of potential discussions with Morocco’s mining office “for a possible return to oil exploration in Morocco.”

Rabat – One of the most exciting developments in the field of cultural diplomacy is taking place between February 8-18 in Casablanca.  The 24th annual Casablanca book fair is bringing together over 700 book vendors, and will have a special focus on the “guest of honor”, Egypt. Morocco and Egypt have had a tense relationship in recent years. Since President Al Sissi’s rise, Egypt has been growing closer to Algeria, a sore point for Morocco due to Algeria’s ongoing diplomatic attacks against her regional rival, as well as the funding of the separatist group Polisario. The distancing is said to have been precipitating by a media brawl, during the course of which two Moroccan video channels referred to the overthrow of Morsi’s government as a “coup.” Prior to that, the two countries enjoyed a long-standing political, and cultural relationship. On a practical level, the distance between the two African countries, which also play an important role in Middle Eastern relations, is damaging. Both Morocco and Egypt have legitimate security concerns related to border issues and the rise of terrorism and extremism, and have taken a tough stand on countering Islamist influence inside their countries, as well as regionally. Nevertheless, the issue of  national sovereignty remains central to Morocco, and President Sissi’s unwillingness to shift on the issue of Western Sahara has been a source of distrust, particularly after Egypt welcomed a Polisario delegation in 2016. That move was surprising and unwelcome after Egypt’s staunch support for Morocco during the brief diplomatic crisis involving the prior UN General Secretary Bai Ki Moon’s comments, which characterized Morocco’s presence in Western Sahara as “occupation”. The deterioration in relations continued with President Sissi’s participation in the Arab-African summit in November of 2016, which 9 Arab states withdrew from due to participation from Polisario. On the other hand, Egypt, currently involved in a dispute with Ethiopia over water issues, and the Grand Renaissance Dam project, took Morocco’s King Mohammed VI’s diplomatic visit to Ethiopia as a provocative reaction to Egypt’s participation in the summit. While to the rest of the world, this internecine bickering may not seem particularly important, and while,, to the extent the Polisario issue is covered at all, the separatists as presented as innocuous underdogs vying for self-determination, the issues involved are not only of great importance to Morocco, but have much wider potential repercussions. Algeria, in its quest for regional leadership (despite a high unemployment rate, persistent corruption, and uninspiring military junta at the head of the government), touts its deradicalization record in global fora, despite the fact that Islamists are actually gaining ground. It seeks to exploit any daylight between other leading countries, in an effort to bolster its own positions and importance on the international front. But setting aside regional rivalries, there are international actors who are ready to take advantage of any tensions between Morocco and Egypt, and in fact, are hoping that these differences may increase. Russia, for instance, has been developing independent relationships with both countries, primarily focused on defense contracts. Russia is seeking to gain foothold in Africa, though so far is lagging behind China, which has a lot more to invest in terms of infrastructure projects and non-lethal trade. China, however, is taking a neo-colonialist approach to infrastructure building; it’s seeking exploitation, rather than equal partnerships. Russia’s approach in other spheres of influence, thus far, has been to be seen as a loyal ally (up to a point) and a business partner in developing energy projects and security mechanisms. Russia’s historic predecessor, the Soviet Union backed Algeria, and armed and trained Polisario as a separatist terrorist group in Cuba. Today, however, with a world no longer quite as bipolar as during the Cold War, Russia strives to diversify its relationship portfolio, managing to play both sides of most conflicts and rivalries.  Russia-Egypt military relationship is growing; it would be growing without any MOrocco issues in the picture, because President Sissi is looking to empower and professionalize his army. However, where is any potential for a dispute, Russia seeks to be an instigator, rather than a peacemaker. One should look at Yemen and Syria, where Russia has been successfully conducting diplomatic and even business relations with various parties to the conflict; however, it is quite possible that Russia may have been originally behind the Houthi revold, just like it has stirred the pot in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, more recently in the Balkans, continuing the tradition of arming separatist groups and liberation movements left over from the Soviet Union – but with a more complex tasks of creating conflicts in order to exploit everyone involved, not just to face off the West. For now, Russia is at peace developing independent relations with each country – but if there is any chance for a tension to heat up, Russia will not miss an opportunity to exacerbate it to its own advantage, even if that means meddling and disseminating disinformation. Much has been written about Russia’s involvement in Western elections, but little is known to what extent Russia is meddling in other, less watched places and processes, such as in Africa. Two great regional powers bickering? That suits Russia’s interests in raising its own profile and growing stronger and more involved at the expense of both. If there is one actor, that hopes to see Egypt and Morocco’s relations continue to deteriorate, and cooperation becoming more tense, it is Iran, which has followed China’s lead in using the entire African continent as a backdrop for secretive operations, open interference, instigation of violence, and spreading chaos.  Iran has at times used Sunni extremist groups, such as various Muslim Brotherhood proxies, to its own advantage to destabilize potential rivals and create additional headaches for its adversaries. In Africa, it seeks to arm violent Shi’a militias, but may also exploit efforts aimed at curbing the activities of Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS, and Al Qaeda. It may fund these terrorists in order to weaken countries that may stand in the way of Iran’s influence elsewhere. Egypt, for instance, is a prime target, battling terrorism on the borders, fighting Muslim  Brotherhood internally, and is also part of the anti-Terrorism Quartet, which also included Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain, and which are the prime opposition to Iran in the Middle East. Having Egypt embroiled in endless controversy, distracted with minor issues, and at odds with other influential countries in Africa makes it less likely to pay attention to Iran’s activities elsewhere, and to provide effective backing to its partners. And Morocco is the polar opposite of Iran in every way – a stable monarchy with the line of descent going all the way to Mohammed, rather than a revolutionary ayatollah-led mixture of ideologies cobbled together with a dollop of Communist of influence, Morocco is effectively fighting corruption, seeking to improve education and employment, focusing on peaceful but effective regional diplomacy, and investing into solar energy, space technologies, its own citizens, and the training of imams from across the region in more moderate traditions of Islam – rather than expending its resources on expensive foreign entanglements and wasteful conflicts. For that reason, although Iran dares not confront Morocco directly, its success in Africa is not something particularly pleasing to the Islamic Republic, given its own increasing involvement in the continent. Morocco’s positive leadership and strong relations with other countries would provide a counterincentive for the disaffected and the disenfranchised, a more positive model for weak, dependent countries, and a bulwark against Iran’s aggressive expansionism. Poor relations with Egypt may put a damper on Morocco’s diplomatic successes, and undermine her authority. Given all these considerations, making Egypt the “guest of honor” at the book fair was a brilliant strategic move. Not only is this a peaceful gesture aimed at a subtle diplomatic reconciliation, but it also brings the two countries together on a cultural level, beyond the occasionally inevitable political grandstanding and resolution of strategic differences. Sending a gesture of goodwilll on a people-to-people level aims to restore long term trust, and inspire a joint cultural renaissance that emphasizes the positive things Egyptians and Moroccans can enjoy no matter what their governments are doing. The real bulwark against threats comes from long term respect and meeting of minds and hearts that no political crisis can fully undermine. Egypt and Morocco are joining for a positive purpose of setting an example of what friendship and joint efforts could do for contributing to culture and improving the world. Focusing on books, in this instance, also plays another important role: bringing into light the richness of Middle Eastern and African cultures, that go beyond the superficial view of them in the West and in popular understanding. For too long, the associations of Africa and the Middle East with corruption, backwardness, illiteracy, and superficial religious dogma prevented the world from exploring the rich traditions of intellectual discourse, the beauty of the many languages and dialects, the deeply emotional poetry, the subtle wit, and the irrepressible humor of intellectuals from the many traditions at their peak. The diverse book fair seeks to show that African countries are rising – not through warfare, conquest, or colonialist domination, but through encouragement of reading, exchange of ideas, education, and intellectual growth and openness. Perhaps soon all these books will gain a wider audience and will join the Western bookshelves, book clubs, and intercultural discussions, making everyone’s experience of other cultures and ideas a much more diverse, rigorous, and stimulating experience.

Rabat – The threat is alien, foreign, and un-American; it comes in different guises: Muslim, Black, immigrant; they come to “our country” and create “chaos” and “violence.” This about sums up the Trump administration’s stance on immigration, with the president repeatedly associating crime and violence with immigrants, and calling on Democrats last Tuesday to “get tough” on border security. After singling Sunni Muslims out in a late January security report as “potential terrorists,” suspicion is now shifting to “immigrants” as a whole; and casting them as an entity or a “bunch” of crime and violence-disposed individuals, according to a yesterday report in The Guardian. In a Tuesday speech, as he cited the death of Edwin Jackson, an Indianapolis professional footballer killed in drunken-driven crash which involved an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, Trump said that the incident was “one of many such preventable tragedies,” suggesting that the unfortunate incident would never have taken place had the US been “tougher on its borders” and more concerned about its “safety” than “diversity.” But the president is also said to be dismissive and critical of “legal immigrants” as he tirelessly insists that putting an end to the so-called diversity-promoting programs like the green card lottery will actually make America safer. “In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford”, Trump said in his State of the Union Speech, adding that, as he associated immigration with higher likelihood of membership in gangs in the US, “Not another country in the world has the stupidity of laws that we do.” “Trump has marshaled government resources to try to portray immigration as a threat, despite several studies that have shown immigrants as actually less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States,” The Guardian commented, highlighting government-sponsored studies and reports that have increasingly been pleading the case that immigration is the highest security risk confronting the US. But for all the criticisms portraying the Trump’s administration’s reports and data as lopsided and based on “cherry-picking” to endorse biased and short-sighted immigration laws, the president appears to be convinced that immigration is a threat, and immigrants—legal or illegal—need to be constantly monitored or altogether prevented from entering the US. “If we don’t get rid of these loopholes where killers are allowed to come into our country and continue to kill… if we don’t change it let’s have a shutdown,” Trump suggested, giving the Democrats until March 5, to reach an agreement on immigration.

Rabat – Fez’ Municipal Council met Thursday to discuss various points related to the city’s management, including the increasing leachate discharge from which the city’s inhabitants have been suffering. To remedy the city’s heightened concern with sewage and the toxic smell it generates, the Municipal Council has proposed the establishment of a facility for processing toxic leachate, which will also be producing energy for the city. The project is set to cost MAD million 118.73, and will be realized through the joint efforts of the municipality of Fez, the Ministry of Interior, and the General Secretariat at the Ministry for Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development. The project, which was agreed upon and adopted yesterday, will receive a MAD million 10 contribution from the state General Secretariat in charge of Sustainable Development. It is also said that the Project is a part of a border initiative of liquid sanitation in Fez. On the sidelines of the energy production project, another deal pertaining to the restoration of drainage channels was signed.  The project will consist in renewing the existing channels, extending the areas they cover from 6,370 m to 8,535m, and expanding the sludge sewage and contaminated water processing station. This final project is estimated to require an investment of MAD million400 for a period of five years. It will be financed by the Ministry of Interior (MAD million 40), the General Secretariat for Sustainable Development (MAD million 60), and the Regie Autonome Intercommunale de Distribution D’Eeu et D’Eelctricite de Fes (RADEEF)—the city’s organization in charge of the distribution of water and electricity (MAD million 300).

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, denied all allegations regarding the safety of drinking water that is produced from Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah Dam in Rabat.   During a Wednesday, February 7 meeting at the Bouregreg water purification facility organized by the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water concerning the quality of drinking water in the region, Othmani assured Moroccans that the water produced at the Bouregreg station is safe to drink. “You are in good hands when it comes to drinking water,” he said. The Bouregreg water facility supplies the populations of Rabat, Sale, Temara, Mohammadia and Casablanca.  In an attempt to reassure citizens, El Othmani said that one of the quality control regulations at the facility states: “All workers are strictly prohibited from bringing in bottled water, since they drink the water that was treated at the station and that they have watched over its filtration themselves.” This was perceived by the prime minister as evidence of the high level of integrity of both the workers and the facility’s management in managing the region’s water supply. “I can only salute the people responsible at this station because they are invisible soldiers, unknown to the public, that conduct important patriotic work and take all the precautions to insure the security, safety, and health of the citizens,” El Othmani said. After acknowledging their efforts, the Head of Government asked those in charge of the plant to continue to provide safe, clean and affordable drinking water to the region. Furthermore, Othmani used the meeting as an opportunity to dispel all public doubts, and to emphasize the numerous testing and monitoring phases that the water goes through in order to become potable. In the same context, the Head of Government assured citizens that the laboratory conducts analyses that follow the standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) in coordination with the Ministry of Health. First opened in 1969, the Bouregreg water facility is considered the first and largest water purification station in Morocco, since it provides drinking water to nearly seven million citizens.

By Hajar El Khaldi Rabat – UK based organization British Society for Plant Pathology (BSPP) reports the first occurrence of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) in Morocco. BSPP’s New Diseases Reports (NDRs) bulletin, declared that the ToLCNDV constitutes a threat to the Moroccan production of cucurbit, include wax gourd, watermelon, cucumber, pumpkin, and zucchini; and Solanaceae plant family which include potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers. ToLCNDV was first found in India in 1995, then in other Asian countries soon after, and more recently spread in Mediterranean countries, initially in Spain, Tunisia and Italy where it has been causing serious problems to growers, and more lately in Morocco. The virus spreads either by direct contact or by seeds and infects plants throughout its life cycle and passes on the virus to its offspring; which makes managing the virus very challenging. The outbreak has also been confirmed by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) since symptoms resembled those caused by ToLCNDV were observed in zucchini crops near Agadir and Taroudant in 2017. “The incidence of disease was significant, with severe yellow mosaic symptoms accompanied by leaf curling and roughness of the fruit skin. The infected plants had smaller and fewer fruits when compared to healthy ones, and in most cases, fruit bursting was observed,” reads the report. Morocco’s environmental conditions are favorable for cucurbit and Solanaceae crops; which makes them greatly significant to the economy. In fact, Morocco produces around seven million tons of cucurbit and Solanaceae plant crops annually, 750 000 tons of which are exported to markets in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.

Rabat – After the African Nations Championship (CHAN) drew to a close on February 4, the Moroccan national team left an indelible mark on the international football community.  The British-based news outlet The Sun was full of praise for two Moroccan footballers who contributed to Morocco’s victory during the 2018 CHAN. In a post published on February 5, The Sun profiled five CHAN stars, “who could be Europe-bound.” Morocco’s forward Ayoub El Kaabi and midfielder Waleed El Karti were both included on the list. Introducing El Kaabi, the British news outlet says that he was the top scorer at the tournament after earning nine goals for his team in “just five appearances.” “No-one has ever scored more goals in a single African Nations Championship before.” The Casablanca-born star delivered excellent performances during the competition. His world-class skills were showcased during the semi-final match against Namibia on January 27. As the competition is considered to be an opportunity for the African players, El Kaabi has reportedly received several offers, especially from Egyptian top-ranked football clubs. According to The Sun, El Karti’s skills and abilities are clear, “although he had found it difficult to break into the main national team squad.” Recalling El Karti’s goal against Egyptian top-ranked football team Al Ahly during the final game of the African Champions League, The Sun called him“one of the most talented [football] players to come out of Morocco in recent years.” The news outlet added that the competition is still a chance for football stars to “catch the eye and maybe, earn a big move to a European league.”

Rabat – As the race to win the hosting rights for the 2026 FIFA World Cup intensifies, the African country has selected 12 cities to host the enormous tournament, according to Moroccan sports news outlet Liondelatlas. Morocco is competing against a three-nation North American bid submitted by the USA, Canada and Mexico. A decision on the winner is expected around June 13 during the FIFA Congress. The source added that Morocco’s Minister of Sports and Youth, Rachid Talbi El Alami, announced in Rabat during a press conference on Tuesday that the cities were selected according to several criteria, including hotels and transportation infrastructure. The 12 cities chosen to host the international tournament are Casablanca, Marrakech, Tetouan, Nador, Meknes, El Jadida, Fez, Oujda, Tangier, Agadir, Rabat and Ouarzazate. When one of the journalists asked the minister about the choice of Ouarzazate, El Alami replied, “It is a city known internationally for its cinema industry and for its solar power plant Noor.” Regarding the stadiums, the sports website said that 14 stadiums will be ready by 2026 to host the World Cup. Marrakech and Casablanca will have the privilege of having two stadiums each. Earlier this week, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Morocco’s Minister of Trade and the Chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid Committee, voiced Morocco’s willingness to do its utmost in order to clinch the right to host the tournament. According to Elalamy, the committee has already formulated a strategy to highlight and exploit Morocco’s potential and its apparent advantages. “Morocco has already embarked on a vast and ambitious investment program in the areas of infrastructure and hotel industry that meets the needs of the local population in the first place,” said Elalamy. Elalamy has also discussed Morocco’s readiness to build new stadiums across the country to house the dozens of matches planned for the tournament. “We are also proposing modular stadiums that will continue to operate after the World Cup,” he said, stressing that, “no dirham will be spent if it cannot ultimately serve the population.” Recently, Morocco hosted the African Nations Championship (CHAN), which saw its conclusion on February 4. Throughout the competition, members of the African Football Confederation (CAF), including its President Ahmad Ahmad lauded Morocco’s commitment to the competition. He also pointed out that Morocco is capable of organizing big international competitions like the 2026 World Cup. According to Ahmad, the members of the CAF organizing committee and members of the executive bureau, football teams, and referees have unanimously praised Morocco’s excellent organization and preparedness, from the quality of the football stadia and arbitration procedures to the quality of local infrastructure and hotels. Kwesi Nyantakyi, first vice president of CAF, shared the same opinion as that of his boss (Ahmad), emphasizing that Morocco “has honored Africa” with its “excellent organization of 2018 CHAN.”

Rabat – The role of agriculture in economic development cannot be overstated. In fact, there seems to be, in the literature of development studies, an overwhelming consensus on the centrality of agriculture in achieving sustainable economic development.  In sub-Saharan Africa, however, policymakers and other stakeholders have, so far, been frustratingly failing to satisfy the requirements of a successful and productive agricultural sector, leading, as a result, to food insecurity, hunger, and extreme poverty. Sub-Saharan agriculture is lagging, sluggish, and fails to feed a booming and vibrant population. The region is in dire need of an agricultural revolution. Today, these are questions any sub-Saharan government should be attending to: How do we attain food security and self-sufficiency in the next decade? How do we, as a nation, ensure that citizens’ nutritional needs are satisfactorily met, while lifting thousands out of poverty? In February 2016, as if in direct response to such concerns, the Office Cherifien de Phosphates (OCP) announced its African venture plan: OCP Africa. Amongst the many goals that OCP Africa listed in its “African venture’s” roadmap, the group put a particular stress on helping the region rise up to the challenges of meeting food security and improved crops production. After launching the Africa Fertilizer Complex in February 2016, by March of the same year, 9 subsidiaries were established in Nigeria, Benin, Senegal, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, and Kenya. This, OCP said, was part of a larger strategic vision to secure “the cornerstones of development in Africa”. And towards the end of 2016, OCP extended its venture to some other countries, including Rwanda, Mozambique and Ethiopia. To date, the group has about 14 sub-Saharan subsidiaries. Most importantly, projects to build fertilizer plants are on the verge of completion in some of the cited countries. “Strongly committed to South-South cooperation, development, we put Africa at the heart of our growth plan using a personalized approach, which led to the creation of OCP Africa. The newly created subsidiaries aim at meeting the challenge of a structured, efficient, and sustainable agriculture”, said OCP’s chief Mostafa Terrab in the group’s 2016 annual report. Describing the group as an “African company” unfailingly committed to satisfying the growing needs of an expanding African population, Terrab went on to point out that in 2016 alone, OCP’s African exportations increased by 70%. As to the rationale behind such a bold and assertive sub-Saharan venture, OCP is clear in its 2016 annual report: “Africa’s central role in the new Moroccan cooperation strategy and the continent’s enormous potential for growth are behind OCP’s interest in adopting a proactive approach to developing sustainable African agriculture.” In this sense, OCP Africa can genuinely contribute to unleashing Africa’s inner strength and realizing Africa’s dream of self-reliance because, essentially, OCP’s cooperation with sub-Saharan Africa is an intra-African cooperation; it is simultaneously a marriage of love and convenience. But can OCP really help leapfrog sub-Saharan Africa’s lagging agriculture? Can the group, as defined in its “African objectives”, help realize an African-style Green Revolution? OCP owes its global reputation to an expanding global population and an increasing global demand for phosphate and kindred products. And as of recently, the group is, by far, the global leader in the production and exportation of fertilizers and phosphate products. Furthermore, with Morocco being home to 70% of global reserves of phosphates, it can safely be said that OCP’s unrivaled control on the fertilizer market will remain unchallenged for years to come. As such, even in a region that, in its level of agricultural productivity, has lagged behind all other regions of the world, one can make a very robust case for OCP’s potentials to rekindle agriculture and reach sustainable growth and prosperity. It has been observed that contrary to farmers in other parts of the world, sub-Saharan farmers make no or little use of chemical fertilizers. The result, by and large, is poor crop yields and a ridiculously low supply of staple food and some other basic necessities. While, for example, a North American farmer yields up to 12 tons of maize by hectare of arable land, his sub-Saharan counterpart can only reap up to 1 ton. This massive disparity between the efforts invested and the production obtained explains the desperation that is befalling many African farmers, not to mention the increasing lack of safe, affordable and nutritious food that is the lot of many sub-Saharan states. In such a context, if African policymakers and entrepreneurs are serious about the “Africa We Want” narrative, a motto popularized by a 2015 African Union Commission report, the use of chemical fertilizers is now a political imperative. In 2016, while global average use of fertilizers was 120 kg/ha, Africa’s was a mere 21kg/ha; no wonder then that the continent imports one-third of what it consumes. But with a population exponentially growing and expected to reach 2 billion by 2050, Africa can no longer afford to delay its agricultural revolution: now is the time to take that much overdue leap of faith: encourage the use of chemical fertilizers, introduce farmers to mechanized means of production, and invest in agriculture-related research. To successfully do that, why bother looking elsewhere when the continent is already home to the world’s leading producer of fertilizers? In 2003, The Economist called Africa “a hopeless continent”, a bleak and dark place which the entire globe had given up on. A decade later, in March 2013, acknowledging the rapid changes and the palpable wind of economic transformations that were blowing through the entire continent, the outlet published a laudatory article that called Africa “a continent of hope”, and saying “Africa is rising”. “Africa is rising” has since been the subject of numerous controversies. Without dwelling on a controversy in which there is nothing new or original left to say, it is safe to argue that OCP Africa can help realize the dream of an Africa that is truly “rising”. In fact, the original Africa rising narrative puts a disproportional emphasis on GDP growth, which, though commendable, does not focus on the daily hurdles of African populations. As Rwanda’s former minister of agriculture Agnes Kalibata put it, “Growth in agriculture is 11 times more effective than growth in any other sector.”With OCP’s technical expertise, its policy of ‘greater outreach to small farmers’, and its unsurpassed acumen in the production of fertilizers, the group can help its African partners capitalize on the abundant potentials and opportunities of the continent’s agricultural sector, thus realizing a growth that is green, equitable, inclusive, and sustainable. Since venturing into sub-Saharan markets in 2016, OCP has signed numerous contracts with private and public shareholders, trained and introduced thousands of farmers to the efficient use of fertilizers around Africa, helped various governments in their national agricultural caravans, and heavily invested in agriculture-oriented research. The Ethiopian government, for example, signed with OCP a strategic partnership that will see the construction in the country of a world class fertilizer plant—production is estimated to start by 2022 with an annual capacity of 2.5-3.8 metric tons. A similar strategic partnership has been signed with Rwandan government. In Nigeria, two such partnerships—one with Dangote Group to build a fertilizer plant in Edo state, and another with the country’s association of fertilizer producers and suppliers to boost fertilizer use and availability on the local markets as well as provide technical support to farmers—have also been signed. In July last year, over 5000 small farmers in Nigeria’s Kaduna state took benefited from an OCP-led ‘Agribooster Scheme’: they were trained and subsidized to use high-quality fertilizers to improve their crop yields. If the continent is to gain and maintain momentum, perpetuating such initiatives is desperately needed. In its second Lions on the Move report, Mckinsey Global Institute found that Africa needs more substantially big African companies to power growth and meet the imperative demand of substituting imports of manufactured goods. As such, mobilizing local resources, nurturing and deepening regional integration, and investing in agriculture to improve the quality of African lives should no longer be the sole preserve of political meetings or policy briefings: it is an urgent imperative and needs implementing now. By 2050, Africa’s food need is expected to triple, and the dream of a prosperous and self-reliant Africa is untenable if the continent is to remain a net importer of agricultural products. So, in the continent’s current nutritional state of volatility and extreme insecurity, embracing and capitalizing on OCP Africa will be an added value to the continent’s goal of diversifying national economies and improving lives. To think otherwise is pure fantasy.

Rabat – Contrary to what was reported by news outlets affiliated with the Polisario separatist front, Morocco did not hold any “indirect negotiations” in Berlin this week on the conflict over Western Sahara. The news was confirmed by Moroccan news website Le360, which quoted an unidentified Moroccan diplomat. Le360’s source denied allegations that Moroccan authorities held indirect talks this week in Berlin with Horst Kohler, the Personal Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General. In January, Kohler sent an invitation to Morocco, Polisario and the other parties to the conflict (Algeria and Mauritania) in hopes of opening another round of negotiations in Berlin, Germany. Kohler’s proposal was welcomed by the separatist group, while the Moroccan government was reluctant to meet with Polisario leadership following the group’s provocative illegal actions conducted in the buffer zone of Guerguerat. On January 26, Morocco’s Government Spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi confirmed that Morocco had received an invitation for “indirect negotiations” in Berlin. El Khalfi, however, made Morocco’s position clear concerning direct or indirect meetings with the separatist group, refusing any meeting after their illegal maneuvers in the region. Moroccan political observers have been explaining that Polisario’s recent maneuvers are a sign of its unwillingness to reach a just and mutually acceptable solution to the four-decade-long conflict. Analysts, including university professor Reda El Fellah, have considered the timing chosen by the UNSG envoy as inappropriate. El Fellah said that Morocco cannot accept Kohler’s invitation to negotiate with Polisario at this time. “At the level of the international community, this [move] would give the impression that Morocco is knuckling under the Separatist group’s recent maneuvers in Guerguerat.” A separatist delegation led by the front’s leader, Ibrahim Ghali, reportedly met with Kohler in Berlin on January 25. The meeting came only a few days after Kohler addressed invitations to the relevant parties to the Western Sahara conflict to participate in separate talks to be held in Germany in January and February, according to a January 23 statement from Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman for the United Nations Secretary-General.

Rabat – Morocco’s unemployment rate increased modestly in the 2016-2017 fiscal year, according to the High Commission for Planning’s (HCP) labor market figures. The HCP figures show the increase of the national unemployment rate from 9.9 percent to 10.2 percent between 2016 and 2017, increasing 4.2 percent year-on-year. The number of unemployed individuals rose from 1,167,000 to 1,216,000 people in the time period, marking an increase of 49.000 people. Most of this increase is registered in urban areas. According to the HCP note, the unemployment rate increased from 14.2 percent to 14.7 percent in urban areas while rural unemployment was lower at 4 percent. The report added that the highest unemployment rate remains for young people aged 15 to 24 at 26.5 percent. The rate for adults aged 25 to 34 is 17.9 percent and 14.7 percent for women. During this period, the Moroccan economy saw the creation of 86,000 jobs, with 32,000 posts in urban areas and 54,000 in rural ones, compared to a loss of 37,000 jobs a year earlier, reports the HCP. The services sector created 26,000 jobs, while agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors added a total of 42,000 jobs. Construction and public works added 11,000 jobs, while textiles and the creative industry including artisanat created 7,000 posts. However, these figures continue a trend of flat job growth in several sectors that have kept unemployment stubbornly high for several years. Increase of Underemployment The note of the HCP also showed a slight increase in underemployment, which refers to a population employed at less than full-time in regular jobs or at jobs inadequate with their training or economic needs. The report notes that the underemployed population reached 1.044.000 individuals, marking a .02 percent rise compared to 2016 (9.6 percent to 9.8 percent) at the national level. By gender, the rate of underemployment reached 11.1 percent among men, with 8.8 percent in urban areas compared to 14.1 percent in rural ones, and 5.4 percent among women, with 9 percent in urban areas versus 2.3 percent in rural ones. These HCP figures also include unpaid employment. Finally, the number of newly created paid jobs has risen to 57,000, with 22,000 in urban areas and 35,000 in rural ones, while unpaid employment posts are estimated at 29,000, with 20,000 in rural areas and 9,000 in urban ones.

Rabat- More than MAD 70 billion is reportedly being dedicated to improve material resources and educational conditions for university students during the current academic year, said the head of government, Saad Eddine El Othmani on Monday, February 5, before the House of Representatives in Rabat.   As part of the implementation of the strategic vision of the 2015-2030 reform program, and in accordance with the 2016-2021 Government Action Program, El Othmani pointed out that a strategic plan for higher education and scientific research has been developed which covers a series of measures aimed at strengthening the university-level provision and implementing significant educational reform related to higher education. Access to universities to increase 30% next year Regarding university pedagogical reform, the prime minister presented several measures that have been adopted such as the upgrading of public university infrastructure, health and sports facilities within campuses, the renovation of all facilities and equipment. Importantly, there will be an increase in the number of students accepted into institutions that have historically limited access or enrollment. Access to those institutions will grow 20 percent during the current year and 30 percent for the next academic year. 700 positions in 2018 for HR management The prime minister added that projects will be launched to evaluate and develop the pedagogical system of higher education in terms of “diversity, openness, efficiency and innovation”, as well as to better monitor the application and respect of academic materials and intellectual property.

Rabat – Abdelhak Khiame, Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) has once again deplored Algeria’s unwillingness to cooperate on security issues relating to counterterrorism. Underscoring the importance of security cooperation, Khiam said in an interview given to the French-based newspaper, Le Monde, that Morocco has anti-terrorism partnerships with international security sources. The interview given to Le Monde is set to be published on Wednesday, according to  Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Khiam said that Morocco works with its partners effectively through exchanging information about bi-nationals tied with terrorist cells, including the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). “We have liaison officers in the partner countries and Western liaison officers are in Morocco,” he said. Khiam, however, has expressed his concerns over the lack of cooperation between Morocco and its eastern neighbor. “The problem is the absence of collaboration of the Algerians and the existence of an area controlled by a terrorist group,” he said, referring to the Polisario Front. Khiam said that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is still controlling southern Algeria and Mali, which is a threat to Morocco and the entire region. According to the BCIJ head “even if there are differences  [between the two organizations], they defend the same ideology.” This is not the first time when Khiam expressed his deep concerns over the region. In April 2017, Khiam told French TV Channel France 24, that since terrorism is a transnational threat, regional cooperation is very important. Deploring the lack of cooperation between Morocco and Algeria in security affairs, Khiam said that coordination with countries such as Mauritania is strong. But, with Algeria it is another story, adding that the Eastern neighbor is not that cooperation. The BCIJ chief has also discussed Morocco’s strategy to counter-terrorism and his bureau’s achievements. In the interview, Khiam told Le Monde, that the counter-terror bureau has managed to dismantle 49 terror cells since 2015. Forty-four of the 49 terror cells dismantled since 2016 had direct links to the so-called  Islamic State (ISI). According to the BCIJ chief, 772 people linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) were arrested since the creation of BCIJ in 2015. Khiam told Le Monde that 97 fighters, who returned from conflict zones, were also arrested. Eighty-four people of the arrested members returned from Iraq and Syria, while 13 were returned from Libya. Fifty-three other individuals were turned back by other countries were also arrested. Khiam has also mentioned the 7-member terror cell, which was operating in the cities of Tangier and Meknes. The cell was arrested on February 1. The BCIJ head added that Morocco’s strategy to counter terrorism has been reinforced as a law adopted in 2015 stipulates that anyone has rallied or attempted to join a region where a terrorist cell is operation has to be questioned, and brought to justice. Such suspects, according to Khyam, might be sentenced to up to fifteen years jail terms. After Morocco has introduced the biometric ID card and passport and the reinforcement of border controls “ we have had no more departures,” said Khiam, adding terror cells rely on internet to spread radicalized ideologies. Le Monde has also discussed the case of Moroccan-born bi-nationals involved in terrorist attacks that affected Europe. To respond to the newspaper questions, the official stated some possible factors that contributed to this situation, including the lack of appropriate laws to arrest suspects, according to MAP. Recalling the 2015 attacks in Paris and Brussels (2016), Khiam said that the “police knew that some individuals had gone to conflict zones, but in the absence of legal texts, they could not interrogate them.” He added that many of the young bi-nationals who committed terrorist acts were radicalized in prisons, adding that this explains that they were not integrated well into a certain society. Khiam added that ISIS members usually target zones, where civil wars are taking place to settle down. This poses a threat to Morocco and the entire region, he said, adding that the country is exchanging information with several countries in order to make the suspects’ arrest possible.

Rabat – On January 27, just a day after Morocco’s election to the AU’s Peace and Security Council (PSC), the Polisario Front entered the demilitarized zone in Western Sahara, which constitutes a violation the 1991 ceasefire agreement.  According to Moroccan political analyst Reda El Fellah, Polisario’s maneuvers in the region “sustain” Morocco’s position in the conflict. During the 32nd Ordinary Session of the Executive Council of the Pan-African organization, 30 AU member countries voted for Morocco’s membership on the PSC. Morocco’s election to PSC came just one year after the country’s AU return following nearly 33 years of absence. Several African countries lauded Morocco’s diplomacy and the country’s election to the AU’s PSC, considering it an asset that would contribute to Pan-African development. Morocco World News contacted El Fellah, who explained his perspective on the importance of Morocco’s election to the AU PSC and its impact on Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. According to analyst El Fellah, Morocco’s election “is very important for Morocco as well as for the African Union since it will support the decision-making process in the AU’s PSC and contribute to the achievement of its objectives, regarding peace and stability in the continent.” El Fellah, who is a university professor in Agadir, explained to MWN that the Peace and Security Council has been “paralyzed by hegemonic pretentions” since its creation in 2004, which made the council unable to cope with “the high level of instability in the continent.” The political analyst emphasized that the Moroccan seat on the council will “inject a sound balance inside the PSC, dominated up to now by unproductive and selfish hegemony.” Slamming Polisario’s maneuvers in the region, El Fellah said that the separatist ideologies are “increasingly losing ground and are predominantly regarded as a threat amplifier to stability in the context of terrorism and state failure.” The analyst added that the PSC has to focus more on conflict prevention in Africa through identifying the factors of insecurity and instability throughout the continent. “Today, Morocco’s election to the AU PSC would introduce a valuable commitment and contribute to overall efforts” that would help improve the security situation in the continent. El Fellah added that the African unity can be achieved through “defeating and rejecting separatist entities like Polisario.” The professor said that Polisario’s military illegal armed operations near the buffer zone of Guerguerat mirror “the state of despair” within both Polisario and its backer, Algeria. El Fellah has also lauded the new Western Sahara vision implemented by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his envoy Horst Kohler. The analyst said that the UN is “undoubtedly” exerting a new vision towards the four-decade-long conflict. “There is a new vision towards this conflict based on a realistic approach and a more balanced perspective of what could be a win-win agreement between the parties.” He added that Guterres and Kohler are “willing to implement this vision by pushing for a just and consensual solution taking in consideration the insecure context in the Sahel-Sahara region,” characterized “predominantly by illicit trafficking and organized crime.” Subsequently, the Moroccan contribution to fight against the separatist-terrorist-smuggler nexus “is widely acknowledged by the European Union and the international community,” added El Fellah. Through his MWN interview, El Fellah called on the Moroccan government to focus more on its diplomacy to reinforce its bilateral ties with all African countries. “In the meantime, Morocco needs to continue to play the card of soft power founded on South-South cooperation alternative. This strategy enables Morocco to gain the hearts and minds of African people and leaders.” The professor added that Morocco’s foreign policy after AU reintegration should be dedicated to consolidating the Pan-African vision, “which could enable the continental body to deal with Africa’s key priorities, notably political integration, peace and security, and human development.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a congratulatory message to Nabila Mounib on Tuesday, February 6 after the National Council of the United Socialist Party (PSU) elected her to a second term as Secretary-General of the party last Saturday.  The sovereign congratulated Mounib for retaining the trust of PSU National Council, saying that her election “reflects the members’ recognition of her commitment in defending the party’s principles.”  “We are certain that you will spare no effort to continue fulfilling your missions at the head of the party, and strengthen its position within a pluralistic political landscape, in order to make a constructive contribution, alongside other serious political bodies, to consolidate the national democratic model of development and consecrate the values of the noble practice of politics, based on the principle of placing the supreme interest of the Nation and the citizens above all consideration,” the King added.  Mounib’s election came nearly two weeks after the fourth National Congress of the PSU, during which Mounib presented her platform called “New Horizon.” Her campaign garnered 614 votes out of 900, in addition to 141 abstentions.  The PSU has also selected its new Political Bureau, which includes, among other members, MP Omar Balafrej, while Mohamed Sassi, Mohamed Moujahid, and Najib Akesbi have all been ousted from the bureau.  Mounib, better known among her followers as “Tata Nabila,” has been at the head of the PSU since 2012. She is also a professor of endocrinology at the University of Hassan II in Casablanca and became the first Moroccan woman to lead a political party.  Born in Casablanca, Mounib’s credentials, leadership style, and charisma made her a front-runner and a leading voice of reform during the parliamentary election campaign in 2016.  She was able to shift the current political discourse and gain wide popularity among both the educated electorate and college students in major cities, many of whom supported her over the PJD and PAM.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) issued a statement Tuesday refuting social media allegations claiming that Moroccan tea products are tainted by toxic pesticides. In the past few days, Moroccan media reported that some tea brands are polluted by toxic pesticides. In a statement, ONSSA reassured the public that did not issue a warning statement regarding the presence of toxins in tea products  distributed on the Moroccan market. ONSSA’s statement, quoted by Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, verified that all foodstuffs sold in Moroccan markets are monitored before distribution. The source added that imported teas distributed in Morocco also comply with national and international standards. “When the control detects nonconformities, the products are not allowed to access the national market and are repressed,” the statement added. On Monday, Moroccan newspaper Assabah reported that three toxic pesticides are openly smuggled into Morocco in large quantities.The use of smuggled pesticides has been increasing sharply, according to Assabah. “They represent 10 to 15 percent of all pesticides used in agriculture,” the newspaper added, quoting an unidentified source. Several dysfunctions in the agriculture sector have facilitated the importation and distribution of pesticides. The use of non-monitored pesticides poses a threat to human health. Pesticides can cause both long-term and short-term health exposure. One report by the Anti-Poison and Pharmacovigilance Center (CAPM) revealed that 48.6 percent of reported poisoning death in Morocco in 2016 were caused by pesticides. The report says that the CAPM recorded 16,843 cases of poisoning in 2016, representing an increase of 10.3 percent compared to 2015.

By François Koundouno Rabat – Amidst racial profiling and mounting security concerns, being a Sunni Muslim has recently been singled out as the most effective indicator of individuals’ disposition towards violence and terrorism. A late January security report by Department of Homeland Security urged American authorities to have strict immigration policies and a continuous surveillance of individuals suspected to be terrorism or violence-prone. The report, which is a mere four-page document, is filled with suggestions that international terrorism, or individuals who are likely to condone it, are generally not American; the threat is said to come from outside, and it is generally “Sunni Muslim”. The report singled out Sunni Muslims on the grounds that they have “at-risk” demographic profiles. After analyzing 25 terrorist attacks in the US between October 2001 and December 2017, it recommends “continuous surveillance” and a state-sponsored-profiling of “persons of interest”, adding particularly that immigrants in the United States should be tracked and “vetted on a long-term basis”. The report was drafted at the request of Kevin McAleenan, U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner, who said that the purpose of the report was “to inform United States foreign visitor screening, immigrant vetting and on-going evaluations of United States-based individuals who might have higher risk for becoming radicalized and conducting a violent attack.” And among the “risk indicators”, some items, unsurprisingly, made the top of the list: being male and young, having national origins in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. However, the greatest risk-indicator is, according to the report, being a “Sunni Muslim.” CBP, which works conjointly with DHS (Department of Homeland Security) on such matters, said that Sunni Muslims are particularly “vulnerable to terrorist narratives”, explaining that the report’s findings [possibly reflects] the long standing difficulty for some Muslim immigrants to integrate into United States society.” An earlier DHS report on January 16 claimed that 3 out 4 individuals convicted for terrorism or terrorism-related deeds were immigrants, or sympathizers of “radical Sunni Islam militancy.” It also claimed that 73% of convicted terrorists between 9/11 and December 31, 2016 were foreign-born and generally Sunni Muslims. A number of news outlets and commentators have criticized the reports for “cherry-picking” cases and narratives that can help implement Trump’s administration’s hostility towards immigrants, especially from predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa. But despite the criticism, senior officials in the concerned departments speak of “a sobering reality” and the need for the U.S to protect its citizens from “foreign-grown terrorism”. “The information in this report is just the tip of the iceberg… The pillars of President Trump’s immigration policy are to secure our porous borders”, said DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielson.

Rabat – Germany’s industrial manufacturing giant, Siemens, responded harshly to Polisario Front pressure to refrain from investing in Western Sahara at its annual Olympic stadium meeting in Munich on January 31. When Polisario member Khadija Bedati asked Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser to reconsider the company’s investments in Western Sahara region,  Kaeser responded, stating that Siemens “has no intention whatsoever to break the law” in the region. Kaeser, quoted by Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum added that “it is no question at all that we recognize European judgment on international law and it does not affect the effectiveness or legality of civilians or individuals and companies in Western Sahara,” The CEO added that all investments in the Sahara are in line with international regulations. “Therefore, the group’s investment in the Sahara will be maintained and continued.” The group’s pronouncements, according to Akhbar Al Yaoum, were addressed to denounce campaigns and other maneuvers carried out by the Polisario Front and its supports at the level of the various institutions of the European Union. Since January, separatist media has been denouncing projects carried out by international companies in Western Sahara. Polisario has urged the European Union to compensate the separatist group issue sanctions for the exploitation of natural resources without its permission. In an interview with Spanish news outlet Europa Press, Mohamed Sidati, Polisario’s delegate minister for Europe said that the Front has demanded EUR 240 million in compensation for the alleged damages caused by resource exportation to the EU. Siemens’ reaction was also a response to the alleged statement issued by the German state secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs, who allegedly stated, “The federal government does not support the economic activities of German companies in Western Sahara and does not secure business through export credit and investment guarantees.”

Cherni said that the “time has come for an Arab country to host the World Cup.” The Tunisian official added that Morocco has plenty of advantages to host the World Cup, including infrastructure. She added that the Maghreb region as a whole has proved its capability to host international events. The Maghreb will be proud if Morocco clinches the right to host the World Cup, the minister said. Other supporters of Morocco’s bid include the African Football Confederation executive committee, as well as its President Ahmad Ahmad, who made his support very clear. On January 25, the Nigerian Minister of Sports and Youth Solomon Dalung also expressed his full support for Morocco’s bid. “It is a support for Morocco, but also for Africa, which has only organized the World Cup once in nearly 100 years,” the minister said to Maghreb Arab Press. Dalung highlighted African support as “beneficial” for the two African countries striving to demonstrate a positive image to the world and consolidate their leadership in football. He pointed out that Morocco is “renowned for its stability, hospitality and prosperity.” Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017. The North African country will compete against the tripartite American joint bid.

Rabat – Moroccan journalists can be pardoned for exaggerating the technical prowess of the local Atlas Lions that thrashed Nigeria on Sunday. Moroccan fans- who else but them-can also be excused for their fanatical attachment to a team that has given the country a major trophy after decades of drought, of humiliating performances on the continental sphere. Love can be tyrannical; demanding tenacity and commitment, it can transform admiration into an abyss of overemphasized homage. This time, however, the fuss is understandable, and the exaggeration has a firm ground of legitimacy: After all, why not celebrate, -with all the irrationality and exaggerated chants that come with that–something that you’d been coveting since, that’d been eluding for years? The truth is, the Moroccan media were not alone to rhapsodize about the splendor of an almost spotless tournament. The international press, too, having paid attention to some of the major facets of CHAN 2018, was there to help its Moroccan peers pay tribute to what is perhaps the best CHAN—so far, anyway. “Morocco closed CHAN as it had opened it: with a beautiful festival of offensive football,” said RFI. Yes, RFI deftly captured the momentum of the moment. The analogy between the opening and closing games of the tournament was unmistakable: 4-0 Against Mauritania in the opening match on January 13; add that to the unforgettable smash the Lions gave Nigeria’s (Super?) Eagles on Sunday—that makes 8 goals in two matches. Impressive! But no, ‘impressive doesn’t sound quite right to The Independent. They saw something else in the game against Nigeria, in the tournament as a whole, in Morocco’s as the host country. Morocco beat Nigeria in CHAN—the major international tournament you’ve probably never heard of, read the title of The Independent’s article on the final. Where some of us saw a simple game—it’s sports, you know—The Independent saw a battle, a scramble for something grander, “a pathway to the top”. Morocco, which “demolished” Nigeria, says The Independent, played “a brave, precise, and technical football.” The report is even more ecstatic report what CHAN means in this era of elitist and post-modern football: “At a time when international football is increasingly removed from fans and players at home, and when elite football feels like a different sport, rather than a pinnacle, CHAN pulls in the other direction […]” But hey, there is always an aloof boy in the party, the stylish and exuberantly dreamy party-boy. He sees what others don’t. His dance moves, beguiling as they may be, are inimitable. That, in this festival of paeans to the local Atlas Lions, was the French outlet So Foot. Morocco’s victory in the CHAN, as So Foot sees it, is the ultimate display of the enormous, and yet unacknowledged talents who have not been fortunate enough to make it to European leagues. And so, now that Morocco has proven that locals are just as talented, the next stage is to “go win that World Cup in Russia this summer.” Wow! To So Foot’s footballistic dreaminess, Le Point, in a typical French move, adds some literary texture to the tournament: CHAN 2018 was, they said, a fairy tale perfected on its last night when the sleeping beauty (Moroccan supporters) rose to an uproar beyond believability to “crazily celebrate” and romantically surrender to the ninth kiss that her handsome prince (EL Ayoub Kaabi) had just delivered. In comes Jeune Afrique, arguably Francophone Africa’s most circulated and respected weekly. “Morocco has proven that it knows how to be welcoming; that it can host”, wrote the weekly in a particularly lengthy reportage on the tournament. As a “Panafrican” weekly, Jeune Afrique’s assessment of Morocco’s successful CHAN is clear: after turning a rather minor continental tournament into a massive success, who can now doubt the kingdom’s organizational potentials? Who can seriously say that they can’t host something grander eight years from now? Of course, all of these celebrations, in their own ways, tend to be unnecessarily magnifying. But for Moroccan fans, there is something else to Sunday’s victory: As Moroccans watched their local squad hammer Nigeria—one of the continent’s foremost football nations—there was, beneath the exuberant mood that only victory reveals, a sense of gratitude: that decades of patience had finally borne fruit; that a lost glory was being recovered; that Moroccan football, 14 years after the Hadji (Youssouf and Moustapha) and Chammakh-led generation failed against Santos’ Tunisia, winning a major trophy, even if it is not CAN, is a morale boost for a nation so proud of, and so invested in its national sport. After Abidjan late last year and Casablanca on Sunday, not to mention that Wydad, a Moroccan club, is the defending champion of Africa’s Champions Leagues, it seems fair to say that Moroccan football is experiencing rebirth, a renaissance. So yes, The International Press are right: CHAN 2018 went beyond what CHAN traditionally meant. And so, the fuss, the euphoria, the irrationalities, the eccentricities, the tension, the ecstasy—it is all well deserved. As Hervé Renard prepares his boys for June 2018, Moroccans will have to wait, hold their breath, and see if the Atlas Lions can keep the renaissance alive.

By Hajar El Khaldi Rabat – According to BMI Research, Morocco is expected to remain a net debtor to the global financial system through 2027; yet, it perceives a limited risk of balance of payments crisis due to limited exposure to portfolio investment. In its latest analysis report, BMI, a research firm that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis, predicts that Morocco will probably remain a net debtor over the coming decade; which is explained by persistent account deficit. However, BMI maintains that a balance of payments crisis is unlikely to happen. This projection is reinforced by the structure of liabilities, which consists of foreign direct investment and loans from multilateral institutions, given the fact that they are less susceptible to sudden withdrawal comparing portfolio investment. BMI research holds an optimistic outlook on FDI inflows and expects that they will remain robust thanks to Morocco’s promising investment profile. BMI’s Autos team states that ‘Morocco is the most attractive automotive production location in the Middle East and North Africa Region.’ The report also maintains that Morocco has had a $3.5 billion credit from IMF over the last five years, and that it would have no trouble finding alternative concessional lending if necessary. When it comes to external debt, BMI Research believes that it will fall steadily as a proportion of GDP over the coming years thanks to narrowing fiscal deficits. The report states that external debt will fall to 34.7% of GDP by 2027 in comparison to 44.7% in 2016. “We see scope for the authorities to tap international markets and believe that concessional funding will play less of a role over the coming years as the economy develops,” the report said. The report is optimistic about vehicle exports and expects it to witness a rapid growth that will see vehicle sales become the country’s top export. BMI’s Autos team predicts that vehicle production will come close to one million by 2022 with an annual growth of almost 20 percent. Competitiveness will rise among Moroccan producers due to the gradual liberalization of the currency that started in early 2018, which will boost export growth and lead to some import substitution. Currency flexibility will also aid Morocco’s attempt at increasing trade with Sub-Saharan Africa and its continental peers. Conversely, the report concludes that the strong domestic demand will translate into a steady increase in imports, especially given the rising prices of the country’s largest import: oil.

These results mirror the efforts carried by the OCP Policy Center since its creation in 2014, and stand as a witness to the quality of the network and researchers involved in different programs with over 200 publications per year. The Think Tanks and Civil Society Program (TTCSP) conducts research on the role policy institutes play in governments and civil societies around the world. Over the last 26 years, TTCSP helped bridge the gap between knowledge and policy in critical policy areas such as security, international peace, and globalization. These classifications are founded on the contribution of 3.750 experts, journalists, academics, that evaluate around 8.000 think tanks around the world.

Rabat – Several African Union officials have hailed the strategic importance of Morocco’s election to the organization’s Peace and Security Council as an additional asset that will serve the African continent as well as the position of Morocco on the Western Sahara conflict. The UK-based analyst firm, BMI Research, said in its latest report that Morocco’s election is likely to “alarm” the Polisario Front and its position in the conflict. The report, Political Risk Analysis – Limited Progress On Western Sahara Resolution, explained how Morocco’s return to the AU and its election might help reinforce Morocco’s position in the pan-African bloc. BMI Research believes that Morocco’s presence in the AU’s Peace and Security Council and “a general shift in approach by both AU and the United Nations … is likely to alarm the Polisario Front, leading to a hardening in the latter’s position,” especially on the conflict over Western Sahara. Morocco’s election to the Council did not please the Polisario Front or its main supporter Algeria. According to BMI Research, the separatist militia conducted a series of maneuvers “in demilitarized zone established by the 1991 peace accords that brought the conflict between the two sides to an end,” referring to Guerguerat buffer zone where the Front has been carrying out illegal actions for the past few months. According to the analyst firm, Morocco is making a notable development thanks to its bilateral ties with other African countries, a situation that is likely to “harden the position of the Polisario Front, the political entity seeking an independent Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in the disputed Western Sahara region.” Morocco’s election back into the AU “signals growing support for the kingdom among its African peers,” noted the report, recalling AU members who backed Morocco’s ascension to the 16-member council. The AU Peace and Security Council function in similar manners to the UN Security Council. The council is in charge of the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. “The two-year membership will give the country significant leverage over the organization and may help Rabat influencing more AU members to back a motion, signed by 28 AU members on July 18 2016, calling for the SADR’s suspension from the AU,” the report said. In July 2016, 28 AU member countries sent a motion to Chadian president and former AU Chairperson Idriss Deby Itno, calling for the immediate suspension of the SADR from the AU. The motion was announced immediately after King Mohammed VI officially announced Morocco’s intention to return to the AU during the 28th AU Summit in Rwanda in 2016. BMI Research says that this motion needs only eight more signatories to be approved. Morocco’s strategy to improve relations with its African peers would help fulfill this goal. The report also discussed AU’s new vision on the conflict, emphasizing that the new chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat, “used his first annual AU summit in January 2018 to state that the two sides must resume direct negotiations without prior conditions.”   According to BMI Research, Mahamat’s vision “marked a departure from his predecessor, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who openly supported SADR independence.” This change, according to the report, followed a similar action as the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, appointed a new Envoy for the Western Sahara Conflict, Horst Kohler, who is trying to renew negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front. BMI Research said that Morocco is likely to gain more support from other African nations, including South Africa. BMI Research noted that South Africa and Nigeria are two of the 20 countries that formally recognize the SADR as a sovereign state. “Although not a certainty, [South African Deputy President Cyril] Ramaphosa’s ascension to the ANC presidency – he is now almost certain to become a national leader – leaves the door open for improved relations between Rabat and Pretoria and this may further bolster Morocco’s influence in the AU,” the report said.

Rabat – A Franco-Moroccan woman has designed and put in function a new application to solve the pervasive problem of sexual harassment in Morocco. Finemchi (“Where am I going?”) hopes to help solve the country’s sexual harassment issue by proposing to its users public spaces and spheres that are safe and women-friendly. Safâa El Jazouli, an entrepreneur and founder of the Finemchi Project, talked to Morocco World News today about the growing concern of female insecurity and sexual harassment in Morocco, particularly stressing the social roles that women are expected to conform to, and the limits that Moroccan society puts on them. Women, according to El Jazouli, are looked down upon, expected to blend into the societal stereotypes, objectified, and pass unnoticed. “They do not get to be expressive and free in their lifestyles and choices”, she adds, with the excited and yet controlled voice of a person sharing her deepest convictions. Of her motivations to launch the project, she says that it is something she’s been thinking about, and working on for nearly seven months now. “I’ve spent a considerable part of my life in France. And I like to come here and visit, you know. But once here, I generally had to go to the same places over and over again, and it started getting dull. “Women are generally limited in their choices, especially when they want to go out and just make the most out of their free time. In Morocco, cafés and other public spaces have always been male-only places, many are hostile to women. It even gets aggressive and physical at times”, she said. El Jazouli explains to me that it is that feeling of boredom, as she grew tired of always going to the same places while in Morocco, that convinced her that something needed to be done to expand women’s outgoing choices while at once ensuring their comfort and security. She, as a result, decided to launch an initiative where women could share their opinions on places and establishments they like or hate, and help other women in their decision to visit or avoid such places. El Jazouli further explained that women who dare to break the established boundaries are generally frowned upon, given bad names, and, in some instances, mistreated. “It really strikes me that a woman who dares to break some of the established standards is generally given bad names, badly perceived. Society seems to have those accusatory looks meant to remind you of your supposed rightful place. Why deny women such basic rights? Can’t she peacefully have her cup of tea and enjoy it? “You mean that the condescending public gaze that women are subjected to scares you, right?” I asked, in the misplaced but sincere humor of somebody wanting to learn more. “No, not just the gaze. It is the entrenched notion of gender inequality, the embedded belief that gives men so much more and denies women so many basic things, that’s what scares me. And it needs to change.” El Jazouli also said that the absence or underrepresentation of female reviewers on Google was her greatest inspiration to launch her project. She said that the project is aimed at providing women with a platform where they “can help each other”, or “judge if an establishment is safe or respectful “towards women, and places where women would not be “embarrassed or harassed.” She however underlined that her project’s aim is not to separate women and men, but to help women in finding safety and comfort in “shared places”. Asked about how her project has been received by the public, El Jazouli explains her pleasant surprise. “The app has received a lot of reviews and comments. All the comments I’ve got from women so far—and trust me, I’m not exaggerating—have been positive and congratulatory. They shared their experiences, thanking, congratulating, and supporting me. That has been really supportive in telling me that this was something needed. Plus, the app has now over 1000 users, which is huge as I launched it just a week ago. But it is no bed of roses challenging established ideas. El Jazouli says that she has received quite a sizable number of negative and derogatory comments, all of which, she hastened to add, have so far come from men. But she doesn’t seem to be bothered by that. “They are not my target”, she says. “Not even a single negative reaction from conservative women?” I asked, surprised, like her, at the overwhelming support she’s so far been receiving. “Well, I am not telling anyone to go to discos or something. I’m helping them to find places to go to and have a good drink or a nice chat with friends. Who doesn’t like that?” She pauses, laughs defiantly, and, her voice now suggesting the childlike optimism and the uneasy civility of somebody savoring the fleeting attention and fame that come with what she has achieved, she adds: “Some managers and directors of some public spaces have even contacted me to know what to do to have a good rating in the app. I told them that they are responsible for what generally happens at their places, and that they should make sure their female clients are treated with respect and dignity. Some of them have promised to collaborate. And I truly welcome that. It was after all part of the project: raising awareness about society’s duplicity in dealing with differences.” Finemchi is now available on Google play, having already listed and reviewed about a hundred places. After installing the app, users can add a café or a restaurant, and report on the added place based on their experiences. And when something negative happens to a user, the app is said to provide them with the numbers and location of nearby police stations. El Jazouli says that she is working on a iPhone version, and that it will come out very soon. “I want to say that sexual harassment, or gender inequality is by no means the preserve of Morocco. It exists in France and elsewhere around the world. But it is quite high here. Look, I believe in participatory politics; I believe that citizens, when they decide to get involved, can make a difference. This is what I felt I needed to do. It is not the end. I’m working on other fronts. And I believe that many others can do what I did, or even more. You just need to get involved.”

By Neil Buckland Rabat – Over the course of the last decade or more, the Middle East has become a popular investment destination. What’s interesting is the motivation for modern investors, however, as leading Middle Eastern economies such as the UAE continue to diversify and evolve. Historically, the Middle East has shone as an investment beacon due to its extensive energy resources and vast population. This is continuing to change over time, however, as economies strive to minimise their reliance on oil and instead cross bold, new frontiers relating to cryptocurrency, clean energy sources and others. This post will offer a brief insight into contemporary Middle Eastern investment, highlighting the benefits and the potential risks. While the Middle Eastern economies and financial markets may have diversified in recent times, the best way to gain traction in the region is by purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If you look at prominent examples such as the WisdomTree Middle East Dividend Fund, you’ll see that it offers broad access to the largest countries in the region including the UAE (24%), Qatar (24%) and Kuwait. Similarly, these funds also reflect the new-found diversity of the Middle Eastern economies, covering thriving, growth sectors like financials, telecommunications and industry. ETFs offer risk-averse or novice investors the best method of embracing the Middle Eastern markets, as they enable traders to assume ownership of any underlying assets or financial instruments. This can deliver genuine peace of mind, which is important for some given the emerging nature of markets such as the UAE.  For those with a little more experience or a greater appetite for risk, there is also an opportunity to gain exposure to Middle Eastern markets through futures trading, which is a slightly more speculative and complex vehicle that has the potential to deliver larger gains. If you’re serious about increasing your exposure to Middle Eastern markets, you may also want to consider investing directly into specific countries. Naturally, this creates a slightly higher risk from far less diversification, depending on the individual country that you choose.  As an investor, you can mitigate this by actively targeting Middle Eastern countries that have achieved the highest rate of economic diversification, with the aforementioned UAE offering a relevant case in point. As recently as 2015, an estimated 70% of this nation’s GSP came from non-oil and energy sectors, while sectors such as media, tourism, telecommunications and commercial aviation has enjoyed significant growth.  This led to a GDP increase of 3.5% in 12 months between 2014 and the end of 2015, and from an investor perspective it mitigates risk by decreasing the reliance on the volatile oil and energy marketplaces.  Clearly, there are numerous risks that are historically synonymous with Middle Eastern investment. Many of these are associated with a lack of diversity within the economy, however, and this can be mitigated by targeting more progressive countries that have embraced new revenue streams during the last 10 years or more.  Other than this and the risk of volatility caused by geopolitical uncertainty, the Middle Eastern markets are increasingly vulnerable to the same challenges that threaten established economies in the west. As the UAE and Qatar continue to become central hubs for cryptocurrency innovation and high value ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), for example, fiscal regulators are warning of the associated dangers of this burgeoning market (such as high price volatility and a relative lack of regulation). Of course, some will argue that diversification will dilute the Middle East’s unique selling point to investors, which is its resource-rich terrain and vast size. This is short-sighted view, however, as a more diversified economy minimises risk and helps investors to create a balanced portfolio of assets from across the globe. Just remember that investing in the Middle East should represent just one part of your overall portfolio, as you look to include growth markets and industries that can sustain reliable returns over time.

Rabat- The National Council of the United Socialist Party (PSU) elected Nabila Mounib, a leading political figure within the socialist movement, to a second term as Secretary General of the party on Saturday, February 3.   This election comes nearly two weeks after the fourth National Congress of the PSU, during which Mounib presented her platform called “New Horizon.” Mounib attracted 614 votes out of 900, in addition to 141 abstentions. The PSU has also selected its new Political Bureau, which includes, among other members, MP Omar Balafrej, while Mohamed Sassi, Mohamed Moujahid and Najib Akesbi have all been ousted from the bureau.  Mounib, better know among her followers as “Tata Nabila,” has been at the head of the PSU since 2012. She is also a professor of endocrinology at the University of Hassan II in Casablanca and she became the first Moroccan woman to lead a political party.  Born in Casablanca, Mounib’s credentials, charisma, and style of leadership positioned her as a front-runner and a leading voice for change during the parliamentary election campaign in 2016.  She was able to shift the current political discourse and gain wide popularity among both the educated and college students in major cities, many of whom supported her over the PJD and PAM.

Rabat – Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving suspect of the November 2015 killings in Paris that left 130 people dead, has refused to answer questions at his trial opening on February 5 in Belgium.  When asked by the judge to provide his personal details, the 28-year-old, who refused to stand, said that he “does not wish to answer questions” and that he would remain silent throughout the four-day process.  “My silence does not make me a criminal or guilty. I am defending myself by remaining silent,” Abdeslam told the court.  “I am not afraid of you, I am not afraid of your allies. I put my trust in Allah and that’s all, I have nothing else to add,” he added.  Abdeslam’s refusal to cooperate with the court may prove a disappointment to survivors and families of the 130 people who died, hoping he might end more than two years of silence to provide some indication of how and why the attacks were organized. Abdeslam is a French passport-holder of Moroccan origins, whose brother is also believed to have been involved as one of the seven other attackers who detonated a suicide bomb inside a packed restaurant. The Paris attacks targeted the Stade de France during a France-Germany football match, as well as bars and restaurants around the 10th and 11th arrondissements of north Paris, and the Bataclan theatre during a rock concert, where 89 people were killed. The Islamic State immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, described by the former French president François Hollande as “an act of war.” According to investigative elements, the operation was planned in Syria and organised by a group in Brussels. After a four-month international manhunt, Abdeslam was shot in the leg before being arrested in a police raid in the Molenbeek area of Brussels on March 18, 2016.  He was handed over to French authorities and placed in a high-security prison close to France’s northern border to allow for his daily transfer to the Palace of Justice in Brussels throughout his four-day trial.

Rabat – The National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) has announced that three hazardous farming pesticides, all of which have proven to be harmful to the health of humans and the environment, are being sold openly in several regions in Morocco. The chemical products, which are widely banned internationally, are still commonly used in Morocco, reported Moroccan newspaper Assabah. ONSSA, according to the daily, identified two Asian and a European pesticide as being heavily used in farming in Morocco. One European chemical, which is used in tomatoes farms in Morocco, was banned in France due to the danger it posed to the health of farmers and consumers. Thailand has banned the use of one of the three pesticides named by ONSSA. It has been classified as a carcinogen. Doctor OumKaltoum Harati told Morocco World News that, “pesticides have played an important role improving the quality of agricultural products. However, many studies have raised concerns over health risks that can be caused by pesticides.” Dr. Harati added that both long-term and short-term health exposure can affect humans’ peripheral nervous system, white blood cells, liver function, and electrolyte levels. Pesticides can also cause kidney disorders as adverse dermatological, gastrointestinal, neurological, respiratory, reproductive, and endocrine effects, according to Harati. Harati said that the need to protect consumers and agricultural workers against pesticides is paramount. “There are many pesticides banned in many countries, given the fact of their potential risk of acute toxicity after exposure as well as a chronic toxicity.” The doctor added that occupational, accidental and intentional pesticide exposures might result in a greater risk of death for farmers and farm workers. Assabah added that the three pesticides are being smuggled into Morocco in large quantities. The use of smuggled pesticides has been increasing sharply, according to Assabah. “They represent 10 to 15 percent of all pesticides used in agriculture,” added the newspaper, who quoted an unidentified source. Several dysfunctions in the agriculture sector have facilitated the importation and distribution of pesticides. According to Assabah, only 10 of the 300 distributors of the pesticides are approved by ONSSA while the majority of the 1,760 resellers do not meet the regulatory standards stipulated by the 42-95 law related to the control of pesticides and the regulation of the products’ distribution. A report by the Anti-Poison and Pharmacovigilance Center (CAPM) revealed that 48.6 percent of reported poisoning death in Morocco in 2016 were caused by pesticides. The report says that the CAPM recorded 16,843 cases of poisoning in 2016, representing an increase of 10.3 percent compared to 2015. Laayoune-Sakia-El Hamra’s region recorded the highest incidence of deaths by pesticides (119.26 per 100,000 inhabitants), followed by Tangier Tetouan-Al Hoceima (107.4 per 100,000) and Rabat-Salé-Kénitra region (83.6 per 100,000), according to the study’s data.
The high rate of pesticide exposure and poisoning in Morocco is due to direct access to the substance, explained CAPM director Rachida Soulaymani Bencheikh in an interview with Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat – In an interview with the France-based magazine, Jeune Afrique, Minister of Trade and the Chairman of Morocco’s 2026 World Cup Bid Committee Moulay Hafid Elalamy stated that the bid is an opportunity for Morocco to feature its strengths and specificities. Elalamy said that the committee has set up a strategy to underscore and better exploit the country’s potential. He added that Morocco’s institutions, both private and the public, will join efforts to win the bid for the 2026 World Cup. “Morocco has already embarked on a vast and ambitious investment program in the areas of infrastructure and hotel industry that meets the needs of the local population in the first place,” said Elalamy. The minister’s expectations for Morocco’s bid are very high. According to Elalamy, Morocco has a dozen modern international airports that meet international standards, as well as a road infrastructure comparable to that in Europe. The first high-speed train will be operational in two to three months, he said. During the interview, which was reported by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Elalamy has also discussed Morocco’s readiness to build new stadiums across the country to house matches of the tournament. “We are also proposing modular stadiums that will continue to operate after the World Cup,” he said, stressing that “no dirham will be spent if it cannot ultimately serve the population.” The Moroccan official added that this vision will not only help Morocco’s bid, but also serve the Moroccan population.  “We have accelerated the pace of public investment for years to upgrade the different Moroccan regions and meet the needs of people, but also to meet the demands of foreign investors.” Referring to Morocco’s health sector, Elalamy told Jeune Afrique that Morocco has a network of university health centers spread throughout the country, adding that a hospital that meets the needs of the local population will be built in every city that hosts the 2026 World Cup. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017. The North African country will compete against the three American nations’ joint bid, including the USA, Canada, and Mexico. The host of the 2026 World Cup will be announced next June in Moscow.

Rabat – As the cold weather is set to continue, snowstorms across the country have closed several roads on Monday, the Ministry of Transport has said. Snowstorms have blocked 38 roads, according to the ministry, which was quoted by Moroccan news outlet Hespress. The Ministry has managed to open 44 roads in various regions of the country after they were blocked due to heavy snowstorms. Among the national roads that are still blocked: Road N. 13, which links between Azrou, Tamhidit and Medelt, and the road N19 that links in Tindara. Regarding the regional roads, the ministry told Hespress that the road number 707, which separates Al-Hajeb and Ifrane is closed. The road 503 linking between Khenifra and Zayda is also closed, according to the Ministry. Roads number 316, 302, 306 and 307 are all blocked due to snowstorms that Morocco has witnessed in the past few days. From January 26 to  January 31, Morocco has experienced stormy and heavy snowfalls and rainfalls. The ministry said that the snow thickness ranged from 50 to 200 centimeters in some regions, especially in the high and medium Atlas.

Rabat – After six years at the head of the largest representative body of employers in Morocco, Miriem Bensalah-Chaqroun, chairwoman of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), will step down next May.  According to Akhbar Al Yaoum, a meeting of CGEM’s board of directors will be held next Tuesday in Errachidia, to determine the date of the General Assembly in order to elect a new president. Bensalah-Chaqroun completed the two-term limit between 2012 and 2015, and then 2015 to 2018.  Born on November 14, 1962, in Casablanca, the chairwoman has a degree from Paris’ ESCP Europe and an MBA from the University of Dallas in Texas.  She is the director of Oulmes Mineral Water, a leading company listed on the Stock Exchange of Casablanca, that specializes in water and bottling. Bensalah-Chaqroun is also the CEO of the Holmarcom Group, owned by her family and one of the five largest industrial, commercial, and financial groups of Morocco; a board member of Bank Al-Maghrib, the National Central and Reserve Bank of Morocco; and Chairperson of the Euro-Mediterranean Center of Mediation and Arbitration.  According to the Jeune Afrique, Bensalah-Chaqroun was destined to become the first president of the CGEM, because “the business world has long recognized her leadership qualities.”  “She is a member of the boards of many prestigious companies such as Eutelsat, Suez and the central bank of Morocco, to name a few,” notes the publication, stating that many leaders who meet her praise her talents as a negotiator. Last year, Bensalah-Chaqroun, received the Cross of Grand Officer for the Order of Civil Merit of the Kingdom of Spain in recognition of her actions in promoting economic relations between Morocco and Spain.

Rabat – After the motorsport giant Formula 1 announced that it would abandon its longtime tradition of featuring female promotional models, or “grid girls,” at its races, the models are slamming feminists for being the cause of their recent unemployment. Claiming non-compliance with “brand values,” Formula 1 Managing Director of Commercial Operations said last week, “Over the last year we have looked at a number of areas which we felt needed updating so as to be more in tune with our vision for this great sport.” “While the practice of employing grid girls has been a staple of Formula 1 Grands Prix for decades, we feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values and clearly is at odds with modern-day societal norms.” “We don’t believe the practice is appropriate or relevant to Formula 1 and its fans, old and new, across the world,” Bratches added. The grid girls, cheerleaders, and podium girls have long been central to America’s sports traditions. In Formula One races, grid girls are essentially models paraded around races, accompanying drivers to their cars, and sometimes holding umbrellas, while wearing clothing that bears the name of a sponsor, However, these tasks have come under criticism as being “outdated” and rooted in a tradition that turns women into sexualised objects intended for “the male gaze.” The ban sparked a backlash from now-former grid girls who slammed the decision, which is, according to them, an “overreach of political correctness.” Many expressed their passion for the Motorsport, lambasting feminists who dictate what they should or should not do. Others have expressed concerns of single-income financial difficulties as a result of the ban. “Ridiculous that women who say they are ‘fighting for women’s rights’ are saying what others should and shouldn’t do, stopping us from doing a job we love and are proud to do. PC gone mad,” now-former grid girl Rebecca Cooper wrote on Twitter. So the inevitable has happened, F1 gridgirls have been banned. Ridiculous that women who say they are “fighting for women’s rights” are saying what others should and shouldn’t do, stopping us from doing a job we love and are proud to do. PC gone mad ? #Gridgirls — Rebecca Cooper (@rebeccageldard) January 31, 2018  Get me on @thismorning so I can defend us #gridgirls
Because of these feminists, they’ve have cost us our jobs! I have been a grid girl for 8 years and I have Never felt uncomfortable! I love my job, if I didn’t I wouldn’t do it! Noone forces us to do this! This is our choice! pic.twitter.com/PUWcyB5BeG — Lauren-Jade (@laurenjadepope) January 31, 2018    #gridgirls women doing what they love for a job!other roles would require consultation before redundancy,why not us? pic.twitter.com/mGNRhrlbjs — Samantha Young (@Sammie_jay25) February 2, 2018  Formula One’s ban came only a few days after the Professional Darts Corporation announced the end of the long-established practice of women escorting male players to the stage, claiming that the tradition is “at odds with modern-day societal norms.”

Rabat – The Moroccan national team will not be a tourist in Moscow. The team has talents in its squad and will try to take all its chances to make Russia 2018 a successful campaign. This is, in substance, the spirit of a recent interview that the Atlas Lions’ coach Hervé Renard had with the French outlet labeautedufootball.fr. “No, there is no stress, we are proud to be part of the qualified squads, and can’t wait to start the tournament, although we know it won’t be an easy one”, Renard said when asked about the squad’s morale as the momentous event draws near. Moroccan squad is ambitious and has great expectations, Renard commented upon being asked if, considering the intensity and high caliber in Morocco’s group, elimination in the group phase would be a disappointment. “I am a competitor, and being eliminated in the first round is surely a disappointment. But other than words, we have to show an intersecting face on the D-Day. An interesting face for the Moroccan squad”, Renard said. Renard explained in the interview that despite the quality in the Spanish and Portuguese squads, Iran too is a serious contender to him as “they will fight tooth and nail”. He however stressed that the two games against Spain—a team he said has a fascinating football philosophy—and Portugal—winner of the most recent European Championship—are the matches in which his squad will give its utmost. “These will be matches where you have to give 100%”, he said. Renard said that, in his career as a coach, his teams have always been built around team spirit and tactical discipline, especially, he stressed, “when the opposing squad dominates the game”. “I like the game and I’d love to have ball possession, but sometimes the opponents leave you no choice. When, for example, you are Sochaux playing PSG, you know that Paris won’t be leaving you the ball. Sometimes you have to adapt to the tactical management of the contending squad and exploit their mistakes”, Renard explained, with the suggestion that the Atlas Lions are counting on tactical discipline and lethal counterattacks against the offensive prowess of Group B’s European giants. Commenting on Morocco’s historic CHAN 2018 triumph, Renard lauded the local talents, adding that some of them will be called upon for the Atlas Lions’ next friendly fixture in March. Hervé Renard rose to prominence as a connoisseur of African football and a great manager when his energetic and enthusiasm-filled managing philosophy allowed Zambia and Ivory Coast to win the CAN (African Cup of Nations), in 2012 and 2015 respectively. As Morocco prepares to take on two world-class squads in Group B in Russia this summer, all eyes are expectantly set on Renard and his boys. “Please, surprise us and make us forget the pain, the unexpected blow of France 98. Can you please sustain, however fleetingly, the Abidjan euphoria?” these hesitant looks seem to suggest.

Rabat – Around twenty migrants have been found dead in Melilla, an autonomous coastal city in Spain, according to Spanish outlet El Pais.  The city’s administrative authorities made the announcement yesterday, saying that the bodies were found at sea last Saturday. 16 floating bodies were reportedly sighted by La Sorolla, a Spanish passenger ship. “The crew of the ship had sailed for more than four miles, after setting sail from Melilla, when they spotted a score of bodies floating in the Mediterranean, off Cape Tres Forcas (Cape Three Forks)”, El Pais reported. The retrieved bodies were then taken to the Nador Morgue, where the medical staff, after administering the first tests, revealed that 15 of the victims were from sub-Saharan countries, while one was from Morocco. They were also three females among the victims. “Among the victims of the tragedy were people from Mali, Guinea Conakry and Cote d’Ivoire”, said Helena Maleno, a human rights and immigration activist in the Melilla region. Maleno is also said that there were 21 deceased as opposed to 16, the number reported by local authorities. She added that the deceased migrants were travelling in a boat that had 47 passengers on board. Although the rescuing teams have not yet found additional bodies, or migrants who may have survived the shipwreck, the region’s authorities commented in  an official declaration that a team of “Specialists in Underwater Activities” had been dispatched to “the shipwreck area in support of Moroccan patrol boats.” The city of Melilla is said to have experienced a “migratory boom” in the recent years. According to the Spanish Ministry of Interior, 681 migrants arrived in the city in 29 boats in 2017, compared to only 70 migrants and 3 boats in 2016.

Rabat – Three weeks after Morocco introduced a flexible exchange rate system, the dirham appreciated by 0.51 percent against the dollar and fell by 0.43 percent against the euro, according to the latest weekly indicators, published Saturday by Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM). The Moroccan Central Bank affirms participating in five foreign currency sales operations, totaling USD 57 million at an average price of MAD 9.1505. The Central Bank’s indicators for this week also show that net international reserves are set at MAD 240.1 billion, which is almost the same amount as the previous week, but with a 3.2 percent decline on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the central bank injected MAD 43 billion into the money market in the form of seven-day advances, during the call for tenders on January 31. On January 15, Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance officially widened the band in which the Moroccan dirham trades against a basket of currencies, 60 percent for the euro and 40 percent for the dollar, from ±0.3 percent to ±2.5 percent. Over a 10 to 15 years time frame, the ministry explained that it will move towards a free-floating currency. According to BMI Research, a Fitch Group firm that provides macroeconomic, industry and financial market analysis, Morocco’s new reform is “unlikely to prompt a sharp currency sell-off, limiting near-term risks to growth and inflation.” The group also pointed out that this move is “likely to help the country in its efforts to attract greater investment to the kingdom and diversify trade, while the risks of disorderly depreciation are well contained given the country’s robust financial buffers.”

Rabat – Jamila El Moussali, State Secretary for Handicraft and Social Economy met with India’s Minister of State for Tourism K.J. Alphons in New Delhi, on Thursday, February 1.   In the spirit of both governments’ desire to work together more, the two officials discussed new ways to cooperate in the field of handicrafts, reported the state news agency MAP. During the meeting, in which Morocco’s Ambassador to India Mohamed Malki was also present, El Moussali gave a brief overview of Morocco’s experience in the handicrafts sector, noting that the sector is an important pillar of the country’s social economy.  The Moroccan official said that the meeting reflects the ongoing desire to strengthen South-South cooperation and recalled the visit paid by King Mohammed VI to India in October 2015 to participate in the 3rd “India-Africa” Forum Summit in New Delhi.  This meeting comes as part of Morocco’s first participation in the Surajkund International Crafts Mela, with a delegation made up of 27 artisans.  “Handicraft and tourism can promote the development of closer ties between the two peoples,” the Moroccan diplomat said.  The Indian official praised the strong relations between the two countries, adding that bilateral cooperation could expand to comprise other sectors of activity, including tourism, considering that nearly 23 million Indians go abroad for holidays.  El Moussali also met with Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Mubashir Javed Akbar.  The 32nd Surajkund International Crafts Mela is taking place from February 2 to 18 with the participation of more than 20 countries. Since 2014, Morocco’s handicrafts are increasingly in demand around the world. Traditional clothing topped the list of exported products, accounting for a 23 percent share of the sector’s export turnover.  To date, Arabic speaking countries represent the main export market for Moroccan handicrafts receiving 29 percent of the sector’s exports, followed by the US at 23 percent.

Rabat – British self-made billionaire Richard Branson took to his blog to share key money lessons he learned during his stay in Morocco from a cab driver.   In an article published on January 22, the businessman wrote on his personal blog that he was recently in Morocco having a chat with a taxi driver who said, “You made money, the money didn’t make you.” “Humbled, I thought he also made a really interesting point. I have never chased money for money’s sake and I don’t think it is the most important thing when starting a business,” said the wealthy businessman.   “I have always believed that if you go into business to improve a product or a service and have a positive impact on people’s lives then success and money will follow,” the 67-year-old wrote.  Why money isn’t the most important thing when starting a business https://t.co/ryPKyGyvMI pic.twitter.com/RrXJszabQq — Richard Branson (@richardbranson) January 22, 2018  “It is purpose, passion and drive that will take you over the finish line, not bundles of money.” Branson, whose net worth is estimated at USD 5.1 billion by Forbes, dropped out of school at the age of 16 to fulfill his desire of becoming an entrepreneur.  “I never went to university. I look at life as one long university course that I’ve never had. I love new experiences, and I try to learn at least one thing every day,” said the businessman.  His first business venture was a magazine called Student. He later opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records, known today as Virgin Megastores. Branson’s Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he established Virgin Atlantic airline, and expanded the Virgin Records music label.  The billionaire said that he travels to Morocco as often as he can to visit his luxury resort, Kasbah Tamadot, which is just 55 kilometers away from the city of Marrakech. “I have so many great memories from Morocco – when I was trying to fly around the world in a hot air balloon, I based several attempts out of Marrakech,” wrote the businessman on the Virgin website

Rabat – Have you ever had a friend to confide to your most secretive and intimate feelings with the belief that you are speaking to yourself? Have you ever had a consoling shoulder to cry on when people or life sadden you and fill you with anguish and sorrow? Have you ever had a faithful source of support, unconditional love, sympathy and empathy? Have you ever had someone beyond your kinship who always helps you up when you fall down, someone who puts your pieces together when you are broken up? If yes, you are lucky because you had a true friend indeed. I was immensely overwhelmed today by the big number of posts on social media on the occasion of Friends Day celebrations. People shared lots of posts, and tagged others in videos and pictures which are beautifully captioned and professionally edited and touched by “all of [them] in Facebook” and other social networks. Celebrating friendship is indeed something to cherish, but what friendship? The post-industrial global context which we live in today is marked by the quick dissemination and pervasiveness of the values of individualism, materialism, and consumerism, which dramatically altered the way we handle our daily lives. Traditional practices and ways of life are slowly but steadily eroded. The concepts of time and place have been compressed through the creation of a virtual reality where neither time nor space is important. Consequently, our days seem like fleeting hours and our years collapse and elapse like a film put on the time lapse mode. Though starkly pessimistic this statement might be, values such as friendship, love, and solidarity would soon be belongings of the past and stories of friendship would be awe-inspiring and completely alien to the near-future generations.  “Once upon a time, there were two friends who truly loved and supported each other and who held each other for better and for worse until death did them apart,” parents would wistfully tell their children like they tell fairy tales. The overwhelming triumph of technology over Man and the automation and digitization of every aspect of modern life will certainly lead to sweeping transformations in society as many prominent cultural theorists predict. One of those transformations would be in human relationships. What characterizes human relationships today is superficiality, pretence and frigidity. A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that the over-dependence on technology in general and the Internet in particular has made us too superficial with scattered thinking and shallow emotions. In other words, we are growing incapable of loving affectionately, thinking profoundly and feeling empathetically. The Internet is shaping the way we think and feel and even writing on behalf of us to our friends on the occasion of Friends Day. Those ready-made and standardized videos “from all of [them] in Facebook” or any other social network would never mean anything to me. A simple text message with spelling mistakes but true words and no music or special effects would be way more expressive. After all, what makes us human is the depth of our feelings, the complexity (not the speed) of our thoughts, the warmth of our hugs, and the empathy we have towards each other. TS Eliot’s poem The Hollow Men was written in a different historical and social context. Yet, in terms of its themes, it does perfectly fit our context of alienation, fragmentation and disillusionment.  The first stanzas sum it up very succinctly:     We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats’ feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion; Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death’s other Kingdom
Remember us-if at all-not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men.

Rabat-Majdouline Cherni, Tunisian Minister of Sports and Youth expressed her full support for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid on Friday.    Cherni made her pronouncement on the sidelines of the 40th Ordinary General Assembly of the African Football Confederation, which took place in Casablanca on Friday. Cherni told Moroccan press, including Le360, that the “time has come for an Arab country to host the World Cup.” The Tunisian official added that Morocco has plenty of advantages to host the World Cup, including its infrastructure. Cherni added that the Maghreb region has proved its capability to host international events, including Tunisia. The Maghreb will be proud if Morocco clinches the right to host the World Cup, the minister said. Morocco’s bid has been supported by the African Football Confederation executive committee as well as its President Ahmad Ahmad, who made his support very clear. On January 25, the Nigerian Minister of Sports and Youth, Solomon Dalung, also expressed his full support for Morocco’s bid. “It is a support for Morocco, but also for Africa, which has only organized the World Cup once in nearly 100 years,” the minister said to Maghreb Arab Press. Dalung highlighted the support as “beneficial” for the two African countries that are striving to show a positive image to the world and consolidate their leadership in football. He pointed out that Morocco is “renowned for its stability, hospitality and prosperity.” The Nigerian minister emphasized that Morocco and Nigeria need to develop cooperation in all areas, notably sports and youth. “We believe in the potential of Morocco and Africa in all sectors, we believe that football can be a way to facilitate cooperation and consolidate the development of partnerships,” Dalung said. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017.

Rabat- The World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report forecasts global economic growth to reach 3.1 percent in 2018, as the recovery in investment, manufacturing, and trade continues. “2018 is on track to be the first year since the financial crisis that the global economy will be operating at or near full capacity,” reads the report.  Growth in the MENA region is projected to improve by 3 percent in 2018, compared to 1.8 percent in 2017, as fiscal constraints ease and improved tourism is anticipated to support the projected growth among economies independent of oil exports.  The report warns, however, that continued geopolitical conflicts and oil price weakness could set back economic growth. The report reveals that Morocco demonstrated one of the highest growth performances in the MENA region, after recording a growth of 4.1 percent in 2017 behind Djibouti (7 percent) and Egypt (4.4 percent). “A strong rebound in agricultural production in the first three quarters of 2017 following the severe droughts of the previous year supported the recovery of the economy in Morocco,” according to WB experts.  The report notes that broader reforms across both oil exporters and importers countries in the region further improve potential growth, including improved labor market participation, in addition to measures to ease business registration and to strengthen investor protection.  The outlook suggests that Morocco’s early childhood education programs are expected to help boost educational development. The institution says that the “continued commitment to implementing these reforms will be critical for realizing higher potential growth dividends in the coming years.” “Potential growth in MENA is expected to strengthen somewhat over the coming years, partly reflecting improvements in investment and productivity. However, reforms that boost investment, labor market participation, or educational and health outcomes have the capability to further improve potential growth,” the report concludes.

Amsterdam – A shift has occurred in the MENA region over the past 30 years, seeing chronic diseases take more lives than their infectious counterparts.  This same shift is taking place in developing areas across the world where the rate of death by infectious diseases has begun to decrease, thanks to improved hygiene, sanitation, and mass vaccination.  However, non-communicable diseases (NCD) such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases remain largely incurable. The global death rate from NCDs is 539 per 100,000 people, and in the MENA-region, this figure rises to 654 per 100,000.  WHO statistics report that 46% of total NCD mortality in the  Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Egypt is due to cardiovascular diseases. Lower rates are observed in Djibouti (14%) and Somalia (5%). Mortality due to cardiovascular disease in the region is expected to increase dramatically over the next decade.  The associated risk factors for many of these types of diseases are tobacco consumption, physical inactivity, depression, being overweight, diabetes and hypertension. Regionally, tobacco consumption is measured to be the highest in Syria and lowest in Oman. The prevalence of smoking overall is almost 6 times higher for men than women. The increasing popularity of water pipes is increasing throughout the region, often replacing cigarettes. The highest level of insufficient physical activity is observed in Saudi Arabia and the lowest can be found in Jordan. According to the Saudi Health Information survey, 75% of women and 46% of men engage in little to no physical activity.  The total prevalence of obesity is highest in Qatar (42,3%) followed by United Arab Emirates (37.2%), Bahrain (35.1%),  and Saudi Arabia, (34.7%). Hypertension was observed at its highest rate in Somalia (26.4%), Morocco (25.3%), and Djibouti (24.4%).  In spite of the massive risk NCDs pose, public knowledge and awareness of cardiovascular disease symptoms appears to be very low, which leads to poor control of risk factors.  Therefore, upstream approaches (or “primary prevention”) are necessary from the government to battle this epidemic through education, mosques, television commercials and public health events. At present, a higher priority is given by governments for treatment, helping to mitigate risk factors, reduce mortality, lower the risk of cardiac events, and improve quality of life, but this can often be more costly and less effective than primary prevention measures.  The government can more productively reduce risk factors by working on multiple intervention levels – working to prevent these risk factors before they emerge and working to treat them once they do.  Public programs can be implemented to increase awareness regarding physical activity and healthy diets, and restrictions on processed foods can reduce salt and fat contents.  Furthermore, some policy measures that have found success elsewhere include banning advertisements on alcohol and tobacco products, increasing taxes on tobacco, banning indoor smoking in public areas, and providing health information related to alcohol, and tobacco consumption. The Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of the World Health Organization (EMRO) has set up a strategy plan for 2012 to 2021 with an increased focus on NCDs. EMRO will support national governments in developing guidelines for the management of NCDs, especially among refugee populations.

Rabat- As many as 90 migrants are feared dead after a migrant boat capsized off the Libyan coast near the city of Zuara on Friday, reported the United Nations migration agency. The majority of the migrants were from Pakistan, three survivors have told aid workers. Two of the three survivors were able to swim to the shore, while the third was rescued by a fishing boat. The tragedy occurred when the overloaded boat carrying the migrants capsized, according to Olivia Headon,  a spokesperson of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). In 2016, nearly 171,000 asylum seekers arrived in Italy via boats and rafts, according to statistics from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. In recent years, thousands of migrants, including Moroccans, have traveled to Libya in order to reach Europe via the Mediterranean. Many, though, remain trapped in dire conditions in detention centers across Libya. International outrage followed reports last year that some migrants had been sold in slave markets. In December 2017, several videos taken by detained Moroccans were widely shared on social media, revealing the horrific conditions they faced in Libyan prisons. The trapped migrants cried for help and urged the Moroccan government to take immediate action to bring them back home. Hundreds were eventually repatriated in December following the efforts and intervention by King Mohammad VI.

Rabat – The Atlas Lions have had an impressive streak during the 2018 African Nations Championship. The team will play Nigeria on Sunday evening for the CHAN championship.  In five matches during the tournament, Morocco has not allowed opponents to score more than a single goal in any match as the team went 4-0-1. The past few months have been an exciting time for Moroccan soccer, from qualifying for the 2018 World Cup to Wydad Casablanca winning the 2017 Africa Champions League title. Excitement that builds momentum for the nation as it moves forward on its bid to host the 2026 World Cup. Another big game takes place this Sunday evening, about 11:30 p.m. Rabat time. The National Football League (NFL) championship game will take place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Philadelphia Eagles will play the New England Patriots in the 52nd edition of the Super Bowl. The game has become America’s premier sports championship event, in part, because it is a single-game championship. NHL ice hockey, Major League Baseball, and NBA basketball all use a best-of-seven championship series format. The Super Bowl is one 60-minute game with a lot of hype. The NFL usually selects warm climate cities to host the big game but this year’s match takes place in a northern city known for very cold winters, inside an enclosed $1 billion stadium. FIFA organizes the quadrennial World Cup tournament. Soccer (football) is the world’s most popular team sport and the sport with the most fans around the world. The World Cup Finals match is perennially one of the most watched global TV events. The tournament includes 32 participating teams (48 teams for the 2026 World Cup). With such widespread geographic popularity and with so many teams represented, it’s logical that many World Cup matches attract large TV audiences. American football — all 32 league teams are located inside the continental US — has a growing level of popularity outside the US, particularly in Great Britain, Germany and Canada. But it remains a uniquely American sport. How do the two big games compare? The World Cup final match and the NFL Super Bowl? The FIFA finals match has a slight edge over the Super Bowl in attendance. The attendance for the 2014 finals match between Germany and Argentina at Rio’s Maracanã Stadium was 74,700. The 2017 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons attracted 70,800 fans to NRG Stadium in Houston. US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis will have about 66,000 spectators for the Super Bowl on Sunday evening. Watching the big game on TV is popular everywhere. From Rabat to Sydney. Everywhere. And World Cup soccer is king of the ratings. After the conclusion of the 2014 World Cup, FIFA reported that roughly one billion people had watched at least one minute of the final match. Viewership included home television audiences and people watching in public spaces and online (calculated estimations which are part science, part art). The 2017 Super Bowl, a dramatic game that saw the New England Patriots make the largest comeback in Super Bowl history, had an average audience of 111.3 million viewers for Fox Sports. Another 1.7 million people watched the game online in the US, and 650,000 additional viewers watched Spanish-language network coverage of the game. In recent years, about 40 million people outside the US watch the Super Bowl. Another soccer finals match that draws millions more TV viewers than the NFL Super Bowl is Europe’s UEFA Champions League final match. In 2017, the game between Real Madrid and Juventis was seen by an estimated 165 million people in Europe and by nearly the same amount outside Europe. And the immense popularity of cricket should be noted. The 2015 early-round match between Pakistan and India at the Cricket World Cup in Australia attracted an estimated one billion TV viewers, including almost 290 million in India alone. The Super Bowl is a one-day American cultural spectacle that blends sport, entertainment, patriotism, and consumerism. A company wishing to promote a product during the game will pay about $5 million for a 30-second commercial. Millions watch the game solely to view the commercials. The ads are often funny, with cameo appearances by Hollywood stars, or they are quirky with an everyman or everywoman point of view. The game includes a half-time musical performance by a big music star. After four 15-minute quarters, one team will be victorious (only once has a Super Bowl game needed overtime to decide the winner). Just two short weeks after the Super Bowl, baseball players head to Florida and Arizona to prepare for their long season that begins in April. The Atlas Lions will prepare for the 2018 World Cup in Russia that begins June 14. More dreams of winning it all

Rabat- Morocco’s Ministry of Labor announced that  agricultural workers authorized by Spain to participate in the next agricultural campaign will begin departing in April. In a statement, the ministry said that 33,452 applications were submitted by farmers by the end of the first phase of registration on Jan. 19. OnAnaly 12,944 were pre-selected for their compliance with the required conditions. The final selection phase was undertaken from Jan. 29 to Feb.1 by the Regional Agency for Employment Promotion (ANAPEC) of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region in collaboration with the ministry. ANAPEC, Spanish representatives and members of Huelva province agricultural associations managed the pre-selection process in Moroccan cities, including Meknes, Marrakech, Agadir, Oujda and Mechraa Bel Ksiri. Spain will send a list of the workers selected to ANAPEC to inform them of the upcoming procedure and visa requirements. 
Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior will work to facilitate passport renewal procedures, while the Spanish authorities will be in charge of granting work permits to the farmers. The recruitment of agricultural workers is part of a labor agreement signed between Morocco and Spain on July 25, 2001, said the statement.  In December 2017, the Ministry of Labor received a request from the Spanish embassy for the recruitment of 11,000 workers for the benefit of companies in the province of Huelva.  The agricultural workers will mainly work in strawberry, red fruit and citrus farms for the 2018 agricultural season.

Rabat- Moroccan authorities have recovered the bodies of at least twenty sub-Saharan migrants off the Mediterranean coast, reported French news agency AFP. The victims were discovered on Saturday by a Spanish patrol boat that alerted both Spanish and Moroccan authorities, according to a spokeswoman for the Spanish enclave of Melilla. Hundreds of migrants have died in recent months while trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach the Spanish mainland. Just in January, at least one thousand migrants have attempted to cross to Spain, according to a data issued by the North Observatory of Human Rights (ONDH). Ninety percent of the migrants who attempted to enter Spain illegally in January are sub-Saharan.

Rabat- Morocco and Liberia have expressed their common willingness to boost bilateral cooperation in the agricultural and fisheries sectors. On Friday in Rabat, Mbarka Bouaida, state secretary for fisheries received a Liberian delegation led by James Pobee Biney, executive secretary of governmental coalition in power in the Republic of Liberia. During their meeting, the Moroccan official and the Liberian delegation discussed possibilities of cooperation in the fields of agriculture and fisheries. Biney, who lauded the “excellent” relations between Morocco and Liberia, invited Moroccan operators to invest in his country, particularly in the fields of agriculture and fisheries. The Liberian official also expressed his hope for the joint commission to occur in the near future, as it will “give new momentum economic relations between the two nations.” In a statement to the press, Bouaida underscored the importance of investment opportunities in Liberia, emphasizing that the country has significant maritime potential. Morocco and Liberia have strong political, historical, and economic ties. In January, King Mohammed VI held a phone conversation with Liberia’s President-elect George Weah. After reiterating his congratulations to Weah for his election success, the King highlighted bilateral ties between the two countries. The monarch said that “considering the African brotherly bonds and active solidarity between our peoples and relations rooted in fruitful cooperation and mutual esteem between our countries, I should like you to know how keen I am to work with you to strengthen our relations in all sectors.” The King added that strengthening bilateral bonds between the two countries “should help us serve our peoples’ best interests and build bridges to promote mutual assistance and solidarity between African countries, whose peoples are yearning for further progress, prosperity and sustainable development in a safe, stable environment.” Weah has welcomed King Mohammed VI’s vision, emphasizing his strong determination to reinforce the multifaceted relations between Morocco and Liberia.

Rabat – According to President of the African Football Federation Ahmad Ahmad Morocco has proven its capacity to host major sports events like the World Cup. Speaking at the 40th Ordinary General Assembly of CAF, held in Casablanca on February 2, Ahmad made his position on Morocco’s candidature for the hosting of the 2016 FIFA World Cup clear. “I can reassure you that I will not be neutral. I say it loud and clear,” said Ahmad. His statements come in response to remarks from FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino. On Friday, Infantino urged CAF to remain neutral in the selection process for the 2026 World Cup host. “I ask you to do everything possible to make the process as healthy as possible. It is about our credibility.” Ahmad, who was quoted by Cafonline.com, said that “There are many World Cup procedure manuals in relation to the various FIFA reforms, ethical requirements and regulations.” He added that, “It is for this reason that I am the only [one] to have made a pronouncement on the candidature of Morocco for the 2026 World Cup. […] I can answer for which concerns me. I cannot answer for others.” Ahmad argued FIFA’s point, emphasizing that “nothing says that [he] cannot” support Morocco’s bid. “Already, I am not entitled to vote. For this reason, I am free.” The CAF top official said that the vote to select the host country of the competition is “done by show of hands, as stated in the statutes. So how do you expect countries not to show support, since voting is not done by secret ballot? Maybe the FIFA Congress will revise that [issue].” Morocco is currently the host of the ongoing the African Nations Championship (CHAN), which will conclude on Sunday. The CAF president and other officials of the confederation lauded Morocco for its organization of the tournament. CHAN’s final is scheduled to take place on February 3, whenMorocco and Nigeria will compete for the tournament’s title. Morocco submitted its candidacy to host the tournament on August 11, 2017. The bid has been highly endorsed by Ahmad and other CAF officials, including Ahmad’s first vice president, Kwesi Nyantakyi. Around 221 national soccer federations from around the world will meet in Moscow in June to decide between Morocco and the USA/Canada/Mexico joint bid for the host of the 23rd FIFA World Cup. The candidates’ files must meet FIFA’s technical terms, including infrastructure and commercial criteria. The two candidates will submit their complete candidacy proposals and required documents to FIFA by March 16.

Rabat – Morocco will have the fastest train in Africa. The high speed train (LGV) travels more than 320 kilometers per hour, operations manager, Mehdi Benqassmi, stated in a video shared by the National Office of Railways (ONCF). The high speed train is the first of its kind in Africa, linking Tangier to Kenitra in only 1.5 hours. In the future, the LGV will connect Tangier to Casablanca in 2 hours and 10 minutes hours, compared tothe current trip’s five hour minimum.

Rabat – Prominent Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan is facing charges and is being formally investigated since being taken into police custody by police in Paris as “part of a preliminary inquiry” into rape and assault allegations.  The 55-year-old theologian has firmly denied wrongdoing and accusations that he sexually assaulted two women in 2009 and 2012, claiming that these allegations are part of a “campaign of lies launched by [his] adversaries.” According to The Times, the preliminary inquiry turned into an extensive investigation after one of his alleged victims, a disabled woman named Christelle, provided information about an intimate part of his anatomy. Ramadan, however, denied ever having made contact with her. The spokesman said that the prosecutor’s office has requested that he remains under arrest because of fears that he might leave the country.  Despite the full investigation, Ramadan’s fate is still uncertain, as the French magistrates’ goal in this preliminary investigation is to decide whether the accused will face trial or not.  If charges are confirmed, the renowned scholar will likely face up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person.  Ramadan, who is the grandson of the Muslim Brotherhood’s founder, was accused of rape by author and former Salafi Henda Ayari, who accused him of raping her in 2012 on the sidelines of a congress of the Union of Islamic Organizations of France.  She was the first woman to attempt to bring Mr. Ramadan to justice, saying she was adamant to “carry this fight till the end, whatever the cost.” She was later joined by Christelle, who stepped forward and claimed she was also raped by the Swiss scholar in a French hotel in 2009. According to Ayari’s lawyer, Eric Morain, many other women were considering suing Ramadan for sexual harassment or assault. In late October, the French news daily Le Parisien reported that a third women, under the alias of Yasmina, came forward to accuse the Islamist scholar of “sexual harassment and threats.” Soon after the rape accusations surfaced, Oxford University, where he has been teaching since 2009, issued a statement that “by mutual agreement and with immediate effect,” Ramadan would take a leave of absence from his position as Professor of Contemporary Islamic studies.  Online Backlash  The news did not take long to stir reactions on social media.  Si Tariq Ramadan a été placé en garde à vue, déféré au Parquet en vue de sa mise en examen et que son placement en détention a été requis, ce n’est pas parce qu’il est visé par deux plaintes pour viol c’est juste parce qu’il est victime d’un complot fomenté par “li siounistes” ? — Sébastien JALLAMION (@SJallamion) February 2, 2018  [If Tariq Ramadan was taken into custody, referred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office for his indictment and his detention was not required, it is not because he is the target of two rape just because he is the victim of a conspiracy fomented by “li Siounistes” (Zionists)] [Why Tariq Ramadan of Swiss nationality is not expelled with a ban on staying in France! Why keeping the s …. at home? #policy #TariqRamadan #viol #DomesticViolence] After the news of Ramadan’s arrest broke out, Queen Mary University in London faced an online backlash for hosting an event, scheduled for March 3, during which the muslim scholar is expected to take part in as a speaker. “@QMUL why are you allowing Tariq Ramadan to speak at your university when there are allegations of sexual violence against him, currently going through the criminal justice system in France?” one Twitter user said.  Aliya Zaidi, a young feminist, argued that it was “only appropriate to cancel the lecture given the nature of the allegations and to keep students safe”. .@QMUL why are you allowing Tariq Ramadan to speak at your university when there are allegations of sexual violence against him, currently going through the criminal justice system in France? pic.twitter.com/6LGO9DdDQ6 — Akeela Ahmed (@AkeelaAhmed) January 31, 2018  Pourquoi #TariqRamadan de nationalité #Suisse n’est pas expulsé avec 1 interdiction de séjour en #France ! ?

I do not see anything wrong with that statement. As it is about her actions about cancelling events, when there is good that can be taken from them. — Zbigniew EG (@EG_Zbigniew) January 31, 2018  After many calls for cancellation and boycott of the event, Queen Mary quickly reacted to tweets, claiming that the event was organized by a UK-based Islamic group at the Islamic Institute for Development and Research.  “Please note that this event has not been organised by Queen Mary and is not taking place on our campus,” the university wrote on Twitter. “The event seems to be organised by @IIDR_Live.”   You might have just answered your own question… “Allegations”, “currently going”. Should we apply a sentence before any verdict? — Ludovic Garcia (@Gorcyn) January 31, 2018

Rabat – Inmates in a number of Moroccan prisons got a breath of fresh air as Morocco hosted the CHAN 2018. The success story of Morocco’s CHAN 2018 was not limited to traditional big city stadiums alone. This time, and for the first time in the history of CHAN, the continental tournament was also played and celebrated in prisons. As local footballers from African nations represented their countries in the past weeks, inmates in four different correctional facilities in Morocco, too, tasted a similar joy and excitement. Over a hundred inmates representing 12 African countries played the tournament in the correctional facilities of Tangier, Marrakech, Agadir, and Casablanca. But it is at the correctional facility of Oukacha, in Casablanca, that the two final matches of the inmates’ CHAN were played on Thursday. Mali played against Cameron in the third place match. With national flags waving and overenthusiastic chants of national anthems greeting and cheering the players, as if in a traditional match, Cameroon beat Mali 4-2. “We wanted to play and win the cup. Although we failed to do that, we are happy to win the third place match”, said Francis, a Cameroonian inmate, adding that he is grateful to King Mohamed VI and the technical staff for “thinking about us African inmates.” “Africa forever”, on could read on the facility’s main Gates as the teams prepared for the games. The final was played between Morocco and Guinea. Morocco won by 8-7, with Morocco’s defender Abderrahmane saying that he is happy to represent his country. The tournament, he later explained, smiling, was a burden-lifter, a sort of way to forget about their daily problems and bring them back to life. In attendance on the final day of the tournament were an important delegation from CAF and the Royal Moroccan Football Federation including, amongst others, the tournament’s Ambassadors Tunisian Abdel Chadly and Congolese legendary goal keeper Robert Kidiaba. In spite of their daily difficulties, inmates were excited and happy to be around famous African footballers and important officials who had come to watch their matches and cheer them up. The inmates’ CHAN was part of an agreement signed between the Royal Moroccan Football Federation and the Moroccan Prisons Services to provide various support to correctional facilities across Morocco. The tournament, the organizers said, is a facet of a broader program of social rehabilitation. “There are talented, high level-players in prisons”, joked Abdelmoumen Cherif, a former local footballer and member of the technical staff of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, adding that he is happy that Morocco won and would like to witness the same triumph in tomorrow’s CHAN final between Morocco and Nigeria.

Rabat – The United States has declined a visa request by Argentina’s former football legend Diego Maradona after he allegedly insulted US President Donald Trump in an interview with the Venezuelan network, Telesur. Matias Morla, Maradona’s lawyer explained in an interview for the program “Buenos Dias America,” that Maradona was asked about his opinion on Trump. During the interview given to Telesur, Maradona called Trump a “chirolita,” a slang insult in Argentina that refers to people who are under the orders of others as puppets, reported several news outlets including Russia’s RT and Great Britain’s Daily Mail. During the time of the interview, the 57-year old ex-footballer was in the process of applying for a visa to the US, which was eventually rejected. Maradona was to travel to Florida in order to appear at a trial with his former wife, Claudia Villafane, who bought property with her maiden name while she was married. After visa denial, Maradona’s lawyer is expected to represent Maradona in the trial. “After this, I said I am going to have to represent you in Miami instead,” Morla told Maradona. It’s not the first time Maradona has run afoul of the law in the US. During the 1994 World Cup held in the US, Maradona tested positive for five banned substances. Argentina’s football federation then expelled the football star from the team and the tournament.

By Amaan Afzal Rabat – On the 4th of February, Rabat will be the host city for a workshop introducing a multimillion-dollar fund from the Islamic Development Bank called Transform to Morocco, intended to stimulate growth in science, technology and innovation – scheduled to launch next month with an “esteemed advisory panel.” The workshop will be presented by Dr Hayat Sindi, figure head of science and technology in the Middle East and Chief Scientific Advisor to the IsDB president. Her visit to Rabat is part of a four-week tour across the Islamic Development Bank’s member countries introducing the fund to the people, including Transform to Morocco’s first undertaking, an online platform called ‘Engage’. This venture will help match businesses with innovators, and will “fund scientific initiatives that will help the economic and social progress of those in the developing world.” This fund comes at an ideal time for Morocco who were stagnant in their innovative strides this year, ranking 50th once again in the annual Innovation Rankings compiled by Bloomberg. Perhaps Transform to Morocco will act as a catalyst for new ideas in science and technology, propelling them up the ranks and aiding them in fulfilling the objectives laid out in the Moroccan Innovation Initiative. “I am delighted to be in Morocco to discuss our exciting plans for the launch of the IsDB’s Engage platform. Morocco is a hub of ideas and innovation,” Dr Sindi told Morocco World News. “We would like to hear from the science and technology community – the start-ups, investors, NGOs, students, researchers and SMEs, who can help us accelerate social and economic progress in the developing world through the power of innovation. We invite them to engage with us because we can provide the infrastructure to help develop their ideas,” she added. Dr Sindi will meet with chief Ministers and Government Agencies during her tour, including spokespeople from the Ministry of High Education, Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade and Digital Economy. The Islamic Development Bank, one of the largest development banks in the world are responsible for establishing a number of widely successful fund partnerships, including the World Bank, DFID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation generating optimism for Morocco’s future in science, technology and innovation.

Rabat – Morocco will receive USD 2 billion in aid from the African Development Bank (AfDB) over the next two years, said Khaled Sherif, Bank Vice President in charge of Regional Development, Regional Integration and Services, in Rabat on Friday. On an official work visit to Morocco from January 29 to February 2, Sherif said, “We informed the Head of Government [Saad Eddine El Othmani] that AfDB will provide [USD] 2 billion in aid to Morocco over the next two years.” Sherif’s announcements were voiced after he held talks with El Othmani, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The Vice President of the bank also lauded the efforts undertaken by the Moroccan financial sectors and public institutions that contribute “effectively” to the success of the partnership programs. The competence of the institutions, according to Sherif, is making the Moroccan model an example to be followed by the AfDB at the regional and continental levels. The talks between El Othmani and Sherif were an opportunity to discuss a possible sharing of Morocco’s experience in several areas of development with Arab and African countries, as part of a Morocco-AfDB partnership. This is Sherif’s first visit to Morocco since taking office on Nov.1, 2016, and aims to oversee projects underway in Morocco and strengthen cooperation between the African banking firm and the country. In December 2017, AfDB’s approved a USD 265 million loan to Morocco to support two solar power plants, NOORM I and NOORM II. Together, they are projected to cost EUR 2.048 billion and yield a cumulative capacity of 800 megawatts.

Rabat – Morocco is expecting the number of Chinese tourist arrivals to reach “at least 500,000” by 2020, against the 100,000 tourists recorded in 2017, said  Minister of Tourism, Air Transport, Handicraft and Social Economy Mohamed Sajid. During a joint press conference on Thursday with Song Yu, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Tourism Cities (WTCF), Sajid revealed that the two countries are seeking to enhance tourism cooperation. The comments were made at a Morocco-China tourism forum in Casablanca. To achieve this ambitious goal, Morocco is planning to create a direct air link with China by 2020 to accommodate more tourists from that country; a market which remains “largely under-exploited.” “We must operate all the vectors of growth and the air will be one of our main priority. The creation of a direct line is under study by the National Office of Tourism,” said the minister as quoted by Medias24. “Without being pretentious, we should very easily reach 500,000 visitors by 2020,” he indicated. Though the minister is not sure whether this project will be finalized by 2019 or 2020, he affirms that it will be “done quickly,” especially considering that the “Ministry has initiated contacts with Chinese airlines that are willing to accompany and take advantage of the current explosion of this emerging market in Morocco.” Sajid also revealed that the National Office of Tourism will strengthen its presence at its Beijing office. “Because with this enormous potential, we can no longer be satisfied with only having two employees already present in the office,” he said. In June 2016,  Morocco lifted pre-travel visa requirement for Chinese nationals wishing to enter Morocco. In 2017, the number of Chinese tourists in Morocco increased by 760 percent, evidence of the broadening global pull of Morocco’s tourism sector. According to Interbank Payment Center, Chinese tourists had the highest per capita spending of all foreign tourists in Morocco in 2017.

Rabat – During an election ceremony held last Friday in Casablanca, Patrice Edouard Ngaissona, president of CAR’s (Central African Republic) football federation, and former chief of the anti-Balaka militia, was elected to CAF’s executive board. The Central African official is said to have links with the anti-Balaka, a militia group that has been accused of numerous atrocities, including killings and human rights abuses, especially against CAR’s Muslims. The militia is also associated with the death of Moroccan Blue Helmets in 2017, as a spiral of violent attacks targeted CAR’ Muslim community. “Today, Morocco has become a blessed land for me”, Mr. Ngaissona told the press after his election. With 30 voices in favor of his candidacy, the Center African football chief is set to be the representative of Central Africa, in replacement of the Gabonese Pierre Alain Moungeuigui who, with just 23 voices on Friday, failed to renew his mandate. The Anti-Balaka, meaning “machete-proof “or “invincible” in Sango, CAR’s most spoken local language, presented themselves as the defenders of the country’s Christians and a reaction to the machetes used by the Seleka rebels. The militia has also been associated with massive terror and numerous exactions under President François Bozizé under whom Mr. Ngaissona briefly serves as Minister of Sports, and is accused of partaking in the wave of violence that saw thousands of people flee CAR in 2013. Al Wihda, a human rights organization based in Bangui, the country’s capital, has declared being “alarmed” by the prospects of a “former Anti-Balaka political coordinator” being elected to a prominent seat in the continent’s football decision-making entity. In 2015, Mr. Ngaissona was barred from running in his country’s presidential election over concerns regarding his role in the 2013 civil strife. But when asked about his role in the 2013 violence, Mr. Ngaissona replied: “If these allegations were true, I would not be here today”, explaining that he would not like “to mix football with politics.” “Everything I’ve done has been for the good of my country”, he added. Despite all the controversy surrounding Mr. Ngaissona’s pats, CAF’s executive committee approved his candidacy in January, with a CAF spokesman telling the press that, in such matters, the organization only “respects strict statutory criteria”, further saying that CAF does not have an ethical committee.

Rabat – The UAE-based freight and logistics chain, Emirates Logistics, along with Adidas have inaugurated their 13,000 square meters logistics center at the Tanger Med port facility, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The project, “Emirates for Supply Services,” is worth MAD 100 million. The facility plans to receive about 5 million Adidas products in 2018, as well as 30,000 product references from more than 20 countries (60 percent of the warehouse capacity). Emirates Logistics is part of the UAE’s Sharaf Group. Abdelkader Amara, Morocco’s Minister of Logistics and Transport said that the inauguration of this logistic platform underscores the trust placed in the port facility complex near Tangier by international operators and logistics companies. Amara said that Tanger Med is ranked among the top 50 ports in the world, owing to the efforts undertaken by its workers and leadership Amara said that the port’s operators are seeking to make the hub one of the 20 best ports in the world. The minister added that the new logistics center, which will be mainly in charge of exporting Adidas items, is in addition to the larger logistics system of Tanger Med’s platform that has attracted several multinational firms in recent years. The newly inaugurated facility is seeking to create 370 long-term job opportunities, according to MAP. Salah Ibrahim, executive director of the Sharaf Group said that the choice of Tanger Med to house the regional logistics platform is motivated by its strategic position between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. According to Ibrahim, the Tanger Med port facility is one of the most important industrial centers in North Africa. Fouad Brini, Chairman for the Supervisory Board of the Tangier-Mediterranean Special Agency said that the impressive results achieved by the port facility confirmed King Mohammed VI’s leadership on development issues, which is aimed at enabling Morocco to acquire large logistics platforms on the Strait of Gibraltar.

Rabat – Najlae Bellouri is a passionate 25-year old traveler and up-and-coming TV presenter from Morocco. She hosted an online travel show called “Yallah M3aia” (Come With Me) on ALTV (an online television station) which recounts her travels in Turkey. Najlae Bellouri was born and grew up in Safi, at the well-known port city on Morocco’s Atlantic coast, famous for its pottery. She has a Master’s degree in Social Economy and Sustainable Development from Cadi Ayyad University in Social Economy and Sustainable Development and she currently lives in Marrakech.   She chatted with Morocco World News on January 4 about her travel show and love for her home country. Najlae made her debut as an amateur TV presenter with Global Girl Media; an organization dedicated to empowering high school age girls. “I reported on social and cultural topics featured on the web.” The traveler said that the Yalah M3aia program helped her to develop her skills as a TV presenter. “It is my first experience as a presenter. It is like a dream come true. I learned a lot of new things.” Without a degree in journalism, Najlae is an inspiration for all college graduates. “ I am not yet a TV presenter yet, but I have always wanted to be, and I am always motivated to work on that.” Yallah M3aia is a 12 part series which Najlae presents in Darija. She explained that since ALTV is an international channel based in the Middle East, herprograms broadcasted on this channel have subtitles in classical Arabic to make it more accessible and thereby increase viewership. The series has strong audiences in Turkey and Egypt, but a surprising few keep up with the show in Morocco. Najlae explained that even though her show attracted many audiences,  gaining “more Moroccan viewers…this is our aim.” Najlae expressed her hope for a new season in which her destination would be Morocco, her home country. “I am a Moroccan and unfortunately I haven’t had the opportunity to discover some regions in Morocco.” Fascinated by the cultural and geographical diversity in Morocco, Najlae said that “in Morocco, we have everything; a lovely desert, amazing beaches, beautiful mountains, a strong tradition, a rich gastronomy, and an incredible hospitality.”  She said that the country has ”everything we need for a successful new season of Yallah M3aya.” Najlae even said that the idea has already been proposed to ALTV. Asked about her passion for traveling in general, Najlae told MWN that she became passionate about traveling through involvement in intercultural exchange programs. “I gained many friends of different nationalities through these programs.” She added that she has always been in love with documentaries and travel programs on National Geographic. “Perhaps this where my interest comes from,” she muses. When asked specifically about Turkey, Najlae replied that she enjoys the whole country, but the fabulous city of Antalya is the one city that takes her breath away. Najlae met Patrix Arnoux, who would become the show’s director,  at an event in Marrakech. When Arnoux offered her the Yallah M3aia opportunity, the young traveler took it without hesitation. Najlae Also expressed her interest in social activities, tennis, fashion and theater. When asked about her inspiration, Najlae cited her mother: “my mother is my true inspiration […]she has always guided and supported me for all the decisions I have made in throughout my life.” Najlae said that she is prouder of her work when she receives support and motivation from her relatives and friends. “I feel successful also when I realized that people are interested in what I do and what I want to do.” She added that the motivation both from the media and her audiences reinvigorates her pursuit of her goals.

Rabat – 1104 illegal migrants have attempted to enter Spain during January, the North Observatory of Human Rights (ONDH) finds. According to data collected in the field from border police authorities, the press and NGOs, ONDH said that almost one-third of migrants who attempted the crossing have managed to enter Spanish territory, while about five percent have lost their lives in the process. In terms of nationality, about 90 percent of them were from sub-Saharan Africa, while three percent were Moroccan and the rest originated from other countries. 57 percent of these migrants chose to reach the Spanish coast by boat, while the others preferred to try to climb the border barriers of Ceuta and Melilla. The number of migrants using the sea route from Morocco to Spain has more than tripled between 2016-1017. Approximately 3,300 refugees crossed to Europe from Morocco in the first four months of 2017 compared to about a thousand in the same period in 2016. A week ago, a group of Spanish relief professionals and civilians rescued 70 people at sea, adrift in the stretch of the Mediterranean between Morocco and Spain. In mid-2017, about 100 immigrants who departed from Morocco, including 14 women and four children, were rescued in the Alboran sea. These numbers are expected to continue rising. “The flows arriving from Maghreb countries to Spain are very likely to increase in 2018,” the director of Europe’s border agency, Fabrice Leggeri told Reuters.

Rabat – While security is always a high-profile issue at international sporting events, the 2018 World Cup may face an unusual threat: locusts. The Russian Department of Agriculture fears a “global scandal” if swarms of locusts descend upon football pitches and disrupt World Cup matches. Russian media reported that nearly one million hectares in Russia’s southern provinces are currently affected by a scourge of locusts, and the Russian government has expressed concern that locusts may also be drawn to World Cup games by the greenery of the football fields. “Locusts love it where there is lots of green. How would they not come to the place where football is being played?” noted Pyotr Chekmarev, the head of the agriculture ministry’s crop farming department. Russian ministers met on Thursday to discuss preventative measures to keep swarms of un-ticketed pests at bay.

Rabat – With a fox fur draped over her shoulder, Dounia Batma posed for photos and displayed her fashion sense in a video she shared on her Instagram a few days ago.  But that wasn’t the last of it. The Moroccan singer’s posts spread like wildfire on social media websites, attracting considerable criticism. Dounia Batma’s social media posts have always sparked controversy. This time, too, it was no different. The photos and the video received sharp criticism from her followers and others. Specifically, animal rights activists who were furious at her for posing with fox fur. Commentators expressed sorrow for the animal and called her ‘vulgar’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘enemy of nature’. Since Batma disabled comments on her original Instagram post, Social Media users shared the posts on Facebook and YouTube where they largely shamed her and her actions. One comment from a video made by Buzz News for its YouTube channel says, “The reasoning behind killing for pleasure or turning a living creature into an object for decoration is beyond me.” Another comment taken from the video on Facebook criticized Batma’s criticizers, saying: “[…] I’d like to remind the ones commenting about how shocking and cruel Batma’s behavior is, that many animals are killed the same way for leather every year, and those meat eaters…are you all vegans, now?”

By Mohamed Amine Rhaz Rabat – It’s been an incredible month for Ayoub El Kaabi. The rising soccer star, born on June 26, 1993 in Casablanca, started his football career as an striker for the football club Racing Athletic Club of Casablanca where he played for one year (2016-2017) before moving to Renaissance Sportive Berkane, the club he currently plays for. The 24-year-old was the top scorer of Morocco’s second division football league Botola 2, during the 2016-2017 season, with 25 goals to his credit. Abdelhak Rizkallah, president of RAC of Casablanca, spoke about Kaabi in an interview conducted by the news outlet Le360. He said, “El Kaabi is a serious player, he wants to play and he is very determined, he is a role model for all the youth who want to be professional and make a future.” El Kaabi made his international debut for Morocco on 13 January during the 2018 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) match against Mauritania, scoring three goals. The RS Berkane’s striker was named Man of The Match on January 31 after Morocco’s encounter with Libya’s National Football Team during CHAN’s semi-final match. Morocco won the game 3-1. CHAN executives chose El Kaabi as the best player due to the world-class performance he displayed during the semi-final match hosted in Mohammed V stadium in Casablanca. El Kaabi displayed pure talent throughout the entire tournament scoring 8 goals in 5 matches, making him the top goal scorer in the entire history of CHAN. “If I’m the top scorer, it’s thanks to my teammates, I thank them. I do not want to stop halfway. I still want to score goals and contribute to the dedication of my team, “he told CAF Online. Ayoub El Kaabi received three offers from Egyptian football clubs, including Al Ahly and Zamalek. The president of RS Berkane, Fouzi Lekjaa, declined the offers, still wanting to see Ayoub El Kaabi wearing RS Berkan’s white and orange shirt.

Rabat – The voices that cried, the protesters that rallied, and the overwhelming majority of 73 percent of women who suffer daily sexual harassment have finally received legislative retribution–or so it seems. On January 30, the House of Councillors adopted draft law 103-13 on violence against women. Verifying prior evidence that women rights are low priority for the Parliament, only 23 members voted in favor, 15 voted against and 82 councillors were absent. Lawmakers’ have long turned a cold shoulder to the discourse around gender-based violence and draft law 103.13,a law presumably drafted to protect the country’s female population. But the aforementioned negligence from the councillors is but the tip of the iceberg. A national campaign on violence against women launched in 2006. Dubbed “Towards a Law on Violence Against Women,” the movement, led by women rights organizations, has been met with promises of a law “in progress” or to “be adopted imminently.” Seven years later, Bassima Hakkaoui drafted law 103.13 and presented it to the parliament. Once in their house, the bill was locked and forgotten in the representatives’ drawers  until the National Observatory on Violence Against Women revealed alarming findings on gender-based violence in Morocco. In its 2016 report, the observatory found that 73 percent of Moroccan women have suffered from sexual harassment and verbal assaults in public spaces. Further findings show that  one in three women in Morocco are victims of physical violence, one in four suffer sexual violence, and one in two undergo psychological violence. Women and their representatives in civil society were enraged and heavily pressured the representatives to react. The same year, the House of Representatives approved the bill, barely amending the original text. “This shows how much Parliament is negligent of the catastrophic condition of half of its population. I suspect that they barely bothered to read the content of this bill that can only be described as totally inadequate. It suffers from so many inconsistencies; it’s a shame to label it as a law,” Stephanie Willman Bordat, Founding Partner of Mobilising for Rights Associates, told Morocco World News. The bill was then sent to the House of Councillors. Fueled by constructive criticism, resentment of the status-quo, and anxiety for social change, NGOs and women’s rights advocates embarked on a journey to advocate and lobby for councillor amendments to the bill. This endeavour lasted more than 1.5 years. “NGOs and women rights organizations did all kinds of things to push the councillors to amend the bill. We sent emails, WhatsApp messages, organized conferences, wrote reports and summaries of those report. We struggled,” Bordat said.
 An Amateur’s Sleight of Hand Far from  what El Hakkaoui deems “a fundamental legal tool to stop female targeted violence,” draft law 130.13 is, in fact, “a setback for women’s rights rather than a progressive move,” according to Bordat. “It basically adds prison sentences, fines for convicted aggressors, and creates a number of commissions that will be operated by bureaucrats,  who will most certainly do nothing to further advance the cause of women,” explains Bordat. Indeed, the draft law states that convicts of sexual harassment will now face sentences ranging from one to six months in prison and a fine of MAD 2,000 to 10,000.  If the harasser is a coworker, supervisor, or security official, the penalty doubles and reaches up to 5 years in prison and a fine varying from MAD 10,000 to 50,000, if the aggressor is a family member. The bill does nothing to cover the reporting, investigation, and prosecution phases of violence against women cases. Neither does it address current deficiencies in sexual violence laws, guarantee adequate protection for victims, or provide women with concrete or specific services. The draft law only provides protection for women once they have filed a criminal complaint.With only 3 percent of women victims of conjugal violence reporting to the authorities, Bordat finds that civil protection orders should instead be issued by the family judge. Bordat believes that “quite frequently, women victims of violence just want the violence to stop, without having to involve the police.” For her, a much better solution is to give the family judge the power to issue civil protection orders tailored to each case in order to guarantee real protection for women. The draft law also lags in providing women victims of violence with protection orders prior to the criminal prosecution. “This gap places women at risk of continued violence.  Women should be able to obtain a civil protection order quickly and as soon as it is requested,” she said. In 2016, Human Rights Watch addressed a letter to the Minister of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development, urging her to amend the bill on the basis of the UN-established legislation on violence against women. HRW recommend that the bill should expand the scope of application of domestic violence crimes to prosecute aggressors of non-married women victims of violence, even if they are not engaged to marry. Likewise, the National Human Rights Council urged Hakkaoui to harmonize the draft bill with the constitution and international human rights law, mainly the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women. “We recommend implementing the “due diligence” standard to prevent, investigate and punish acts of violence against women and girls.” Bordat explains that other recommendations include providing financial support for women and children, prosecuting offenders even if the victim retracts her testimony, compelling the police to conduct thorough investigations, providing free legal assistance automatically to women victims of violence, and guaranteeing safe and immediate shelter for women victims of violence in emergencies. When the House of Councillors met Monday to vote on Draft Law 103.13, none of these recommendations were taken into consideration.   The Draft Law will soon be tabled in the House of Representatives for a second revision before being officially adopted and implemented. Bordat suspects that they will make amendments to it, but unfortunately, she predicts that once again, “Moroccan women will be left with yet another inadequate law that does nothing to protect them.”

Rabat – FIFA’s President Gianni Infantino has called on the African Football Confederation (CAF) to remain neutral in the selection process for the 2026 World Cup host. Having arrived in Casablanca on Friday to attend the 40th Ordinary General Assembly of CAF, Infantino said, “I ask you to do everything possible to make the process as healthy as possible. It is about our credibility.” Infantino’s remarks, however, did not please CAF’s President Ahmad Ahmad. In response to Infantino’s call, Ahmad said, “We live in an era of democracy. You are free making your decision.” The CAF president, who has been expressing his full support for Morocco’s bid, added: “I have my position, the executive committee supports me in my position, but it is up to you to decide.” “I am not allowed to vote on June 13, so I am free to express my position,” added Ahmad, who was quoted by Moroccan news outlet Le360. In December 2017, Infantino expressed his support for the North American bid, saying that, “Joint biddings are certainly positive.” FIFA’s president also said at a conference in Dubai, “Let me say one more thing, to have Canada, U.S. and Mexico coming together for a joint project, already this is a positive message,” reported American news outlet New York Times. In January, the CAF President expressed his satisfaction over the African Nations Championship (CHAN) tournament, which is currently being held in Morocco. He believes that the smooth proceedings of the tournament are proof that Morocco is capable of organizing the World Cup. Ahmad is not the only CAF official who has supported Morocco’s bid. CAF’s first vice president, Kwesi Nyantakyi, said that Morocco has honored Africa throughout the month-long CHAN. According to Nyantakyi, the success of 2018 CHAN is a proof that Morocco can organize major football events, referring to the 2026 World Cup. Morocco’s effort to secure the World Cup is, he added, “the project of an entire continent.” Around 221 national soccer federations from around the world will meet in Moscow to decide in June between Morocco and the USA/Canada/Mexico joint bid as to who will host the 23rd FIFA World Cup. The candidates’ files should meet FIFA’s technical terms, including infrastructure and commercial criteria.   The two candidates will have to submit their complete candidacy proposals and required documents to FIFA by March 16.

By Amaan Afzal Rabat – A recent report on Morocco’s renewable energy source ambitions by BMI Research, a branch of the Fitch Group, predicts the countries continued outperformance among Middle Eastern and Northern African (MENA) nations over the next decade. These strides have been ongoing since their introduction of wind power generation in 2002 and were prompted by Morocco’s reliance on imported energy sources, including hydrocarbons and fossil fuels, meaning their overall energy production was subject to potential instability due to possible external supply shortages – as opposed to the more reliable domestically produced solar and wind power sources. BMI Research’s glowing view of Morocco’s energy future can be attributed to an impressive track record over recent times, “delivering tendered renewable projects in a timely manner at steadily decreasing costs,” a direct result of the governments need for energy sector diversification.  The Moroccan government has set its sights high, with its goal of improving its total yearly energy production coming from renewable processes from 33% in 2017 to 42% by 2020. BMI Research predicted, in its report, that by 2027 wind and solar power sources will account for 21% of the Moroccan power mix, nearly doubling the current figure of 11%, catapulting them ahead of all MENA competition. Given that the energy demand is simultaneously rising by circa 7% each year, these projections are made even more impressive. The Western Kingdom has already set into motion a zealous solar plan with the goal of generating 2 gigawatts of solar power by 2020, through the construction of five large-scale solar power projects in Laayoune, Boujdour, Quarzate, Tarfaya and Ain Beni Mathar – all fitted with contemporary concentrated solar power, solar thermal and photovoltaic machinery.  Morocco also has great wind power potential due to high wind speeds across its 3,500-kilometre-long coastline, where it already has a number of wind farms capable of achieving their renewable energy goals, with some expansion.  Due to the inherently erratic nature of the energy production from renewable sources, Morocco will have to invest in technology capable of storing excess power produced on days of high yield to compensate for unavoidable low output days – according to the BMI report. Although this presents a potential obstacle, Morocco has already demonstrated its ability in improving the reliability of its solar power production, having eliminated blackouts in the Quarzazate Province through the thermal storage capacity of the Noor 1 Concentrated Solar Power farm. In total, Morocco will invest 13 Billion USD in supplementing their renewable energy sector to reach their 2020 objective. Given that they annually spend three billion less in non-renewable energy imports, they are truly planning for a more stable long-term future.

Rabat – Moroccan-American rapper Karim Kharbouch, widely known by his stage name French Montana, is expanding his charity efforts in his birth homeland, Morocco. The famous rapper is planning to help improve his country’s education system. Born in Morocco, French Montana spent the first 13 years of his life in Morocco before immigrating to the US with his family. His love of Morocco, though, is never hidden. Known for his generosity, French Montana was just named a Global Citizen Ambassador by Global Citizen, a social initiative platform that supports social and economic development efforts. At an event in New York City last week, the social action platform crowned the rapper as its ambassador for universal healthcare and education for his generous philanthropic efforts. The rapper donated USD 100,000 to the MAMA Hope Organization in Uganda, to expand a health facility in the African country. He also filmed the video for his song “Unforgettable” in Uganda. During his stay in the African country, the rapper visited the Suubi health center and met with the organization’s founders. Afterward, he decided to donate a large portion of the video and song proceeds to the organization with the aim of supporting the center’s maternal health programs. The rapper is now bringing his philanthropic efforts home to Morocco, celebrity news outlet TMZ has unveiled. French Montana is planning to help improve the education system in Morocco by donating funds for the acquisition of computers, books and faculty, according to TMZ. Kharbouch has become the first rapper to clinch the Global Citizen Ambassador title. “We are so happy to be partnering with French Montana, who embodies the true meaning of being a Global Citizen and are grateful for his commitment to using his platform to lift up those in most need, said Hugh Evans CEO of Global Citizen.” French Montana told TMZ before the ceremony that, “The whole idea of this is to spark the mind of the world leaders, you know? To help and do something on a bigger scale.” He said, “I just feel like all the mothers and children should have the right care. It should never be a privilege, it should be a right.” French Montana often pays public tribute to Morocco through his song lyrics, music videos, and social media posts. Recently, he unveiled the much-anticipated video for his latest hit “Famous,” shot on the streets of Chefchaouen.

Rabat – The US president announced accelerated plans to end the green card lottery and family-sponsored immigration on Thursday during his State of the Union speech. “We need to end chain migration and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery.” Under the current visa program, the controversial president stated that countries “give us their worst people, they put them in a bin.”  According to Trump, the green card lottery “randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people,” pointing to one green card recipient from Uzbekistan, who carried out an alleged terrorist attack in October 2017, killing eight people. Green card, or “diversity,” visas are based on geographical criteria. Nationals of countries that spend less than 50,000 immigrants to the US over five-year spans are eligible to obtain a green card. The chosen applicants receive legal permanent residency in the US. Between 2007 and 2015,  nearly  1.5 million Moroccans have benefited from the green card program. Trump also wants to end “chain migration,” a practice that allows residents of the US to sponsor family members for visas. “Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,” he said, but promised to allow immigrants to sponsor only spouses and minor children, as “it would protect the nuclear family.” Since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the US has been admitting immigrants who have family residing in the country, regardless of national origin quotas. But for Trump, this program is dysfunctional. “We want people coming into our country based on merit, and based on the fact that they are going to love our country, and they are going to respect our people and our country.”

By Amaan Afzal Rabat – The largest of the notorious cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, dropped to a value of $7,643 this morning – the first time it has fallen below the 8,000 marks since November of 2017, undoing the progress made that propelled the currency to a peak value of $19,511 on the 18th of December. This dramatic decrease represents a 17% depreciation over the last day and a 46% fall for the month corresponding to a dismal start to the new year. However, these developments are not exclusive to Bitcoin with all major rival coins seeing failure this month – the most notable case being Litecoin with a 55% dive, raising speculation that the digital currency phenomenon is destined to bust. The recent wave of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-hindering news certainly ensued these recent shortcomings. Worries of price manipulation and an astounding 500 million USD hack heist at Japanese exchange, Coincheck Inc, led to an investigation conducted by local authorities to ensure user security. Also, a number of regulatory threats were made by countries including the USA, China, India and South Korea including concerns of cryptocurrencies being used for dubious endeavours such as money laundering: “The government does not recognize cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin,” said Indian Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, on Wednesday, “and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.” Various critics have pinned blame on innate issues with cryptocurrency such as its natural volatility, manifesting in drastic price swings and postulating that Bitcoin will not acquire the government and user acceptance required to develop into a global payment system. In addition, numerous investors are distressed over suggestions that the widely used exchange, Bitfinex, has been artificially boosting digital currency values through its USD-backed digital tokens, ‘Tethers’, essentially disregarding the value jumps occurring through December. “Bitcoin is in trouble,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at a foreign exchange broker Forextime Ltd. “Price action suggests that bears are clearly in control, with further losses on the cards as jitters over regulation erode investor appetite further.” Some experts remain unfazed by recent developments, given that regardless of Bitcoins rapid short-term failures, when its value is placed within a long-term context, the cryptocurrency still demonstrates a 2520% increase over the previous year. “Even if we go as low as $5,000, it will still be double the prices that were traded in June and July of 2017,” said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, a social trading network. The future variations in value of these cryptocurrencies are as of yet unknown, however this uncertainty could seal the eventuality predicted by J. P. Morgan’s Chief Executive Jamie Dimon (who described Bitcoin as a “fraud” and said that it would “blow up” in due course) by forcing a mass, fright-induced, investor sell-out. “The jury is still out,” said CEO and co-founder of CryptoCompare, “and fear is gripping the markets with people preferring to step out and slight to safety rather than keep risk on.”

By Ahlam Saga Rabat – Sofia El Mountassir Billah, a 17-year-old Moroccan student of Casablanca’s Lyautey Highschool, won the speaking contest (Concours De Plaidoiries) in Caen, France.  In Caen Museum, where the event was held, EL Mountassir Billah spoke up against sexual harassment in Arab countries, specifically her country, Morocco. El Mountassir Billah’s voice made a sound resonance in Caen’s speaking contest as she addressed women’s struggle with violence and sexual harassment in Muslim countries, including Morocco. In her speech titled ‘Silence, rape…!’, El Mountassir Billah brought up the case of young Moroccan girl who was sexually harassed in a public bus last August 2017, and criticized the Moroccan code 745 that urges rape victims to marry their assailants. “The victims of rape commit suicide because of the injustice of the Penal Law,” she said. With a rueful sigh and a sad expression on her face, she made a reference to the case of the young Moroccan girl, Amina Filali, who committed suicide in 2013 after she was forced to marry her rapist Sofia further insisted that a thorough education about women’s rights in society plays a potent role in putting an end to the constant sexual assaults that target women. The sound of applauds filled the room as Sofia El Mountassir Billah ended her speech with a “thank you” to the audience. Of all the 1.500 participant speeches, including her High-school student peers’, El Mountassir Billah’s advocacy won the event. According to MEMORIAL CEAN website’s Finale results.

Rabat – A new report issued by an EU-based online market research firm, ResearchAndMarkets.com, says that Morocco is one of Africa’s leading tourist markets. The recent report, “Destination Market Insights Morocco”, provides a detailed analysis of Morocco as a tourist destination. The report mentions that Morocco attracted 10 million foreign visitors in 2016 with an eventual goal of being one of the top 20 global tourist destinations. The survey report notes that the country aims to grow the industry significantly in coming years, guided by the Moroccan Department of Tourism’s 2020 Tourism Strategy which aspires to “double the size of the tourist industry.” The firm has also underscored the surge in hotel construction in Morocco. “Between 2016 and 2021, the number of hotels in Morocco is expected to increase by 30.8 percent,” as the number of tourists visiting the country rises quickly, added the report. The report added that France is the largest source of tourists traveling to Morocco, accounting for 36.1 percent of all arrivals in Morocco in 2016. Spain was second, providing 14 percent of arrivals. Additionally, the firm added that France is the largest outbound market for Moroccans traveling abroad. Seventy-four percent of tourists who arrived in Morocco in 2016 were from Europe, with the largest inbound markets being France, Spain and the UK. Last year January to October tourist arrivals in Morocco posted a nine percent increase over the same period in 2016. Morocco has also begun to attract tourists from new markets over the past few years, including China, South Korea, Brazil, Japan and Russia. Highlighting Morocco’s top tourist destination, Marrakech, the report says that the city “is the most popular tourist destination in the country, comprising 34.5 percent of total overnight stays in Morocco in 2016.” The ResearchAndMarkets.com report added that several tourist-related construction projects are being planned for the city, “including numerous hotel projects and a new airport which is due to open in 2030.” The report is aimed at giving business leaders and potential investors a better understanding of the business, tourism and travel sector opportunities in the country, as well as the risks, to better support informed investment decisions.

Rabat – February’s cold weather is bearing down on Marrakech-Agadir highway. Snow and bone-chilling temperatures have swept over the road, covering it in scenic white. The southern regions have been experiencing snow, caused by  a mass of air coming from Northern Europe,  in the past few days.   Despite its appeal, the fall of rare heavy snow in the the Southern region has caused the roads to close, particularly in Ouarzazate, “where travelers were forced to wait for the roads to be cleaned before being able to access the city or leave it,” the director of Ouarzazate Tourism Council told Morocco World News.

Rabat – The government reiterates its promises to solve the socio-economic problems in Jerada, said government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi on Thursday in Rabat. “The government is committed to giving concrete substance to the promises it has made to solve the socio-economic problems in Jerada province,” said El Khalfi. Dialogue with representatives of the population, youth, local authorities, political parties, councils and trade unions has provided the government with “an understanding on the raised issues and demands in the mining town  as well as commitments and measures to meet these demands and expectations.” These measures are in a progressive evolution, he said, revealing that the Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, and a ministerial delegation will soon conduct a visit to the eastern region to inform the town’ residents of the government’s commitments to enhance the socio-economic conditions of their region. With a budget of MAD 7 billion allocated to create a program to combat territorial disparities, “the government is driven by a strong will given the pressing need to fight territorial and social disparities,” the spokesman said. Every year, several deaths are recorded in Jerada’s clandestine mines. On February 1, the town suffered another loss, as another person was killed while extracting coal from a clandestine mine when the walls of the mine collapsed on him. His death has led to a new wave of demonstrations. The first series of protests began late December 2017, when two brothers were crushed while mining the underground tunnels of a disused coal mine in the eastern city. The demonstrators protested against the injustices, the lack of infrastructure, the diligence of the authorities and the prospects of safe economic activity in the region. Since then, the government has said that it elaborated an action program aimed at improving farmers’ incomes and the standard of living of the local population, as well as job creation. The planned actions include irrigation, local products, range management, development of cattle breed, beekeeping, fruit tree planting and the creation of cooperatives. Meanwhile, Minister of Agriculture, Aziz Akhannouch recalled that during the 2010-2017 period, Jerada has benefited from many structuring projects which required an overall investment of over MAD 213 million, allocated for the development of rangelands, the conversion of cereals into fruit growing, the development of irrigation schemes and local products.

By Hajare El Khaldi Rabat – Spanish series, “Morocco: Love in Times of War,” will air on Netflix, following enormous success on Spanish TV,  starting February 16. The events revolve around three Spanish nurses with no experience who volunteer in the city of Melilla during the Rif War of the 1920s. “In 1921, during the Rif War, nurses from Madrid are sent to a hospital in Melilla where they are met by unemployment, class struggle, and love.” The drama follows Julia Ballester, played by actress Amaia Salamanca, who volunteered in the hope of finding her brother and fiancée that have been taken as prisoners of war. Julia; however, gets distracted from her mission after meeting Army Doctor Fidel Calderón, portrayed by Álex García, who has a fiancé of his own. The series also introduces the viewers to Julia’s fellow nurses, Pilar, Magdalena, and Veronica who are also entangled in relationship drama.  The Rif War, also known as the War of Melilla, was an armed conflict between the Spanish colonial forces, later supported by the French forces, and the Amazigh people of the mountainous region of northern Morocco known as Rif lasting from 1921 to 1926. The leader of the war was  Mohammed Ben AbdelKrim El Khattabi, who surrendered to French and Spanish forces in May 1926.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on Thursday reiterated AU’s commitment to supporting United Nations’ efforts to find a consensual and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara conflict.” According to El Othmani, AU’s leaders’ stance on the conflict is “unchanged.” In a cabinet meeting, El Othmani said that the Moroccan diplomacy has successfully managed to cancel a series of recommendations by the Summit. These proposals, according to El Othmani, are opposed to Morocco’s sovereignty and interests.  Referring to the controversial report that the Algerian Commissioner of Peace and Security Council of the AU, Ismail Chergui, submitted to the 30th summit of Heads of states and Government, El Othmani said that one-third of the African body signed against the recommendation.  Therefore, the recommendation, which was prepared by the Peace and Security body was canceled, affirmed El Othmani. The head of government added that the AU’s position is identical to the one taken during the 29th summit in support of UN efforts, referring to the decision taken during the 29th summit. At the end of the 30th summit, Moussa Faki Mahamat, the Chairperson of the AU Commision said that the AU decision, on the Western Sahara conflict, later dubbed 653, is still valid. The decision was undertaken in July 2017 by the AU as a way to show its commitment and support for the UN to find a consensual and mutually acceptable solution to end the conflict. The decision made at the 29th AU summit urges AU member countries to support UN efforts aimed at reaching a solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara. El Othmani has also confirmed that Morocco’s presence in the AU’  components is growing stronger and more dynamic. In his remarks at the cabinet meeting, El Othmani has also discussed Morocco’s election to the AU Peace and Security Council. He said that this election will help the country to act and contribute from the inside by interacting with the different African countries and defend its interests. In a statement read out by government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi after the Ministerial meeting, El Othmani said The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation will continue, in accordance with the high royal guidelines, to consolidate the efficient and productive presence of Morocco in Africa,  based on the principle of win-win cooperation and in total harmony with the vision of  King Mohammed VI.

By Amaan Afzal Rabat – A petrol bomb was thrown yesterday at the symbolic Lakeside Yangon compound of the State Counsellor of Myanmar and Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, where she was held under house arrest for 15 years by the former Burmese military government (Junta) – this sacrifice urged her National League for Democracy (NLD) party to a majority win in 2015, following 5 years since her liberation.  The report was confirmed by Director General of the State Counsellor’s Office, Zaw Htay, however, he provided no insight into the motive behind the attack or the condition of Myanmar’s de facto leader. The narrative gaps were later filled by Kyi Toe, official from the NLD, who confirmed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s absence from her residence at the time of the attack and described the minimality of damages induced: “Nothing was destroyed or burned… Our respected security forces are continuing their work so they can arrest the culprit,” said Kyi Toe.  Zaw Htay followed up, posting a description of the culprit on social media, who was captured on camera fleeing the scene – A 5-foot 5-inch brown man, about 40 years of age, with short black hair, wearing a blue longyi and pink t-shirt at the time of the crime. Despite the domestic adoration for Ms Suu Kyi for her critical role in the democratizing of Burma, she has faced criticism on an international scale for her shortcomings in addressing the alleged human rights violations committed by her nations military amidst their response to the violent insurgence in Northern Rakhine, by Rohingya extremists. Aung San Suu Kyi claimed in September of last year that the situation is being misinterpreted through a “huge iceberg of misinformation”. “We make sure that all the people in our country are entitled to protection of their rights as well as, the right to, not just political but social and humanitarian defence,” she reportedly said to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. The acts of brutality began in October of 2016 and have led to the mass fleeing of almost 700,000 to the Bangladesh border, a majority of the originally 1.1 million Rohingya civilians living in Northern Rakhine. The refugees brought with them testimonies of rape, murder and arson, qualifying Myanmar’s military and government for global condemnation of alleged ethnic cleansing, to which they actively deny.  The heroine of democracy’s silence has warranted beratement of her own, most recently reprimanded by US diplomat Bill Richardson for lacking “moral leadership”, refusing to attend her committee intended to “ease communal tensions in Rakhine” – saying they will most likely “whitewash” the genesis of the issue at hand. The State Counsellor is currently in Naypyidaw in anticipation of the two-year anniversary of the election of the National League for Democracy, and has not yet commented on the villa bombing.

Rabat – The gap in wealth between Morocco and other MENA countries with similar levels of economic development is primarily the result of lower levels of human capital per capita, the World Bank reports in a 2018 study on global wealth, entitled “The Challenging Wealth of Nations.” Morocco’s economic advancement is not to be ignored. Between 2005 and 2014, the country achieved strong growth in per capita wealth, totaling a rise of 45 percent. But if the change in real wealth per capita is added to this data, the authors of the study find Morocco’s economic growth sluggish and inconsistent. During the same time span, per capita wealth fell from roughly USD 400 to less than USD 100.  In 2014, 41 percent of Morocco’s total wealth was human capital, compared with 59 percent in Egypt and 65 percent in Lebanon. The human capital gap, compared with these countries “fully explains why total wealth per capita in Morocco is well below the average.” In a speech  presented in July 2014, King Mohammed VI called for an assessment of Morocco’s development that would include the country’s historical and cultural heritage, social and human capital, the quality of institutions, innovation and scientific research, cultural and artistic creativity, the quality of the environment, “so that all Moroccans may benefit from their country’s wealth.” At the time of the  speech Morocco’s  economic progress had been maintaining  a positive trend since 2000, particularly driven by investment in fixed capital, especially in the public sector   Nevertheless, the rate of convergence with high-income countries, including Mediterranean peers, “was too low to meet the aspirations of Moroccan citizens, particularly its youth,” the World Bank writes. The World Bank states that the country is still seeking convergence with higher-income countries. To achieve this goal, the country’s development agenda consists of macroeconomic reforms, increased trade and competitiveness, and institutional reforms. Equally important, the report explains, is the kingdom’s human capital. “Human capital is the largest source of wealth in most advanced economies, building Morocco’s human capital is the development challenge.” To build human capital, Morocco requires reforms in the education sector and labor market, plus a greater emphasis on early childhood development. From 2005 to 2014, women have accounted for only one-fifth of total human capital in Morocco, states the World Bank, explaining that if gender parity in human capital wealth were achieved, levels of human capital wealth in Morocco could increase by more than a third. Furthermore, the country should invest in early childhood development, as well as its educational system; though investments in education have led to universal primary enrollment and higher enrollment rates in secondary and postsecondary education, quality remains low. Finally, the report states that equally important changes include institutional reforms to create a modern administration, improvements in public investment and financial management, and increased accountability and access to information.

Rabat – Rumors that historical Egyptian Islamic university Al-Azhar revoked Tunisia’s categorization as an “Islamic state” due to the country’s recent women’s rights proposals stirred controversy across social media last week. In order to de-escalate the buzz, Al-Azhar finally broke its silence and denied the rumors via Twitter on January 28.  “Al-Azhar Media Center has followed astonishingly the rumors spread recently across social media about Al-Azhar removing Tunisia from the list of Islamic states,” tweeted Al-Azhar on January 28. Social media users’ responses to  the rumors have been conflicted. While some were outraged by the alleged decision, others supported the spread of such rumors, as they consider Al-Azhar a proponent of religious extremism in Egypt and the Arab world. The latter claim is connected to Al-Azhar’s refusal to consider the Islamic State an apostate institution. Amazgh political activist Ahmed Asid expressed his views on Al-Azhar’s alleged decision: “Al-Azhar’s intrusion in the affairs of another country is a sign of cultural degeneration.” Asid added that Tunisia’s reforms concerning women’s rights have set an example that Morocco should follow. On August 15, 2017, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi promised to push forward an agenda in support of gender equality with his proposal to revoke imbalanced inheritance laws and allow Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men. Al-Azhar issued a statement on August 20 that indirectly criticized Essebsi’s attempts at reform and refused any alternative interpretation of the Islamic law, saying, “Islamic texts, including verses from the Holy Quran on inheritance, are fixed provisions.” However, Al-Azhar has not made any threats about removing Tunisia from a list of Islamic states;  in spite of its rich Islamic history, Al-Azhar does not have the authority to make such a decision, and furthermore, no such list actually exists.

On his Twitter account, Benatia shared a picture of the pair. Congratulating El Yamiq, Benatia wrote, “a new adventure [begins] for my brother Jawad El Yamiq. It is on you to well represent Morocco in Europe. I wish you the best.” Une nouvelle aventure pour mon frero #JawadElYamiq
C’est là que le plus dur commence…

Marrakech – Morocco has achieved 95% vaccination coverage, while the immunisation rate increases to 99% for some vaccines, said Minister of Health, Anas Doukkali, on Wednesday, in Marrakech. “Today, Morocco has introduced more than 13 vaccines including 12 vaccines dedicated to children under 5 and another vaccine for women to prevent neonatal tetanus,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the ceremony hosted by Princess Lalla Meryem, Chairperson of the National Observatory for Children Rights, to present the results of 30 years of action in serving child vaccination rights. The vaccination coverage of 95% is a high achievement considering the global coverage has remained at 86% for the past two years. Efforts are aimed this year at improving rates of vaccination against hepatitis B and to achieve a coverage rate of 99%, said Anas Doukkali. Morocco, who has eliminated tetanus, “will surely eliminate poliomyelitis and diphtheria,” the minister pointed out. “The Kingdom has managed to drastically reduce the number of people with multiple infectious diseases through immunization.” Thanks to the King Mohammed VI’s solicitude and the involvement of Lalla Meryem, Morocco is celebrating a 30-year implementation of the national immunisation program under the slogan “30 years in serving children vaccination rights.” Since the national immunisation program was institutionalised back in 1987, huge progress has been made in the health sector thanks to vaccines – mainly with poliomyelitis and diphtheria, given that no cases were reported since 1987 and 1991, respectively.

Rabat – In an apparent attempt to undermine Morocco’s stance over the Western Sahara conflict, Algeria’s pro-separatist Commissioner for Peace and Security Ismail Chergui  submitted a controversial report to the African Union (AU) at the 30th Summit of African Heads of State and Government asking the AU to urge Morocco to make certain decisions that would be detrimental to Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. Chergui, who has been a political instrument of the Polisario to advance positions adverse to Morocco’s and the United Nations’ position on Western Sahara, has submitted a report to the 30th Summit of African Heads of State and Government, asking the Pan-African bloc to put pressure on Morocco to accept the return of the AU mission for Western Sahara to the Moroccan Southern city of Laayoune, a demand that Morocco has strongly denounced, according to Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum. The report includes statements contradictory to the historical and current positions of the UN and Morocco and calls upon the AU to create a human rights monitoring mechanism in Morocco’s southern provinces. Akhbar Al Yaoum reported that while the written report was prepared by Chergui, the document was presented to the summit by Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi. The report reprises a request originally made by the United States in 2013 proposing a Security Council draft resolution that encouraged the establishment of human rights monitoring mechanisms in the Sahara. However, in the face of Morocco’s strong denouncement of the proposal, the UN Security Council rejected the US request. Chergui, whose attempts to undermine Morocco’s position before the AU were unsuccessful, also urged the AU to persuade Morocco no longer to host the Crans Montana Forum, currently held annually in Morocco’s southern city of Dakhla. The AU is not required to vote upon the report nor are AU heads of state required to observe the report submitted, according to African Status. The report further states that despite the numerous resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council, no resolution has ended the four-decade-long conflict over the region, according to Akhbar Al Yaoum. In advocating what is essentially a “separatist” position, Chergui accuses Morocco of freezing negotiations  to solve the conflict, and considering Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as “the only consensual resolution for the conflict.” The last paragraph, numbered 119 in the report, contains statements that are more controversial than earlier statements, according to Akhbar Al Yaoum. In paragraph 119, the Algerian separatist asks the AU to urge Morocco to accept direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario under the supervision of the AU and the UN. Morocco’s return to the AU last year is notable for several reasons including the fact that Morocco was voted onto AU’s Peace and Security Council on January 26.  At the end of the summit, Moussa Faki Mahamat, the Chairperson of the AU Commission, said that the AU’s July 2017 decision, known as decision 653, regarding the Western Sahara conflict is still valid. Through Decision 653, the AU demonstrates its commitment and support for the UN’s process to find a consensual and mutually acceptable resolution of the conflict. Edited By Elisabeth Myers

Rabat – On January 27, 2018, the 24th monthly dinner bringing together the American Jewish and Moroccan professionals of various backgrounds was held together in the beautiful home of one of the American Sephardi Federation’s board members, Jamil Ezra. Over delicious food, wonderful music, and while gazing at great art piece, we mingled freely and comfortably and discussed an assortment of topics, ranging assorted cultural pursuit, international and domestic US politics, and relationship building with other countries. At the center of it all, however, was the central question: where do we go from here? When my Moroccan co-organizer Simo Elassaoui first approached me about the idea about starting a social club for Jewish and Moroccan communities to come together once a month to network and build relationships over dinner, I jumped on it, and we started almost immediately. We have not missed a single months, though some dinners were significantly more populous than others. One of the highlights of this project was last year’s megadinner with King Mohammed VI’s Counselor, Andre Azoulay, who is Jewish. Also present at the event were the Jewish-Algerian singer Enrico Macias, who now resides in France, and Kuwaiti singer, actress, and  human rights activist Ema Shah, as well as Moroccan-born singer Neta Elkayam. The three performers united for a magnificent concert at the American Sephardi Federation’s Morocco-themed opening night of the ASF annual Sephardic Film Festival, celebrating its 20th anniversary. It was a spectacular success. That dinner was quite a surprise, because we were expecting approximately 40 people, but ended up with 68. We have dined in a variety of restaurants, in homes of some of the members, and in December 17, even celebrated the New Year early with our dinner at a Moroccan community event, complete with delicious Moroccan buffet, live music and singing, and very vivacious dancing. Acquaintances and networking gave rise to real friendships. And the monthly meetings became a lot more than just a way to explore new cultures or to find an outlet for off-the-record honest conversations that may not have been possible in more mixed settings. Eventually, we began to see that not only we were looking forward to seeing each other at these regular gatherings, but the sense of community was building up and becoming quite real – and perhaps the time came to do something more with what we had, to take it to the next level. Recently, we finally became a New York State not-for-profit organization, focused on social and educational activity. Now having a platform for organizing events on a bigger scale and under a name – Moroccan Americans in New York (or M.A.N.Y.), as well as a social media mechanism for promotion – a populous Facebook group under the same name, we could look towards doing more diverse and engaged social activities that would have wider reach towards both communities, as well as anyone else who cares to join. We had our first board meeting, and we are excited to proceed, working together to build something real, exciting, and lasting. It’s time to think past legacy and towards heritage. However, it has not always been smooth sailing, and challenges, likewise, lie ahead. Aside from the logistical issues of running an organization, for me personally bringing it new members of the Jewish community to these events has been a challenge.  There is a fair number of regular “clients,” who have attended multiple events, and for their friendship and support I am truly grateful. But New York is a busy place, the Jewish community is preoccupied with assorted social events, existing Jewish organizations, family lives, as well as, for the singles, the pressure to spend every free moment in the dating world. How do you make bridge building and intercultural exchanges a top priority for the New Yorkers who already live, work, and mingle in one of the most diverse cities n the planet? Initially, dealing with this issue was frustrating, and at times, I frankly was not sure whether our fledgling effort was going to last or whether it was even worth our while to continue trying in this format. You can only bring the horse to the water, but you cannot make it drink. But over time, we became invested in this monthly meeting, and I realized that I was doing it not because I owed it to anybody to come up with some imaginary perfect numbers, but because I genuinely enjoyed both the process and the outcome. We have created something that managed to survive two years – and that’s amidst all the distractions and challenges of New York, with participants growing, rather than losing interests, and potential new opportunities were opening up. With future diversity of events, there will be greater publicity, and perhaps more public interest. But the exclusivity of being one of the “original” founding members is not to be discounted. Recruitment, though a challenge, has never been an obstacle to an honest exchange of ideas that have caused me to think much more deeply about future possibilities of engagement for the communities, as well as, the United States and Morocco as a whole – and I was inspired, after a long break, to return to writing with a new sense of perspective, and more solid grasp of the issues. Far greater difficulty lies in having the “conversation” with the recalcitrant members of my community, which find my activity in this organization confusing, inexplicable, and of dubious value. Many people are simply suspicious of other people who are not like them; they are closed off to the extend that they are not even interested in having their assumptions shattered. The extent of distrust is deep; there is sometimes a sense of silent judgment. The defensive mindset present in a good portion of the community is in tension with the social requirement of appearing open-minded and multiculturalist. This results in New Yorkers sometimes surrounding with random people of very superficial value to their lives, for the sake of appearing the “right” kinds of friendship – while actually having very little in common, and even less interest in creating real bonds. The mistrust is not always open and straightforward. Sometimes it is exhibited in seeming excitement and interest in joining – yet the prospective participant never shows up, nor has any good explanation for never having the time to do so. Certainly they are missing out on a great time, and on having their internal questions answered, perhaps, but underneath it all lies the fear: what if I am right about all these people, and they will hate me? And what’s worse, what if I am completely wrong and have been wrong all my life? At the end of the day, there is the concern about disrupting one’s favorite paradigms, leaving one’s comfort zone, or the bubble. In New York, it is not the traditional kind of racism or any other kind of well known “isms” that is the biggest problem when bringing together different cultures. It is the tokenism that allows New Yorkers to feel so proud of themselves for how open-minded and tolerant they are, not in the way that is proud of their tolerance and defensive of others, but in a way that is proud of their pride and how good everyone else should think they are. Of course, that’s not to generalize – there are millions of New Yorkers of every imaginable background, and some communities are simply more insular than others, and over time and over generations that changes and everyone ends up hanging out with everyone else. Still, the bubble mentality is real. The favorite kind of person people who really like to stay in the bubble but want to pretend that they have left it for good is some group of people that they can consider a victim and adopt as a pet project. And here, I am going to be blunt – Moroccans, overall, simply do not fit anyone’s vision of anything of that sort. Individually, they are all very different people, of course, with different personalities, interests, ethics, and so forth – but the one thing they have in common, is that it’s not a passive group and not a passive culture. These are people who are highly professional, greatly engaged, life-loving and affirming, opinionated and robust. This is not a culture of whiners and complainers. Yellers, laughers, dancers, and ravers – maybe. Ok, more than maybe. Nor are these people who lack self-criticism or who do not engage in discussions of their culture, countries they live in, or every matter on the planet. Wherever there are Moroccans, there is vibrant debate, discussion, or even gossip of some sort going on. There is no passivity whatsoever. What attracts me so much to the very different people with a very strong sense of values, and a very expressive way of living is a big turn off to the bubble dwellers, who prefer to interact with easily predictable, passive people, who will demand endless attention for nothing more than their misfortunes in life and in exchange make their benefactors feel like heroes. That the bubble mentality has apparently infected the atmosphere in New York is unfortunate, but not irreversible. If you are ever in New  York and feel the firsts signs of it coming on – we can save you from that. The fact that we have lasted as long as we did and are not going away anywhere is a sign that what we have to offer, the world worlds and needs. Firm sense of values and identity coupled with the open mind towards others. Commitment to growth and to a creative drive. A sense of family and belonging; a home we create not only when we meet for dinners, but whenever any of us are together with other participants. Inquisitive mindset, zest for life, taste for good food, good music, and good fun, and a deep-seated, full-throated, unapologetic joy. We come together, not only every month now, but at various other social occasions, simply because we want to be there and we want to share these special experiences and good times with our friends. And that is what is ultimately all about… even if many people do not yet understand it, that sometimes it’s just about being with friends. Whoever they are, wherever they – as long as they bring warmth, openness, and good conversation to the table, they are welcome. So pull up a chair, get your plate ready for a heaping of delicious food, and come join us next month.

Rabat – The road projects launched as part of the “Al Hoceima Manarat Al Moutawassit” development program will help improve the region’s socio-economic conditions and road safety, said Minister of Equipment, Transport, Logistics and Water Abdelkader Amara during an appearance in Al Hoceima on Wednesday. The ongoing and new road projects will help improve the region’s socio-economic conditions, road safety and user services, facilitate access to the Mediterranean bypass and enhance the region’s tourism potential, Amara said. The minister made a field visit to survey the progress of the projects which were launched under the massive multi-sector development program for Al Hoceima. “These projects touch on the widening and strengthening of provincial road N° 5209 linking Ait Kamra and Al Hoceima by Izmouren over 13 km, of provincial road N° 5207 over 19.5 km between Bni Hdifa and M’rika, as well as of national road N° 8 between Targuist (RN2) and Bni Boufrah (RN16) over 24 km,” Amara said. The plan to widen and strengthen provincial road N° 5209, which will require 12 months of construction, has an overall budget of MAD 47 million. “This plan aims to facilitate and improve vehicle access via the western entrance of Al Hoceima and to upgrade services provided for road users. The expansion is especially important given that this road will eventually provide primary access to the grand Al Hoceima stadium now under construction, and also to the Ait Kamra industrial zone which is the region’s economic development hub,” he added. The minister explained further that widening and reinforcing national road N° 8, with a cost of MAD 105 million, also includes moving the existing public utility networks (drinking water and electricity), as well as additional environment-related work that will require an estimated 24 months to complete. Regarding the project to widen and strengthen provincial road N° 5207, “it requires a total budget of MAD 43 million, financed by the Agency for Northern Provinces Promotion and Development and will span 12 months,” said the minister. The Manarat Al Moutawassit regional development program for the Al Hoceima area is financed jointly by the Ministry and the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, and to which a total budget of MAD 6.5 billion has been allocated.

Rabat – Last Tuesday, Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat Senator, asked Scott Pruitt, Trump’s EPA (Environment Protection Agency) chief, if Morocco is a “shithole”. Scott Pruitt visited Morocco last year to promote the use of American natural gas, and Senator Duckworth was explicitly referring to that trip when she asked Mr. Pruitt: “Can I assume, like all decent Americans, you did not find Morocco, a North African nation, to be a shithole when you visited?” Mr. Pruitt however ignored the question. Earlier last month, Trump allegedly made the “shithole” comments during an immigration policy meeting with Democrats. Trump was reportedly talking about Africa and Haiti when he made the comments that many news outlets and commentators have since described as “derogatory” and “inconsiderate.” The shithole comment did not sit well with African leaders. Delegates at the AU summit late last month said the continent was “deeply alarmed” by Trump’s comments. The Panafrican organization, of which Morocco is now an integral member, asked Trump, in the aftermath of the outrage that his comments provoked, to respond and apologize. Although Trump did NOT issue an official apology, he sent a “friendship” letter to African heads of states gathering at AU’s summit late last month, saying that America values its relationships and shared goals with Africa, and that he “deeply respects” Africa and its people.”

Rabat – A report issued on January 29 by the US-based Foreign Affairs magazine, says that Morocco has secretly deported dozens of alleged representatives of the Gulen movement.  Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish businessman and cleric, was accused of leading a violent coup attempt against the Turkish government and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in July of 2016. Nate Schenkkan, author of the report, asserts that Turkey “has been hunting its opponents abroad, especially those who belong to the Gulen movement,” and that 15 countries, including Morocco, arrested or deported the alleged members who served as either financiers or school teachers. The list of other countries alleged to have been involved in arresting or deporting suspected members of the Gulen movement includes Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Georgia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Turkmenistan. The report claims also that many individuals appear to have been turned over to Turkey by Kazakhstan, Myanmar and Sudan without specific judicial proceedings. While it is unclear how exactly Turkey has been gathering information about these individuals, it is suspected that a special branch of the National Intelligence Organization that Turkey’s state news agency says was established to track down “high–value” Gulenists is involved. After the attempted coup, several countries including Morocco shut down schools associated with the movement, and in January 2017, investigations were carried out by government to investigate the motives of the school. Following this probe, Morocco’s ministry of interior said  in a statement that “investigations have revealed that the schools were spreading  ideologies and ideas of Gulen’s movement, which contradict the educational system and religious principles of Morocco.” The Moroccan government did not, however, officially release any statement regarding the deportation of the movement members. Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum contacted Idriss Bouanou, an expert in Turkish affairs who claimed that direct deportation did not happen. He reported that “[the only thing that happened is that the closure of the schools led the representatives of the movement to leave Morocco.]” He added that the Gulenists received information that the Turkish government would release arrest warrants for members of their organization. Bouanou added that Gulenists who entered Morocco at that time were largely either businessmen or scholars.  “[None of them have been proven to threaten Morocco’s national security, and therefore the state has no right to expel them without concrete justification.]” Foreign Affairs reported that Turkey had been exerting pressure on several governments to close Gulen schools, even before the failed coup. “[The government has been pressing other countries to shutter the schools. The Gambia closed its Gulen schools in April 2014. Turkey’s close ally Azerbaijan followed soon thereafter and Tajikistan shut down its Gulen schools in 2015.]” Other countries, however, did not force the closure of the Gulen schools until the attempted coup. According to the report, this group includes: Morocco, Libya, Somalia, Angola, Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Tanzania. Other countries, including Nigeria, Tunisia and Mali closed the schools up to a year afterwards. In August 2016, a Turkish delegation consisting of three deputies of the Turkish ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to Morocco to warn Moroccan authorities about the “danger” of the movement, and to expound upon the risks that Gulen’s movement posed to the interests of all nations.

Their death triggered a movement, mimicking the beginning of the Hirak movement. Relatives of the victims, friends, and sympathizers have taken to the streets of the city, along 20,000 other demonstrators to “protest against injustices: the lack of infrastructure, the neglect of the authorities, and the low prospects of safe economic activity in the region.” The protesters even adopted the slogans of the Hirak protest movement, which has stirred the neighboring Rif region Jerada, located about sixty kilometers from Oujda, capital of the Oriental region, is known for its large coal mines, which employed more than 9,000 miners up until their closure in late 1998.

Rabat – Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, reiterated on Wednesday in Brussels, the Moroccan government’s tireless efforts to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Jerusalem conflict. Having arrived in Brussels on January 31, Bourita took part in the Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Palestinian People Coordination (AD Hoc Liaison Committee). During the meeting, Bourita discussed the actions undertaken by Bail Mal Al Quds Agency, an affiliate of Al-Quds Committee chaired by King Mohammed VI. The Moroccan official underscored the importance and relevance of the meeting, “which enables us to discuss together the current situation in the Middle East in a frank, calm and responsible atmosphere, especially given the regional and international situation.” During the meeting, the minister also discussed the international community’s concern over American President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to transfer the American embassy to the city, emphasizing the historical importance of the city of Al Quds. “Hence this concern, shared of course, about the negative consequences that this decision could have on peace and stability in a region already undergoing big crisis,” Bourita added. The diplomat added that Trump’s decision would undermine peace negotiations between parties to the conflict, noting that this unilateral action “could turn the issue into a religious conflict and prejudice international efforts aimed at creating conditions conducive to the resumption of peace talks.” Trump’s decision was not only denounced by Morocco, but also by Arab and international leaders. Bourita said that the international community is convinced that Trump’s move will make peace talks impossible. “It could increase tension, jeopardize the chances of peace and boost violence and extremism,” said the official. He explained that this is why the international community needs a “clear, just and comprehensive approach to remedy this critical situation.” Bourita confirmed Morocco’s participation in the ministerial meeting on the Palestinian case to Maghreb Arab Press. Bourita said that the “Kingdom’s invitation to this meeting is an acknowledgment of the role played by King Mohammed VI as Chairman of the Al Quds Committee.” According to Bourita, Morocco’s participation is also an acknowledgment of the country’s commitment to promote peace in the Middle East and revive the peace process in the region. The meeting, according to the minister, is also an opportunity to discuss all the actions carried out by King Mohammed VI in response to Trump’s decision. Trump’s recognition of the holy city as the capital of Israel has sparked a backlash across the world. Arab leaders, including Morocco’s king, strongly denounced Trump’s move and urged him to reconsider his decision. Read Also: UN General Assembly Overwhelmingly Rejects Trump’s Move on Jerusalem On the eve of Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem, the King sent a message to US President Donald Trump and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressing his deep concern over the US decision. “The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all,” said King Mohammed VI. “The city is not only important for the parties to the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions,” read the King’s message to Trump. Standing firm on his decision, Trump responded to the king on January 20,  voicing his “gratitude for the leadership of the King at the League of the Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.” Trump has also affirmed that he  understands “the importance of the city of Jerusalem for the followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.”

Rabat – A twinning project on institutional reforms and the modernization the High Institute of Magistracy (ISM) was launched yesterday in Rabat in a ceremony that marked the attendance of the Minister of Justice, Mohamed Aujjar, as well as many other high-ranking Moroccan officials, and European diplomatic representatives. The project is a 24-month program that seeks to reinforce institutional cooperation between Morocco and its EU partners in the legal field and other justice-related issues. The program amounts to €1.2 million, financed by the EU, and entirely allocated to expertise exchange between Moroccan and EU public administration officials. The allocated funds are said to be managed by the ministry of finance, whereas the program itself will be managed by a consortium of 50 experts from France, Belgium, and Spain.  In line with the project’s ambition, which is to modernize and reform Morocco’s judiciary system, the consortium of European experts will exchange their expertise and legal experiences with their Moroccan counterparts. According to Aujjar, this twinning program is a result of the King’s professed desire to guarantee judiciary independence, and competence of legal authorities. The aim, according to the Ministry of justice, is to train Moroccan legal authorities according to European standards, therefore giving them the required qualification to build a “strong, professional, and independent judiciary system.” “This project is the culmination of a partnership between the Ministry of Justice and the High Institute of Magistracy, on the one hand, and the French Ministry of Justice, the Spanish General Council of Judiciary Power, and Belgium’s Federal Service, on the other hand. It will improve judicial mechanisms, while guaranteeing citizens’ rights and liberties”, Aujjar said. “Reforming the Judiciary is one of Morocco’s national priorities,” Aujjar further explained, as he underlined that Morocco’s judicial system has been experiencing great improvements in the recent years, especially after the 2011 constitutional reforms. Claudia Wiedey, UE’s Ambassador to Morocco, stressed, for her part, the improvements made in Morocco through a justice system that is “transparent and independent from the executive.” She praised Morocco’s efforts in building “an equitable and civil justice,” and explained that the twinning program is a vital means of strengthening cooperation between Morocco and its European partners. Around 70 judiciary-related missions and five research trips are scheduled as part of the program, a move, some officials explained, aimed at equipping the High Institute of Magistracy with solid trainings in communication and governance.
