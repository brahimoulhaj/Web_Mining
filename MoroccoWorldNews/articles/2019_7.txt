Rabat – US Secretary of Health  Alex Azar renewed his country’s determination to strengthen diplomatic relations with Morocco. On Tuesday, July 30,  the US official said that Morocco and the US share “very strong ties.” Azar extolled Morocco’s efforts in the fight against terrorism and extremism, emphasizing that the North African country is one of the main counterterrorism partners for the US. The official made his remarks on US-Morocco diplomatic relations during a reception held in Washington D.C for the 20th anniversary of the Throne Day, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The US is a staunch supporter of Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy.   In its 2018 Country Reports on Terrorism, the US  Department of State said that Morocco  has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” Morocco introduced a new security unit called the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) as part of its strategy to modernize its security system to fight radicalization and organized crime in the wake of the 2011 Marrakech terror attack. The US official also lauded Morocco’s UN peacekeeping operation. The promotion of stability in Africa, he said, “could not be achieved without more than 2,000 soldiers with whom Morocco has contributed to UN peacekeeping missions in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Southern Sudan.” In addition to security, the US and Morocco also aim to reinforce their trade activities with the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The US and Morocco signed the FTA on June 15, 2004. It came into effect on January 1, 2006. Azar emphasized the importance of the Free Trade Agreement between the two countries, saying that trade has increased by more than 300% since the FTA came into force in 2006. “There are more than 150 American companies currently active in Morocco, investing in energy, infrastructure, aviation, pharmaceuticals, and environmental technology,” he said.  Azar’s statement came after US pResident Donald Trump and his US Secretary of State addressed congratulatory messages to Morocco on Throne Day. In their messages, Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo both reiterated the US’ unwavering support for Morocco, emphasizing their willingness to reinforce cooperation with Morocco in several areas, including security. Despite the strong diplomatic relations between the two countries, the US is still waiting for its senate to approve Trump’s request to appoint David Fischer as his ambassador to Morocco.

Rabat – In the “complex” Wydad-EST dossier, the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) has delivered a partial verdict which annuls the rematch option between the two clubs. CAS announced, on July 13, that it would deliver a final verdict by today, July 31. The announcement elicited mixed reactions of uncertainty and hope within the immediate circles of the two clubs, Morocco’s Wydad and Tunisia’s Esperance Tunis. Both teams claim that they have been wronged and deserve to win this year’s African Champions League.  Instead, CAS’ verdict, even as it strongly overrules the previous rematch ruling made by CAF, the governing body of African football, has come with more doubts than answers. In its ruling, CAS is adamant that Wydad’s conclusions are wrong and that CAF’s call for rematch is “null and void.” But it does not say whether EST should be the winner, once again delaying the final answer which it said it would provide today.   After recounting the circumstances that led the two clubs to seek an intervention from CAS, the body explained, in a statement published earlier today, that the executive committee of the African Confederation of Football (CAF) does not have the legitimate authority to decide as it did on June 5— on a rematch of the second leg in neutral stadium. “The CAS team tasked with this issue has decided the CAF executive committee was not competent to rule for a rematch of the second leg of the final and has therefore decided to annul that decision,” CAS announced. Referring to both clubs’ opposition to a rematch, the statement added: “The two clubs’ conclusions have been partially admitted.” In their separate requests, both Wydad and EST claimed they should win the trophy. EST pointed out that it was winning 1-0 when the referee ended the match after tense disagreements over Wydad’s equalizer, which the referee had wrongfully ruled out for off side.  By contrast, Wydad, also claiming to be the legitimate winner, built its case around the fact that they had no prior knowledge of the defective state of the VAR system at the Rades Stadium.  On this point, CAS’ partial verdict sided with EST. “All other conclusions that WAC reached [except for its opposition on CAF’ rematch decision] have been definitely rejected, while those of EST will be taken into account in the final verdict.” As the statement went on to explain the “concrete” meaning of the decision, however, there came no clear answer to the question that everyone has been asking: Who will be champions if CAS rules out the rematch option? CAS’ answer was as confusing as its rejection of CAF’s rematch ruling was unmistakable.  “Concretely, it is now CAF’s competent bodies’ responsibility to decide on the incidents that occurred at the Rades Stadium on May 31, to take adequate disciplinary measures, or rule whether the second leg of the final should be played again,” the statement noted.  Having overruled CAF’s rematch decision because its executive committee lacked legitimacy to rule on the ETS-Wydad case, CAS is again asking “competent bodies” from the same CAF to decide on what should be next.  In the meantime, while CAF takes time to decide, “CAS will continue to deliberate” by taking into account EST’ requests and CAF’s final decision, the statement concluded.  The verdict leaves EST in a far comforting position than Wydad, but the confusion over CAF’s role—the fact that the final verdict will take CAF’s decision into account—means that this EST-Wydad saga is anything but over. If anything, a fierce power battle should be expected within CAF institutions in the coming weeks.

Rabat – Spanish police in Almeria, Spain detected an irregular migrant hiding in a suitcase inside a trunk of a vehicle, which landed for the Tijarafe Volcano ferry from Nador, eastern Morocco. During a check-in operation on July 30, police noticed the heavy suitcase, in which the woman was hidden. When they opened the suitcase to check, the police found the woman with “obvious symptoms of exhaustion and dehydration.” Spanish police called emergency medical services to assist the woman Police opened an investigation to determine the identity of the car’s driver and the person hiding in the suitcase according to Diario de Almeria. The Spanish news outlet said that so far this year police in Almeria have helped 98 people who were hidden between luggage or inside vehicles. This number includes stowaways on North African ships who jump into the sea during docking operations. This is not the first time the Spanish civil guard has discovered migrants hidden inside the car as a way to cross the border.  Spanish police found two underage sub-Saharan African migrants on December 30, 2018. In  May, police in Spain also found three migrants inside car dashboards and engines trying to sneak into Europe from the Morocco-Melilla border. In the same month, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) released data, showing that Mediterranean migrant arrivals have reached 19,830 in 2019. Though there has been a 30% decrease from the 28,325 Mediterranean arrivals during the first half of 2018, the IOM reports that the irregular immigration rate to Spain is 7,666. This statistic is not too different from the 8,150 irregular immigrants who arrived in Spain in the first 6 months of last year. Like Spain, Morocco has been also facing the pressure of irregular migration as the North African country has become a transit country for migrants who aim to cross its borders and reach the EU. Both Morocco and the EU discussed means to double efforts to curb irregular migration. In July, the Moroccan director of migration at the Ministry of Interior, Khalid Zerouali, said that Morocco’s security services thwarted more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since the beginning of 2019. He said that the number of foiled irregular migration attempts represents an increase of 25% from the same period of 2018.

Rabat – The National Fund of Social Welfare Organizations’ (CNOPS) held, on July 26, its sixth session on compulsory insurance for students. Following the session, the Fund affirmed in a press release that 114,000 students were registered in the Compulsory Basic Student Health Insurance Scheme during the academic year 2018-2019. Morocco’s healthcare currently The current health system, the Medical Assistance Plan (RAMED), and Compulsory Health Insurance (AMO) have been in place for seven years. However, they are in the process of being replaced by the Moroccan Health Insurance Fund (CMAM) in accordance with the Decree-Law 2-18-781. The CMAM is a single fund meant to replace all national insurance funds (including CNOPS). The CMAM will now be responsible for providing the basic AMO for employees, pensioners, and their beneficiaries in the public sector. Miloud Maasid, Chairman of CNOPS’ Board of Directors, noted the Fund’s “deep institutional development is ensuring the success of the transitional phase towards CMAM.” 114,000 insured students for the 2018-2019 academic year  In their press release, CNOPS noted that, in 2018-2019, all higher education institutions in the public sector (counting for 90% of students) are now involved in the Compulsory Basic Student Health Insurance Scheme. The insurance is open to students enrolled in an institution of higher education or vocational training, public or private, registered with CNOPS. Students are eligible if they are not already covered by AMO, RAMED, or a personal or parental private insurance. CNOPS also highlighted the increase in registration applications from 70,361 applications in 2017-2018 to 272,517 applications in the current academic year. After the National Health Insurance Agency conducted its inspections, 114,866 students were registered. The inspection showed that about 52,352 students are covered by AMO in the private sector and 26,124 students in the public sector, while 57,352 students are covered by RAMED. Therefore, they will not be covered by the Compulsory Basic Student Health Insurance Scheme. In light of these figures, the Board of Directors recommended the creation of a committee to facilitate registration procedures. The goal is to enable the integration of certain students, including RAMED beneficiaries, into the Compulsory Basic Student Health Insurance Scheme.

Rabat – A report published this month by the civil rights organization Muslim Advocates found that Muslims in US prisons are being denied basic religious freedoms, such as access to halal food and the right to pray. The report also found that Muslims are dramatically overrepresented in US prisons, accounting for about 9% of state prisoners. Muslims only represent 1% of the US population. “We don’t know for certain why there are so many, or why the numbers are growing,” said Yusuf Saei, the study’s main author. “Possible factors are the growth of the Muslim population in the U.S. generally, increased surveillance, harsher sentencing, and enforcement for Muslim communities, as well as conversions in prison.” To get these numbers, Muslim Advocates requested religious preference data from every state and based its report on the records it received from 34 states and Washington D.C. After getting a proper grasp of how many Muslims are in state prisons, the organization then analyzed discrimination complaints put forward by Muslims in prison and found that “numerous Muslim prisoners face obstacles to practicing their faith.” Many of these complaints stemmed from prisons refusing to comply with the dietary restrictions of Muslims, especially during Ramadan. Out of 163 cases of discrimination put forward by Muslim prisoners in the federal court and evaluated in the study, nearly 40% involved food. In one case, a prisoner alleged that the prison failed to provide him religious meals for four consecutive days during the month of Ramadan. Another alleged that he had
to submit 15 requests to receive halal meals, over a period of about nine months before, before the request was finally accepted. The frequency of discrimination cases against Muslims in prisons is likely much higher than cases brought to court, due to the difficulties prisoners face in filing a lawsuit. “To file such a lawsuit, a prisoner must pay fees and overcome other serious obstacles to litigating, including the inability to obtain legal representation, fear of retaliation, difficulty conducting legal research, and lack of materials for mailing,” said the report. The study found that another common complaint from Muslim prisoners is that requests to celebrate Eid al-Fitr are frequently denied, and work exemptions are not given. In Vermont and Alabama, policy says that “there are no work proscriptions required” for Muslims. “Considering that Christian holiday meals and festivity requests are routine or easily granted approval, these claims signal disparate treatment of Muslim prisoners,” said the report. The second most common complaint, accounting for 57 of the 163 cases, or 35%, regards obstacles to prayer and worship. The report referenced a case at one institution where Muslim inmates were banned from praying inside the chapel, even though other religious groups were permitted to do so. The Plaintiff in the case explained that this rule forced him and other Muslim inmates to pray outside in extreme weather conditions including cold, snow, and rain. In other cases, prisoners were banned from praying in the outdoor yard or prison dayroom and were sent to administrative segregation when they tried to do so. One prison even went as far as banning Muslims from praying in their own cells, the report says. Since an analysis of court cases can not provide an accurate picture of discrimination, for the aforementioned reasons, the third part of the study analyzed the policies in state prisons across the US regarding religious freedom. The report found dramatic inconsistencies from state to state, with “some providing an appropriate level of accommodation in their policies, and others seemingly ignoring or downplaying the basic religious needs of Muslim prisoners.” For example, while some states are fully accommodating of prayer, with seven state religious
handbooks recognizing the importance of group prayer in Muslim daily practice and
instruct that daily group prayer be allowed where possible, other states are much less accommodating. The study also found “numerous examples of restrictions on Muslim practice that are needless, excessive, and without any legitimate justification,” and are therefore in breach of federal law. Muslim Advocates cited several of these “restrictive, and at times ridiculous” laws in its report as examples. While 17 states are completely accommodating of religious headgear, most of the states have odd restrictions in their policy. One odd law, in Colorado, says head coverings are allowed outside of the cell, but only if they are covered with another head covering such as a stocking or baseball cap and are “not visible.” “These restrictions on head covering are arbitrary. As the Colorado policy shows, non-religious headgear is allowed outside of cells. A baseball cap brim surely obscures the face more so than most Muslim headgear, which is brimless and, with the exception of a face veil, leaves the face unobstructed,” the report points out. As well as pointing out the flaws in the current prison system with regards to the rights of Muslims, the report outlined what changes it recommends to rectify these issues. The suggestions include allowing Muslims to adjust their work hours during Ramadan, training guards on how to conduct respectful searches of religious property, and allowing head coverings throughout their facilities. Muslims Advocates also said that the growing Muslim representation in US prison “should be enough of an incentive to implement the suggestions nationally.” “As civil rights lawyers, our takeaway is that many state prisons are failing to respond to the needs of this significant population of Muslims,” said Saei, the study’s main author. “It is simply unreasonable for so many state prisons to deny these people basic necessities […] particularly when other prisons are already doing this with ease.”

The project will lay at more than 2,000  hectares connected to the railway and motorway networks. China’s collaboration with Morocco’s BMCE aims to deliver the $11 billion project in ten years. “Chinese public funding will be mobilized as part of the One Belt, One Road Initiative,” said Benjelloun.  China announced its Belt and Road global development strategy in 2013. The strategy established the Maritime Silk Road, a trade sea route connecting China to Europe through Africa.  In February,  Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah said that Morocco is becoming a partnership hub as a link between China and the rest of Africa due to major reforms and partnerships under Morocco’s Africa policy.

Rabat – The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez seized the occasion of Morocco’s Throne Day, marking the 20th anniversary of King Mohammed VI’s accession to the throne, to praise Morocco’s notable progress.  The Prime Minister also took the opportunity to emphasize Spain’s strong relationship with Morocco. Spain considers Morocco an important partner with whom further collaborations are on the horizon. Sanchez spoke proudly of Spain’s relationship with Morocco in a memo published on the website of Spanish newspaper El Pais. “Morocco is today one of the most important partners in Spain. The close relationship that unites us is articulated around a dense network of shared interests to which my Government has devoted priority attention in the last year,’’ Sanchez underlined. Sanchez has been to Morocco twice, once in November 2018 on an official visit and then on the occasion of the United Nations Conference on Migration. The conference took place on December 10-11 in Marrakech.  He further declared that his government will support Morocco in the European Union. Spain has been pressing the EU to financially assist Morocco in its ongoing battle with irregular migration.  The European country has also strengthened surveillance in the two Spanish exclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, and also carrying out sea surveillance operations to abort migration attempts. “‘We will support Morocco in its relations with the European Union and project the dynamism of the economic, social and cultural exchanges of our societies in all areas.’’  Spain and Morocco also have a budding partnership in the field of counterterrorism. Morocco is lately emerging as a global leader in the fight against the ongoing threat of extremism and terrorism. “Our cooperation on migration and counterterrorism is a model example in the European environment. Its foundation is well-established trust, mutual respect, and permanent communication,’’ Sanchez highlighted. The Spanish president recognized Moroccan authorities’ efforts in facing one of the European Union’s major challenges, irregular migration. “As a result of this work, during the first half of this year, the number of irregular entries has been reduced by 33%. The number of entries has been reduced for the first time since 2013,” said the president. On the list of Spain’s ongoing efforts in support of its North African neighbour, is ‘’the active involvement of Spain in the negotiation and subsequent approval of the Agricultural Agreement and the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Morocco.’’ In terms of economics, elaborated the president, Spanish investments are the largest in the African continent, constituting 15% of Morocco’s GDP. Sanchez also announced that Spain plans to further consolidate its cooperation with Morocco through investment in the energy sector. “One of our priorities for the coming months will be to complete the development of a third electrical interconnection between the two countries, to achieve greater security of supply.’’ Sanchez explained that Spain’s greater interest in Morocco is due to the two countries’ mutual background in terms of human and cultural links. Moroccans’ presence in Spain is numbered at 1,000,000 people. This mass presence requires maintaining a strong relationship with their native country. ‘’This reality demands a special and constant effort to favor the spaces of communication and rapprochement between our cultures and our communities.’’ Sanchez concluded his note by committing to further develop an equitable and dynamic relationship in a way to satisfy the aspirations of both peoples. “Our neighborhood is today more than ever an opportunity and a challenge to develop an equitable and dynamic relationship that satisfies the legitimate aspirations of our peoples. This is the commitment I assume with ambition and conviction on this anniversary.’’

Rabat – Tomorrow, July 31, the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) will deliver its final verdict on the ongoing stand-off between Morocco’s Wydad of Casablanca (WAC) and Tunisia’s Esperance of Tunis (EST).  With the case being described as “the first of its kind,” CAS’s ruling in the WAC-EST case is set to create a precedent in the history of sports arbitration, regardless of which side wins the legal, off-the-ground battle.   The two clubs played a two-leg African Champions League final in late May. They played first in Rabat on May 24, and then in Rades, a suburb of Tunis, on May 31. Both games were riddled with incidents of controversial refereeing.  The standout act of the controversy-soaked debacle came in the second leg, when the referee ended the game after a mere ten minutes in the second half. What followed was much messier.  Faced with what they now call a very delicate, multifaceted case, the legal teams representing both clubs have unanimously insisted on the issue being “a very complex one,” even as each of the legal teams as prays that CAS’ verdict will be in its favor. Speaking yesterday to Moroccan sports channel Arryadia TV after long hours hearing that saw the two legal teams of try to argue their case or question the credibility of their opponent’s, representatives of both sides expressed perplexity, uncertainty, and hope.  “This is a very complex case,” said Despina Mavromati, a Greek defense attorney for EST, when asked about her side’s odds of winning. Such is the complexity of the “this scandal,” she went to add, that both in terms of content and procedure, the verdict is bound to be unpredictable. There has never been a similar case before, Mavromati recalled. “The case is the first of its kind,” Tarik Mossadek, a Moroccan lawyer on Wydad’s defense team, said. Echoing Mavromati’s perplexity as to what to expect from CAS’s verdict, he added that “the case is very complicated.” The Moroccan attorney hopes, however, that Wydad wins the case. He said he is “optimistic.” For his part, Rida Touiti, the EST’s legal affairs chief, tried to downplay the tense emotions surrounding the whole thing.  He played down the gravity of the growing enmity, saying that Wydad and EST “know each other well” and intend to keep their relations warm, regardless of the verdict. He insisted there was “a good atmosphere” during yesterday’s hearing. “I would like to tell our Moroccan friends that this is not a war,” Touiti said. The Tunisian official’s peace and fraternity offer may have been sincere. But so much has happened between the two teams in the weeks since their two memorably scandalous matches that “good atmosphere” comes nowhere close to describing the state of affairs as they await CAS’ final decision. When it announced two weeks ago that it would settle the issue by the end of this month, CAS clearly noted that neither of the clubs wanted a rematch, as previously ruled by CAF, the ruling body of African football.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI‘s yesterday’s Throne Day is perhaps the clearest indication in recent months of how drawn he is to questions of social inclusiveness, civic responsibility, and effective government.  It was an occasion to celebrate, to dwell on what has been great in his two decades of leadership, and perhaps mention—just fleetingly, though—that some challenges are yet to be met. But the King begged to differ.  He nuanced, assessed, and ruthlessly evaluated what has gone wrong. “The past years have revealed the inability of our development model to meet the urgent needs of some of our fellow citizens, to reduce social inequalities and spatial disparities.” Deviating from the usual, expected bravado of most political speeches, the King highlighted the multiple, yet to be addressed challenges ahead. The language was analytic, nuanced, and matter-of-fact.  Its driving spirit seemed to be: We know what we have done so far, and we are proud for doing it, for making it possible. But we shouldn’t get too ecstatic, too ahead of ourselves. If only because there is still too much to do.  Seldom does a commemorative speech sound this burdened,  exclusively focusing on what could have been, what can still be done to right the wrongs, and only intermittently mentioning what has actually been achieved. Both in its overt pronouncements and its unarticulated, murmured suggestions, King Mohammed VI’s twentieth Throne Day speech consistently played down most of the much-lauded progress made Morocco has made in recent years. It zoomed in on “completing the ongoing reforms” and “correcting the shortcomings.” At some point, though, the monarch did succumb to the need, or necessity of speaking of what has actually been done. But, quickly putting that in perspective, he went back to his initial message, repeatedly hammering home the point that no material progress is enough as long as it does not trickle down to as many Moroccans as possible, especially those from low-income backgrounds in dire need of “working,” “harmonious” policies from the governing class. “We have taken a qualitative leap in terms of infrastructure: highways, high speed train, big ports, renewable energy, and urban rehabilitation. We have also made significant progress in reinforcing and consolidating rights and freedoms, in giving a healthy and solid footing to our practice of democracy,” he said. But this was also quickly followed by a longer litany of we-still-have-so-much-work-to-do remarks. By all evidence, forcefully hammered or thinly suggested throughout the speech, the talking points pointed to a King who seemed intent on using the loaded symbolism of two decades of reign to tell Moroccans that he has listened to their complaints, that he understands why some of them are still frustrated, unconvinced by a string of development projects and impressive investments that do not seem to benefit them.  “We know that developing infrastructure is not enough, no matter how important that may be.” As he acknowledged the structural shortcomings in policy choices and the glaring social disparities that have not been adequately dealt with in 20 years, the King insisted on “clarity” and “objectivity” as “civic duties” for the country’s ruling class. It is his and the government’s “duty,” he offered, to be clear about the direction in which they want the country to sail, but also “objective” in assessing their own actions and policies as leaders entrusted with the “sacred responsibility” to “serve Moroccans.” For the Moroccan King, the persistence of challenges such as youth unemployment, social disparities, corruption, and inefficient public administration, among others, is fundamentally due to what he sees as an outdated development model.  As such, new “harmonious and effective” plans are urgently needed to put the country back on track. But the point of such actions should not be radical rupture from the past. Instead, according to the King, the goal is to “pump fresh blood” in the development model by stressing “audacity” “entrepreneurial spirit,” and a “heightened sense of responsibility” as the pillars of the new plan.  But this constructive criticism of Morocco’s two-decade-long journey would have been incomplete without the mention of the recurring theme among Morocco specialists: self-entitled politicians. “Our ultimate goal is to propel Morocco among advanced nations,” the King said, allusively disapproving of those in power or politics “who serve their own interests rather than those of the Moroccan people.” Overall, the speech was a working combination of concession, exhortation, and promise.  The King conceded that his twenty years of reign have not been all roses, that many Moroccans have been left behind, or let down; he exhorted the government to “prepare a new generation of coherent… harmonious plans;” he promised to inject “fresh blood” into public service as well as a new specialized committee to supervise and evaluate the implementation of the new development model. “Over the years, we have not always done as we wished. But today we are determined to stay on course, capitalize on our achievements, complete the ongoing dynamics of reforms, and address the shortcomings,” he said.

Rabat – Judicial police in Marrakech arrested on Tuesday, July 30, a French national. The suspect was the subject of an international arrest warrant from France. The French national is wanted  for his involvement in an attempted murder with a firearm, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The incident dates back to April 20 2019. Police arrested the suspect in an apartment he had rented in Marrakech. Preliminary investigations show that the suspect was in possession of false identification papers. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation pending the extradition procedure. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to strengthen international security corporations against organized crime. This is not the first arrest that Moroccan security services made based on international arrest warrants. In April Moroccan police in Essaouira also arrested a French national for links to an international drug trafficking network. French authorities  issued an international arrest warrant against the suspect in 2017. On July 20,  Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) arrested a Moroccan holder of a French nationality suspected of involvement in extremism and criminal activities in France. On October 31, 2018 French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian emphasized the importance of Moroccan-French security cooperation. The French official said that security cooperation between the two countries “is essential to respond to the threat posed by the return of foreign fighters from the Syrian-Iraqi conflicts.” He also emphasized that Morocco and France must respond to the pressures of terrorism and migratory issues in a “spirit of firmness, responsibility and humanity.”

Rabat – Casa Aménagement, the local development firm that handles the Casablanca-Settat region, has announced plans to renovate the city’s historic central market.   The aim of the renovation, is to turn the market into a gourmet food hub. The renovated market is set to meet international standards to maximize its potential as a tourist attraction.  The project has an expected budget of  MAD 15 million, with eight million coming from the Ministry of the Interior, and a further MAD 7 million coming from the Casablanca-Settat regional council.  The plan is still currently in the conception stage, as Casa Aménagement has just launched a call for bids in order to find a consulting firm that will assess the premises and determine specific project guidelines.  The Art Déco style Central Market,  designed by french architect Pierre Bousquet, has been an important city landmark for both locals and tourists since its construction a century ago in  1919. The building has, however, been neglected for a major part of its history; Renovations were undertaken for the first time in 2005 and then for a second  in 2012. The Market, nonetheless, still bears structural damage which the planned renovation aims to address.  Previously, Casa Aménagement has worked on renovating the Ain Diab waterfront and the Arab League Park.  It is now completing construction on the Casablanca Grand Theatre, set to finish in September, and wrapping up renovations on  the Mohammed V sports complex, to be completed in August.

Rabat –  Clashes between gang members at the prison of Altamira in Para state, Brazil resulted in the death of 57 detainees. Sixteen of the victims were decapitated in the riot, which took place on Monday, July 29. Other victims suffocated due to a fire in the prison buildings. The fire broke due to clashes between organized crime groups. Al Jazeera reported that clashes started at 7 a.m. on Monday between the “Janeiro-based Comando Vermelho and a local criminal group known as Comando Classe A.” The Para state government said in a statement that members of the Commando Class set a fire in a cell, targeting members of the Comando Vermelho. Chief of the prison Jarbas Vasconcelos described the attack as targeted. “The aim was to show that it was a settling of accounts between the two groups, not a protest or rebellion against the prison system.” Prison authorities also said that knives have been used during the attacks. Videos showing smoke rising from the prison have gone viral. This is not the first time Brazil has experienced such a riot in prison. According to CBC News, 55 prisoners died in similar riots in May across the prisons of Amazonas in northwestern Brazil. “In early 2017, more than 120 inmates died in prisons across several northern states when rival gangs clashed over control of drug-trafficking routes in the region. The violence lasted several weeks, spreading to various states, added CBC News.

By Binwei Yu Rabat – A book donation and book signing event for Chinese writer Yang Peng’s children’s book was held at Les Etoiles Bookstore in Rabat on July 20. The event was opened with a speech from Yang Peng about his view on children’s imagination and reading habits. He stressed the importance of imagination for children and said the way to preserve and develop the imagination is to read more.  Yang Peng’s intriguing account was followed by a speech by the brains behind the event, his 15-year-old daughter Yang Yuchen. Her coherent and moving speech revealed her personal and sentimental interpretation of the meanings of her father’s books, as well as her passion for reading. “A good book is a paradise because, in a book, there is no limitation to one’s imagination. It takes you to a wonderland where you can break free from the bondage of reality and look at things from a different perspective,” said Yang Yuchen as her eyes sparkling. Impressed and inspired by Yuchen’s speech, the Moroccan children at the event bombarded her with questions, including about her writing experiences and her future career plans. Yang Yuchen donated 300 copies of books, written by Yang Peng and translated into French and Arabic, to Moroccan children. The donation included 130 copies to Les Savant Fous and 170 copies to Association Ibtassim as well as participants of the book event. The books include My Dad in A Pocket series and Mickey Mouse Kung Fu.  Yang Peng is an award-winning children’s book writer in China. He won the Best Works Award (五个一工程奖), one of the most prestigious literature and arts awards in China, three times, in 1997, 2000 and 2002. He was also the first Chinese writer to sign a publishing contract with Disney. He has published more than 100 books, and 10,000,000 copies of his books have been sold.  Yang Peng’s daughter Yang Yuchen is a 15-year-old high school student in New Jersey, USA. She manages a WeChat public account to promote English learning and AI knowledge in China, as well as to fundraise for book donations to Asia and Africa. This charitable and cross-cultural event not only offered Moroccan children options to widen their reading but also brought Chinese culture into Morocco. For example, part of the donation, Mickey Mouse Kung Fu, will expose children to traditional Chinese cultural elements, such as Buddhism, Taoism, and metaphysics, to bring Chinese stories and historical figures to live to readers.   The literary and cultural exchange will help Moroccan readers to learn more about Chinese culture, especially the younger generation.

Rabat – A group of Sahrawis renewed their emergency call for the Polisario Front to disclose the fate of Ahmed El Khalil Ould Braih, a leading Polisario member who went missing almost ten years ago. On July 29, tens of Sahrawis  staged a protest to condemn the disappearance of El Khalil, who was arrested and kidnapped by Algerian forces and Polisario in 2009. The protest took place in front of the high commission for refugees in Rabouni, Algeria. El Khalil’s arrest came just a few weeks after the Polisario Front  had appointed him to monitor human rights in the Tindouf camps. The forced disappearance, so soon after his appointment, raised further questions over human rights violations in the camps. Protesters on Monday held banners and chanted slogans, emphasizing that “there is no alternative for the Polisario Front other than El Khalil’s freedom.”   The protesters asserted that they will accept no excuses from the front. The banners held by protesters read: “where is El Khalil,” “we are all El Khalil,” and “no to forced disappearance.” The Polisario Front has made a series of unfulfilled promised to El Khalil’s family and supporters. The vows to reveal the fate of El Khalil remain unfulfilled. In response to Polisario’s refusal to enter a dialogue or reveal the whereabouts of their missing relative, the family of El Khalil have been staging a sit-in front of the refugees commission for 16 days. The extreme temperature in the deserted area led to the collapse of one of the El Khalil’s on Saturday, July 27. A source told Morocco World News that Polisario refused to dispatch an ambulance for El Kahlil to take him to the hospital when he fainted. El Khalil’s case is not the only pressure the Polisario Front is facing. Recently, human rights NGOs, including Human Rights Watch, have issued warning statements to the separatist group, urging it to release opposition activists, who are under arbitrary arrest.  In June, the Polisario Front arrested three activists for their participation in protests to condemn human rights violations in the camps. Two of the activists have been on hunger strike, with one of them refusing to drink water. The families of the activists also condemned Polisario’s unlawful detention of the activists.   The families of the detained activists said  in a statement last week that they were “surprised” to know that gendarmerie members were attending hearings. The families condemned the gendarmerie’s presence, which constitutes a violation of the law, as they are not a party to the case.

Rabat – Germany has introduced new regulations for international students wishing to pursue higher education in the European country. The enrollment fees for international students will now increase to €10,236 in order to obtain a student visa. The German Federal Foreign Office (the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs) has increased the sum from €8,640 to €10,236, up by 20%. In order to fulfill the new visa requirements, international students must prove that they have the total sum, which must be blocked in a German bank. The new total amount is calculated to cover students living expenses for one year. It is used to assure authorities that students have the financial capacity to live in Germany. Under the current system, once the potential students have the required annual amount in a blocked German bank account they can withdraw a set sum per month to cover expenses. The increased sum of €10,236 will come into effect starting from January 2020. But from September 1, the sum to be withdrawn each month will be raised from €720 to €853. “Once in Germany, students can then withdraw a certain amount of money each month, although this amount is currently €720, it will increase to €853 from 1 September this year.” The ministry in charge stated that the blocked funds can not be withdrawn and are only a guarantee that students have enough cash to cover their expenses. Among the banks offering the possibility to block cash are Fintiba-Sutor Bank and Deutsche Bank. On November 20, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced an increase in enrollment fees for international students in France. From September 2019, international students taking bachelors degrees enrolled for the increased fee of €2770, instead of €170.  In the 2019-2020 academic year, Master’s and PhD students paid €3,770 instead of €234 and €383 respectively.

Rabat  – The Moroccan Center of Conjuncture (CMC) [Centre Marocain de Conjoncutre]  said in its monthly report that Morocco’s economic performance appears to be “very promising compared to the weak results recorded” in 2019. The CMC said that national economic growth is expected to reach 4.6% in 2020. Despite the forecasts, the CMC also commented on the challenges facing Morocco’s economy, including household debt. Earlier this month, Morocco’s central bank,Bank Al-Maghrib released a report, showing that household debt has increased by 6.1%, to MAD 42,500 per household. CMC cited the index of household confidence (ICM) from the High Commissioner for Planning  (HCP), saying that the index is calculated using a specific technique. The process takes into account the concomitant evolution of several aspects, such as the previous and future standard of living in Morocco, personal financial situation, and unemployment. ICM dropped to 74.9 points compared to 79.1 points recorded in the previous quarter, and 87.3 points recorded a year earlier.  HCP said that 46.2% of households reported a decline in living standards over the last 12 months. The commission added that 32.9% reported that the standards maintained the same level, while 20.8% noticed an improvement. CMC said that household confidence deteriorated between the first quarter of 2018 and Q1-2019. The report also indicates that bank loans reached MAD 872 billion at the end of May, representing an increase of 4.4% year-on-year. “This increase is significantly higher than that recorded a year earlier where it has barely exceeded 2.6%,” said the report. HCP shared statistics showing Moroccans’ inability to save money saving due to the rising living costs. According to HCP, Only 16.7% of households expect to save money in the next 12 months. Debt repayment requirements can place further pressure on household finances, and contribute to pessimism on saving abilities. On the eve of Throne Day, the governor of Morocco’s Bank Al Maghrib  said that Morocco’s economic performance in 2018 was weak and failed to meet expectations of  citizens. He acknowledged that Morocco experiences challenges due to unemployment and the slow recovery of non agricultural sectors. Jouahri warned that without concrete actions, Morocco will not get back on its track of higher growth. The expert said that urgent reforms are needed with “greater efficiency and performance” to overcome the crisis. “Genuine action is needed from all vital forces of the country, who are called upon to move beyond the narrow personal and partisan considerations and come together for the interest of the country and its citizens,” Jouahri concluded.

Rabat – In his speech on the eve of Throne Day, King Mohammed VI renewed his call  for dialogue with Algeria in the hopes of breaking the stalemate currently hindering the Maghreb unity project. The monarch said that Morocco has reaffirmed its sincere commitment to the “policy of the outstretched hand towards our Algerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds rooted in brotherhood, religion, language and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the peoples of the two sister nations.” The King then echoed the statement of friendship he made on November 6, 2018 during the 43rd  anniversary of the Green March.  During his Green March speech, the King  invited Algeria to join a “frank” and a “direct dialogue,” to break the political stalemate between Rabat and Algiers, to restore full diplomatic ties, and to reopen the borders between the two countries. Despite the offer for talks, Algeria continues to oppose Morocco and question its territorial integrity by supporting and financing the Polisario Front. Although there has been no official response from Algeria, the King renewed his call to end the frozen diplomatic relations. On this subject, the King recalled how Moroccans celebrated  Algeria’s 2019 African Cup of Nations victory. He said Morocco’s commitment was shown through “the sincere and spontaneous manifestations of friendliness and support expressed by Morocco – its King and its people – for the Algerian national football team at the African Cup of Nations held in our sister country, Egypt. Moroccans shared in the Algerian people’s joy and pride when their national team deservedly won the Cup. It was as if Morocco had won, too.” After Algeria’s win, King Mohammed VI addressed a message to congratulate Algeria and its people over the victory. “Because of this awareness and of the belief that ours is a common destiny and that we share the same historical and cultural heritage, we are optimistic and hopeful that we can work for the fulfilment of Maghreb people’’ aspirations for unity, complementarity and integration.”  King Mohammed also called for unity across the Maghreb region, in the interests of its people.

Rabat – In his speech to the nation commemorating his 20th year in power, the King addressed a central issue for Morocco; Western Sahara.   King Mohammed  VI took the opportunity to reaffirm Morocco’s unwavering position on the question of its territorial integrity. Morocco will accept no solution that throws doubt over its sovereignty in Western Sahara. He said, “the celebration of the glorious Throne Day is a most fitting occasion to reiterate our unwavering commitment to the Moroccanness of the Sahara, to our national unity and territorial integrity, and to full sovereignty over every inch of the Kingdom’s territory.” On the same subject, the King expressed satisfaction with Morocco’s achievements at the international level. He cited its partnerships and dialogues with the United Nations, the European Union, and the African Union. In his speech, King Mohammed recalled that the United Nations, the only legitimate body responsible to find a political solution to the conflict, has acknowledged Morocco’s commitment towards finding a pragmatic and fair settlement to the conflict. The UN Security Council has repeatedly drawn attention to Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, submitted to the UN in 2007. The council has acknowledged the viability of the initiative as a political solution to the conflict.  The Autonomy Plan is part of Morocco’s ongoing plan, to build a democratic and modern society based on the rule of law, individual, collective, and economic freedoms, as well as social development in the region. In his speech, the King also highlighted to Morocco’s partnerships with the European Union and the African Union. This year, Morocco and the EU agreed to strengthen their partnership by renewing their fisheries deal despite maneuvers from the Polisario front to sabotage the accord. The King also commented on Morocco’s Pan-African gaze. The country’s return to the African Union has helped it  to quell any claims which question Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. Morocco’s return to the AU bolstered the deflection of  hostile moves and limited the AU’s involvement in the conflict.  King Mohammed VI said that his country “maintains its sincere adherence to the political process conducted under the exclusive auspices of the United Nations.” He also added that Morocco’s position is clear “in terms of its fundamental convictions: the way to achieve the desired settlement can be none other than through Moroccan full sovereignty and within the framework of the autonomy initiative.”

Rabat – Morocco’s development plans were among the core issues highlighted in King Mohammed VI’s Throne Day speech. The annual speech aired on the evening of July 29.  The King first focused on Morocco’s achievements over the past year. He affirmed that Morocco “made a quantum leap in infrastructure development, whether it is highway construction, the high-speed railway, major ports, renewable energy facilities, or urban development and revamping.” The King also highlighted Morocco’s advances in consolidating rights and freedoms, stressing its importance “for a strong and healthy anchoring of democratic practice.” Nevertheless, the King pointed out that infrastructure and institutional reforms, important as they are, are not enough. Therefore, the King attached “particular importance to human development programs, social policies, and the need to respond to Moroccans’ pressing concerns.” The speech echoed a previous call in October 2017 when the King gave the opening speech of the autumn parliamentary session. He called for the adoption of a new model of development, “balanced and equitable, guaranteeing the dignity of all, generator of income and employment.” This evening, he once again called for the re-evaluation and updating of the model. He said that it has been unable to meet the growing needs of citizens, and emphasized the need to reduce social inequalities. Special development model commission King Mohammed further expressed reservations about the creation of “ad-hoc” non-governmental commissions. He explained that “for some, this is the surest way to evade problems and walk away from them.” However, the King has created some commissions to which he entrusted the examination of issues such as regionalization, the Constitution, and the Family Code. Similarly, He announced the decision to set up a special commission in charge of the development model. The commission will be established at the beginning of the next school year. The commission will be neither a second government nor a parallel official institution. It is an advisory body with a specific time-bound mission. It is expected to improve sectors such as education, health, agriculture, investment, and the tax system. The king expects the commission to fulfill its mandate impartially and objectively by providing an exact statement of the state of affairs, “as painful as it may be.” The commission will also be expected to deliver bold and insightful solutions. Morocco will enter “a new phase, whose distinguishing features will be responsibility and the pursuit of a comprehensive take-off,” said the King.

The Ministry of Justice issued a statement on July 29 to announce the royal pardons granted in the event of the King Mohammed’s 20th Throne Day. The statement said that 4,764 detainees benefited from the royal pardon. The royal pardon, according to the statement, included a number of detainees jailed for their participation in unauthorized demonstrations in the Al Hoceima protests (2016-2017).  The ministry did not reveal the exact number of activists who benefited from the royal pardon. The pardon also includes some prisoners convicted of terrorism. The released prisoners convicted for terror crimes were part of the fourth annual Reconciliation (Moussalaha) program. Morocco launched the reconciliation program in 2018. The program aims to reintegrate prisoners into society. Morocco’s government has eminent trust in the reconciliation program. King Mohammed VI has offered the royal pardon to numerous defendants convicted of terror-related crimes who applied to join the program. The royal pardon reduced prison sentences for 2,477 prisoners. The royal decree also commuted the death penalty sentences to life imprisonment for 31 detainees. One hundred prisoners have been excused fines, while two people benefited from royal pardon with exemption from prison and fines.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI delivered his speech on the 20th anniversary of the monarch’s accession to the throne. Here follows the full text of the royal speech: “Praise be to God, May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, His Kith and Kin Dear Citizens, Twenty years have elapsed since Almighty God entrusted me with the sacred duty of leading the nation. It is a position of immense trust and a heavy responsibility. I made a solemn commitment to you and to the Almighty to work earnestly so as to live up to that trust. As God is my witness, I have not – and I shall not – spare any effort to serve your best interests and your just causes. God knows that I have made serving you and the nation my main concern, so that all Moroccans, wherever they may be, can lead a free, dignified life on an equal footing. I give thanks to Almighty God for bestowing upon us the blessings of unity, cohesion and the mutual Bei’a between the Throne and the people, in addition to the bonds of reciprocal affection and loyalty between the King and the citizens, which have become stronger and deeper over the years. I also give praise and thanks to God for the Moroccan people’s consensus on the nation’s immutable, sacred values and its major policy choices. Firstly, there is the national, citizen-based monarchy, which is grounded in closeness to the citizens and which takes to heart their concerns as much as their aspirations, and seeks to respond to them. Secondly, there is the democracy and development-based policy, which I have been implementing resolutely and confidently. Thirdly, there are the sweeping reforms we introduced, the reconciliations achieved and the major projects implemented. Thanks to these accomplishments, we have managed, by the grace of the Almighty, to press ahead with the process of building modern Morocco and to overcome the difficulties faced. Praise be to Almighty God for helping me carry out initiatives and actions successfully to serve you and the nation. It is a fact that, at times, we did not accomplish all that we were hoping to achieve. Today, our resolve is greater than ever to press ahead with our efforts, to build on our achievements, to continue the reform process and to address the shortcomings revealed by past experience. Dear Citizens, We have made a quantum leap in infrastructure development, whether it is highway construction, the high-speed railway, major ports, renewable energy facilities or urban development and revamping. We have also made undeniable progress in promoting rights and freedoms and consolidating sound democratic practice. Nevertheless, I realize that, though important, infrastructure development and institutional reforms are not enough on their own. Let me say this clearly and frankly: what undermines this positive result is that the effects of the progress and the achievements made has not, unfortunately, been felt by all segments of the Moroccan society. Indeed, some citizens may not directly feel their positive impact on their living conditions, or in terms of helping them meet their daily needs, especially in the areas of basic social services, the reduction of social disparities and the consolidation of the middle class. God knows how much I suffer personally when a fraction of the Moroccan people – even if it were just one per cent of the Moroccan population – endures hardships and lives in poverty. For this reason, I have attached particular importance to human development programs, social policies and the need to respond to Moroccans’ pressing concerns. As I said in last year’s address, there will be no peace of mind for me so long as we have not properly tackled the hurdles faced and found the right solutions to development and social issues. This, however, cannot be achieved without a comprehensive vision, without qualified human resources or without meeting the conditions required to carry out planned projects. Dear Citizens, In recent years, our development model has proven to be inadequate in terms of helping us meet the growing needs of a segment of the population, reduce social inequalities and tackle regional disparities. For this reason, I have called for revisiting that model and updating it. To be honest, I personally do not like setting up ad-hoc committees to tackle issues; for some, this is the surest way to evade problems and walk away from them. However, I did resort, in the past, to setting up committees to tackle some key national issues, such as regionalization, the amendment of the Constitution, family law and the Justice and Reconciliation Commission. I was keen to ensure close follow-up to their work, and the results achieved were positive and constructive. I have therefore decided to set up an ad-hoc committee for the development model. God willing, I will inaugurate that committee in the autumn. As regards membership, I have seen to it that the committee includes representatives from various fields of knowledge and intellectual currents, including prominent Moroccans from the public and the private sectors who meet the requirements of competence and impartiality, who are able to feel the pulse of society, who understand its expectations and who have the nation’s best interests at heart. I should like to emphasize, in this regard, that the said committee will not serve as a second government or be a parallel official institution. This is an advisory body with a specific time-bound mission. It will have to take into consideration the major reforms introduced – as well as those to come – in a number of sectors, such as education, health, agriculture, investment and taxation. The committee is expected to make suggestions on how to improve these reforms and increase effectiveness. I expect the committee to be totally impartial and objective, and to report on facts as they are on the ground, however harsh or painful they may be. And when proposing solutions, I want it to be daring and innovative. This is not about a break with the past. Rather, we want to add a new building block to our development agenda, as part of a continuing process. Most importantly, we must be resolute and audacious and show a keen spirit of responsibility as we implement the relevant conclusions and recommendations adopted, no matter how hard or costly that may be. God willing, I will go back to this at a future date. In the meantime, work pertaining to the management of public affairs and response to citizens’ concerns must continue with greater commitment and a keener sense of responsibility. In particular, emphasis should be placed on improving basic social service delivery and enhancing the performance of public institutions. In parallel, I ask the Government to start working on major, integrated next-generation sectoral plans, which will form the backbone of the new development model. Dear Citizens, Revamping the nation’s development model is not an end in itself. Rather, it is a gateway to a new era – one into which, with God’s help, I intend to take Morocco. It is a new phase, whose distinguishing features will be responsibility and the pursuit of a comprehensive take-off. It is a phase which holds great promise because Morocco’s potential and competencies allow for greater accomplishments than what has been achieved so far. And we are, indeed, capable of accomplishing more. Our main ambition is for Morocco to join the ranks of developed nations. Nevertheless, the new era we are about to enter is fraught with internal and external challenges to which we must rise. They include the following in particular: • Firstly: the challenge of enhancing trust and consolidating achievements: this is the recipe for success and a condition for fulfilling our ambitions. It concerns trust among citizens and trust in the national institutions that bring them together. It is about having faith in a better future. • Secondly, the challenge of avoiding isolation, especially in some sectors which require openness towards international experiences. This is a gateway to economic development and progress. It makes it possible for Moroccan businesses and operators to hone their competitive skills. Openness is a catalyst for investment and for the transfer of foreign expertise and know-how. Not only is it a driver for improved services and better training opportunities, but it also creates jobs. It is a fact that the state, the public sector and national professional institutions have made significant efforts to carry out their mission and improve performance. Nevertheless, some sectors and liberal professions, for instance, need to be open to international expertise and competencies, and to private investment, both domestic and foreign. Many international companies and businesses have expressed a desire to invest and settle in Morocco. This is a matter of deep satisfaction because it is a sign of confidence in our country. However, the constraints imposed by some national laws, and the fear and hesitation characterizing the mindset of certain officials sometimes isolate Morocco or lead to damaging indecision. Those who refuse to open up to the outside world in certain sectors – which I do not want to name here – arguing that it leads to lost jobs, do not care about Moroccans but fear, instead, for their own personal interests. As a matter of fact, foreign investment in those sectors would boost state efforts, not just by creating jobs, but also by promoting quality training, attracting expertise and showcasing successful experiences. • Thirdly, the challenge of accelerating economic development and enhancing institutional efficiency: the aim is to build a strong, competitive economy by continuing to incentivize private entrepreneurship, in addition to launching new programs for productive investment and creating more jobs. This requires greater institutional efficiency and a change in the mindset of those in charge. The public sector needs an immediate three-dimensional revolution: a revolution in simplification, a revolution in efficiency and a revolution in ethical standards. I have already drawn attention, in the past, to the need to change and revamp work methods, and to show diligence and innovation in the management of public institutions. • Fourthly, the challenge of social and regional justice: the aim is to complete the building of a nation of hope and equality for all; a country where there is no place for blatant inequalities, frustrating behavior, rent seeking or time and energy wasting. Therefore, there must be a final break with such negative attitudes and conduct; we must uphold the values of hard work, responsibility, merit and equal opportunity. Dear Citizens, For this new phase to be successful, all national institutions and actors concerned should be involved in injecting fresh momentum into economic and social development in our country. This requires collective mobilization and making the motto of putting the interests of the homeland and the citizens above any other consideration a concrete reality – not just a slogan. In addition to the important role that has to be played by national institutions, I should like to emphasize the need for Moroccans to be involved, since the citizen is one of the most important actors in the success of this phase. I therefore call upon all Moroccans to make a positive contribution in keeping with a spirit of effective civic engagement. Indeed, the results we seek to achieve, the projects we implement and the initiatives we launch all have but one goal: to improve the citizens’ living conditions. God willing, the new phase will see projects of a different type. They will require qualified elites in all managerial and executive positions. Furthermore, new life will have to be injected into institutions and political, economic and administrative bodies, including the Government. In this regard, I ask the Head of Government to submit to me, after the summer break, proposals to fill executive posts in the Government and the civil service with high-level national elites chosen on merit and competence. This does not mean that the current Government and our civil service are completely lacking in qualified human resources. I simply want to make sure the new phase is a success thanks to people with a different mentality and officials who are capable of raising performance levels and bringing about the radical change we are yearning for. Dear Citizens, The celebration of the glorious Throne Day is a most fitting occasion to reiterate our unwavering commitment to the Moroccanness of the Sahara, to our national unity and territorial integrity, and to full sovereignty over every inch of the Kingdom’s territory. I am proud of all that our country has achieved at the United Nations and at African and European levels. We need to remain mobilized across the board to consolidate these achievements and face up to the plots of our adversaries. Morocco remains resolutely and earnestly committed to the political process, under the exclusive aegis of the United Nations Organization. Morocco is also clear in terms of its fundamental convictions: the way to achieve the desired settlement can be none other than through Moroccan full sovereignty and within the framework of the autonomy initiative. The security and development challenges facing us cannot be tackled by any country on its own. With that in mind, I wish to reaffirm our sincere commitment to the policy of the outstretched hand towards our Algerian brothers, out of loyalty to the bonds rooted in brotherhood, religion, language and good-neighborliness that have always existed between the peoples of the two sister nations. This was shown recently by the sincere and spontaneous manifestations of friendliness and support expressed by Morocco – its King and its people – for the Algerian national football team at the African Cup of Nations held in our sister country, Egypt. Moroccans shared in the Algerian people’s joy and pride when their national team deservedly won the Cup. It was as if Morocco had won, too. Because of this awareness and of the belief that ours is a common destiny and that we share the same historical and cultural heritage, we are optimistic and hopeful that we can work for the fulfilment of Maghreb peoples’ aspirations for unity, complementarity and integration. Dear Citizens, Morocco belongs to all Moroccans. It is our common home. We must, all of us, each in his or her respective field of competence, contribute to building our nation, ensuring its development and preserving its unity, security and stability. We want a country that accommodates all its sons and daughters; a country in which all citizens – without exception – enjoy the same rights and have the same obligations, in an environment where freedom and human dignity prevail. I remember with deep respect and reverence all honorable Moroccans who made tremendous sacrifices for freedom and independence, and who contributed to building modern Morocco – a country committed to development, democracy and progress. Chief among them were my venerable grandfather, His Majesty King Mohammed V, and my revered father, His Majesty King Hassan II. May they rest in peace. I wish to pay tribute to all members of the Royal Armed Forces, the Royal Gendarmerie, the Auxiliary Forces, the National Police and the Civil Defense for their continued mobilization, under my leadership, to defend the homeland and preserve its security and stability. Almighty God says: “Allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession (to authority) upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them”. True is the Word of God. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – On the eve of the Throne Day, King Mohammed VI received congratulatory messages from several leaders, including US President Donald Trump. In his cable, the US President said that he is confident that the US and Morocco will reinforce their diplomatic ties in order to achieve in common areas in the interests of both countries. “I am confident that we will build on our free trade agreement [FTA], our strong security partnership and our diverse cultural and educational ties to ensure a safer and more prosperous future for our two peoples,” said the president. Trump also recalled that the US and Morocco promoted fair and reciprocal trade ties. The US and Morocco signed the FTA in 2004. It came into effect  on January 1, 2006. Through the agreement, the US became itself as Morocco’s fourth largest trade partner. Since the agreement came into effect, bilateral trade between the two countries has increased by more than 250%. Trade activities, according to a the 2019 Investment Climate Statements, made the US Morocco’s fourth largest trading partner. In his message, Trump also expressed his country’s determination to continue the fight against extremism. Trump’s cable said that,”we still have a lot to accomplish together, notably the continuation of our fight against extremism in all its forms, the promotion of tolerance and religious understanding, the promotion of common priorities in Africa and the further development of the cultural link between our countries as a testimony of our friendship for more than 240 years.” Trump’s statement acknowledged Morocco’s leadership in countering extremism and terrorism at the national and international level. In September 2018, the State Department’s Country Reports on Terrorism asserted that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.”

Rabat – On the eve of the Throne Day, King Mohammed VI received  the Governor of Morocco’s central bank, BAM, Abdellatif Jouahri at his royal palace in Tetouane, North Morocco. During the meeting, Jouahri presented the central bank’s annual report on the economic situation for the 2018 financial year. Jouahri acknowledged that Morocco’s economic performance in 2018 failed to meet the “growing social expectations.” He said that Morocco experienced challenges due to the slow recovery of non agricultural sectors last year. The business expert said that domestic economic growth stood at 3.0%. Jouahri also echoed statistics of the High COmmissioner for Planning (HCP), emphasizing that unemployment fell to 9.8% in 2018. Despite the slight changes in employment rate, unemployment among youth aged 15 to 24 remains high, especially in urban areas. HCP said in a report that unemployment hovers around 40% in some urban areas. Regarding macroeconomic balances, fiscal consolidation slowed down moderately, according to Jouhari as the deficit widened to 3.7% of the Gross Domestic Products (GDP). He added that the current account deficit expanded to 5.5% of GDP despite “continued strong performance of exports.” He added that inflows of foreign investments reached MAD 47.4 billion and net international reserves stood at the equivalent of slightly over 5 months of imports. “Under these conditions, inflation rose significantly to 1.9%, mainly driven by higher volatile food prices,” the governor told the King. Reforms urgently needed Jouahri said that Morocco is in dire need of reform to place the country back on the path of higher growth. For Jouahri, Morocco needs reforms with “greater efficiency and performance.” He also advised taking into account the changes in the international business climate. Jouahri also called for a reform to the education and training system. Most recently, the political scene witnessed controversy over the adoption of draft bill, stipulating French as a language to teach technical and scientific subjects at Moroccan schools. On July 22, the House of Representatives adopted the draft law, angering several Moroccan politicians, including former head of government Abdelilah Benkirane. The law created division among political parties. Jouahri called on Morocco’s government, however, to give more attention and a new vision which will save Morocco’s education system. Jouahri said that education and training system has suffered from “political calculations, at a time when the digital revolution is enhancing requirements of the labor market.” Despite all the challenges, Jouahri promised that Morocco continues to enjoy a “privileged status, both regionally and internationally” under the King’s leadership. “Genuine action is needed from all vital forces of the country, who are called upon to move beyond the narrow personal and partisan considerations and come together for the interest of the country and its citizens,” Jouahri concluded.

Rabat -The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) is calling for the development of a halal vaccine after the UK government said the current vaccine is unpopular in Muslim majority areas. The council said that Fluenz is not halal as it contains gelatin from pigs. Fluenz, a nasal spray that prevents the flu, is set to be given to every healthy child of primary school age in England. The council also told the Telegraph today, July 29, that it was advising imams to tell parents that Fluenz is “not acceptable in Islam.” “We have consulted the scholars and this is their view. Since then we have been giving people the information so that they can make their judgment,” said Dr. Shuja Shafi, the chairman of the MCB’s research and documentation committee. “We need another vaccine which is halal and can be offered to all. We urge the government and the industry to make this happen,” he added. Since the statement from MCB, Public Health England (PHE) has expressed fears over the number of parents withdrawing their children from the vaccine program since the Muslim Council of Britain made its announcement. The Royal Society for Public Health backed the MCB’s statement, urging the government to offer a halal alternative vaccine acceptable to Muslims as the situation “adds to the risk of major flu outbreaks.” PHE said there are no “suitable alternatives” to Fluenz “for healthy children.” While there are currently injectable flu vaccines available that do not contain gelatin, they are not as effective and are “only recommended as part of the program for children and adults who are at high risk of the complications of flu.” England’s National Health Service (NHS) is urging Muslim parents to consider making an exception because the vaccine can be “considered different from ingesting food.” It pointed out that the many Jewish communities, who do not consume pork either, have said the spray is acceptable because it is not taken by mouth. NHS also insists that the gelatine is purified to the point that it no longer contains traces of pig DNA. Gelatin is used as a stabilizer to ensure vaccines remains safe and effective during storage. UK Health authorities gave a warning that changing the stabilizers in vaccines would require “extensive laboratory and clinical studies”. “Because of this, developing a new safe and effective vaccine with a different stabilizer may take several years or may never happen.”

Rabat – The Polisario Front maintains its refusal to release opposition Sahrawi activists detained since June. The activists were arrested  for participating in protests against violations and lack of human rights in the Tindouf camps. The family of detained Sahrawi activist Moulay Aba Bouzid announced that he started a hunger and water strike to protest his arbitrary detention. Former Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ould Mouloud said that Aba Bouzid’s decision to stop drinking water is the latest escalation of the protest. The new measures come after the Polisario refused to meet the detained activists’ demands after 12 days of hunger strike. In addition to Bouzid, Polisario arrested two other opposition activists, including  Fadel Braika. Braika has also been on a hunger strike for two weeks. Mustafa Salma said in a Facebook post on July 28 that the detainees are calling on the Polisario Front to respect laws regarding investigation procedures and detention conditions. The activists also called for a fair trial, seeking their release pending legal charges. Last week, the families of the detained activists said they were “surprised” to know that gendarmerie members were attending hearings. The families condemned the gendarmerie’s presence, which constitutes a violation of the law, as they are not a party to the case. Mustafa Salma has called on the activists to stop the hunger strike and not put their lives in further danger. “I urge whoever is in contact with them, especially their lawyer to advise them to stop this escalation with all my respect to their feelings.” Mustafa Salma also condemned the injustice exerted by the Polisario Front against activists. On Saturday, July 27, a Sahrawi activist fainted during a sit-in to protest the disappearance of his father Ahmed El Khalil, who has been missing for a decade. A source in Rabouni told Morocco World News that the Polisario Front refused to dispatch an ambulance to the activist, who collapsed during the sit-in. Algerian security services and Polisario members kidnapped and arrested El Khalil in 2009 under unknown circumstances. El Khalil’s family has been staging a sit-in near the high commission of refugees in Rabouni near Tindouf, Algeria for 15 days. The sit-in aims to put pressure on Polisario to disclose information on the unjustified disappearance of their relatives. Polisario has ignored ongoing calls from NGOs, including Human Rights Watch which recently called for the immediate release of the detained activists.

Rabat – Rachid Madrane, a Belgo-Moroccan politician, has been serving as president of the Brussels Regional Parliament since July 18. Madrane was elected in the 2019 Regional Elections. At the age of 51, Madrane is one of the leading figures of the French Socialist Party (PS) and the Belgian political scene. His motto is “work and perseverance always pay off.” Madrane told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that, as president, he has big dreams for Brussels. “I dream of a creative and dynamic city that embodies the future of big cities, where it is pleasant to live,” he said optimistically. For Madrane, “there are several priority issues to be tackled, particularly the topic of mobility which is one of the main sources of concern in Brussels.” As for employment, the president finds pride in the “uninterrupted” decline of Brussels’ unemployment rate. However, Madrane stressed that more effort is needed to fight hiring discrimination. This type of discrimination is “an issue that has always been important to me and one I have worked hard on,” says the politician. His adherence to the PS dates back to 1985, in the wake of “Don’t touch my friend” campaigns led by the SOS Racisme association. “When I was a teenager, I started to understand and experience racism and its effects, and so I started to get involved with associations, but as time went on, I realized that if I wanted to make a change, I would have to do so through politics,” he explained. After having worked as a radio and newspaper journalist, Madrane held the position of spokesman in ministerial cabinets. He was then elected for the first time at the Etterbeek Municipal Council in 2000. From June 2004 to June 2009, he was a member of the Brussels Parliament. In 2010, he joined the Federal Parliament. In 2014, Madrane integrated the Wallonia-Brussels Federation government, where he was designated Minister for Youth Aid, Houses of Justice, and Promotion of Brussels. The now-president was in charge of the departments of Sports and Youth respectively in 2016 and 2018. At the head of the Brussels Parliament, Madrane has taken the challenge to promote participatory democracy, to involve citizens in the decision-making process, and to reconcile them with politics.

By Hamza Guessous and Juliette Owen-Jones Rabat – A study carried out by the Global Footprint Network shows that humanity has depleted, in just 7 months, all of its share of natural resources such as water, soil, and clean air for the year. This means that the earth’s population is currently consuming the resources of future generations. The Earth Overshoot Day fell this year on July 29, which is the earliest date ever, according to a report from the Global Footprint Network. The Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity’s level of consumption exceeds the amount of natural resources the earth can regenerate.  The environmental group stated that humans have consumed 1.75 more natural resources in 2019 than the earth can regenerate. “Earth Overshoot Day falling on July 29 means that humanity is currently using nature 1.75 times faster than our planet’s ecosystems can regenerate. This is akin to using 1.75 Earths,” said Global Footprint Network in a statement. The group’s calculations take into account the amount of water, land, fish, and forests we use as well as how much CO2 we’re pumping into the atmosphere. The NGO added that this over consumption of natural resources will lead to climate change which could cause extreme weather events such as the heatwave Europe is currently experiencing. “The costs of this global ecological overspending are becoming increasingly evident in the form of deforestation, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, or the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The latter leads to climate change and more frequent extreme weather events,” the report added. The first calculated Earth Overshoot Day was in 1986. The date has been falling earlier each year. In 1993, Earth Overshoot Day fell on October 21, in 2003 on September 22, and in 2017 on August 2.  This graph published by the group this year shows the stark contrast year by year best: The precise Earth Overshoot Day date for each year is less significant than the sheer magnitude of ecological overshoot. Over the last decades, the date has been creeping up the calendar, although at a slowing rate. https://t.co/ZwrDagJt5K #MoveTheDate pic.twitter.com/i4gM0pk5Mk — Footprint Network (@EndOvershoot) July 28, 2019  “We have only got one Earth this is the ultimately defining context for human existence. We can’t use 1.75 (earths) without destructive consequences,” said Mathis Wackernagel, founder of Global Footprint Network. The Global Footprint Network also analyses the amount of resources each country is individually using. Morocco impressively almost makes it to the end of the year before having its own overshoot day, estimated to be on December 16. Qatar, in comparison, burns through the replenishable resources for the year by February 11. The group also examines how many earths we would need if the whole world’s population lived like one individual county.  The environmental group has launched a campaign, ‘#MoveTheDate’, proposing solutions aimed at moving back the date to limit consumption to one-year of natural resources annually. Among the solutions, cutting CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels by 50% would help to move back the date by 93 days. Emissions from burning fossil fuels contribute significantly to global warming. “The past does not necessarily determine our future. Our current choices do. Through wise, forward-looking decisions, we can turn around natural resource consumption trends while improving the quality of life for all people,” says the group. “While our planet is finite, human possibilities are not. The transformation to a sustainable, carbon-neutral world will succeed if we apply humanity’s greatest strengths: foresight, innovation, and care for each other.” “The good news is that this transformation is not only technologically possible, it is also economically beneficial and our best chance for a prosperous future.” The group recommends changes in 5 areas: “cities, energy, food, planet, and population.” Cities must be built to be more compact rather than sprawling, there must be a move towards renewable energy, and awareness must be spread over how we produce, distribute and consume food, says the group. Finally, efforts must be put into conservation, reforestation, regenerative farming for the sake of the planet, and the population growth must be reduced through the empowerment of women and through family planning. The NGO has also launched the #MoveTheDate Solutions Map where people are invited to share their solutions for a better sustainable future. Users can propose their solutions in the form of a comment and start a conversation with other conservationists.

Rabat – The World Health Organization’s seventh report on the global tobacco epidemic analyzes countries’ efforts to implement the most effective measures to reduce the demand for tobacco. The report, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, shows that only 23 countries have implemented smoking cessation support at the highest level. “116 other countries provide services whose costs are entirely or partially covered by institutions and 32 other countries provide these services, but do not cover costs,” says the report. WHO estimates, in its July 26 press release, that there are 1.1 billion smokers, about 80% of whom live in low- and middle-income countries. WHO tobacco control measures WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has 168 signatories and more than 150 Parties. The convention sets out the principles and context for the development of policies and mobilization of political and financial resources for tobacco control. In order to help countries carry out these principles, WHO established a policy program called MPOWER. MPOWER stands for: In its publication, “MPOWER: A Policy Program to Reverse The Course of The Epidemic”, WHO says that “smoking is often wrongly perceived as a personal choice.” “Even fully informed of its health consequences, most tobacco users want to quit but have trouble getting there because of the addictive power of nicotine,” the organization adds. “Although the lethal consequences of smoking have been scientifically proven, only a number of countries are fighting the epidemic; developing countries are even fewer to do so,” says the publication. The organization further stresses that “women and young adults are the favorite targets of the tobacco industry in these countries because they are the category which offers the greatest potential for increased sales and profits.” Tobacco consumption in Morocco According to The Tobacco Atlas 2017 report, “smoking tobacco causes exposure to a lethal mixture of more than 7000 toxic chemicals, including at least 70 known carcinogens that can damage nearly every organ system in the human body.” The report specifies that every year, more than 17,600 of Moroccan people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. Yet, more than 10,000 children (10-14 years old) and 47,710.00 adults (15+ years old) continue to use tobacco each day. Female Smokers in Morocco  The report mentions that, in 2015, 0.8% of Moroccan females (15+ Year Old) and 0.23% children (10–14 Y.O.) smoke daily. “Even though fewer women smoke in Morocco than on average in medium-HDI countries (Human Development Index), there are still more than 102,600 women and more than 3,200 girls who smoke cigarettes daily,” says the report. In 2016, 3.74% of female smokers died of tobacco consumption in Morocco. Male smokers in Morocco According to the same report, 38.3% of male adults (15+ Y.O.) and 0.52% of children (10–14 Y.O.) use tobacco daily. More than 7,600 boys smoke cigarettes each day. Similarly to female smokers, more men smoke in Morocco than on average in medium-HDI countries. The male smokers’ death toll in 2016 reached 14.99%. According to Fondation Lalla Salma for the fight against cancer, “Morocco is considered one of the biggest consumers of tobacco in the Mediterranean area with more than 15 billion cigarettes a year.” The foundation considers that 90% of lung cancers and 25% of coronary insufficiency including infarction are caused by tobacco consumption. Tobacco and Moroccan Economy The Tobacco Atlas report also indicates that the economic cost of smoking in Morocco amounts to MAD 16,371 million. This includes direct costs related to healthcare expenditures and indirect costs related to lost productivity due to early mortality. According to the Lalla Salma foundation, “a national survey on habits and behaviors of smokers published in 2008 shows that the Moroccan smoker spends, on average, MAD 22 per day for the purchase of tobacco, 30% of the legal minimum wage in Morocco.” Since 1996, Morocco has an anti-smoking law (No. 15-91) which prohibits smoking in certain public places, propaganda, and the advertising of tobacco. The law also stipulates that all cigarette packages should include the warning message: “smoking kills.”

In the speech, commemorating the 19th anniversary of the sovereign’s accession to the throne, King Mohammed VI urged his government to  increase efforts to curb social disparities. “Achieving goals, redressing imbalances, and tackling economic and social problems requires collective action, planning and coordination between different institutions and actors, especially between the members of the government and between the political parties forming the government,” the King said. The King also emphasized the importance of improving public administration to “enhance the trust and promote serenity within the community and among all its components.” “Citizens’ affairs cannot be put on hold for they do not relate to a specific period of time. Responsible political bodies are those that stand by the citizen, in good times and bad,” the King announced. The King also warned that political parties do not “make efforts to carry out their mission.” He urged politicians and political parties to engage Morocco’s youth in politics. “(…)  they should attract new elites and mobilize young people to engage in political life, for today’s youths are the ones who know what the current problems and requirements are,” the monarch said.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of Economy and Finance published a report from the Directorate of Studies and Financial Forecasts showing poor cereal production in the 2018-2019 crop year. The report shows that cereal production for the 2018-2019 season is estimated at 61 million quintals. The number represents a decrease of 40.5 % from the previous season. The report cites  poor the rainfall season as the main reason for the drop in crop production.

In April, the Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that Morocco would have a lower cereal harvest because of poor rainfall. The ministry predicted, however, that Morocco would  harvest 61 million quintals of the three main cereals: wheat, barely and durum. This forecast represents a decrease of 19% compared to the average production of 75 quintals. The ministry of finance  report forecasts a positive season for the fruit growing sectors, rearing and rangelands. The report added that the projected yields of sugar beet are estimated at 70 tonnes per hectare. “As for sugar cane, yields are of the order of 68 tonnes per hectare,” the report added. The document also shows a “good” forecast for olives, citrus fruits and date palm production. The report explained that, “in terms of trade with the outside [world], exports of agriculture and agri-food sector have been consolidated in value.” . Export statistics also show that the value increased from 4.9% at the end of the first five months of 2019, to more than  5.4% through the MAD 30.5 billion increase in the value of food industry shipments. The value of the agriculture, forestry, and hunting sector increased by 4.3%, according to the report.

Rabat – French authorities refused to renew the residence permit of a 31 year old Moroccan national for his comments on Facebook. French news outlet Next Inpact reported on July 23 that French authorities consider the Moroccan national a threat for public order. “Once again justice considers activities on social networks before making a decision,” said the news outlet. The news outlet said that French police refused on July 10, 2018, to renew the residence permit of the Moroccan national and forced him to leave the territory within a month. Challenging the decision, the Moroccan national appealed the decision in November 2018, a request that was rejected by the Paris Administrative court. He then continued to try and repeal the decision.  On July 12, the Paris Court of Appeal said that the man was refused residence permit renewal following an “investigation by the specialized intelligence services,” alerting on his publications and writings on Facebook. France is not the only country that takes into account applicants data on social networks.  US Visa applicants are required, since the June 2019 reform, to provide information on their social media accounts. The US State Department indicated that it had updated its immigrant and non-immigrant visa forms to request additional information from almost all US applicants.The new visa forms list a number of social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), and require the applicant to provide the names of the accounts they may have had in the last five years.

Rabat – Moroccan international football player Hakim Ziyech said he rejected an offer to join the Spanish football club Sevilla. The football player expressed his determination to stay with Dutch football club Ajax Amsterdam as he is waiting to find a “perfect picture.” Recently, international media linked Ziyech with giant football clubs, including  Arsenal and Liverpool. The alleged interest of the football club is due to Ziyech’s successful season with his Dutch football club. Ziyech explained his rejection to Sevilla, emphasizing that the Spanish club has the same level as the Dutch football club he plays for. “I think Sevilla is from the same level as Ajax and I don’t switch Ajax for nothin’,”  Ziyech told Fox Sports. He added that he has not received the right offer yet. “For now I just stick with Ajax and do my very best on the field.” In April, the 26-year old football player also said that he is “always very picky” in response to offers he receives from football clubs. “Anything is possible. There must be a club that I want to trade in for Ajax. That doesn’t just happen,” he added. Ziyech joined Ajax in 2017, and has a contract with them until the end of the 2020-21 season. Ziyech is also a key player in the Morocco’s national football team, with whom he made his debut in October 2015 in a friendly match against Cote d’Ivoire.

Rabat – Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ spokesperson Annelijn van den Broek said that his country’s embassy in Morocco is in “direct contact with the [defense] lawyer” of the perpetrators of theLa Creme shooting. On July 26, the Court of Appeal in Marrakech sentenced the main defendants in the shooting to death. A young medical student died in the shooting, and one of his classmates was seriously injured. The spokesperson of the Dutch ministry said that it is up to the people concerned to “use the possibility of appeal.” He added that “all Dutch people have the right to consular assistance,” according to AFP. Broek added that the Netherlands stands against the death penalty. Moroccan police linked the crime to the settling of accounts between drug cartels and drug traffickers working between Morocco and the Netherlands. The death penalty was abolished in the Netherlands in 1870. While capital punishment remains legal in Morocco, no executions have been carried out since 1993. Moroccoo, however, handed death sentences to three individuals directly involved in the death of two Scandinavian tourists in the Atlas Mountains in  December 2018.

Rabat – Three years ago, a 17-year-old named Aymane began to dream of owning a Siberian Husky.  “They look beautiful with their eyes and coat,” he said of the wolfish dog breed. “They’re not aggressive like other dogs.” Although a self-proclaimed dog lover, Aymane was not aware of the breed’s temperament or specific needs. His interest in having the dog was essentially driven by superficial fixations.  “I want to show off,” he admitted. “Everyone thinks it’s cool to have a Husky. The dogs get attention.”   “The shabaab only want Huskies to impress other people,” interjected Aymane’s disapproving older brother. “If they really loved dogs, they would save one from the streets instead of buying a pure race.”  Aymane’s silence expressed his agreement with this bold generalization. Unfortunately for Aymane, his family’s apartment in Temara is not suitable to house a dog. While a decent size, the apartment is on the fourth floor of the building and doesn’t have access to a garden or balcony. Aymane, now 20, is also a student and works when he’s not in school. Simply put: “My parents said no.”  His parents’ decision was ultimately the responsible one. But their awareness of the amount of time and resources needed to properly take care of a pet is not shared by all dog owners throughout Morocco–especially among those who only want a dog to “show off.”   Sled dogs: intelligent, stubborn, and nomadic Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes have become common pets for Moroccans all over the country.  These dogs are similar in appearance, having historically been bred above the Arctic Circle for their strength, energy, and resilience. They are pack dogs, difficult to train, in need of a lot of exercise and open space, and they prefer cold climates. The prevalence of these Arctic sled dogs in a country characterized by its high temperatures and tightly-packed cities is surely an eyebrow-raising phenomenon, particularly as they are often seen running freely along busy streets or tied up in direct sunlight. Although these dogs can adapt to warm climates, unfavorable living conditions often exacerbate the negative aspects of the breeds’ temperaments. And unless a Husky or Malamute owner is experienced in meeting the breed’s unique needs, these dogs are very challenging to care for.    The Kennel Club (KC) recommends owners of both breeds to exercise the dogs for at least two hours every day, but not in temperatures above 24 C (75 F) as they risk dehydration and overexertion. If these dogs don’t receive an adequate amount of daily stimulation, they become agitated, noisy, and destructive. Mahmoud, a 28-year-old man from Sefrou, surely understands the breeds’ disdain for heat, small spaces, and idleness. He had a mixed-race husky for just two months before the dog, named Lisya, jumped from the second-floor balcony of his apartment and ran away. The adult dog was given to Mahmoud in the summer of 2018, when temperatures in the Fes-Meknes region routinely topped 33 C (91 F). Despite going for daily runs and receiving plenty of affection, the small apartment and scorching heat pushed Lisya to her boiling point, prompting her to make a dangerous escape. Mahmoud, wrought with grief, spent weeks searching for her to no avail. He believes she was picked up and sold.      For Husky owners around the world, Mahmoud’s story is quite relatable. This is because Siberian Huskies are widely known for being escape artists: they can free themselves from almost any enclosure if they are hot, stressed, anxious, or simply bored.  Huskies can easily dig under fences, jump over walls up to 1.83 meters (6 feet) high, unlock gates and cages, unlatch doors and windows, and squeeze through small openings. And, based on Mahmoud’s experience, they can withstand falls from at least 6.6 meters (~22 feet) high. On top of this, Huskies and Malamutes can slip out of regular dog collars and will run whenever the opportunity arises.    So why are so many Moroccan men and women eager to bring these high-maintenance, expensive, and mischievous dogs into their homes? As we learned from Aymane, the answer is really quite simple: they look cool.  Irresponsible ownership Dogs have long been used to symbolize one’s wealth, social status, or power.     Any dog can be irresponsibly used as an accessory, but some breeds are especially vulnerable to shallow trends.   Huskies, Malamutes, and other Arctic breeds have unfortunately become “fad pets” due to their wolf-like features. In recent months, fans of the hit show Game of Thrones (GoT) began buying–and later abandoning–Huskies en masse for their resemblance to the show’s fictional “direwolves.”  In separate campaigns for PETA, the world’s largest animal rights organization, GoT actors Jerome Flynn and Peter Dinklage urged viewers against engaging with this trend. The Moroccan infatuation with wolf-like dogs is on par with that of the West. However, in Morocco, it is much more difficult to adequately care for any pet–let alone one as demanding as a Husky or Malamute.  The average Moroccan lives in an apartment and doesn’t have a private, securely enclosed yard. These are two critical drawbacks, given the dogs’ high energy levels. To compensate, Husky and Malamute owners must spend an ample amount of time exercising these dogs. Owning these dogs is not only time-consuming–it’s expensive.  For example, Siberian Husky breeders in the U.S. estimate the cost of raising one puppy to be around $1000 a year, or MAD 9582.05.  With an average salary of MAD 3000-4000 per month in Morocco, nearly MAD 10000 a year is simply not a feasible amount to spend on a dog–especially as many dog owners are unemployed youth. Mahmoud, being an unemployed youth himself, evaded this steep cost by feeding Lisya rice and meat rather than nutrient-dense food specifically created for Huskies. He said he never took her to a vet because he doesn’t know what a vet is, or where to find one.  These methods of cutting corners–intentional or not–are common practices among under-resourced and inexperienced Husky and Malamute owners. Otherwise, many would not be able to afford to keep these prized dogs.   Beldis: belonging to the street At face value, it may appear that Moroccan society is becoming more accepting of dogs. But Morocco’s strays are still suffering, deemed unworthy of adoption by the majority of supposed “dog lovers.” Morocco’s streets are home to more than 3 million stray dogs, known as Beldis. Beldis are a type of mixed-breed dog native to North Africa. Some are even mixed with Huskies, Malamutes, and German Shepherds–a result of unsterilized purebreds running freely through the streets.   Morocco’s animal shelters are teeming with Beldis, but these dogs are seldom adopted. Mohammed, 25, has a friend who sold his Husky after the dog became too “expensive and annoying.” When asked if the friend ever considered having a Beldi, Mohammed laughed.  “You’re never going to see a Moroccan with a Beldi,” he said. “No one likes how they look.” Although mixed-breed dogs tend to be healthier and better behaved than purebred dogs, some Moroccans turn up their noses at the thought of having a Beldi in the house.  “Beldis belong to the streets,” Mohammed said.  Purebreds, too, may soon belong to the streets.  Although Huskies and Malamutes are still in high demand in Morocco, they are routinely abandoned, lost, or re-sold by their owners as expenses and behavioral issues become too much to handle.  If more Moroccans become aware of the amount of work and money required to care for these Arctic breeds, they may discard their dreams of owning one. This leaves the thousands of purebreds currently circulating the market with a potentially uncertain future.  Morocco’s wolf-dog craze may soon meet its end, and the Huskies and Malamutes being bred to nourish this fad will pay the price.

Rabat- The Ministry of Culture and Communication has announced the addition of four rock carving sites, all from different time periods, to Morocco’s National heritage list. According to the ministry, the addition of the sites is part of its action plan for the protection, enhancement, and promotion of national heritage. The first of the four sites added to the list is Azrou Klan, a site with a large number of engravings on one rock surface. The site is located in the Laâouina Commune in the Assa-Zag Province.  The ministry says this site stands out in particular thanks to a unique drawing of a ship. The three other sites added to the list are Adrar Zerzem, Tarslt, and Oumougjim. They are all located in one commune, Aday, in the Guelmim province. The ministry points out that these new additions to the National Heritage List will serve as magnets for cultural tourism in the region.  All four sites carry great scientific significance, as the engravings give insight into the social and economic structure of prehistoric communities in Morocco, as well as their beliefs.  The ministry will work with the National Rock Heritage Center to protect the sites from threats such as looting, theft, and vandalism, and run archaeological excavations and scientific research programs.

Rabat – Moroccan actress Nisrin Erradi won the award for Best Actress at the Durban International Film Festival (DIFF) in South Africa for her role in Maryam Touzani’s “Adam.” The 29-year-old Moroccan actress played the emotional role of “Samia” an unwed mother who travels to Casablanca from the countryside to put her child up for adoption. Erradi took to Instagram to thank her fellow cast members for her success.     40th Durban International Film Festival award 2019 Best Actress: Nisrin Erradi for Adam directed by Maryam Touzani. (جائزة أحسن تشخيص ) مهرجان ديربان السينمائي عن فيلم آدم لمخرجته مريم التوزاني 🙏 Très contente merci à toute l’équipe ❤️ A post shared by  Nisrin Erradi (@nisrin_erradi) on Jul 25, 2019 at 4:12pm PDT  “Adam,” spotlighted the controversial topic of unwed mothers in Morocco. The story was inspired by a pregnant woman who was going door-to-door asking for work in Touzani’s hometown of Tangier. “In a country like mine, it’s the biggest shame for a woman to have a child out of wedlock,” said Touzani. “She doesn’t want to disappoint her parents so she cannot tell the truth.” Touzani also explained her reasoning behind featuring taboo topics: “There is a facade that everything is all right on the outside even if people are tormented inside. It is good to let in some air and light, and people are relieved and happy things are being spoken about.” Touzani has also seen her share of praise for the innovative film. Earlier this month, she joined the prestigious Oscar’s Academy. As part of the role, she will be responsible for selecting the nominees and winners in the “Screenwriters” category for the upcoming Academy Awards.

Rabat – In the border city of Oujda, Morocco, butchers have passed down their trade, from father to son, for decades. Once a center for trade between countries, Oujda is located less than 10 kilometers from neighboring Algeria.  In the heart of Oujda’s medina sits a series of stalls where local butchers have gathered to ply their trade for generations. As the largest city in Eastern Morocco, Oujda’s market thrived, especially on weekends when shoppers travelled in from Algeria to stock up on goods.  The closing of the border between Algeria and Morocco in 1994 shut down overland trade between the two countries, impacting the local economy. Since then, Oujda’s market relied in part on smuggled consumer goods to fulfill local demand. “In the early 2000s, the black market trade carried on largely unabated,” said Professor of International Relations Anouar Boukhars. “The government, fearing unrest due to lingering high unemployment and poverty, continued to heavily subsidize commodities, maintaining the allure and incentives for border residents to smuggle.”  With the rise of Islamic extremist groups, drug trafficking in the Maghreb, and the Arab Spring revolutions in 2011, Algerian and Moroccan authorities tightened border security and cracked down on smuggling. The black market dried up and Oujda’s economy continued to suffer. The butchers said the once bustling medina now barely provides them with enough income to support their families. These men, some of whom are third generation butchers, said they are encouraging their children to learn new skills instead of following in the footsteps of their fathers. With economic prospects in decline, the butchers of Oujda see themselves as the last generation in their families to carry on their family trade.

MAD 10 can help you taste all of them at once – only recommended for travelers with a strong stomach! The one and only Kaliente Karan is also known as karantica or kaliente depending on the region. For example, people in east Morocco, including Oujda call it Karan, while in central Morocco  they call it Karantika. This is one of the most popular snacks in northern Morocco. It is also popular across Morocco, but the taste varies from one region to another. Tourists and visitors can have the opportunity to taste kaliente next to the beach in Martil or its souqs, where vendors offer their warm and tasty kaliente. A slice for MAD 2 or 3 can sate your hunger as one serving has enough carbs and fiber. Karan is made with chickpea flour, oil, and eggs and is served warm with cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper lending it a spicy flavour. Some people prefer kaliante in bread, which can be eaten as a sandwich with tuna. Hummuss &amp; Ghoulal Chickpea hummus is one of the most famous Moroccan snacks, and is a well-known draw for tourists. Although it is affordable across Morocco, the taste differs from one region to another. In northern Morocco, you can find vendors offering one pot for MAD 2. The water in which the chickpeas is soaked is also part of the taste. It is served with spices cumin, salt, cayenne pepper, and fenugreek.

Rabat – Hafdallah El Khalil Ould Braih, the son of the disappeared  Polisario leading member Ahmed El Khalil, fainted during a sit-in today, July 27. An inside source in Rabouni told Morocco World News that a private vehicle transferred Hafdallah to the Rabouni hospital in Algeria after he fainted in front of the headquarters of the high commission of refugees. Hafdallah has been staging a sit-in, with his three brothers and mother, to condemn the continued, forced disappearance of Ahmed El Khalil. El Khalil has been missing for a decade. The same source told MWN that the Polisario Front refused to dispatch an ambulance to transfer Hafdallah to the hospital. Algerian intelligence services along with Polisario members kidnapped El Khalil in 2009, two months after the Polisario had appointed him to monitor human rights in the Tindouf camps. Since his disappearance, El Khalil’s family along with other activists have been urging the Polisario Front to disclose the fate of their relative. After unfulfilled promises, leader of the front Ibrahim Ghali refused to engage in a dialogue with El Khalil’s family. Subsequently, the family decided to hold a sit-in campaign to pressure the Polisario to disclose information on the disappearance of El Khalil. On July 20, a group of Sahrawis marched on Rabouni to condemn the disappearance of the leading Polisario member. In January, rumors emerged in the Tindouf camps of the death of El Khalil in an Algerian prison. Former Polisario officier Mustafa Salma Oueld Sidi Mouloud said in a Facebook post that the leading member died on Wednesday, January 10. In response to the rumors, which attracted interest in human rights violations at the hands of the Polisario, the front’s leader vowed to disclose information on the disappearance of El Khalil. His family members and supporters are still waiting for Ghali to reveal his whereabouts. Ahmed El Khalil was born in Tan-Tan in southern Morocco. He decided to join Polisario in 1977. El Khalil held several positions in Tindouf, including director of security in Tindouf before he was appointed a human rights adviser prior to his disappearance.

Rabat – The Polisario leadership is calling for war with Morocco, delivering a shattering blow to the new momentum surrounding the ongoing UN-assisted dialogue. In a brief, but fiery video message relayed by pro-Polisario outlet Futuro Sahara, Brahim Ghali, the leader of the Polisario Front, the separatist movement seeking independence in Western Sahara, announced his plan to impose compulsory military service in the Tindouf camps to “prepare for the inevitable war against a relentless enemy.” Sounding determined, Ghali suggested that he has had enough of the lengthy and apparently Morocco-friendly UN-led peace negotiations. The only way for the front to get what it has long fought for is to go at war, he emphasized in the video. “It is now clear that those peace negotiations are not getting us anywhere,” the separatist-in-chief said, adding that the front and its supporters are left with war as the sole alternative. From the arguments repeatedly hammered throughout the four-minute video, one recurring reason for Ghali’s blunt call for war is the front’s apparent realization that the ongoing negotiations for a lasting political settlement are actually moving in Morocco’s favor. “Morocco is unyielding because they know they have the support of great powers,” he said, as he went on to dismiss the ongoing political process as a game planned in advance to fit Morocco’s agenda. “It is clear by now that war is both compulsory and inevitable. Everyone is concerned,” he said. By Ghali’s own admission, however, the only lingering question, the unsettled uncertainty in his certain determination to go to war against Morocco is, “How and when will the war be fought?” But that, he blustered, “is a question for another time.” In his message, the Polisario leader consistently spoke of the “necessity” for the front to impose compulsory military service in the Tindouf camps. In patriotism-flavored evocations, he called on the youth in the camps to join the front’s troops to prepare for the coming, inevitable war. “Voluntary military service is no longer relevant, as we are in national liberation fight against a relentless enemy. That is why we have to take radical measures. Compulsory military service will allow us to drive the enemy out of our lands and establish our state in our fatherland.” Meanwhile, there are suggestions that Algeria knows about, and is encouraging the separatist front in its determination to ditch the UN-led process and resort to taking arms. While Ghali was making his war pronouncements, Algiers is funding and organizing a “summer school” in Tindouf. The event is part of Algeria’s known sponsoring of the separatist front’s military maneuverings, Le 360 reported yesterday. The message may elicit surprise in UN circles. The last couple of months came with messages of hope, of high expectations that the international community was finally on track to broker an agreement that would end the decades-long stalemate in Western Sahara. In the pro-Polisario camp, however, while momentum built around the encouraging prospects of the ongoing UN-led negotiations, the pervading sentiment has been that the most powerful nations of the international community, especially France and the US, were merely engaged in a rigged game with the sole aim of “selling to Sahrawis” a Morocco-friendly deal. “The West, Europe and the US, do not want another state geographically separating Morocco and Mauritania,” Mauritania’s Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz said in April. “Everything you hear outside of this frame is not correct.” The suggestion, as an anonymous pro-Polisario source said in the same period amid preparations for the second UN-moderated Geneva meeting between Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and the Polisario Front, is that there is a “behind-the-scenes intervention from the Americans to put an end to hopes of Sahrawi independence.”

Rabat – On July 26, the Court of Appeal in Marrakech sentenced to death the main suspect Gabriel Edwin, from the Republic of Suriname, and his Dominican accomplice. Both defendants have Dutch nationality. The case goes back to November 2017 when the two defendants, on a large motorcycle, opened fire at café “La Crème.” The shooting caused the death of a young medical student and seriously injured his female classmate. The two Dutch defendants faced several charges. They were convicted of intentional premeditated homicide, participation in an attempted homicide, criminal gang formation, damage to public property, as well as drug production and trafficking. The owner of the café and his cousin were sentenced, respectively, to 15 and 8 years in prison. Both were convicted of involvement in drug trafficking operations which led to the shooting. Two further suspects were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, and a third was handed a suspended sentence of 2 to 3 months. Judicial Police in Marrakech, in coordination with the services of the Directorate-General for the Surveillance of National Territory (DGST), carried out an investigation into the shooting. The investigation led to the arrest of the two Dutch nationals in August 2018. DGSN reported that the defendants already had criminal records. They were directly linked to cases of international drug trafficking, abduction, taking hostages, armed robbery, and attempted murder. Moroccan police linked the crime to the settling of accounts between drug cartels and drug traffickers working between Morocco and the Netherlands. In recent weeks, Sale’s Court of Appeal had announced similar verdicts in the Imlil murder case in which two Scandinavian female tourists were killed by extremist terrorists in December 2018. The three main defendants were also sentenced to death. However, the death penalty has not been carried out in Morocco since 1993.

Rabat – Having repeatedly failed to have the EU pull out of its fisheries agreement with Morocco, the Polisario Front is now preparing another legal fight to at least be on the list of beneficiaries. Months after it failed in its repeated attempts to sabotage the EU-Morocco fisheries deal, and Brussels vowed to uphold its strategic partnership with Morocco, the Polisario Front, still unsatisfied with the state of things, is again contesting Morocco’s legitimacy over the waters off Western Sahara. This time around, however, Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia has reported in its weekend edition, the separatist front is asking to financially benefit from the deal. As it now comes to realize that it can’t have Europe retract from its multi-dimensional and highly strategic partnership with Morocco, the Polisario leadership is resorting to a rather “absurd” and unexpected string, the Moroccan paper said of the separatist front’s latest move to undermine the Morocco-EU relations. The Moroccan newspaper refers to the move as part of the separatist group’s relentless public relations campaign to delegitimize Morocco’s position with Brussels. “We would like to benefit from the exploitation of natural resources in the region,” Al Ahdath Al Maghribia cited an unnamed “high-ranking” Polisario official as saying. While it is aware that countries like France and Spain will most probably stand by Morocco, the front still hopes that “competent European institutions” will soon assess their prospective request and deliver in their favor. In their request in the making, the separatist front is essentially upset with they have labeled “a European maneuver” from Morocco-friendly EU countries to have Brussels support Rabat, regardless of what the front sees as its “natural right” on the natural resources in the waters in question. The suggestion is that the front wants to urge EU institutions to negotiate with them rather than with Morocco. And should it fail to achieve that aim, it would at least want to be a third party in the negotiations. While Al Ahdath Al Maghribia does not dwell on the implications of the “absurd” request, it appears that the separatist group seeks to replenish, or sustain, the financial means of its “Sahrawi independence cause” by having part of the €220 million deal go to its coffers. Rabat has not yet made a statement on this latest move from Polisario. But with the North African country having been adamant about the political dimension of its deal with the EU, “underpinning Morocco’s integrity over its southern provinces,” it is likely that the front is engaging in an arms wrestling with scant, and practically nonexistent, chances of succeeding.

Rabat – The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) under the Directorate General of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) succeeded today, July 27, in dismantling a terrorist cell in the city of Tangier. The cell is composed of five extremists aged between 24 and 36 years, among them a veteran who fought in the ranks of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In a statement, BCIJ said their investigation found that the cell members were in contact with ISIS and had pledged allegiance to the terrorist group. “The extremists coordinated and planned to target several sensitive sites in the kingdom,” adds the statement. The BCIJ added that the investigation, carried out under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office, is still ongoing. The suspects are pending trial until the completion of the investigation. The arrests are part of the BCIJ strategy. The strategy aims to neutralize suspects before they carry out their operations.  According to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia’s July 27 issue, the BCIJ was able to neutralize,  in one week only,  twenty extremists planning acts of terror. The arrests took place in several cities including Safi, Rabat, Casablanca.

Rabat – A man wakes up and has a leisurely breakfast – he’s retired and does not need to rush out the door for work. Eventually, he says goodbye to his wife and children, leaves his home, and strolls down the street. He weaves through the rows of tables and chairs, facing the street not each other, that cover the sidewalks out of each cafe he passes until he arrives at his usual place.  He greets the waiter and the other regulars, sits down and orders a cafe noir.  After a few hours, he might stop home for lunch, only to return to the cafe in the afternoon. “I understood it’s basically part of every man’s routine – the man of the house routine,” Anas, a 23-year-old PhD student, said of his impression of cafes growing up. “You would notice when you go to these kinds of [traditional] cafes that they only have those kinds of archetypes.” In the past, this was the norm, but the picture is changing. “Basically my whole life has been around cafes,” said Hiba, a 25-year-old Rabati woman.  “At this point in our lives you just go to the place where you feel the most comfortable and you make it your second home. And that’s what you do basically every day.” Hiba took a puff of her cigarette and explained that she has been hanging around cafes since highschool. She said her parents understand the significance of cafes in her daily routine since they, like many other Moroccans, have the same habit. The first time Anas went to a cafe was with his dad when he was 8 or 9 and it remains the main way they socialize. “That’s how we spend quality time – me and him – we go to cafes together, like father-son time,” he said.  I met Anas at a casual cafe – with plenty of sunlight and comfortable couches – in Akdal, a younger and more modern neighborhood in Rabat. He gestured around us and said his dad would never go somewhere like this, as he refuses to go anywhere that isn’t a traditional cafe. In comparison, if he were with his mom they’d find a more modern place similar to where we were sitting – somewhere without a lot of men. While Hiba said she prefers to go to cafes with fewer men and more younger people, she also tries to sit in traditional cafes to make a statement. “I try to change Morocco by provoking the men because – I don’t know how – but we’re in 2019 and there are some men – and older women – that are still shocked that a woman is smoking in a public place,” she said. Throughout history, cafes have been a male space and it is only recently that women have really started sharing them, said Said Graiouid, a professor of communication and cultural studies at the University Mohammed V-Agdal, in Rabat. The professor has previously conducted extensive research on cafe culture within Morocco.  While cafes are not Moroccan in origin –  they were introduced by the French through colonization – they gradually became a male space through social norms. Traditionally, public space was for men and there were numerous regulations around women’s presence in it.  “The appropriation of [cafes] followed the distribution of spatial production and consumption along gender lines,” Graiouid said.  “They immediately became available to men, and women obviously were not expected to be in that space because they were not even supposed to be on the streets to begin with.” In the recent past, the cafe landscape in Morocco has changed and now contains many more modern cafes that cater to different crowds. The increase in different types, in addition to changes in gender dynamics within Morocco more broadly, have contributed to the appropriation of the cafe by Moroccan women, according to Graiouid. While men still dominate neighborhood cafes, women often self select to go to newer cafes, he said. “The more modern, the fewer ties to a particular neighborhood, the more inviting it might be for a woman to use,” he explained. Davis-Taieb’s 1998 study of Moroccan womens’ use of modern cafes found that Moroccan women have a different relationship with “neutral” cafe spaces – like McDonalds or Starbucks – and concluded that there is not much of a difference in clientele based on gender in these types of cafes. Since these spaces are newer, they don’t hold as strong of historical context and are not necessarily catered more towards men so it is easier for women to inhabit them, Graiouid explained. More recently, women’s absence from cafes wasn’t because of set regulations but more a result of lasting historical context – women just grew up believing cafes were for men, said one of Graiouid’s past students, 21-year-old Samia. Samia’s mom, Zaina, 49, has lived in Sale most of her life and explained that throughout her childhood, the culture of women sitting in a cafe did not really exist. “In my generation cafes were not for girls,” Zaina said, through her daughter’s translation.  “If a girl goes to a cafe it means she’s a bad girl. If she goes to a cafe someone might see her and people would spread rumors about her not being a good girl – it’s bad for her reputation and her family’s reputation so she wouldn’t go.” Now things are different. “It changed completely.  Only a minority of people still think that way,” she said. She laughed and added that she is a pioneer in this change because she allows her daughters to sit in cafes.  A few decades ago, there would be hesitation and very few women saying they would go to cafes, Graiouid said when reflecting on his surveys of past students. “Now, the question barely sounds interesting,” he recalled.  “It sounds like – why are you asking this question? They don’t think about it.” Samia said she couldn’t place when exactly the shift happened, but that she and her sisters have a very different relationship with cafes than her mother or grandmother. Houda, Samia’s older sister, seconded that there is an increase in the visibility of women in cafes and added that the atmosphere and variety of cafes has changed as well.  They aren’t the smelly, loud, male-dominated spaces she remembers from when she was younger. “Personally, I would be more shocked if I don’t see women in cafes,” she said.  “This idea of women belonging in the house and that they should not go to cafes it’s something that you hear about it – like ages ago – but it’s not something you see now.”  While Zaina prefers to visit with her friends at their houses – versus in cafes – the stigma from when she was younger would no longer prevent her from sitting in one.  If the cafe was clean and nice, she would be open to going. In fact, Zaina and her daughters have a long-standing plan to visit a cafe together, but something always seems to come up, they explained. Chaimae, a friend of Hiba’s who joined us at the quiet Rabat Ville cafe in which we met, said she didn’t sit in a cafe by herself until after she had graduated from high school and an organization she joined introduced her to “another world of cafes.” Once she saw other people her own age hanging out in them, she started going all the time. “At first I was awkward, I was like, ‘I can’t go to cafes because its weird for a girl to go there.’  And then I started going out to cafes and now I go wherever I want,” she happily shared. “There has been a tremendous change in terms of how cafe space accommodates both males and females, but there is still some sort of ‘hyphenated borderlines,’” Graiouid said. While most cafes have both inside and outside seating, it’s typically the outside terrace that is more populated – and more male-dominated, specifically in traditional cafes.   Amine, 21, and a recent graduate from the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences in Rabat, recalled that his mom prefers to cross the street instead of walking in front of a cafe that has mostly male patrons. “It happened many times and I was always asking myself, ‘why does she do that?’” he said.  “After I grew up, I found out that when women pass a cafe, [the men] see her in a weird way and that’s why she prefers to pass on the other side of the street.” Traditionally, cafe terraces consist of rows of tables that fill the sidewalk and chairs that face the street, not each other, to provide cafe goers the ability to watch passerbyers and action in front of the cafe. “People would just sit there and watch – cat calling, peeking at people,” Anas said.  “Those kind of cafes only serve that purpose, but the purpose of cafes is changing overtime.” Now there are cafes for anyone to sit in – whether they’re relaxing, studying, or meeting friends. Because the cafe can “send back to stereotyped practices” – like prostitution and seduction – some cafes remain an uncomfortable place for some women, Graiouid added. The historical connotation surrounding women who go to cafes remains prevalent enough to sometimes make the space more difficult for women to inhabit even if the actual use of cafes in this way is not necessarily still present, he explained. “The stigma for girls who sit in cafes as known for getting more sexually harassed is still here, the fact that just because I’m smoking I’m more susceptible to getting sexually harassed is also still here,” Hiba said.  “But it’s just not as often and not as much – it’s changing. It’s fading a little bit.” It’s faded enough that more women feel comfortable being in a cafe, she added. Chaimae, originally in agreement with Hiba, started to reconsider how far things have really come, about halfway through our time together. “Actually, I think it is still uncomfortable to sit in cafes now if I think about it because if I’m sitting alone I always put headphones in so I don’t hear anyone talking to me,” she explained.   She added that things have even further to go outside of big cities.   When she goes to Meknes, where she grew up and where her father still lives, she doesn’t go to cafes – not due to a lack of friends to go with, but because it’s not as common to see girls sitting out in cafes. “In big cities like Rabat and Casablanca and other areas it changed.  The idea changed completely. Even if you find a group of girls and boys – it’s fine.  But in rural areas or small cities the idea still exists,” said Majda, 22, who is originally from a small town in Southern Morocco but has moved into the bigger cities for school and work. Anas, who has family living in a small town outside of Meknes, agreed that rural cafes have a longer way to go with reference to becoming a comfortable space for all people.   While traditional cafes are easy to find anywhere – rural or urban – it’s mostly in big cities, with larger populations of young people, where there is an abundance of more modern cafes.  “I think cafe culture is kind of changing, for the better for sure, but it’s really slowly and if it wasn’t for the kind of capitalistic purpose, I guess, it wouldn’t be,” Anas said. If there wasn’t an opportunity to make money, these modern cafes wouldn’t exist, he claimed.  Though he couldn’t say if modern cafes saw a market that wasn’t being catered to – in women and young people – and targeted them, or if demand by these groups, who traditional cafes might not appeal to, encouraged modern cafes to form. Graiouid agreed that the marketing strategy of a cafe matters – sports cafes traditionally draw a male-dominated crowd while more modern cafes attract more young people and women – but so does the number of cafes.   As the number of cafes increases, they become more integrated into society as a whole and accessible to more people.  Young people are drawn to cafes for a variety of reasons, but cafes’ easy accessibility makes them a convenient place to go for groups of mixed company.  It’s only “special cases” where boys and girls are able to be together at someone’s house, Hiba said. She added that cafes offer a safe place for young people to smoke for those who want to keep their habits hidden from their parents. She laughed when she shared that, even though her parents “know” she smokes and she “knows they know” and they “know she knows they know,” she still must go to cafes to have a cigarette. Over time, everything about the cafe – from the menu and the atmosphere to the clientele and the ideas they discuss – has developed, said Amine. A traditional cafe most likely will only serve coffee, tea, and orange juice, have limited decorations, and be mostly populated by retired men who sit in the same cafe each day.  In comparison, a modern cafe serves a larger variety of food and drink; often has more decorations, music, or comfortable seating; and a mix of clientele. In Anas’ opinion, the types of cafes present in a community reflect the perspectives of community members.  In rural areas, where traditional values may be stronger, there isn’t a market for modern cafes that rely more heavily on young people and women being out and about. “I hope for cafes to be opened up more to women other than limiting it only to men, especially in small towns,” Majda said.  “That really matters for me.” One’s preference in cafes depends on the person and whether they’re comfortable there, Houda and Samia agreed. When she was younger, Samia would never have imagined going to cafes alone – it was somewhere she’d always have to be with her dad.  But as she got older and discovered different kinds of cafes, this changed. Houda shared that although she believes the stigma surrounding women going to cafes is gone, she has never sat in a cafe alone. “I have this irrational fear that if I’m sitting alone somebody will come talk to me and I don’t like that.  So I just don’t go,” she said. “But it’s because of me and my personality – it’s really not because of the culture.” Though she admitted that once she did sit alone on accident – after her sister brought her along only to leave soon after with another friend – and she was fine. Samia mentioned that her friend, Hiba, could go to any cafe and be comfortable. “She would be very confident and she would sit and be herself.  I wouldn’t dare to do that. I think maybe it’s lack of confidence from my side?  And not based on gender,” she said. Your experience in a cafe depends on how you respond to the environment, according to Hiba. “I think I’ve learned to block out everything else.  That’s why I’m comfortable in cafes. I don’t give a sh*t,” she said.  “I think people sense that. I always tell them, I don’t get harassed. I think it’s just my attitude.” Both Samia and Houda avoid cafes populated by mostly men and instead prefer to head somewhere more modern, comfy, and cute, but clarified this is more personal preference than anything else. Hiba and Chaimae explained that even in male-dominated neighborhood cafes, where they might feel more uncomfortable, there are signs that things are changing. Hiba described her experience in one such cafe, saying that when she first lit her cigarette and started smoking everyone stared at her, but she pretended she did not see them.   “And that was the only time that they stared at me.  After that I became familiar and the people were nice to me,” she said.  They called this cafe, located in Sale’s old medina, a “mystery” because, despite its traditional atmosphere, it ended up being a fine place for them to go.  While Chaimae went there once and didn’t go back, Hiba said her experience made her like Sale’s old medina a little more.  “I had a very different assumption about place.  It’s the old medina and the stereotype is that they’re the more closed-minded people of the city,” she said.  “And then you find them totally fine and very polite to a girl that is smoking in a public place and that is not as covered.” To some degree, the dynamic found in cafes, specifically regarding gender, can reflect on Moroccan society more broadly – while Moroccan women are more and more visible in society, it is to an extent, said Graiouid. “I would say the presence of women in a space like a cafe would probably be equal to the presence or visibility of women in the public sphere,” he said, but clarified that there is not a way to gage this with data and one needs to be careful with the correlation. Moroccan women have significantly increased their presence in Moroccan political public sphere since 2000, when they held only 0.6 % of national parliament seats, to 2016 in which they held 20.5 % of seats, according to a report by the World Bank. Years ago the Moroccan woman couldn’t go out of her house and was prevented from doing things she wanted, Amine said. “I think those things [having more women in cafes and in public] are mainly the consequences that people are beginning to be more accepting,” he said. Even though individuals don’t go to cafes with the intention of learning how to interact with others, because cafes are a key space in which socialization occurs, they still can educate people on how to relate to others – whether in a good or bad way. In traditional cafes, it’s often the same people, with the same ideas, hanging out there everyday, Amine said, and he believes this is partly contributing to the continuation of the harassment of women in cafes. “I think it’s a toxic thing to keep doing the same thing everyday,” Amine said of the stereotypical older men spending day after day in the same cafe. “I think that’s why they act like that and you find them really weird.” Zaina emphasized it is important not to generalize the population because there are some men who never sit in cafes. “People are beginning to bring in new things or bring in new ideas to the concept of the cafe.” Amine added, “I hope in the near future I will find all the cafes are the same as I imagine – I don’t want to see the cafes full of men.  I want to see them mixed and with all generations.”

Rabat – On Tuesday, July 30, 2019, Morocco will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the coronation of its monarch, King Mohammed VI. Since ascending to the throne, King Mohammed has worked to institute, accelerate, and solidify a wide range of social, democratic, and economic reforms in the country.  These developments aimed to improve the lives of millions of Moroccans and to reinforce the Kingdom’s overall stability and socio-political infrastructure.   Not long after ascending to the throne, King Mohammed delivered a speech to Morocco’s citizens, promising to tackle the country’s poor economy and corrupt practices. He also vowed to create new jobs, and improve the country’s human rights record. For the past 20 years, King Mohammed’s efforts to alleviate poverty have had some success. He has further encouraged foreign relations and has consolidated a number of significant political advances, including those that curtailed his own powers and strengthened the Moroccan parliament. His most critical achievements, noted throughout his reign, have been globally acknowledged by the international community. King Hassan II’s 38-year rule, from 1961 to 1999, left questions over the country’s human rights record, including decades of imprisonment without trial. King Mohammed strove to improve Morocco’s previously poor reputation in this area.  The new king established the 2004 Moroccan Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission (IER), an independent reconciliation commission which investigated human rights violations. King Mohammed accepted the commission’s recommendations and granted financial compensation to more than 5,000 aggrieved Moroccans to the tune of $100 million. As a result, political prisoners were released. Non-governmental organizations were legalized, and now operate under the legal framework and aim to provide a buffer between citizens and the state. In a recent interview, Amina Bouayach, the president of Morocco’s National Human Rights Council (CNDH) stated that “there are no political prisoners” in Morocco and that torture is no longer practiced in prisons or police stations in the country. “The option to defend and promote human rights has been consolidated at the legislative level, through the creation of mechanisms and also through public spaces of expression; that is, [Morocco] already has the legislative, constitutional and public framework,” Bouayach said. In 2004, King Mohammed instituted a new family code for Morocco; the Moudawana. The Moudawana is one of the most dynamic and progressive laws related to women and family rights ever established in the Arab world. The code radically granted women joint responsibility of the family with their husbands, as well as equal rights in marriage and access to property upon divorce. During the reign of King Mohammed’s father, Hassan II, women were “politically” equal to men, but today they also have social and civic equality. The code promoted women’s participation in politics as well as society. As of today, 17% of Morocco’s parliamentary seats are occupied by women, an astonishing increase from just 1% 15 years ago. In 2005, King Mohammed established the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) to alleviate poverty, vulnerability, and social exclusion in Morocco. According to King Mohammed, the program’s main objective was to “ensure a better distribution of growth and better living conditions for Morocco’s citizens.” The project was composed of four components; to alleviate poverty in rural areas, to mitigate social exclusion in urban areas, to curb extreme vulnerability, and finally to strengthen institutional capacity. The program had a budget of 10 billion MAD (about $900 million) distributed over five years, 2006-2010. For the urban program, committees at the local level identified 264 urban neighborhoods with the greatest needs in the30 Moroccan cities to benefit from the initiative.  The World Bank supported the project through a $100 million loan and a further a $7 million grant to allow for greater access to water supply and sanitation in three poverty ravaged cities. The INDH is widely acclaimed as a success. In 2010 the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised the program, saying that its “significant results” will efficiently help all Moroccan citizens, especially the poor. King Mohammed has expanded Morocco’s ties with the African continent and the Middle East and has reinforced the country’s long-standing alliance with the US.  Today, Morocco has cooperation agreements with several countries across Africa, further promoting economic development, security, and religious moderation. The leadership of King Mohammed VI and his steadfast commitment to promoting the values of tolerance, inter-religious dialogue, and coexistence, at home and abroad, have become a distinctive feature of Morocco over the last two decades. King Mohammed VI has advocated on multiple occasions for countries working together to achieve a new world order for peace while highlighting the need for coexistence and tolerance of diversity. Some of the King’s initiatives in the religious field include the establishment of the Mohammed VI Institute for Training Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates, and the Mohammed VI Foundation for African Ulema in 2015. Morchidines and Morchidates aim to properly equip Imams from Mali, Libya, Tunisia, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, the Maldives and Nigeria to combat religious extremism. The organization has trained 1,391 African Imams since its creation. The African Ulema was established to help preserve the values of authentic Islamic tolerance.  “Those who engage in terrorism, in the name of Islam, are not Muslims. Their only link to Islam is the pretexts they use to justify their crimes and their folly. They have strayed from the right path, and their fate is to dwell forever in hell”, said King Mohammed in a speech on August 2016, condemning the acts of religious extremism. “They think – out of ignorance – that they are engaging in jihad. Since when has jihad been synonymous with killing innocent people? The Almighty says: “Do not transgress limits, for Allah loves not transgressors.” In May 2019, the commissioner of the Bahraini Ministry of Justice, Islamic Affairs and Waqf, Farid Ben Yaakoub Al Miftah, praised the leading role King Mohammed VI plays in the accomplishment of peace and counter-extremism in the region. Al Miftah noted that the crucial role King Mohammed VI has played in consolidating the values ​​of tolerance and spiritual rapprochement have upheld the real image of Islam. “As Commander of the Faithful and defender of the faith, I am committed to protecting the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims alike”, said the Sovereign in a speech delivered in 2016. In 2010, King Mohammed VI initiated a program to rehabilitate hundreds of ancient synagogues and Jewish cemeteries scattered throughout Morocco. Since then, the kingdom has spent millions of dollars to repair nearly 200 of these sites. Christian residents in Morocco and temporary visitors have always practiced their faith freely in churches. The visit by Pope Francis in March 2018 underlined the King’s tolerant religious scheme and Morocco’s international role in inter-faith dialogue. In 2015, King Mohammed introduced the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) to monitor security threats across the country and join the efforts of foreign security agencies in countering terrorism. According to the BCIJ, between 2015 and 2018, Morocco dismantled 57 terrorist cells and arrested 3,129 suspects, 292 of whom had criminal records. The country’s security forces also foiled 361 terrorist actions. One recent report revealed that Morocco has adopted efficient counter-terrorism and de-radicalization approaches which have proved more efficient than those applied in Egypt and Tunisia. In a recent interview, the head of BCIJ, Abdelhak El Khiame, said that Morocco always offers to share its strategy in the area with European partners. This has helped them to impede “several attacks in several countries, including France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and Belgium.” “This professionalism has given more value to the Moroccan security services that are still receiving requests from their European counterparts,” El Khiame said. In 2018, under the King’s initiative, Morocco launched the “moussalaha” (reconciliation) program, a multidimensional policy aiming at the reintegration of prisoners in society and the modernization of security institutions. At the request of King Mohammed VI, Morocco offered royal pardon to several defendants convicted of terror-related crimes. Many former terror suspects applied to join the program. In 2015, King Mohammed VI pardoned a group of 37 Salafi detainees who had been convicted of terrorism charges, including Sheikh Hassan al-Khattab.  According to a statement by the Ministry of Justice, the pardon came “when they officially declared their loyalty to principles of the nation, its holy sites, and national institutions, and after we reviewed their ideological positions and tendencies and they renounced extremism and terrorism.”    These pardons indicate a shift in the country’s approach to the Salafi jihadi issue. This marks an overall improvement in the relationship between a number of Salafi figures and the regime, and a restructuring of some components of the government’s approach to combat extremism.  In terms of security, the government’s strategy of using Sufism to confront extremist Salafism has fallen short. Therefore, decision-makers, under the King’s intervention, are leaning toward a policy of greater acceptance of Salafism, attempting to reconcile it with the Sufi character. Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the most recent initiative towards the resolution of the West Sahara conflict. The proposed solution to the conflict was presented by King Mohammed to the UN in April 2007.  In a letter to Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, the King confirmed Morocco’s commitment to a consensual solution to end the dispute over the Saharan territory. In the same letter, the King informed the UN Secretary-General that Morocco was preparing to submit an Autonomy Project within the framework of the territorial integrity and the national unity of the nation. After the Autonomy Plan was successfully devised, King Mohammed VI re-established the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS). CORCAS then visited several countries to present Morocco’s objectives. A number of international countries welcomed Morocco’s plan as the best possible solution to the four-decade-long conflict. Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, entitled “The Moroccan Initiative for Negotiating an Autonomy for Statute for the Sahara Region,” is the fruit of a dialogue with the local populations and political parties over the ongoing issue. This initiative offers autonomy to the inhabitants of Western Sahara under the sovereignty of Morocco. It aims at reconciling the Kingdom’s territorial integrity with respect to the people’s need to manage their own affairs. The solution consists of an “extended autonomy” which is aimed to satisfy the aspirations of the Saharawi populations by respecting their cultural identity while it simultaneously defends the territorial unity of Morocco. Under the plan, the autonomous region would be given the prerogative to run its affairs democratically, through legislative, executive, and judicial bodies enjoying exclusive powers. According to King Mohammed VI, Morocco’s challenge over the West Sahara conflict is to reclaim the “Moroccanness” of the disputed territory. To do so, the King said that Moroccans, especially the diplomats and officials working to convince the global community on Morocco’s position over the issue, should equip themselves with “clarity” with regards to history and “far-sightedness” concerning present and future challenges. “The group for the territorial integrity of Morocco” issued a statement to reiterate its support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan at the 41st session of the Human Rights Council in June 2019. The group’s member countries are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, Jordan, Comoros, Gabon, Burundi, Djibouti, Senegal, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Guinea. Finding a solution for the conflict, according to the group, will make it “possible to realize the aspirations of the African and Arab peoples for integration and development.” In May 2019, 13 members of the Security Council supported the adoption of Resolution 2486, which extended the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping operation, in Western Sahara for six months. French Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Anne Gueguen, said that it is critical for the four parties involved in the conflict to “continue their discussions in a constructive state of mind and compromise to reach a realistic, pragmatic, just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution in accordance with Security Council resolutions.” “I take this opportunity to reaffirm that France considers the 2007 Moroccan Autonomy Plan as a serious and credible basis for discussions,” Gueguen said.  Côte d’Ivoire, a non-permanent member of the Security Council, also welcomed the adoption of Resolution 2468. Kuwait, a non-permanent member of the Security Council, has also backed Morocco’s territorial integrity, expressing respect of Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed region. Morocco’s late King Hassan II decided to withdraw the country from the AU in 1984, after the pan-African organization publicly acknowledged the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as a member state. The “empty chair” policy that Morocco had adopted since it left the Organization of African Unity (today’s African Union), has done more harm than good to its stance on Western Sahara and its relationships with the continent’s nations.  After the re-admission of Morocco during the 28th Summit of the African Union, King Mohammed VI delivered a speech, underlying the position of Morocco in Africa.  The monarch discussed the projects created to solidify South-South partnership as well as Morocco’s initiative to provide Sub-Saharan immigrants emergency assistance. “It was necessary to withdraw from the AU; it has enabled Morocco’s action to be refocused in Africa,” King Mohammed VI said in 2017. “We have thought it through carefully and it is now so obvious!” he added. “It is time to return home; at a time when the Kingdom is among the most developed African nations and when a majority of Member States looks forward to our return, we have decided to join our family again.” King Mohammed VI’s tour to three key countries in East Africa in 2017, all of which have diplomatic relations with the Polisario, confirmed Morocco’s foreign policy orientation that the best way to fight the Polisario and its backers is from inside the African Union. The agreements the King signed with Rwanda, Tanzania and Ethiopia showed that Morocco sought to turn the economy, infrastructure, and agricultural projects into the cornerstones of its relationships with the East African countries.  By rendering the economy into the main tool of Morocco’s foreign policy in Africa, King Mohammed VI managed to strengthen the country’s position as one of the major players on the continent, as well as to indicate that the country is determined to break away from the “empty chair” policy it had implemented over the past four decades. Tolerance is not just a rhetorical aspect of Morocco’s domestic and foreign policy. The country stood out in the African continent as the sole country that has implemented migration policies offering residency status to migrants. Morocco has “welcomed people coming from sister nations to this African land, with their different religions, cultures, traditions, family habits and lifestyles,” King Mohammed said. Under the King’s initiative, the North African country organized two campaigns for migrants to regularize their status and launched several programs to ensure the proper integration of migrants, asylum-seekers and their families. In 2011, King Mohammed proposed constitutional reforms. These included amendments to reduce his political powers, devolve more privileges to the regions, and solidify the parliament’s authority.  Through the application of the 2011 reforms, King Mohammed managed to reach his ultimate goal which was no other than to consolidate democracy in Morocco. The new Constitution was adopted by a national referendum. The referendum officially transformed Morocco into a constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliament and separation of powers.  These changes have allowed the North African country to mark significant progress and flourish in a wide variety of sectors, compared to other nations in the Arab world.  Morocco has sculpted a system of governance which renders the country unique in the Middle East region, as well as well known in the international community. Morocco’s achievements and growth bear the 20-year-old signature of its King; Mohammed VI.

Rabat – Humanitarian Doctor Zouhair Lahna has announced his decision to return to the middle east to continue his aid work in conflict zones. Lahna is a French-Moroccan doctor who has spent 20 years of his life helping and caring for people who are affected by war in conflict zones across the world. The doctor has also launched humanitarian projects in Morocco to assist those in need. This includes refugees fleeing war in their countries of origin. Doctor Lahna, however, admitted that he faced multiple challenges while operating in Morocco. Sadly Lahna feels that he cannot realize his ambitions for humanitarian aid in Morocco. He blames the lack of progress in the health sector for this. However, the doctor did not deny that he enjoyed spending 85 % of his time in charity work in Morocco after his initial return from Palestine in 2014. Doctor Lahna says that he cannot regret the moments he spends helping any patient  Prior to his decision to leave Morocco, the doctor shared his love for volunteer work in an interview with Morocco World News at his home in Bouskoura, Casablanca.  For Dr. Lahna, volunteering is not a hobby or a vanity project but a calling and a human duty. “I received my academic training in France, where I gained an important experience. I had to apply what I had learned to helping people all over the world, especially in my native country, Morocco.” The 50-year-old father of four received his academic training in Casablanca and then in France, where he specialized in gynecology and obstetrics. Immediately after graduating from medical school, Lahna decided to dedicate his time to humanitarian work. He started volunteering as a surgeon with Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in 1998, and had the opportunity to work in a number of African and Arab countries, including Ethiopia, the Comoros, and Rwanda. After a brief experience in Afghanistan in 2002, Dr. Lahna took on one of the most influential experiences in his personal and professional life. Together with colleagues at MSF, he responded to the needs of people in the West Bank who are under Israeli aggression and siege. Over the past 12 years, the surgeon visited Palestine seven times—four trips to the West Bank and three to the Gaza Strip. It was during his  first experience in Jenin area in the northern West Bank where he provided training courses in laparoscopies. During the Israeli siege and bombing in the Gaza Strip, hospitals experienced great pressure. The number of urgent cases admitted in these hospitals reached more than 50 cases per day, an unusually high level of admissions compared with other hospitals internationally. Dr. Lahna comments on the situation: “War alone means death, let alone if this war is accompanied by harsh weather conditions and siege.” The doctor admitted that his experiences in Palestine have had a great impact on strengthening his sense of altruism and duty. “When I returned from Gaza,” he said, “I decided to allocate 80 percent of my time to volunteering. Life is very short; I have to devote a part of it to help victims of war.”  Two months after he left the Gaza Strip, the surgeon went on to visit Syria nine times, mostly in the province of Idlib to discover that the situation in Syria was “much more difficult than Gaza,” he said. “Statistics show that about 780 health facilities have been bombed and hundreds of doctors have been killed under the rubble of hospitals,” he told Morocco World News. Last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that “[s]even years of conflict have devastated Syria’s healthcare system. More than half of the country’s public hospitals and healthcare centers are closed or only partially functioning.” The number of people in need of health assistance has exceeded “11.3 million people, including 3 million living with injuries and disabilities.” “The regime considers all the doctors alike, whether you agree or disagree with it,” he said. “Everyone who helps Syrians belongs to the opposition,” he says. After the bombing of medical facilities, “all foreign doctors left [the country] for fear of the regime, and only two doctors stayed with me: one French and one English.” The possibility of injury or personal danger did not prevent those who chose to remain in Syria from continuing to assist the victims of the bombing. “Despite the difficulty of the situation, the experience included a positive dimension. I worked with a big association called the Union of Syrian Relief Organizations,” he added. Dr. Lahna’s experiences as a rescue doctor and an instructor made him see life through a less rigid perspective— free from the limitations of politics, and the dichotomy life and death, individual and community, or  “I” and “them.” He decided to undertake individual initiatives in the beginning of 2011: “I chose to volunteer on my own because I felt that international organizations were tightening up on me and limiting my freedom to go to all areas of conflict in Syria and Yemen.” “International organizations are working in these areas with local doctors because they do not want foreign doctors to be in danger. They also prevent doctors from talking to the media,” he said. “I almost work in the same fashion as these organizations, but I do not care about insurance, accidents, death, etc.” Dr. Lahna could not turn a blind eye to the suffering of Yemeni people caught between the civil war and the Saudi-UAE-lead coalition, which imposed a land, air, and sea blockade on Yemen following the military intervention that started in March 2015. The blockade has inflicted untold damage on the living conditions of the Yemenis. It caused a humanitarian catastrophe and contributed to the deterioration of various sectors, including  health, to the extent that the United Nations declared in April 2018 that “Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” In 2016, the United Nations reported that 600 medical facilities had been closed due to the conflict as well as the lack of basic equipment and medical personnel. Besides which, 70 medical facilities had been destroyed entirely. Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen Johannes van der Klaauw stated in May 2014 that over half the country’s population was in need of humanitarian aid. In November 2017, the World Health Organization stated that the number of people suspected of cholera in Yemen had reached nearly half a million people. The lack of access to health facilities due to bombing has proved a powerful weapon against Yemeni civilians. The war has disrupted 50 percent of health facilities and medical personnel in 18 percent of all districts in Yemen, according to the United Nations. After many attempts, Dr. Lahna was able to enter Yemeni soil in 2018. “After I was tired of trying, I went to Bangladesh in a relief initiative for Rohingya Muslims, and there I met a young Syrian working for an American organization operating in Yemen.” After a period of research and planning, he was able to visit Al-Jouf and Marib hospitals, collaborating with a local foundation called Hayat for Relief. In addition to relief work, Zouhair shared his expertise with local medical staff in Yemen through the training of two teams on relief operations and obstetric surgery; as many as 30 doctors and nurses benefited from the training. “When I train a group of doctors in a particular place, I leave and I am reassured that I have left [behind] doctors able to provide help for the injured.” Dr. Lahna has established a private clinic in the city of Casablanca in Morocco offering free treatment services to two categories of patients: the poor and refugees coming to Morocco. He recently established Injab Center in collaboration with a foundation bearing the same name in France and Morocco. Injab Center is a women’s reproductive health center that targets the health and safety of infants and lactating women. “Women are the backbone of society, that’s why I chose to save the life of the mother and the fetus.” He also contributed to the development of volunteerism where he grew up and many Moroccans call him “the doctor of the poor.” “I come from a social class that is deprived of basic health care, so the issue of paying attention to this simple class is very important to me. Medicine is my only weapon; it is the  means I have chosen to help people in need.” Being a volunteer doctor in various countries to rescue victims in areas of conflict made him criticize the Arab rulers’ silence towards the suffering of victims.  “I regret the lack of solidarity in the Arab countries which reveals the absence of any vision among Arab officials who do not consider that they may live the same strife and pain at any moment.”

Rabat – The US Department of State has issued its 2019 Investment Climate Statements, which generally showcased a positive stance on Morocco’s business. In its overview, the report extolled Morocco’s geographic location and its strategy for attracting international investors. The executive summary of the report reads that Morocco “enjoys  political stability, robust infrastructure, and a strategic location, which have contributed to its emergence as a regional manufacturing and export base for international companies.” The Government of Morocco has implemented a series of strategies aimed at boosting employment, attracting foreign investment, and raising performance and output in key revenue-earning sectors, such as the automotive and aerospace industries.  With several ports and investment zones, Morocco has attracted renowned international operations specialized in several fields, including the automotive and infrastructure industries. The automotive and aeronautical industries are  significant assets as they play an intrinsic role in Morocco’s economy. The aeronautic sector is active with more than 120 companies, generating direct annual revenues of more than $1 billion in 2015. The sector also creates more than 11,000 direct job opportunities, a number that contributes 8.5% to Morocco’s total employment. The report also unveiled Morocco’s successful strategy to attract investors through  facilitating foreign investment This is especially relevant in “export sectors like  manufacturing, through macro-economic policies, trade liberalization, investment incentives, and structural reforms.” Regional business hub The executive summary indicates that the North African country seeks to position itself as a regional business hub, owing to its status and location at” the tri-regional focal point of Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.” The report indicates that Morocco attracts the “fifth-most foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa, a figure that increased 23 percent in 2017.” South Africa’s leading newspaper Daily Maverick published an opinion piece by Gregg Mills, in which he  described Morocco as the modern face of a modern Africa. In the opinion piece, the author celebrated  King Mohammed VI’s leadership, which, he said, has led Morocco towards development and radical reforms. The report also emphasized the success of Morocco’s royal vision and commitments to Africa. “Morocco’s return to the African Union in January 2017 and the launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) in March 2018 provide Morocco further opportunities to promote foreign investment and trade and accelerate economic development,” the report said. Unemployment Despite the  reforms and the political stability, the report acknowledged that the country faces challenges in several fields, including the “insufficient skilled labor,” and unemployment. The report cited press releases from the High Commission for Planning (HCP), stating that unemployment was 9.8% at the end of 2018. The report recalled that “unemployment among youth aged 15 to 24” hover around “40 % in some urban areas.” The document also cited Morocco’s strategy to integrate more students into the vocational training programs as a means to curb unemployment. “The government opened 27 such training centers between 2015 and 2018 and nearly doubled the number of students receiving scholarships for training between 2017 and 2018,”  the report said.  US-Morocco FTA agreement The report also claimed that the US Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is bearing its fruit for both parties. The US and Morocco signed the FTA in 2006. It came into effect  on January 1, 2006.

Rabat – The Moroccan economy is on track and performing well, and prospects for next year are even more encouraging, according to the Moroccan government. Speaking at a press briefing yesterday, July 25, on Morocco’s economic performance for this year and expectations in terms of economic growth, Mustapha El Khalfi, the spokesperson for the Moroccan government, gave an upbeat reading of Morocco’s current and expected economic trajectories. “Economic growth prospects for 2020 indicate that there will be improvements,” El Khalfi asserted. He noted that the economic growth rate for this year rate is expected to stand at 2.9%. For next year, that rate will increase to 3.7%. He went on: “This year has so far been marked by an improvement in the budget deficit, both in terms of rates and financial values.”  According to statistics from the government, the country’s budget deficit for this year went down by MAD 4.5 billion, decreasing from MAD 21.1 billion in 2018 to 16.6 billion last month.  The Moroccan official also explained the country’s plan to cement nationwide financial security, saying that the government is striving to keep its budget deficit rates at 3% for both this year and coming years. The news comes as international observers shower Morocco’s economy with praise of resilience and business-friendliness.  Christian de Boissieu, economist and emeritus professor at the University of Paris I, told La Tribune Afrique earlier this week that, compared to other economies in its region, Morocco is “more resilient to external shocks.” While the country remains vulnerable to, and dependent on, global dynamics and worldwide commodity price fluctuations, structural reforms in the past two decades have made Morocco’s economy more resilient.  “External constraints remain strong, but internal public policy choices have played a major role” in terms of building resilience, the Paris-based economist said of Morocco.

Rabat – A photo capturing the moment a young Syrian girl saved her sister from falling off the edge of a destroyed building is causing shock worldwide. The father of the girls can be seen screaming in horror as his five-year-old daughter, Riham, pulls her 7-month-old sister Tuqa up by her shirt to stop her from falling from the rubble. The photo was captured on Wednesday by local media activist group SY24 in the Syrian town of Ariha, Idlib province, following an airstrike conducted by government forces. After the picture was taken, the girls were freed from the ruins and after being taken initially to a local clinic, they were transferred to a larger hospital in Idlib. Five-year-old Riham tragically died from her injuries in the hospital and Tuqa remains in the intensive care unit, according to SY-24.  Their mother, Asmaa Naqouhl, was killed at the scene. Her husband and father to the girls, Amjad al-Abdullah survived. The family is one of many devastated recently by the intensifying airstrikes in the region. According to the UN last week, more than 350 civilians had been killed and 330,000 forced to flee their homes since the fighting escalated on April 29. The situation is especially deadly to children, according to human rights organizations in the region. In a statement on Wednesday, NGO Save The Children its partner organization Hurras Network reported that the past few weeks have been more deadly for children than all over last year combined. “Save the Children and Hurras Network can confirm that at least 33 children have been killed since June 24, compared to 31 children killed during all of 2018,” said the statement. “The current situation in Idlib is a nightmare. The injuries we are seeing are horrific. It’s clear that once again children have been killed and injured in indiscriminate attacks,” said Sonia Khush, Save the Children Syria response director. “The bombardment is relentless. It seems as though the different sides have stopped fighting each other and are fighting us, civilians, now. It’s just senseless brutality,” one anonymous eyewitness, told Save the Children. “I saw dozens of people killed in the marketplace, torn to pieces, including many young children who were playing on the street. They should have been safe,” the eyewitness continued. The heartbreaking photo of the family is causing shockwaves across the world and drawing renewed attention to the Syria crisis. A disturbing photo that circulated in 2015 had the same effect. The photo showed the body of a 3-year-old Syrian boy, named Alan Kurdi, who drowned off the Greek island of Kos. The image defined the Syrian refugee crisis, shocked EU leaders, and led to increased concerns about the refugee crisis.

Rabat –  Can arts preserve national identity and heritage? For Minister delegate in Charge of Moroccans Living Abroad (MRE) and Migration Affairs Abdelkrim Benatiq art is not only entertainment, but also a means to preserve and promote national identity. At a press conference held in Skhirat, in  the outskirts of Rabat on July 25, Benatiq’s ministry convened senior officials, cinema experts, and theater staff to celebrate the launch of a  300 performance theater tour designed for Moroccan diaspora. In a statement to the attendees, Benatiq said that the ultimate goal of the initiative is to “preserve the identity of Moroccans of the world.” “I am happy to  contribute, along with the Head of Government [Saad Eddine El Othmani] and the Minister of Culture [Mohamed Laaraj] (…) to the launch of the theater tour for the benefit of Moroccans oversees,” Benatiq said in his statement. Benatiq explained that the government deals with the issues of Moroccan diaspora in accordance with three key aspects. The first key element, is a special royal attention to MREs. He added that Morocco’s 2011 Constitution also emphasizes the importance of preserving the rights of MREs. Article 16 of the constitution stipulates that Morocco works for the “protection of the rights and legitimate interests of the  Moroccan citizens [feminine] and citizens [masculine] resident abroad, within respect for international law and for the laws in force in the host countries.”   The same article indicates that the country is committed to the “maintenance and to the development of their human ties, notably, cultural, with the kingdom, and the preservation of their national identity.” The official said that the third and last of the three aspects adopted to preserve the rights of MREs is the government program. The  minister said that his department, along with other government institutions, seeks to implement the program based on initiatives and projects for the benefit of the diaspora. “These three constants are translated into goals. The first goal is to fortify the identity of Moroccans oversees.” The minister estimated the number of the Moroccan diaspora at over five million. He said that the  Moroccan presence in Europe is stronger than on other continents. Benatiq also commended the contribution of MREs to the economic development of Morocco. The 2019 Migration and Remittances report from the World Bank expressed positive expectations on the inflow of remittances from the  Moroccan diaspora. The diaspora  remittances hit $7.4 Billion in Morocco in 2018. Every year, Morocco receives thousands of MREs, who come annually to visit their relatives. A significant proportion of Moroccans oversees choose the sea route as a way to cross Europe to Morocco annually. In 2018, a total of 842,698 passengers entered Morocco through Tangier Med from June to August, according to Tangier Med Port Authority. The port is expecting a transit of more than 5,000 vehicles and 18,000 passengers from July 27 and August 8. Arts preserve national identity The minister delegate of MREs and migration affairs also spoke about the goals of the launch of  the theater tour. The 300 performances will be in Arabic and Tamazight (berber). The tour, according to Benatiq, is part of a  national strategy to tackle all issues related to the diaspora. “Through these theater performances, we aim to protect the identity of Moroccans abroad. Moroccans are always connected to their roots,” he said. The official also emphasized the importance of art, especially theater, and its role to “fortify the identity of the Moroccans of the world.” He said that the upcoming theater performances received positive reactions from thousands of Moroccans oversees.

Rabat – Police in Worcester, central England, have sparked controversy after officers were involved in a revealing “Walking While Black” incident. UK newspaper, The Independent reported earlier this week that members of the Worcester police force followed and handcuffed Vanylson Silva, a fourteen-year-old black boy, while he was on his way to the local church. “As he entered the building,” the newspaper explained, referring to Silva, “officers who had been following him, grabbed his arm and handcuffed him.” Vanessa Santos, the boy’s mother, said that police only released her teenage son after members of the church he was entering explained that the boy is a known member of the church. They added that he is actually one of the volunteers doing community work before and after church services.  While she was happy that her boy was released on the spot and did not have to undergo the distress of police interrogation, Santos lashed out at the police for arbitrarily arresting the boy in the first place. She especially lamented the fact that the police offered no apology or acceptable explanation after the incident. “The church workers told the police he was a volunteer. They uncuffed him and left, without even an apology,” she said. “I just think it is harsh the way they dealt with it. There was no reason for him to be cuffed at 14 years old. What would you expect a young boy to be doing inside a church on a Sunday morning?” A subsequent statement from the Worcester police later indicated that the reason for the incident was because of “drug dealing concerns” in the area. The boy looked suspicious, police explained.  “Police were patrolling on St Paul’s Street in Worcester on Sunday morning when they saw a member of the public acting suspiciously,” Inspector David Troth said. Troth explained that officers decided to arrest the boy for a search due to his “behavior and concerns about drug dealing in the local area.” Without offering an apology, he went on to point out that officers however immediately released after they “were made aware the individual had legitimate reason for being in the area and determined that no offenses had taken place and grounds to continue with any subsequent search no longer existed.”  In response, the boy’s mother said that the event left him “embarrassed and distressed.” She said he is a “normal boy” who plays with friends of his age “but knows to keep away from boys that smoke and drink.” For the mother, the boy’s skin color was the primary reason why police officers thought he was suspicious. “I prepare my son and tell him that with our skin color, unfortunately we are labeled. I tell him that people will react in different ways and some people will be nice to him, but others will not be so nice,” she said.

Rabat – Two boats, estimated to be carrying between 250 and 300 people, have capsized in the Mediterranean sea off the coast of Libya, leaving over 100 dead. Ayoub Qasim, a spokesman for Libya’s coastguard, told Associated Press that the boats sunk around 120 kilometers east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. He confirmed that 134 people were rescued on Thursday, July 25, but at least 115 others are missing, feared drowned. Authorities are in the process of recovering the bodies. The people who were on board the boats are believed to be from a number of Arab and African countries. However, both the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimate the number of dead to be higher, at over 150 people.  🚨Urgent: tragic shipwreck may have occurred in the central mediterranean.
Nearly 150 migrants are reported missing and 145 more returned to Libyan shore. — IOM Libya (@IOM_Libya) July 25, 2019  Filippo Grandi, the head of UNHCR, has called the devastating incident “the worst Mediterranean tragedy of this year.” The worst Mediterranean tragedy of this year has just occurred. Restoring rescue at sea, ending refugee+migrant detention in Libya, increasing safe pathways out of Libya must happen NOW, before it is too late for many more desperate people. https://t.co/XuZJpDtZfv — Filippo Grandi (@RefugeesChief) July 25, 2019  He also called on the EU to resume its operations in order to prevent any more tragedies such as this one. The EU suspended rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea in March, following disagreements over how rescued migrants should be divided between the member states, Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the UN, echoed a similar sentiment, calling for “safe, legal routes for migrants and refugees.” I am horrified by reports that about 150 people died in a shipwreck off the coast of Libya. We need safe, legal routes for migrants and refugees. Every migrant searching for a better life deserves safety and dignity. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) July 25, 2019  UNHCR estimates that 164 people died on the route between Libya and Europe in the first four months of 2019, making this most recent tragedy with a death toll of up 150 by the worst this year. In May, after 65 people drowned when their boat sank off the coast of Tunisia, the UNHCR Special Envoy for the Mediterranean, Vincent Cochetel, warned against the dangers of stopping rescue and patrol efforts in the region. “Across the region, we need to strengthen the capacity of search and rescue operations,” said Cochetel. “If we don’t act now, we’re almost certain to see more tragic events in the coming weeks and months.”

Rabat – The UN has adopted a Morocco-drafted resolution on counter-terrorism and interfaith dialogue.   The resolution, which was adopted yesterday, July 25, is a resounding statement about Morocco’s growing reputation as a fortress against religious fundamentalism, extremist discourse, and terrorism, Morocco’s state-owned outlet MAP reported earlier today.  “The general consensus over this resolution and its backing by 90 countries from different regions of the world and with different cultural and religious sensibilities is a testimony to Morocco’s credibility on the world scene as a promoter of [religious] dialogue and tolerance,” the Moroccan paper wrote. The text of the resolution is a firm condemnation of all fundamentalist interpretations of religion. According to the resolution, extremism inevitably breeds social exclusion, political abuse of minority rights, and violence against those who hold different views. Omar Hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative at the UN said that political or religious extremism erodes the notions of tolerance, individual freedoms, peace, and cultural cohabitation. Extremism, he elaborated, thrives on the exclusion and the criminalization of difference by investing in hate discourses. “Its goal is to incite exclusion, provokes division in society, stirs conflicts, and fuels terrorism and anarchy,” Hilale said of extremism. The Moroccan representative noted that Morocco has, in recent years, put massive efforts in countering radical discourses, preventing terrorist plots, and “building bridges.”  Morocco’s “credibility” as a bastion of counter-terrorism, interfaith dialogue, and religious cohabitation, of which Hilale effusively spoke, is the fruit of a host of reforms in the country’s security apparatus and official religious discourse.  Most notably, Morocco is increasingly becoming an exporter of “tolerant Islam.” The country’s Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, has become a continental Mecca, with many African—and increasingly European—countries sending students to be schooled in the tradition of what observers have called the “next generation of Imam.” But perhaps the latest defense, or proof, of Morocco’s newfound reputation as an oasis of religious cohabitation is Pope Francis’s interfaith-themed visit to the country in late March.  A telling episode of that visit came when the Pope and King Mohammed VI visited the Mohammed VI Institute for Training Imams and an orchestra graced the audience with an interfaith-themed performance of a vocal arrangement fusing the Muslim call to prayer, a Jewish prayer, and the Catholic “Ave Maria.” The episode elicited scathing criticism in conservative circles. As far as Moroccan authorities—and in particular King Mohammed VI—were concerned, however, both the papal visit and the unapologetically interfaith-inspired performances that greeted it spoke of Morocco as a country that takes pride in its cultural and religious diversity.

Rabat – Fitch Solutions, a foundation which provides credit and macro intelligence solutions, forecast a marginal narrowing of Morocco’s budget deficit in its July 24 commentary, “Privatization To Lift Morocco’s Government Revenue.” The foundation reported that Morocco’s budget deficit would shrink to 3.6% of GDP in 2019, and 3.5% in 2020, from an estimated 3.7% in 2018. Fitch Solutions estimated that the privatization of state-owned assets will lift the country’s revenue. The foundation also expects the Moroccan government to introduce more generous spending measures over the coming quarters due to risks of social unrest. However, both measures would mean a slow pace of deficit reduction. Privatization of State assets According to the commentary, Morocco’s plans to privatize public companies will allow the government to “increase spending without raising taxes.” “The Moroccan authorities will move forward with a planned sale of an 8% stake in telecommunication firm Maroc Telecom, selling 6% to local institutional investors and 2% on the Casablanca stock exchange in 2019,” says Fitch Solutions.  “This move will generate substantial revenue gains, likely close to $1 billion according to government estimates,” adds the commentary. Other privatization prospects include La Mamounia hotel and the Tahaddart power plant. New Taxes in 2019 Fitch Solutions predicts that the new taxes enforced in 2019 will have a positive impact on Morocco’s revenue. The foundation’s “preliminary estimates point to 4.5% growth in tax revenues in the first six months of 2019 compared to a year earlier.” They link this change to a number of newly introduced taxes, such as “a 2.5% social solidarity contribution on firms with earnings exceeding MAD 40 billion (in place until the end of 2020) and excise taxes on sugary drinks and tobacco.” Government solutions to social unrest “We believe the government will continue to introduce more generous spending measures in a bid to temper social unrest,” said Fitch Solutions. The foundation mentions that the Moroccan government responded to recent labor union protests by “introducing a public sector wage hike and an increase in government-funded family allowances of up to $30 per family.” Morocco faces limited risks Fitch Solutions concluded that, overall, Morocco’s fiscal trajectory will face limited risks. The commentary recalls that “Morocco’s government debt-to-GDP ratio came in at 65.3% of GDP in 2018,” forecasting an increase to 66.7% in 2019 and 68.0% in 2020.

Rabat – Following the July 24 landslide in El Haouz region, the authorities were able to uncover the bodies of 15 people on July 25.

Rabat – The US Administration shared a memo to inform its citizens of the government’s decision to authorize the import of fresh raspberries from Morocco. In a statement, the US government said that based on “the findings of a pest risk analysis, which we made available to the public for review and comment, we have determined that the application for one or more designated phytosanitary measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of introduction of disseminating plant pests or noxious weeds via the importation of raspberries from Morocco.” Prior to the authorization, the US government also published a justification statement to support the importation of raspberry fruit. The supporting statement said that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) proposed to amend the regulations concerning the importation of fruits and vegetables to allow the importation of fresh raspberry fruit from Morocco into the continental United States.” APHIS made the public aware that the “the raspberries would have to be produced under a systems approach employing a combination of mitigation measures for the quarantine pest Monilinia fructigena” as  a condition of entry. The product should also be  inspected prior to exportation from Morocco and “found free of this pest.” “The raspberries would have to be imported in commercial consignments only and must be field inspected for signs of Monilinia fructigena infection no more than 30 days prior to harvest,” the supporting statement added. The approval of raspberry fruit imports from Morocco comes a week after a joint committee for the  follow up of the Morocco-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) convened in Rabat on July 16 to discuss means to further develop trade relations between Morocco and the US. Foreign direct investment (FDI)  from the US  in Morocco increased between 2012 and 2018, Morocco’s Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said during the meeting. Trade activities between the two countries have increased over the past year. In December 2018, the US Trade Representative (USTR) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that the Moroccan government “has agreed to allow imports of U.S. beef and beef products into Morocco,” under the terms of the US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA). USDA also announced in August 2018 that Morocco will import US poultry, opening up an estimated “$10 million market.” Morocco’s agriculture ministry stated that poultry imports from the US are only in frozen form.

Rabat – Essebsi began his political career under president Habib Bourguiba after Tunisia gained independence from France in 1956. When Zine El Abidine Ben Ali replaced Bourguiba in a bloodless coup in 1987, Essebsi moved to align himself with the new leader. Essebsi retired from politics in 1991, returning two decades later during the Tunisian Revolution. At age 88, Essebsi became Tunisia’s first democratically-elected president in 2014.  Essebsi, one of the world’s lost one of its oldest governing heads of state, was hospitalized in late June for illness. After being readmitted on Thursday, he died that morning at Tunis Military hospital. “In this great event Tunisia loses one of its great leaders, who have contributed in all its major battles in modern history, the battle for the liberation of the country from the grip of the colonizer, and the battle for the building of the national state,” said a statement shared on Facebook by Essebsi’s Nidaa Tounes Party.  Born in 1926 into an elite family in the coastal city of Sidi Bou Said, Essebsi studied law in Paris. His interest in politics began at a young age, inspired by a pro-independence protest on April 9, 1938 in which 22 Tunisians died at the hands of French colonial  forces.  He began his political career after Tunisia’s independence, serving as an advisor to President Habib Bourguiba. He went on to serve as Bourguiba’s Interior Minister, Defence Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister. In 1987, Prime Minister Zine El Abidine Ben Ali assumed the presidency after having Bourguiba declared mentally unfit for office. Essebsi quickly shifted his allegiance to the new leader’s Democratic Constitutional Rally party. After serving in Ben Ali’s cabinet as the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Essebsi retired in 1994. Ben Ali resigned from office after revolution broke out in Tunisia in late 2010. Essebsi returned to politics in 2011 to serve as Prime Minister of the transitional government and help draft Tunisia’s new constitution. In response to the instability the country faced in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution, Essebsi founded the secular, modernist Nidaa Tounes, or Call of Tunisia party in 2012.  When Tunisia held its first fully democratic presidential election in 2014, Essebsi won with almost 56% of the vote. Since his election in 2014, Essebsi and his Nidaa Tounes party moved toward the middle of the political spectrum. Essebsi’s centrist policies, adopted to mitigate the growing tide of Islamist extremism and stabilize a country coming out of revolution, could at times leave Tunisians feeling lacking representation in the government.  Essebsi pushed for gender equality and negotiated the delicate transfer of power following the Tunisian Revolution. Lauded for his role as Tunisia’s first democratically elected president, Essebsi also built his political career serving in the cabinets of two increasingly authoritarian leaders. Essebsi planned to step down from the presidency this November following the country’s general elections, saying his departure was “necessary to clear the way for the youth.” President of parliament Mohamed Ennaceur will serve as interim head of state. The Independent Electoral Commission of Tunisia reported  Presidential elections will now be held on 15 September. “[Beji Caid Essebsi] is the first democratically elected president of the country,” Tunisian scholar Raina Said Balti said to Morocco World News. “And his death is a test to our nascent democracy.”

Rabat – Morocco’s government has denounced Israel‘s violations in East Jerusalem after Israeli forces demolished Palestinian  homes in Oued al-Homes, south of the occupied Jerusalem. On Thursday, July 25, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that Morocco “expresses its firm condemnation of the demolition by the Israeli authorities of houses belonging to Palestinian citizens.” Bourita made his statement in a press conference after talks with the Prime Minister of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Timothy Harris, in Rabat. The Minister said that the violation is an  “unacceptable approach,” which defies the provisions of international law and agreements signed by the Palestinian Authority with Israel. Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) said that Israeli troops started to demolish the houses houses on July 21, in the early morning. “Ongoing: Demolitions in #SurBahir started early this morning with four houses at once. Preparations started past midnight as hundreds of armed Israeli occupying soldiers/ bulldozers stormed the town. Families threatened with demolitions were woken up/ moved out of their homes,” PLO said on Twitter. Bourita also expressed satisfaction with the international community’s unanimous rejection of the Israeli violations. While several countries and organizations condemned the Israeli violations in the region, the US continue to support Israeli’s move against the legitimate rights of Palestinians. On Wednesday, July 24, Trump’s administration blocked a proposal to urge the UN to issue a condemnation against Israeli moves in Jerusalem. Kuwait,Indonesia, and South Africa, attempted to file a five paragraph statement to the Security Council to urge it to condemn Israeli practices in the region, according to Reuters. “Kuwait, Indonesia and South Africa circulated a five-paragraph draft statement, seen by Reuters, to the 15-member Security Council on Tuesday that expressed grave concern”  over the Israeli move. The document also “warned that the demolition ‘undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospect for just and lasting peace.’” Bourita said that the Israeli practices constitute a “flagrant” violation of the provisions of international law and the relevant UN resolutions. “Morocco flatly rejects all unilateral measures likely to change the historical and legal status in Al Quds, to stir feelings of despair and disappointment among the Palestinian people and to undermine the Middle East peace process?” he added. This is not the first time Morocco has condemned Israeli violations against Palestine. The Moroccan government  has long expressed support for its Palestinian ally. In June, Bourita said that Morocco’s position on the Palestinian cause is contstant.

Rabat – The President of Tunisia Beji Caid Essebsi died this morning, July 25, announced the Tunisian press agency (TAP).  The 92 year old president had been suffering from health issues, and was admitted to hospital on Monday. Mohamed Ennaceur, the Speaker of Parliament, was sworn in this afternoon as interim president.

Rabat –  Bank al Maghrib, Morocco’s central bank, has revealed in its 15th annual report on financial services in the country that  more and more Moroccan women now have access to a bank account. The rate of participation in banking has risen 3% from the end of the fiscal year 2017,  reaching 40%  at the end of 2018. Despite this recent increase, the banking rate for Moroccan women remains low compared to men. Whereas Bank Al Maghrib’s figures put the percentage of Moroccans with at least one bank account at 60%  of the population, this number is lower for women, at 40%, than it is for men, at 77%. However, these recent developments showcase that this gap can be bridged soon. Women are increasing their rate of participation in the banking system faster than their male counterparts, going from 37% in 2017 to its actual figure of 40%, as men’s participation  has stagnated at its previous rate of 77%. Young people, aged 15 to 24, have also increased their level of participation in banking, going from 23%  in 2017 to 24% currently. Amongst other segments of the population, older Moroccans (over 60 years old), have the highest rate of access to financial services, at 83% , where 69% of Moroccans aged 25 to 59 have at least one bank account. According to the World Bank, these developments indicate improvements in the situation of  Moroccan women. As better access to financial services makes women more likely to save, invest in their families and contribute to overall economic growth. In addition, women with independent bank accounts are more likely to have a say in household financial decisions.  These benefits also improve the socio-economic situation of morocco as a whole. A higher rate of participation in banking, the World Bank explains, leads to job creation, better access to education, and better financial resilience, especially for lower income households.

Rabat – Peruvian congresswoman and politician Martha Gladys Cossio published a one-page opinion piece to speak about her visit to two of the twelve regions of Morocco: Laayoune and Dakhla in Western Sahara. Published in Expreso, the publication shows the congresswoman’s satisfaction with her visit to the region, where she observed  significant development. “The purpose of my visit (..) was to directly observe the situation in these regions, especially the day-to-day life of the population” of the regions, she said. She also said she had the opportunity and “freedom” to exchange ideas with government officials, as well as representatives of private institutions and association dedicated to   education and the support of vulnerable groups. “Life in these regions goes on  normally with eagerness to achieve progress and well-being,” Cossio said. The congresswoman also acknowledged Morocco’s “seriousness, commitment, and significant human and material efforts” in the search search for a mutually and pragmatic political solution to end the conflict. Morocco, which does not accept any hostility against its sovereignty over  Western Sahara, has already submitted an initiative which was recognized by the most significant resolutions of the Security Council.  Morocco submitted its the Autonomy Plan  to the United Nations in 2007. The plan  is part of the country’s ongoing efforts to build a democratic and modern society based on the rule of law; individual, collective, and economic freedoms, as well as social development. In 2018, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita  said that Morocco’s initiative was established within the framework of international legality “to guarantee all the collective and individual rights as decided by international instruments, in particular those relating to human rights, natural resources, and the self-determination principle.” Aware of the pragmatism of the initiative, Cossio said that the Western Sahara conflict is an issue of territorial integrity. Cossio added that  an increasing number of countries, in particular in Latin America and regional blocs such as the African Union, the European Union, as well as other regional organizations, d support a final solution to the question ofthe “territorial integrity of Morocco” through the autonomy initiative. In her article, Cossio did not forget to mention the good diplomatic relations between Morocco and Peru. “Morocco, a friend of Peru, is an ally of the world” in the face of threats linked to religious extremism, she said. Peru  has long supported Morocco’s autonomy plan. In October 2017, 21 members of the Peruvian Parliament expressed their support for Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara.

Rabat – HACA has reviewed TV advertising statistics for the month of Ramadan this year, finding “a number” of advertising standard breaches.  The authority has not yet pointed the finger at any particular TV station, but has warned that sanctions may be the only way forward. The concern relates to the number of advertisements shown on TV during Ramadan, in particular at the time of “iftar,” the meal taken after sunset prayer to break the fast. Iftar is prime advertising time, as families across Morocco come together to share a meal, many in front of a TV. Moroccan media law states that TV advertising spots must not last more than 6 minutes, and must be broadcast more than 20 minutes apart. A breach of this leads to a “concentration of advertisements prejudicial to the comfort of viewers,” explained HACA in a press release on July 24. HACA has enforced the law. Last year, HACA fined Moroccan public broadcasting station Al Aoula and state-owned 2M for showing too many ads, at too short an interval during the month of Ramadan. Al Aoula was fined MAD 800,000 for a number of breaches including showing up to 17 minutes worth of advertisements in an hour, with some advertising spots being shown three minutes apart. Al Aoula was fined for similar breaches in 2013 and 2016. HACA fined 2M MAD 3 million last year for up to 280 breaches during Ramadan. The TV station’s breaches included showing 27 minutes of advertisements in one hour. Some ad spots were shown just 32 seconds apart. HACA has fined 2M for six years in a row. In its press release yesterday, HACA warns the problem of breaches is deep-rooted and raises broader concerns in relation to Morocco’s media. “The problem raises questions regarding the reality of the financing of public audiovisual companies as well as their economic model. The level of their dependence on advertising resources is irreconcilable with the importance of their obligations of public service,” HACA said.  Exactly what sanctions HACA may impose on TV stations this year remains to be seen.

Rabat – The historic Dar El Bacha museum in Marrakech is to hold an exhibition celebrating Moroccan fashion and beauty as seen through the eyes of French designer Yves Saint Laurent and perfumist and photographer Serge Lutens. The exhibition is set to last from July 25 to January 20, 2020. Both Saint Laurent and Lutens  spent considerable amounts of time in Morocco, especially in Marrakesh. The city, its architecture and inhabitants served both artists as a source of inspiration for their crafts.  Yves Saint Laurent has also contributed to the city’s heritage through the acquisition and renovation the house of Orientalist painter Jacques Majorelle, which now stands as one of the city’s most important attractions, the Majorelle museum and gardens. The exhibition is organized by the Dar al Bacha museum in conjunction with The Yves Saint Laurent-Pierre Bergé foundation, as well as the Serge Lutens foundation. It will showcase a collection of caftans, a traditional Moroccan garment, acquired by Saint Laurant and his business partner Pierre Bergé. The Caftan, in addition to other traditional Moroccan artefacts, served as an inspiration for many of Saint Laurent’s high fashion designs.  In addition, a collection of photographs taken by Lutens showcasing traditional Moroccan beauty products and rituals will be shown next to a collection of Moroccan fabrics dating back to the 18th century.

Rabat – The US will grant Morocco two Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft under the Excess Defense Articles Program (EDA). The program is managed by the  US Agency for the Defense Security Service (DCSA). The Lockheed C-130 Hercules fleet have four engines and serves as military transport aircraft. “Everything about this aircraft is big. The airframe is nearly 100 feet long—97’9” to be exact. It has a wingspan of 132 feet, and is over 38 feet high. Each of the four propellers is 13.5 feet in diameter,” said the Military Machine website  about the fleet.  The military specialized website said that each engine in the aircraft has a “dry weight of nearly a ton, and they can each consume 2,412 LBS of fuel an hour.” An extract from a document on the program, published by military specialized page FAR-Maroc, reads: “Notification of proposed grant Transfer of Two excess C-130H Aircraft to the Government of Morocco under the Excess Defense Articles Program. June 11, 2019.”  The document added that “DSA [is] transmitting pursuant to Section 516 of the Foreign Assistance ACT of 1961.” The press release added that “the proposed sale will improve Morocco’s self-defense capability.  Additionally, the continuation of sustainment for their F-16 fleet strengthens the interoperability with the United States and other regional allies.”  In recent years, Morocco has made several military purchase operations from the US. The US Statement Department approved a “possible Foreign Military Sale  to Morocco of continuation of sustainment support of its F-16 fleet for an estimated cost of  $250.4 million,” DCSA announced on June 27. The US is Morocco’s largest supplier. Morocco received 62% of its arms from the US between 2014-2018. France is also a key military supplier for Morocco. In the 2014-2018 period, Morocco received 32% of its major arms from France. Morocco’s military budget slightly increased from MAD 29.4 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2012 to MAD 34.7 billion in 2018 ($3.5 billion), according to the 2018 Trends in World Military Expenditure report released in April 2019 by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

Rabat – On the night of Wednesday July 24, in the region of El Haouz (a province in the region of Marrakesh-Safi), a vehicle transporting several people flipped on national road n° 7. A section of a mountain located between the municipalities of Ijoukak and Asni collapsed on top of  the vehicle which was traveling to Taliouine (212 kilometers south of Marrakech). According to local sources, the passengers were from Casablanca and were heading to Taliouine to celebrate Eid El Adha with their families. In a press release, the Ministry of the Interior reported that the landslide was due to heavy rainfall in the area a few days before the accident. More than 6 hours after the accident, the emergency services are still active. Rescue teams are still on-site trying to extract victims’ bodies and find possible survivors. Ali Tani, a councilor in the rural commune of Tizi N’Test (135 kilometers south-west of Marrakech), explains that Civil Protection officers have so far uncovered 18 bodies. The authorities have opened an investigation into the incident under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office. The 18 bodies were taken to the morgue of Marrakech hospital.

Rabat – After the heinous Imlil murders, authorities in the region of Marrakech-Safi took preventive measures to protect the region’s tourism sector. After the installation of checkpoints and surveillance cameras, gendarmerie officers are now equipped with quads. Local authorities continue to strengthen the preventive measures in order to avoid any incidents similar to the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists in Imlil. They have undertaken concrete action to protect tour groups throughout their travels in Morocco. On July 22, the Royal Gendarmerie provided quads to its units and its mobile officers. The vehicles are intended to monitor tourists during their visit to the Marrakech-Safi region, known for a large tourist influx throughout the year. These quads have several features which allow them to navigate the varied terrain of the region consisting mainly of lanes and steep valleys, as well as dangerous mountain roads. According to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the quads are expected to be used across tourist-friendly valleys and ski resorts such as Ourika, Oukeimeden, Asni, Moulay Brahim and Imlil. These security measures were substantially strengthened in the wake of the Imlil murders. In December 2018, two young Scandinavian tourists were victims of a terrorist cell affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The two hikers, Louisa Vesterager and Maren Ueland, had camped in “Chamharouch” near the village of Imlil. The two women were beheaded by three extremists who have recently been sentenced to death.   The remaining 21 accomplices have been sentenced to between 5 and 30 years in prison.

Rabat – Lv Xinhua, chairman of the Council for Promoting South-South Cooperation (CPSSC) met with Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) in Casablanca on Tuesday, July 23. At the meeting, Xinhua said he was determined to work with Morocco to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two business communities, reports Xinhuanet, China’s official news agency. In particular, Xinhua highlighted his interest in strengthening cooperation between Morocco and China across a number of sectors, including the infrastructure sector. “The Chinese-Moroccan partnership will play an exemplary role in the region and benefit everyone, thanks to the joint efforts of the two countries,” Xinhua stated. In April, Morocco signed an agreement with the infrastructure group China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) to take over the construction and development of Mohammed VI Tanger Tech City. The Tanger Tech project is a plan to build a 2000 hectare city outside Tangier. Once complete it will include multiple industrial zones, and is set to house over 200 Chinese companies. At the meeting on Tuesday, Mezouar, the president of CGEM, noted the importance of fostering Morocco’s entrepreneurs, and of integrating more youth into the China-Africa cooperation.  African youth who are talented and skilled in digital sectors need more support, for instance through funding, he stated. Morocco has been pushing forward a digital strategy this year, with a focus on fostering start-ups and entrepreneurship. Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance signed off on a $700 million loan from the World Bank on March 14, launching extensive reforms for Morocco’s digital economy, to “unleash the potential of Morocco’s digital start-ups.” Funding from China for the start-up sector would further support Morocco’s digital goals.

Rabat – Ahead of World Hepatitis Day (WHD) on July 28, the Association de Lutte Contre le SIDA (ALCS) organized a press conference on July 23 at Hotel Farah-Casablanca. The press conference was an opportunity to present the current situation of the fight against Hepatitis C in Morocco. It also aimed at alerting the authorities and inciting them to adopt a national plan against hepatitis C. According to Mehdi Karkouri, president of ALCS, 5,000 Moroccans die every year, 15 a day. Nearly 400,000 citizens are infected with the Hepatitis C virus and 16 others are newly infected each day. The “silent” infection shows no warning signs or symptoms. Patients often come to know when they are diagnosed with cirrhosis or cancer, both consequences of untreated Hepatitis C. The ALCS suggested that “with the new revolutionary antiviral medicines, very effective and marketed in Morocco at a relatively low cost, the infection mortality rates should no longer be inevitable.” “Today, realistically, beneficiaries of “Ramed” (Medical Assistance Plan for the benefit of the poor) suffering from Hepatitis C do not have access to treatment because it is not available in hospitals,” says Mehdi Karkouri. “Treatments have not been bought yet. If a national plan is launched, the Ministry of Health will launch a tender for such treatments which are available on the market,” he added. ALCS also calls for the establishment of a free testing program for “Ramed” beneficiaries. “If screening reveals that the person is infected with the virus, they can be referred to treatment centers in hospitals and have access to treatment,” says Karkouri. “Today, patients pay about MAD 13,500 from their own pockets for treatment,” said ALCS president. Hepatitis C worldwide Hepatitis C, both acute and chronic, is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The Hepatitis C virus is bloodborne. The most common modes of infection are through exposure to small quantities of blood.  Infection may happen through injection drug use, unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. The infection can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness.  In its  2017 Global Hepatitis Report, World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned that viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015. Globally, WHO estimated that 71 million people were living with Chronic Viral Hepatitis C (HCV). Most viral hepatitis deaths in 2015 were due to chronic liver disease (720 000 deaths due to cirrhosis) and primary liver cancer (470 000 deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma).

Rabat – Aerospace giant Boeing announced on Wednesday that it may have to halt production of its 737 Max planes completely after massive financial losses. The grounding of all 371 of Boeing’s 737 Max planes was ordered after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found evidence at the scene of a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash which killed 157 people. Five months earlier, 189 people were also killed when a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air nosedived just minutes after taking off. Both accidents were caused by the malfunctioning of a new automated system in Boeing. Since the devastating Ethiopian Airlines crash, Boeing has been working on fixing several issues identified by investigators and is still waiting for approval from regulators for the planes to take to the skies again. Production of the 737 Max has been reduced from 52 to 42 aircraft per month, said Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. As a result of the grounding, the company announced its largest-ever quarterly loss, to the tune of $3.4 billion. “We might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options including a temporary shutdown of the Max production,” Muilenburg said during a conference call with investors on Wednesday. The grounding and the prospective halt in production of the plane have a ripple effect that touches much further than just Boeing, due to their influential role in the economy and supply chain.  Airlines that carry the 737 Max have had to cancel thousands of flights, causing a significant dip in revenue.  The Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, announced this month that it has to scale back expansion plans because the Max 737 planes it ordered were delayed. Suppliers are also heavily affected. Spirit Aerosystems, the largest supplier for the Max 737, has already cut hours and pay for 4,000 workers and will see even further losses if production is halted. “A defining moment for Boeing” Muilenburg is putting on a brave face and remains confident that the planes will be approved to take to the skies again by October this year. “These are challenging times, first and foremost, for the families and loved ones who are affected by these recent events, and also for our dedicated people, who work tirelessly to deliver on our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world, all with a relentless focus on quality and safety and doing so with the utmost integrity,” he said in a statement. “This is a defining moment for Boeing and we’re committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company.” He also reassured investors that it has nearly $10 billion in cash and securities to help weather the storm, although it has already burned through $1 billion. “I want to personally thank everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey; from our airline customers and their pilots, flight attendants and others who have been impacted by these groundings, representatives from all levels of government who share our commitment to safety for the flying public and everyone in the aviation community impacted by these events,” he said. “We are grateful for your support and we will continue striving to earn and re-earn your trust,” the statement concluded.

Rabat – The 92-year-old Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi died on Thursday, July 25, the Presidency of the Republic has announced. Tunisian press agency Agence Tunis Afrique Press shared a brief notice from the press release to confirm the death of Tunisia’s first freely elected president. The late president suffered a health crisis last month. He was taken to the military hospital on June 27. Despite leaving the hospital, Essebsi’s health condition remained critical. Essebsi served as president of Tunisia since December 2014 after an Arab uprising across the region. In April 2019, the late president announced that he had no intention of running for presidential election again. Born in 1926, Essebsi completed his studies before entering the political field. He was a supporter of Tunisia’s independence leader Habib Bourguiba. The country gained its independence from France in 1956. Essebsi served in several positions, including as speaker of parliament, while Ben Ali was still in power. Essebsi’s expert fields were security, defense, and foreign affairs. Essebsi, a prominent political figure, led his country towards democracy after serving as Prime Minister following the overthrow of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. Three years later, Essebsi was elected president of Tunisia. According to Al Jazeera,  a presidential vote will take place on November 17 after parliamentary elections expected to take place on October 6. The leader of the Ennahda political party, Rached Ghannouchi, will run in the next parliamentary elections. “The decision to present Ghannouchi at the top of the party’s electoral list in Tunis 1 [district], is to have leaders of parties play a more important role at this crucial stage in the history of the democratic transition in Tunisia,” said Imed Khmiri, an Ennahda party official. The parliamentary race is expected to be fought closely by the Ennahda party, the secular Tahya Tounes party of Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, the Nidaa Tounes party led by the president’s son Hafedh Caid Essebsi, and the Courant Democrate party.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) will continue its vaccination campaign until it reaches its target of approximately 3 million cows and 25 million goats and sheep in this latest campaign before the upcoming Eid Al Adha. Eid Al Adha, or the “Festival of the Sacrifice,” is one of the most important religious celebrations of the Muslim calendar. It honors the willingness of Ibrahim, recognized as a prophet in Islam, to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah’s command. Muslim families across the world will sacrifice an animal, usually a sheep, goat, or cow, in celebration of the day. The date of Eid Al Adha, the tenth day of the last month of the Islamic calendar, changes each year as it is based on the lunar calendar. In Morocco this year, Eid is expected to be celebrated on August 12 and 13.  The ONSSA is concerned with preventing any spread of foot-and-mouth disease ahead of the religious celebration and making sure all meat destined for slaughter meets hygiene standards. In its latest vaccination campaign from June 17 to July 23, ONSSA has vaccinated 1,195,268 cows and 17,744,573 sheep and goats, it stated in a press release yesterday, July 24. ONSSA invites all stock breeders to participate in this campaign, it adds in the press release, noting that vaccinations are carried out free of charge by private and ONSSA vets. According to ONSSA, “the hygiene state of the livestock is satisfactory on the whole.” Farmers in the Chtouka Ait Baha province are however on high alert, after the recent death of a number of cows infected with foot-and-mouth disease, reports Moroccan news source Le360. Since July 21, farmers in the Douar Ait Laasri area south of Agadir have reported up to two deaths of cattle a day due to the highly contagious illness.

Rabat – The President of the National Human Rights Council (CNDH), Amina Bouayach, said that there are no “political prisoners in Morocco.” In an interview with Spanish news outlet EFE, Bouayach discussed Morocco’s reforms abolishing any sort of torture and human right violations in prisons in Moroccan prisons. The CNDH chief, however, acknowledged the presence of a crisis over the question of management of human rights, especially in the management of “demonstrations.” In her interview with the Spanish-speaking news outlet, Bouayach said that there are no “political prisoners” in the North African country but rather “prisoners who have been arrested for their participation in demonstrations or violence produced during demonstrations.” Bouyach said that the prisoners are not arrested for their opinions, but for the “impact or effect of demonstrations or violent expressions.” International media and observers have long referred to the detained Hirak Rif activists arrested for participating in unauthorized protests in 2016-2017 as “political prisoners.” When the EFE asked Bouayach whether torture is used against suspects in police stations, she said that torture is against the law. “Now it is an institutional rule, which continues to develop. The General Directorate of National Security [DGSN] reacts to cases of abuse or inhumane treatment with administrative decisions of suspension,” she said. She added that in the case of a violation, the case would go to court to decide on the consequences for the agent if he or she is proven guilty. “This rule to hold [a person] accountable is important, it has permeated the institution in its behavior with detainees.” EFE also asked the CNDH president about the Hirak Rif (popular movement), which emerged in 2016 in the Al Hoceima province after the death of local fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri. EFE asked Bouayach whether CNDH “tried to ‘correct the excesses’ of the executive and judicial branches.” In response, Bouayach said that CNDH’s role is not to “correct others.” “We have a framework of action, which is the  protection of rights, and we intervene in each case of detention or imprisonment to ensure that those affected have decent conditions.” Capital punishment EFE also asked Bouayach about the death penalty in Morocco.  The Court of Appeal in Sale, Morocco sentenced three main perpetrators of the Imlil murders in the Atlas Mountains to the death penalty. While capital punishment remains legal in Morocco, no executions have been carried out since 1993. The Spanish news outlet mentioned that the perpetrators were sentenced to death shortly after the interview, emphasizing that some NGOs are calling on the government to abolish capital punishment. EFE also asked Bouayach whether the Imlil murder would change people’s minds over the death penalty. “Abolition is a decision of legislative power. The voices against abolition will always exist, they are not indicators which will slow the process,” said Bouayach. She said that crimes punished by death penalty have already decreased to 10 from 30. Bouayach added that MPs want to “abolish [death penalty]  but they have doubts, so we have work to do in our campaign.” In December, King Mohammed VI appointed Bouayach as the president of the CNDH, succeeding  Driss El Yazami, who had been the chairman of the human rights council since March 2011.

Rabat – The global list of state-accredited private institution majors now includes additional options. The ministry accredited the new majors and renewed established courses after their expiry. The global list now includes Business Management (SIST), Entrepreneurship and Economic Intelligence (ESTEM), Graphic and Digital Design (ESDAV), to name a few. The accreditation of the new majors, published in the Official Bulletin (page 5100) on July 18, will expire either in the 2019-2020 academic year or the 2025-2026 year (in the case of private medical schools). Major accreditation means that the related training programs become state-approved. Once all its majors are accredited, the institution can apply for state-recognition of their degree. The application for accreditation is submitted by the owner of the institution to the department in charge of higher education according to a set of specifications. The accreditation procedure is carried out according to a number of conditions. The institution must have a Scientific Council and at least 30% of its teaching staff must be permanent. For management, commerce, and communication majors, one teacher for every 40 students is required for accreditation. One teacher for each 25 students is required for the science and technology majors, while paramedical majors require one teacher for each 10 students. The institutions must also respect national pedagogical methods. Morocco has 202 private institutions for higher education. In the academic year of 2015-2016, 1231 students graduated from Moroccan private universities such as Mundiapolis or Universiapolis. The universities had 7032 students already enrolled and 2153 new students for the same year. In 2016-2017, 6093 students graduated from private schools all around Morocco, 2801 in Casablanca alone. New students enlisted in private schools to study Business and Management, Science and Technology, and Health Sciences increased from 7,912 in 2010-2011 to 10,623 in 2016-2017.  61% of new enrollments (2016-2017) in private institutions were in private schools, with  20% in private universities. 28,493 students were in training in private schools for the 2016-2017 academic year.

Rabat – The Moroccan Association of Malaga has launched an application to combat Islamophobia and hate crimes against Muslims. The NGO considers the application as part of the National Program for the Prevention of Islamophobia. The program seeks to protect the Muslim community in Spain against the rising scourge of Islamophobia and its circumstances. The NGO said that the European Council and the UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination define Islamophobia as a “form of racism and xenophobia manifested through hostility, exclusion, rejection, and hatred against Muslims.” The National islamophobia Prevention Program, according to the NFO, is co-financed by the Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund (FAMI). The program seeks to “give specialized attention to cases of discrimination based on Islamophobia, improving the victims’ knowledge of their rights and existing resources,” as well as to increase the level of awareness and ability “to detect discriminatory incidents caused by Islamophobia.” Part of the program, the application is available on Google Play for free. Europa Press believe that 46% of Islamophobic attacks occur on the internet. Anadolu Agency reported in March that religious discrimination and hate crimes in Spain have increased, quoting a report from the Spanish Ministry of Interior. Miguel Angel Aguilar, a coordinator for services dealing with hate and discrimination crimes in Barcelona, told  the press that his country is observing an increase of hate crimes “even though not at an alarming level, in Islamophobia and attacks against Muslims, and in religious hate in conversations on social media.” The report stated that there has been a 120 % increase in hate crimes in 2017. Aguilar, according to Anadolu Agency, said that 39 out of 41 cases “related to religious hate crimes in 2017 were about Islamophobia.” Catalonia tops the list of regions in which religious hate crimes occur. The region is home to 2 million Muslims.

Rabat – UN envoy Martin Griffiths said on Tuesday, July 23, that all warring fronts in Yemen, as well as the international community, support a United Nations peace deal launched in Sweden in 2018, and are making progress towards achieving it. “I believe that this war in Yemen is eminently resolvable,” Griffiths told reporters in Geneva. “Both parties continue to insist that they want a political solution and the military solution is not available, they remain committed to the Stockholm agreement in all its different aspects.” Yemen has been facing a devastating power struggle between the Saudi-Emirati backed government and Iran-aligned Houthi fighters since late 2014. The conflict has further escalated since 2015 when the Houthis advanced on the deposed government’s temporary base in the city of Aden, causing Saudi Arabia and its allies to start a military campaign against the rebel group. While the Stockholm agreement was taking some time to be implemented, the warring sides saw an opportunity to begin negotiations on a political solution. The international community supported their effort to abandon a military approach to the conflict. Last week, a meeting between both parties brought a surprise breakthrough, with an agreement on the technical aspects of a ceasefire deal in the port of Hodeidah. The meeting took place on the neutral ground of a UN ship in the Red Sea. Griffiths said those talks marked more progress than expected, reaching operational agreements on troop withdrawal plans under the Stockholm deal. The deal envisions a United Nations backed team taking over management of the port as the two armies withdraw.  Last month, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) began curtailing its military presence, a move viewed as a deliberate push towards a commitment to peace. Meanwhile, a senior Emirati official, Anwar Gargash, said the UAE and “the rest of the coalition are not leaving Yemen,” in an opinion piece published on Monday, July 22. After four years of fighting, the Houthis still dominate much of the country, including its capital, Sanaa. Since 2015, thousands of people, many of them children, have been killed in the conflict. The fighting has triggered what the UN calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, leaving 3.3 million people displaced and 24.1 million, more than two-thirds of the population, in urgent need of aid.

Rabat – Amid lingering concerns over social and political hurdles that may delay the delivery of the much-publicized Nigeria-Morocco pipeline project, the two African countries have promised to deliver the project on schedule. According to Nigeria’s The Sun newspaper, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its Moroccan counterpart have announced that they will deliver the pipeline in “record time,” as planned. The two countries hope to tighten bilateral cooperation while boosting prosperity and security at the regional level, the newspaper noted.   The news comes after Mallam Mele K. Kyari, NNPC’s managing director, met on Tuesday, July 23, with Moha Ou Ali Tagma, Morocco’s ambassador to Nigeria.  In comments after the meeting, Kyari asserted that discussions revolved around finding a way to accelerate delivery and cement energy cooperation among the countries which will benefit from the much-awaited pipeline project. The project, which is set to involve fifteen countries in West Africa, a region where Morocco is notably assertive, is the result of the heightened rapprochement of Morocco-Nigeria relations. The two countries have grown closer in the last three years under the guidance of King Mohammed VI and President Muhammadu Buhari.  King Mohammed visited the West African country in December 2016, laying the groundwork for the two countries’ joint commitment to bolstering their cooperation.  In June of last year, President Buhari visited Morocco to finalize the signing of the first phase of what some observers have since labeled the “trans-African” pipeline project. In addition, the two leaders signed agreements on agricultural cooperation, expertise sharing, and vocational training.  In his remarks on Tuesday, Kyari noted that work for completing the gas pipeline is on track and delivery will respect the spirit of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) the two governments recently signed.  “We are completely aligned with the MoU signed by our two governments. We will take it forward and ensure that those terms that are particularly related to oil and gas industry are delivered in record time,” he explained. The Nigerian official went on to highlight the pipeline project’s significance for economic prosperity and socio-political stability in Africa. “This is very important towards job creation, economic prosperity and ultimately, the achievement of overall peace and stability across the entire African continent.” While the project rekindled among African policy circles, doubts have been raised regarding the timely completion of the whole project.  “High exposure to political risks” is likely to negatively impact the Nigeria-Morocco pipeline project, Fitch Solutions warned earlier this year. The analysis added  that “considerable commercial, technical, legal and financial challenges” will make the project “unlikely to materialize in the short or medium-term.” For Kyari, however, after a recent feasibility study stressed the project’s promising prospects, there is little reason to doubt that it will not be delivered as planned. He said, “I am optimistic that our bilateral cooperation around the gas pipeline with Morocco will boost the economies of all countries across the West African states and up to Morocco.” Also crucial in the two countries’ insistence on completing the much-anticipated project is the strong feeling that projects such the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline are a fundamental part of what is needed to pave the way for realizing the pan-Africanist aspirations pervading most discussions across the African continent.  In line with that pan-Africanist wish, Ambassador Tagma described Morocco and Nigeria as “two important African countries” which need to step up to drive Africa’s march forward. The gas pipeline is a key step in the right direction, he asserted, elaborating that Nigeria and Morocco can do much more for continental agendas while working together. Taking a similar tack earlier this month while on a visit to Morocco, former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo spoke of Morocco as a pivotal African country which needs to shoulder its regional leadership responsibility to help the continent realize its longing for food security and socio-economic stability.

Rabat – Today, July 23, the UK government appointed an independent advisor to give expert advice on islamophobia, as well as help create a clear definition of the social problem. Imam Qari Asim MBE, Deputy Chair of the Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group, has been selected for the important role, and he will be joined by a second advisor in due course, according to a press release from the UK government. Asim, along with his team, will draw on a wide range of opinions and work in close collaboration with the cross-government Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group to build on the current definitions of Islamophobia, added the statement. Asim expressed his honor in being entrusted with the role, “which will have a far-reaching impact in protecting British Muslims and tackling anti-Muslim hatred.” “To tackle the alarming rise in anti-Muslim sentiment, it is imperative that Islamophobia is defined,” he said. “I am deeply committed to working across Muslim communities and with relevant stakeholders to formulate a legally robust, comprehensive and workable definition of Islamophobia.” The government also pledged to stand by Asim in his work against Islamophobia, agreeing that “there needs to be a formal definition of Islamophobia to help strengthen our efforts against anti-Muslim hatred.” The current government definition, the statement adds, unintentionally undermines freedom of speech, and prevents legitimate criticism of Islamist extremism, or of unacceptable cultural practices. “The government is wholeheartedly committed to ensuring that Muslims are not targeted for hatred, persecution or discrimination,” said Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. “Imam Asim’s appointment marks a further step in helping us to achieve that goal and ensures that we develop an effective definition of Islamophobia which commands widespread support,” he continued. The appointment of an independent expert is part of ongoing efforts by the UK government to crackdown on Islamophobia. In recent years, the government doubled the Places of Worship Fund, which protects mosques and other places of worship, to £1.6 million.  A new £5 million fund has also been allocated to provide security training and consultation on what more can be done to protect faith communities. The crackdown and concentrated efforts are in response to worrying statistics showing a rise in islamophobia. In its 2017 annual report, Tell MAMA, a UK government-funded NGO, logged the highest ever number of anti-muslim incidents since its launch 5 years earlier.  The NGO recorded a total of 1,330 anti-muslim acts, defined as vandalism, harassment, and violence, in 2017 alone.

Rabat – “Morocco is closely following recent developments in the area and calls for the respect of the freedom of maritime navigation in the Strait of Hormuz and of international law,” said Bourita during a joint press briefing with Guinea’s Foreign Minister, Mamadi Toure. This is Toure’s first visit to Morocco since his appointment. Bourita stated that “the area is under significant pressure and experiences several tensions.” “We believe that the sense of responsibility must prevail and that freedom of movement and maritime navigation must be respected,” he reiterated. Bourita specified that “Morocco, like all countries, is concerned about the escalating tensions in the Strait of Hormuz in recent weeks.” He further explained that the Kingdom’s concern comes as the country has special relations with the Gulf region. The minister also mentioned that “Morocco has repeatedly condemned acts which threaten the stability and security of this region and has affirmed its solidarity with the Arab Gulf countries, whenever their security and the tranquility of their citizens have been threatened.” During the month of July, the Strait of Hormuz witnessed escalating tensions and provocative moves. On July 11, The United Kingdom‘s government claimed that five Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) vessels had unsuccessfully attempted to hinder the passage of a British oil tanker through the Strait. The UK government issued a statement, on July 10, saying that the Iranian ships withdrew after receiving “verbal warnings” from a British warship accompanying the tanker. On July 18, the United States announced that a US Navy ship took “defensive action” and “destroyed” an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, after the drone threatened the vessel. However, Iran dismissed the claim. On July 19, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards abseiled from helicopters and seized a British tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. The seizure came in response to the British capture of an Iranian tanker two weeks earlier. Britain called on Iran to release the British-flagged tanker and its crew, describing the seizure of the Stena Impero oil tanker as illegal.

Rabat – Representatives from the nations that are still party to the Iran nuclear deal will meet on Sunday, July 28 in Vienna, to discuss to what extent the agreement can be salvaged, according to the European Union’s foreign policy service. China, Russia, France, Britain, Germany, and the EU representatives will “examine issues linked to the implementation of the [2015 nuclear accord] in all its aspects,” the EU statement said on Tuesday, July 23. The urgent meeting in Austria’s capital, which will be chaired by the EU foreign policy service’s Secretary-General Helga Schmid, was requested by France, Germany, Britain, and Iran. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian highlighted the need for diplomacy to de-escalate volatile tensions, which he has said previously could lead to “an accident.” The accord, which is formally known as the Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been pending since the United States withdrew from it in 2018 and imposed austere sanctions against Iran. The 2015 deal scaled down Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. But in May 2019, more than a year after the US withdrawal, Iran said it would disregard certain limits on the programme as they did not benefit the country. Iran threatened additional measures if the remaining parties to the deal failed to protect Tehran from the US sanctions. Tehran has since exceeded the deal’s limits on its enriched uranium and heavy water stockpiles. The 4-5% enrichment level the country reached is still well below the more than 90% required for a nuclear warhead. Iran has yet to specify what other steps it may take and has repeatedly emphasized its actions can be reversed “within hours” if European partners deliver on commitments.

Rabat – Nasser Bourita, Moroccan foreign affairs minister, has called Guinea a “true and exceptional” friend of Morocco’s, hailing the “unique” and “historical” relations between Rabat and the West African country. Bourita made the comments in the company of Mamadi Toure, Guinea’s foreign affairs minister, who is currently on a working visit to Rabat.  Speaking at a joint press conference yesterday, July 23, the Moroccan minister welcomed Guinea’s “constant and clear” support for Morocco’s stance on the Western Sahara territorial dispute. Under the leadership of its president Alpha Conde, who was elected as the chairman of the African Union (AU) as Morocco joined the organization two years ago, the West African country has been one of the loudest continental supporters of Morocco’s return to African club.  Guinea has also been one of the African countries to have backed up Rabat’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.  Bourita said that Guinea’s support for a host of Morocco-friendly agendas is the culmination of historical bonds which are illustrated in the closeness between successive Guinean governments and the Moroccan monarchy.  Recently, however, Bourita stressed, the friendship between the two countries has been particularly helped by King Mohammed’s Africa-centered diplomacy and his commitment to Morocco’s historical allies. “Our relations considerably progressed recently, notably after the King’s two visits [to Conakry], during which we signed agreements to realize concrete projects.”  According to Bourita, the host of development projects Morocco is accompanying and supervising in the West African country, as well as the solid friendship between King Mohammed VI and President Conde, have refreshed what was already a strong, “special” bilateral relationship. “Since the King’s visits, our bilateral cooperation has become stronger and multi-dimensional. It includes academic and vocational training, city planning projects in the city of Conakry, and the training of imams,” he said. All these, he elaborated, are “dimensions that reflect the wealth of the historical and unique friendship between Guinea and Morocco.” Bourita’s insistence on the academic and vocational training spoke simultaneously of Morocco’s desire to project itself as a continental hub for academic matters, as well as Guinea’s reliance on its North African partner for training its elite. As one of the primary beneficiaries of the scheme of scholarships and study grants Morocco offers on a yearly basis to a number of African countries, Guinea’s support for Morocco has increased in recent years.  Guinean students who spoke to Morocco World News late last year were full of praise for the North African country. “Morocco has one of the best education systems in the world,” one said, as he spoke with enthusiasm about his academic experience in Morocco. But the most striking illustration of Morocco’s appeal among Guinea’s Morocco-trained youth and elite was most visible when Guinea failed to vote for Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid. Guineans took to social media to lambast what many of them labeled a “shameful betrayal” of a historical ally. Most cited Morocco’s support for the country when it faced the Ebola in 2014-2015. In response to Bourita’s call on Guinea to continue coordinating with Morocco on “all continental and regional issues,” Toure reaffirmed his country’s commitment to upholding the “exceptional friendship” binding it to Morocco.  Like Bourita, the Guinean minister lingered over the two nation’s “historical closeness,” expressing gratitude for Morocco’s support in a string of ongoing development projects in guinea.

Rabat – Families of detained Sahrawi activists have announced the decision to protest in front of Polisario’s “ministry of justice” to condemn the arbitrary arrest and treatment of their relatives in prison. Pro-Polisario news outlet FuturoSahara reported that the families of the activists are urging all people in the region to take part in the protest. The news outlet said that the families are condemning the involvement of members of the “national gendarmerie” in the investigation. On Saturday, July 20, one of the gendarmes “insulted”  and accused activist Moulay Aba Bouzid of lying during a hearing. The families are also “surprised” to discover the gendarmerie members are attending hearings, which is against the law as they are not a party to the case and they do not legally declare their presence. The activists informed their lawyer, who then raised a petition to the “minister of justice.” The investigative judge ordered the gendarmeries to leave the hearing room during the investigation session with Fadel Brieka, who has been on a hunger strike for nine days. Former Polisario police officer Mustafa  Ould Sidi Mouloud quoted a statement yesterday, July 23,  from the Sahrawi Initiative for Change. The statement said that  Brieka’s health has deteriorated due to the hunger strike, according to his family. The family of Brieka said that the “authorities” in the prison of Eddhaibia still refuse to provide their relative with medical care. The statement added that Breika’s family “believe that his condition is a source of serious concern.” The activists’ defense lawyer also expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of working conditions and standards in the prison. He further condemned the prolonged period of detention, which is against the judicial procedures in the case. Both Aba Buzid and Brieka were arrested arbitrarily in mid June at a protest. The activists were condemning actions taken by some Polisario leaders. Human Rights Watch condemned the arrest of the activists, calling for their immediate release. The front is also facing pressure from the family of Ahmed El Khalil, a Polisario leading member who has been missing for a decade. Algerian intelligence services, along with Polisario members, kidnapped El Khalil in 2009. The forced disappearance took place two months after the Polisario had appointed El Khalil to monitor human rights in Tindouf camps. On July 20, a group of Sahrawis marched in Rabouni, Algeria  to condemn the continued, forced disappearance of El Khalil. Wearing yellow jackets, several Sahrawi activists are now protesting the arbitrary detention of the activists in the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – Every year, Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib, releases a report identifying trends in Moroccan trends in household debt.  For its 2018 report released on July 22, Bank Al-Maghrib reviewed data from the 11 banks and 10 consumer credit bodies that make up the majority of Morocco’s lending institutions. Data includes the age, income, professional occupation and geographic location of debt holders.  The report finds that during 2018, household debt increased by 6.1%, to MAD 42,500 per household, or a total of MAD 342 billion. This amount represents 31% of Morocco’s GDP. In terms of the debt types, consumer credits account for 36% of household debt, and housing loans make up 64% of the debt. Housing debt in Morocco sat at MAD 219 billion, and most of this is borrowed by Moroccans over 40. The Bank Al-Maghrib report finds that 65% of the debt is held by Moroccans aged over 40, and 29% is held by Moroccans aged between 30 and 40. Only 6% of the housing debt is held by Moroccans aged under 30. Low income is not keeping Moroccans out of the debt market: the report identifies that 31% of borrowers earn less than MAD 4,000 per month.  Those earning between MAD 4,000 and 10,000 a month make up 39% of borrowers, while 30% of borrowers earn more than MAD 10,000 a month. When it comes to job profiles, salaried employees and public servants are the main housing debt holders at 81%. Artisans and tradespeople make up 13% of borrowers. According to Bank Al-Maghrib, the average consumer credit amount in 2018 was MAD 51,000, a drop from MAD 53,000 in 2017. Most debt holders are aged between 30 and 49 years old (50%), 40% are aged over 50 and 10% are aged under 30.  36% of debt holders have an income below MAD 4,000 per month. The economic implications of household debt sitting at 31% of Morocco’s GDP are broad.  As noted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), household debt and access to credit can help boost a country’s demand and build individual wealth. It also allows households to make investments in things like housing and education, and increasing quality of life. However, high levels of debt can also be a source of financial vulnerability. Households can face significant debt repayment problems if a country’s economy faces negative economic shocks. Moroccans are already pessimistic about saving money in the face of rising living costs. According to figures from the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP), Only 16.7% of households expect to save money in the next 12 months. Debt repayment requirements can place further pressure on household finances, and contribute to pessimism on saving abilities.

Rabat – Moroccan police in collaboration with customs services seized 37.5 kilograms of cannabis resin in Ceuta. The security services seized the drugs in separate operations conducted over the past 24 hours, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. During the first operation, which took place on Monday evening, members of the police and customs seized 18.5 kilograms of cannabis resin. The police found the drugs through the search of a Spanish-registered car. Police arrested two suspects, of Spanish and Russian nationality respectively, for further investigation. On Tuesday morning, another search operation led to the seizure of 19 kilograms of cannabis at the floor of a car registered in Morocco. The car owner was a Moroccan national. Police put him in custody for further investigation. Customs also seized on Tuesday, July 23, an amount of money estimated at €10,250 from a Moroccan living abroad. MAP said that the man was carrying the amount of money without authorization from the relevant financial institutions. The operations are part of Morocco’s strategy to fight against drug trafficking and cross border crimes. Moroccan police and customs in Ceuta also aborted an attempt to smuggle 345 kilograms of cannabis resin on Friday, July 19. Customs sources told MAP  that the operation is part of Morocco’s strategy to fight against drug trafficking. The abortion of the drug trafficking operation is the result of a collaboration between members of the Customs and Excise Administration and the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), operating at the Ceuta crossing point. Police also arrested two Spanish citizens, a man and a woman for their alleged involvement in drug trafficking. The police seized the cannabis hidden in a caravan. The suspects are in police custody pending further investigation to determine the circumstances of the case. Morocco’s government announced; in 2018, that the country has been implementing “a multi-dimensional national strategy to fight illegal drugs and is determined to  place civil society at the forefront of this national strategy.” Mustapha El Khalfi, Spokesperson of the Moroccan government said that over 107,000 people were prosecuted in drug-related cases in 2017. El Khalfi added that Morocco’s geographical location makes it the focus of dangerous networks which actively promote various types of drugs.

Rabat – The European Statistical Office (Eurostat) has released figures on the number of citizenships granted by the European Union in 2017.  Eurostat reports that in 2017, a total of 825,447 citizenships were granted by member states of the European Union. The top three recipient countries of European citizenship were Morocco, followed by Albania, and India.  The EU has granted the most citizenships to Morocco every year since 2012 (the date of the earliest Eurostat figures). The total number of citizenships granted have however dropped significantly. In 2017, the EU granted citizenship to 67,848 Moroccans, while in 2016, 101 295 Moroccans acquired citizenship. Italy granted most of the EU citizenships (33.4%), followed by Spain (25.2%), France (24.6%), Belgium (7.5%), and “other” (9.3%). The number of EU citizenships granted in 2017 was the lowest since 2012. The drop in figures can in part be explained by the rise of EU protectionist immigration policies.  Economic uncertainty, cynicism about the effectiveness of the European Union, and anger over the ongoing migrant crisis shaped more right-leaning policies in Europe’s member states. Muslim immigrants have borne the brunt of Europe’s protectionist discourse. In France in 2017, far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen used Islam and national identity to bolster conservative votes.  “Financial globalization and Islamist globalization are helping each other out. Those two ideologies want to bring France to its knees,’ Le Pen told supporters at the launch of her campaign that year. Despite this, Moroccans still want to go to Europe. A 2019 survey from BBC News Arabic and the Arab Barometer showed that more than 40 % of Moroccans dream of emigrating. In fact, 64% of the people interviewed in Morocco said that given the chance, they would emigrate to Europe. Fewer and fewer Moroccans may have this chance if EU citizenship grant figures continue on their downward trend.

Rabat – The 35-year-old man, who has only been identified as Jermaine, received a call from his sister on the night of Thursday, July 18, telling him that his mother’s apartment building was on fire and she could not get out. Knowing he had to do something, Jermaine immediately rushed to the scene and tried to enter through the door but was stopped by police who cannot let a civilian into a burning building. “They said the elevators are not working,” he told CNN. He told officers he could just take the stairs. “They were like, ‘we can’t let you in.’ Not taking no for an answer, he decided to find another way. “I took it upon myself because that’s my mother. There’s no limits. That’s my mother,” he explained. “She can’t get out of the bed or walk around, so if there’s a fire, she needs help out.” Despite having injured his hip earlier that day, the heroic man began scaling the 19-story building to reach his mother. “When I grabbed a gate, at the top of the gate, there was a ledge. Then I could step on top of the ledge and reach up to the other gate and keep climbing my way up,” he said.  Upon reaching his mother, he ensured she was not in harm’s way and that the fire was contained before scaling back down the building with the peace of mind that his mother was safe. He said his mother was not shocked by his heroic actions, explaining: “She’s not surprised by the things that I do for her. She knows I’ll go over and beyond for her.” Despite his direct disobedience of police orders, authorities seemingly let it slide.  “He actually did cut me a break,” Jermaine explained, speaking of the police officer present. “He understood the circumstances. He knew — when your adrenaline is pumping and your mom is up there, you think she’s dying — you’d do anything you can.” Fortunately, there were no casualties in the fire, which was started by a trash compactor, but 4 people were treated for smoke inhalation.

Rabat – Ethiopian journalist Omna Taddele reported that international referee Bamlak Tessema has forgiven the President of Morocco’s Football Federation, Fouzi Lekjaa, after a complaint made by the Ethiopian Football Federation (EFE).  The EFE claimed that Lekjaa had physically assaulted Ethiopian referee Bamlak Tessema after the CAF Cup final between the Egyptian team Al Zamalek and Moroccan football club RS Berkane in May. Taddele quoted the referee on his Twitter as saying: “I want to focus on my refereeing career. I don’t want to consume much of my time in going between offices in search of disciplinary action. So without any third-party influence, I forgive him (Fouzi Lekjaa),” Tessema said. Earlier this month, rumors went viral that the African Confederation of Football (CAF) had suspended Lekjaa in response to the complaints from EFE. On July 9, Morocco’s Football Federation issued a statement to refute the rumors. FRMF described rumors of Lekjaa’s suspension as “false information,” adding that “the CAF discipline commission will be holding a meeting on the matter with M. Lekjaa in the upcoming days.” The EFE accused Lekjaa of beating Tessema with a head butt in an “aggressive and forceful manner.” The statement also accused the RS Berkane players of harassing the referee.

Rabat – The Moroccan General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) arrested the 32-year-old Bulgarian national on July 23, as he was withdrawing suspected stolen cash from an ATM in central Marrakech. The Bulgarian national came to Morocco on a tourist visa and was arrested for suspected bank fraud, DGSN announced in a press release yesterday. According to DGSN, he was using special technology to copy the banking details from bank cards inserted into ATMs across Marrakech.  He then copied these details onto blank cards, which he then used to withdraw funds for his own use from other Moroccan ATMs.  DGSN carried out a search warrant on the man’s hotel room and seized a dozen blank bank cards, tools used to pirate bank card details, and IT equipment.  According to the press release, police also seized cash, suspected to have been withdrawn through the man’s illegal activities. The case is under investigation to determine the extent of the suspect’s criminal activities. Depending on how long the suspect had been operating, thousands of bank account details may be at risk.  According to March figures from the Moroccan Center for Interbank Transfers (CMI), Marrakech has 369 ATMs. Each ATM sees an average of 3859 withdrawal transactions per month.

Rabat – Spanish athletics club the Playas de Castellon Athletics Club expelled last week Moroccan athlete Jaouad Tougane after his involvement in two alleged thefts in Valencia, Spain. Spanish sports news outlet Marca reported that the Morocco Spanish police arrested the Moroccan athlete twice in recent weeks for “two robberies in a shopping center” in Valencia. Las Provincias said that the club decided to dismiss the Moroccan national for his “completely inappropriate” behavior that goes “against the values of the club and its laws.” Las Provincias added that Spanish police arrested the athlete twice in “fifteen days for two robberies in which he stole 80 euros and a woman’s purse.” Morocco World News contacted the Spanish club for comment to confirm the allegations. The club has not yet responded to MWN’s request for comment. The Moroccan-born athlete was the champion of the Comunitat Valenciana de marathon in 2018. The 27-year old athlete has been living in Spain since his childhood.

Rabat – Boris Johnson, who once famously said “my chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars, or my being reincarnated as an olive,” has been elected the UK’s new leader. He will officially take over from incumbent Theresa May on Wednesday, July 24. Johnson was not elected by the British people in a general election, but has come to the post of prime minister through his new position as head of the Conservative Party. The party holds a small majority in parliament.   The former Mayor of London beat out his opposition Conservative MP and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt comfortably, winning 92,153 votes to his rival’s 46,656. Hunt said he was “very disappointed” by his loss, but believes Johnson will “do a great job” nonetheless, thanks to his “total, unshakeable confidence” in the UK.  While giving his victory speech at the Queen Elizabeth II center in London, he promised to reenergize the UK, as well as to deliver Brexit.  “We are going to get Brexit done on October 31 and take advantage of all the opportunities it will bring in a new spirit of can do. We are once again going to believe in ourselves, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity,” he said. He also gave his regards to May, saying it had been a “privilege to serve in her cabinet,” where he served as her foreign secretary until her resignation. May announced resignation on May 24, bowing to pressure after her latest Brexit plan was strongly condemned by her own Conservative MPs. “It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit,” she said. She reiterated that she had “done everything” she could to convince MPs to support the withdrawal deal she had negotiated with the European Union, but it was now in the “best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort”. Johnson has made it clear he intends to push through with a Brexit plan, calling it “do or die,” and saying that a no-deal exit will happen if a new agreement cannot be reached before the end of October. The new UK Prime Minister is known for his eccentricity. In 2016, he raised eyebrows when he referred to Africa as “that country.”  He also famously published a poem in the British paper the Spectator, describing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan engaging in bestiality with a goat.

Rabat –  The Grand Chancellor of the National Order of Ivory Coast, Henriette Diabaté, presented the medal of Commander of the National Order of Ivory Coast to Mohamed El Kettani, CEO of Attijariwafa Bank.   Acting on behalf of Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara, Diabaté honored the bank CEO on July 22 at the Grand Chancellery of National Order of Ivory Coast in Abidjan. Among the 150 guests who attended the ceremony were the Ambassador of Morocco to Ivory Coast as well as several Ivorian Ministers. Members of the Attijariwafa bank, Ivorian Bank Corporation (SIB, subsidiary of the group), other local subsidiaries of the Group, corporate clients of the Attijariwafa bank in Ivory Coast, and heads of partner organizations of the SIB also attended the award giving. Speaking on this occasion, Diabaté congratulated El Kettani for “the quality and volume” of Attijariwafa Bank’s activities in Ivory Coast at a time when Morocco represents the first African economic partner of Ivory Coast. “I am particularly happy to see in you a figure and a symbol of the continuity of the friendly relations between our two countries,” affirmed Diabaté. A press release from Attijariwafa bank group mentioned that “this distinction is a recognition of the commitment of the group, and of Mr. El Kettani, for the consolidation of Moroccan-Ivorian relations in particular and for strengthening South-South cooperation in general.” El Kettani noted that this distinction is for him as well as for all the group’s employees. He sees it as an encouragement to continue the efforts made for an efficient and inclusive South-South cooperation. “In the space of a few years, our Ivorian subsidiary (SIB) has become a major player in household financing, since it granted, on average, 15,000 consumer loans per year,” said El Kettani.

Rabat – The United Arab Emirates (UAE), part of a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen, will not leave the war-ravaged country despite the ongoing reduction of Emirati forces, a senior official has said.  “Just to be clear, the UAE and the rest of the coalition are not leaving Yemen,” said Anwar Gargash, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, in an opinion piece published on Monday, July 22 in the Washington Post. “While we will operate differently, our military presence will remain. In accordance with international law, we will continue to advise and assist local Yemen forces,” he added. The UAE is a key partner in the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition. The coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to restore the internationally acknowledged government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi against the Houthi rebels. Earlier this month, the UAE announced it was curtailing and redeploying troops in Yemen. Emirati officials have declared the UAE is not leaving a vacuum in Yemen, saying it trained about 90,000 local fighters and remains committed to the coalition and the dismissed Yemeni government. After the withdrawal of UAE troops , Saudi Arabia moved in to secure two strategic Red Sea ports and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. Gargash said the Houthis should see the UAE move as a “confidence-building measure to create new momentum to end the conflict.” “As the United Arab Emirates draws down and redeploys its forces in Yemen, we do so in the same way we began – with eyes wide open,” he said. “There was no easy victory and there will be no easy peace. But now is the time to double down on the political process.” Several rounds of UN-sponsored talks have failed to implement any deal to end the war. The fighting has triggered what the United Nations describes as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Sor far reports show 3.3 million people have been displaced and 24.1 million, more than two-thirds of the population, are in need of aid.

Rabat – Members of civil society are calling for the Minister of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development, Bassima Hakkaoui, to resign, following her silence on the rape and murder of women in Morocco.  The latest murder to cause shockwaves across Morocco is that of Hanane, a 34-year-old woman who was brutally raped and killed in Mellah, Rabat. Her entire ordeal was captured on film and circulated on social media. Hanane’s murder is just one of many cases to shock the nation recently. Just this month, on July 11, an 11-year-old boy was raped and killed in Meknes.  Hanane’s case represents a developing face of violence in Morocco, were perpetrators film the incidents to circulate the footage on social media.  The same occurred in the case of Khadija, a 17-year-old in Beni Mellal who was gang-raped and forcibly tattooed, and that of Zeinab, a 23-year-old who was gang-raped on a public bus in 2017. No bystanders intervened.  Hakkaoui, who was elected into her role in 2012 and is the only female minister in Moroccan parliament, did not comment publicly comment on any of these incidents. Following Hanane’s murder, activists took to the streets of Rabat to protest violence against women. “No to rape, terrorism, and violence,” and “no to hatred and violence” were among the signs raised in front of the Moroccan Parliament on July 19.  Hakkaoui’s silence on this case, as well as the ones that came before, has been deafening for women’s rights activists and members of the civil society. One woman, Houari Meryem, has created a petition calling for the minister’s resignation.  “During her career as a minister, she has only given silence on the issues of rapes, pedophilia, single mothers, forced marriages, deep inequalities between men and women, homeless children,” read the petition. The petition mentions that when she does break her silence on the issues of women, many consider her views archaic.  The last time Bassima publically commented on the rape of a Moroccan woman, it was the case of Amina El Filali, a 16-year-old girl from Larache, Morocco, who committed suicide by ingesting rat poison on March 10, 2012. El Filali committed suicide because she was forced to marry Mustafa Fellaq, a man ten years older than her who had raped her twice. The marriage meant that he could escape prosecution thanks to Article 475 of the Moroccan penal code, which at the time, de-criminalized rape if the rapist later married their victim. Commenting on the case to the press, Hakkoui said: “Article 475 of the Penal Code is unlikely to be repealed under pressure from international public opinion. the marriage of the girl to her rapist does not bring her real harm.” The petition also alleges that Hakkoui said that a rapist marrying his victim is actually “a good solution to spare the victim the rejection of society.” It also says Hakkoui said women are safe from sexual assault as long as they wear the veil and “do not surrender to the eyes of the perverts.” “Women and feminists have struggled for years to improve the situation of women and children in Morocco. The struggle for schooling, to be able to vote, study and integrate professional life, the struggle to have the right to choose,” the petition continues after listing Hakkaoui’s shortcomings. “Today we are going backward. We are losing what we have acquired through this policy of silence, by the non-competence of the minister and by wanting to transmit to us and inculcate retrograde values, of which the society of today and the Moroccan woman no longer need.” “Again, 4 years with Bassima Hakkaoui as minister and all acquired will be lost,” it concludes, echoing the statement of many other activists on social media.

Rabat – Today’s date,  July 23, marks the death of King Hassan II. The Moroccan monarch was in power from 1961 until his death in 1999. The great king remains a symbol of strength and power for thousands in Morocco. The events of his reign still mark the country 20 years after his death.  Intelligence and sharp wit are a combination that reinforced his personality. The King, who was always interested in medical science, was the first foreign monarch to patent an invention in the US. The late monarch invented a system to study the heartbeat. The invention combined videotape and an electrocardiogram. The King, who was a lawyer,  was a man of distinct charisma which made some Moroccans believe that he enjoyed a special “Baraka,” a mystical protective karma. The monarch’s funeral brought important delegations from all continents, World leaders, including former president of the US Bill Clinton, attended the funeral. Hassan II also helped bring about the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Furthermore, he helped bring about the subsequent agreements between the Palestine Liberation Organization, Jordan, and Israel. It is believed that more than one million Moroccans walked the road to attend the funeral procession, emphasizing the love Moroccan citizens had for him.  Citizens carried pictures, chanting slogans to mourn the death of their beloved King. In addition to his mediation efforts, the late monarch is also remembered for the historic Green March. The late king called Moroccan citizens to undertake a peaceful March from the north to the south to defend Morocco’s sovereignty over its Sahara. “We have to do one thing dear people and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara,” King Hassan II said on October 16, 1975. With respect and appreciation, more than 350,000 Moroccans took the speech to heart without hesitation. For the King and his  descendants, the Green march is sacred.  The late King passed on the same ambition and goals to his son, King Mohammed VI who ascended to the throne immediately after the death of his father. In addition to his commitment to  the middle east, the monarch was also committed to keeping his connections with other continents alive.  King Hassan II  was also close to the media. Unlike King Mohammed VI, the late monarch accepted interviews with the press, especially with French media. Fluent in French, the charming monarch amazed journalists as he spoke about democracy and politics. The iconic monarch was also known for his sartorial choices. Always dressed in a well-tailored suit, the charismatic king charmed his subjects with his compelling voice.  The late king’s style, charm, and commitment to the betterment of his country will long be remembered by the people of Morocco.

Rabat – Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation  (BCIJ) Abdelhak El Khiame has again called for a shared responsibility and joint efforts to fight terrorism in the region. El Khiame reiterated in an interview with Italian news agency LaPressa that the war against terrorism will take a long time.  “The fight against terrorism will take a long time, but if we work together with serenity and responsibility we can overcome the courge.” This is not the first time that Al Khiame has acknowledged that the issue of terrorism requires  joint work from all concerned parties. In December 2018,  El Khiame said that  terrorism threats, including that of the ISSI had not ended. He explained that social media helps terrorists to spread their ideologies easily. El Khiame also said that Morocco always offers to share its strategy in the area with European partners. He says  this has helped them to foil “several attacks in several countries, including France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and Belgium.” “This professionalism has given more value to the Moroccan security services that are still receiving requests from their European counterparts.” El Khiame also denied that terrorism is linked to a specific nationality or religion. “Terrorism has no religion or nationality.” El Khiame recalled that Morocco is currently co-chairing the World Forum against Terrorism with the Netherlands. He added that Morocco, under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, has  adopted a multidimensional policy which integrates religious and socio-economic aspects to modernize security institutions. “We realized that security alone is not enough to protect young people against the risk of radicalization, and that it is necessary to fight against the factors that lead to their radicalization,” El Khiame said. The BCIJ chief referred to the“moussalaha” (reconciliation) program launched in 2018. The program  aims to reintegrate prisoners into society. Morocco’s government has eminent trust on the reconciliation program. Morocco,at the request of King Mohammed VI,  offered royal pardon to numerous defendants convicted of terror related crimes. Many former terror suspects applied to join the program. Morocco introduced the BCIJ in 2015. The bureau has monitored security threats across the country and assisted foreign security agencies in combating terrorism. El Khiame added that Morocco have been making  great efforts in the religious field through the Higher Council of Ulemas and the training of imams. This is in addition to initiatives to combat poverty and to strengthen the process of  economic development. During his interview, El Khiame recalled that Italy is among the countries with which Morocco  shared security information and experiences in this area.

Rabat – The US consulate in Casablanca canceled visas for some Moroccan applicants during the third week of July. As indicated by several citizens on social networks, visa applicants for the United States were contacted by the consulate to resubmit their visa applications. The canceled visas had already been validated. Some media outlets linked the cancellations to the recent reform of US visa applications. Visa applicants are required, since the June 2019 reform, to provide information on their social media accounts. The US State Department indicated that it had updated its immigrant and non-immigrant visa forms to request additional information from almost all US applicants. The new visa forms list a number of social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), and require the applicant to provide the names of the accounts they may have had in the last five years. The change proposed in March 2018 is expected to affect approximately 15 million foreigners who apply for a US visa each year. Some media outlets considered the reform an expansion of the Trump administration’s improved screening of immigrants and potential visitors. However, the spokesman of the United States Embassy in Morocco, Joshua Waggener, said the visas were canceled due to additional procedures, initiated after their issuance. “We reiterate that no new regulations have been imposed on Moroccan citizens applying for visas for the United States, and the United States continues to welcome Moroccan nationals for tourist visits, studies, and business,” he said. He further stated that cancellations sometimes take place in case of doubt about the authenticity of certain documents or when the reason behind the visit is not clear.

Rabat – As Ireland announces its plan to establish an embassy in Morocco in the coming months, Rabat and Dublin prepare to put years of lukewarm, and sometimes nonexistent genuine diplomatic connection behind them. But the countries’ overt disagreement on the Western Sahara question remains the elephant in the room, the thorn in the side of the new relationship. In a series of social media posts in recent weeks, the Moroccan embassy in Dublin announced a flurry of moves being prepared to move the Rabat-Dublin relations in more friendly waters. In the embassy’s posts, education was one area that stood out in the new impulse towards which the Morocco-Ireland relationship is said to be heading. On July 5, the embassy took to its Facebook page to announce the reception by Al Akhawayn University in Irfan of an important delegation from Trinity College Dublin. Authorities from the two universities discussed “strategic collaboration issues,” the post noted. Later that day, the embassy subsequently announced “promising productive relations between University College Dublin (UCD) and Moroccan universities.”  The announcement explained this time, “The visit was an interesting occasion to explore options to develop further students and professors mobility and to share mutual experiences in education programs and in research areas.” Mohammed V University in Rabat and Cadi Ayyad of Marrakech are the two other Moroccan universities that have so far been associated with the new winds of Morocco-Irish cooperation.  It is expected that the partnership will include Irish institutions other than UCD and be extended to other Moroccan institutions as well. With Ireland now set to open its embassy in Morocco in 2020, there are mild hopes that perhaps this time the two countries will work out a more effective bilateral cooperation.  But the relationship is still alive mainly because, as has been the case with other countries where it has recently increased its appeal—mainly in Africa and Latin America most recently—Morocco is playing a proactive rather than reactive diplomatic card. In late 2012, Morocco recalled its ambassador to Dublin after Eamon Gilmore, who was then the deputy head of the Irish government, met with a Polisario delegation. “Mr Gilmore made it clear at the meeting with Saharawi Republic President Mohamed Abdelaziz that he supported the right of the Saharan people to self-determination,” the Irish Independent reported at the time. Asked why Morocco had withdrawn its ambassador, a spokesman for the Irish government was blunt: “The Moroccan government does not like our position on Western Sahara. It’s just one of these things.” The Moroccan ambassador subsequently returned to his post. There then followed a semblance of normalization, although the Irish position on Western Sahara never really changed in the intervening years. In December 2018, the Irish Senate passed a bill to “ban sale of goods from occupied territories,” as reported by the Irish Times. As the move came in the heat of debates over the legitimacy of the EU-Morocco fisheries and agriculture agreements, it caused some hard feelings in Rabat. Only this time Morocco did not withdraw its ambassador.  Consistent with its newly adopted proactive approach, Rabat last month sent a delegation of Sahrawi representatives to meet with Irish officials. The message was clear: Not all Sahrawis identify with the Polisario’s agenda. Days later, Habib El Malki, the speaker of the Moroccan parliament, traveled to Dublin to meet a number of high-ranking Irish officials. He reiterated the message of the earlier delegation while dwelling on the merits of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. In response, an Irish delegation led by Sean O Fearghail, the chairperson of the lower house of the Irish parliament, visited Rabat, where the agenda included Irish-Morocco relations, EU-Africa issues, and sustainable development.  The recent developments in the Western Sahara dossier and prospects of stronger Morocco-Ireland bilateral relations were inevitably the major talking points of these series of visits. The two countries expressed their wish to move their friendship to the next level, beyond the important but not sufficient learning and exchange agreements between Irish and Moroccan universities. “Your embassy in Dublin has been fighting for us to open an embassy here,” O Fearghail said at a press conference during his visit. He went on to announce that Dublin has been considering opening an embassy in Rabat and has finally decided to take the plunge in the early months of 2020. Meanwhile, on Western Sahara, the Irish position cannot be said to have evolved much. During their Moroccan stay, the Irish delegation simply noted that their country was ready to support and submit to whatever settlement deal that comes out of the ongoing UN-led process. With the latest UN resolutions taking a direction that Morocco has welcomed, Ireland’s insistence on respecting the terms of the UN-led agenda came across as the least Morocco-hostile position Dublin has taken in recent years.  In this, and with the prospective Irish embassy in Rabat, Morocco sees the possibility of dialogue, of changing Dublin’s mind—as it has done with other countries in recent years and months—if only the European country would (really) listen to Rabat’s side of the story, or history, of the Sahrawi question. Like it has done with other diplomats, Morocco has invited Irish officials to visit the cities of Laayoune and Dakhla. The two cities have witnessed gigantic development projects in recent years, and Rabat hopes to show Dublin the efforts it has put into realizing those projects.  The realizations have largely been interpreted by other visitors as the ultimate proof of the “sincerity” of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.  But whether Dublin will follow suit, and decide to reconsider its support for the Polisario narrative, or come to the conclusion—as Rabat ardently hopes—that Morocco’s plan for the region is sincere and credible, remains to be seen.

Rabat – Palestinians have driven Saudi blogger Mohammed Saud out of the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem after he posted a video expressing love for Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In May, the blogger shared a video to expresses his wish to visit Israel. In the video, the blogger said: “Hello everyone, I am Mohammed Saud and I am from Saudi Arabia. I love Israel.” He added, “I wish if there is a diplomatic relationship between my country and Israel. We have a lot to do to make our Middle East greater than ever.  Please support peace and I invite all of you to visit my country, and hopefully, I can visit your country. Thank you so much and God bless you.” Videos of Palestinians expressing anger over Saud’s visit to the Al Aqsa Mosque has gone viral on social media. Several videos posted online show Palestinians insulting him and accusing him of being a traitor and a zionist. Some videos also show some Palestinians throwing plastic chairs at him. Wearing a traditional tawb (traditional clothing in the Gulf), Saud was visiting the country on Israeli-sponsored trip. He is part of a six-member Arab delegation of journalists hosted by the Israeli foreign ministry. Quoted by Al Jazeera, the Palestinian Journalists syndicate condemned Saud’s visit. “ The Arab journalists’ federation rejects all types and kinds of normalization with the Zionist enemy,” the statement said. Saud is not only a pro-Israel blogger but also a supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In his Twitter bio, the blogger wrote: “Only Bibi,” to show support for Netanyahu. The Saudi blogger’s statement stirred a backlash.  Yes for peace we can make a great future together

Rabat – Marrakech’s Royal Mansour and Kasbat Tamadot in the Atlas Mountains won their categories. Travel + Leisure runs an annual competition, where readers of the famous monthly travel magazine vote for their favorite hotels based on the quality of the rooms and facilities, location, service, food, and value. This year, readers voted the Royal Mansour of Marrakech as the best city hotel in North Africa and the Middle East.  It is yet another award for the luxury hotel in the heart of Marrakech. In 2018, the Royal Mansour won 7 awards including the prestigious Forbes Travel Guide annual award and the World Luxury Spa Award. The hotel was commissioned by the King of Morocco. It is spread over five stories and an estate, with multiple restaurants, 53 riads, and a 2,500 square meter spa.  Many guests report having an “exceptional experience” on TripAdvisor. “Positively amazing in every way. [sic] This was our 4th time to the Royal Mansour – you are treated like royalty from the moment you arrive until the second you leave,” says one guest. For another, “the surroundings/service/décor/food/everything [were] the best I have ever experienced in a hotel.” The riads cost between $1,195 and $6,752 per night.  Of the nearly 600 reviews, most are excellent, although some are more critical. “The common area is filled with people posing and taking photos,” complained one reviewer. “The design might appeal to some guests, but for my taste, it screamed gaudy and pretentious,” they added. A minority report having a “terrible” or “poor” experience. “Pure esthetics over genuine service and quality,” reports one guest. “For those with more money than sense,” finds another. For Travel + Leisure readers though, the Royal Mansour deserves recognition. Marrakech’s Four Seasons Resort and the famous Mamounia Hotel, also both made it to the top ten list. Travel + Leisure also awards the readers’ “top five resort hotels in North Africa and the Middle East” located outside major cities.  Kasbat Tamadot won this category. Kasbah Tamadot is the former governor’s mansion at the base of the Atlas mountains. The 28 room hotel near the Toubkal, Morocco’s highest summit an hour’s drive south of Marrakech is owned by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson. The hotel has collected hundreds of positive reviews on Trip Advisor. “100% over the top AMAZING,” says one guest. “The place will make your draw drop! Wow!,” says another. “When you arrive at the hotel, it feels almost magical. The grounds are unbelievably beautiful, complete with a pool overlooking endless breathtaking views,” describes another. But you can’t please everyone. “Seriously disappointing! In fact, pretty downright awful,” complains a guest. “The fixed smile Branson-worshipping management, recently transferred from the Caribbean, were irritating to everyone we talked to and were better suited to a Virgin gym reception than a Moroccan hideaway in the mountains,” criticizes another. The rooms and suites cost between $600 and $2,700 a night in the low season.

Rabat – Based on intel provided by the Directorate General of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), police in Temara, 11 kilometers from Rabat, have arrested a 24-year-old suspected of belonging to a criminal gang which specializes in violent robbery. The suspect was arrested at his home in the Nasr district of Temara. The arrest followed investigations into a number of thefts committed by the criminal gang. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) indicated that the gang used knives and a rental car to carry out their operations. The gang was particularly active on the Rabat-Temara bypass. The investigations showed that the rental car was taken to a municipal pound following a traffic accident in Sidi Yahya (80 kilometers north-east of Rabat). “One of the members of the criminal gang died as a result of the accident,” specifies the statement. Police took the suspect, and another person charged with concealment of stolen property, into custody. The arrests were carried out under the supervision of the Prosecutor’s Office. The police were able to identify his accomplices who are now subject to search warrants.

Rabat – Rached Ghannouchi, the influential leader of Tunisia’s Islamist Ennahda party, will run in the country’s next parliamentary elections in October 2019. The move is widely interpreted as his attempt to attain a leadership position in the country.  “The decision to present Ghannouchi at the top of the party’s electoral list in Tunis 1 [district], is to have leaders of parties play a more important role at this crucial stage in the history of the democratic transition in Tunisia,” said Imed Khmiri, an Ennahda party official. Ghannouchi was exiled in London for nearly two decades during the tenure of former president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Although he has never run for an official position before, Ghannouchi has been a significant force in Tunisia since the 2011 revolution.  The 78-year-old remains a dominant figure. Critics say he effectively controls the country in cooperation with the secular-minded President Beji Caid Essebsi, 92, nicknamed the “two sheikhs” in reference to their age.  Ghannouchi’s candidacy for a parliamentary seat intensifies expectations that he is hoping to play a bigger role in Tunisia’s politics, possibly as prime minister or speaker of parliament, if his party wins the election. Parliamentary elections are expected to be held on October 6, 2019 with a presidential vote on November 17, 2019. This will be Tunisia’s third free election since the revolution in 2011. The parliamentary race is expected to be fought closely by the Ennahda party, the secular Tahya Tounes party of Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, the Nidaa Tounes party led by the president’s son Hafedh Caid Essebsi, and the Courant Democrate party. Tunisia has been globally acknowledged as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring uprisings. The country drafted a new constitution, held free elections and formed a coalition government with secular and moderate Islamists, all in a region which previously struggled with socio-political turmoil.  However, political progress has not yet been reached by economic advances. Tunisia’s economy remains stagnant with the unemployment rate equating 15%, rising from 12% in 2010, due to the country’s weak growth and inadequate investment opportunities.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi is undoubtedly proud of the recent developments regarding the proposed education bill, Law 51.17. The law stipulates the use of French as a language of instruction for scientific and technical subjects in Moroccan schools. On Monday evening, the House of Representatives passed the draft law with 241 MPs voting in favor. Only four members from different political parties voted against. Omar Balafrej and Mustapha Chennaoui, members of the Federation of Democratic Left (FGD) were among the four MPs who voted against the law. From the PJD, two members voted against the bill: Mohamed El Othmani and El Mokrie Abouzayd El Idrissi.   Twenty-one members from the Al Istiqlal  (Independence) Party abstained. The law is expected to come into effect after approval at the House of Councillors. The adoption of the law came a week after the Moroccan parliamentary commission for teaching, culture, and communication approved the framework law. In addition to the implementation of foreign languages in technical and scientific classes, the law also requires Tamazight to be taught in all Moroccan schools. Article 2 of the draft law received 144 votes in favor and two against. One-hundred-eighteen members abstained. Article 2 of the draft law stipulates that it will “be carried out through teaching some subjects, in particular, scientific or technical subjects, or chapters of certain subjects in one or more foreign languages.” Article 31 of the bill received 144 votes in favor and 2 against. About 116 members abstained. Article 31 relates to teaching Tamazight in school. It states that “upon completing high school, students should have mastered both Arabic and Tamazight in addition to two foreign languages.” The dominance of French as a foreign language in Morocco has angered some political parties, especially the PJD and Al Istiqlal. PJD member and former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has long believed that the law is against the Moroccan constitution and the official language in Morocco: Arabic. While the law stipulates that Arabic remains the official language of the state, Benkirane insists that the law violates the status of Arabic. Benkirane also believe that the French language is an “unknown” language to Moroccan students. He also forecasts a failure in the education system as the language might be a burden for some students at scientific and technical classes. This is not the first time when Benkirane strongly condemned the proposal of Amzazi. In March, Benkirane said that “there is no evidence that teaching science in Arabic has caused the failure of the education system,” he said. Benkirane also preferred English as a language to teach science over French. “If [higher] education in a foreign language is necessary one day, there is a better language for it than French,” he said. On Saturday, July 20, Chairman of the PJD at the House of Representatives Idriss Al Azami Idrissi submitted his resignation letter to the ruling party. Local media speculated that Al Azami’s move is due to the adoption of the new framework law for education by the parliamentary commission for education. In addition to Al Istiqlal Party and Benkirane, the National Coalition for the Arabic Language strongly opposed the draft framework. According to the coalition, the bill is a crime against the Moroccan constitution. The head of the coalition, Fouad Bou Ali, said in April that excluding the Arabic language from Moroccan schools will “reap failures and setbacks experienced by the public school.” While Morocco is shifting into more French, Algeria is now evaluating the idea of replacing French with English in universities. Algerian Minister of High Education Tayeb Bouzid ordered all heads of university institutions on July 21 to replace French with the English language. Observe Algerie reported that the “French language is gradually banned from universities’ administration.” The news outlet added that the French language is “less and less used in the management of universities.” Despite the controversy, Amzazi said that the approval of the legal framework was a “historic moment.” It is the first time that the education sector will have its own legal framework, which is a first step towards the Moroccan education system “taking off,” Amzazi told MAP after the adoption of the bill by the parliamentary education commission last week. Many experienced teachers in Morocco may find it difficult to adapt to teaching scientific and technical subjects in French. Historically, Moroccan teachers have taught sciences in standard Arabic. It remains to be seen whether teachers will receive any specific training to meet the new standards.

Rabat – Eid al-Adha, the “sacrifice festival,” is one of the most important celebrations in the Islamic calendar. Expected to take place this year between August 11 and August 13, it is celebrated by slaughtering sheep, goats, or cows. On July 24, the Moroccan Secretary of State for Sustainable Development, Nezha El Ouafi, will launch the “Clean Eid Al Adha” campaign.  The purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness on the importance of keeping slaughter areas clean, collecting and sealing slaughter residue in closed bags, and avoiding dumping residues in drains. A similar campaign was launched last year, to prevent the uncontrolled dumping of the waste from the slaughtering, such as the organs not suitable for human consumption, skins, and bones. This year’s campaign also promotes environmentally sound behavior but has a new dimension. It is also calling on Moroccans to preserve the skins of the sacrificed sheep, so that they can be collected and treated, then used in the leather industry. “85 % of skins are in a deteriorated condition and cannot be used,” the State Secretary for Sustainable Development said about previous Eid years, in a press release on July 22. The new measures seek to counter this. “Pilot projects will be launched in the four largest cities of the Kingdom: Rabat, Fes, Marrakech, and Tangier, and the projects will then be generalized to the rest of the country,” she added. The measures will include educational campaigns by environmental groups across Morocco on hygiene and slaughtering, and the broadcasting of an educational video on TV, news websites, and social media. The skins of slaughtered sheep will be collected and sorted after Eid. The “Clean Eid Al Adha” campaign is organized in collaboration with the Moroccan Federation of Leather Industry (FEDIC).

Rabat – Retired athlete and Moroccan Icon, Hicham El Guerrouj, has strongly opposed the re-election of Abdeslam Ahizoune as the president of the Royal Moroccan Athletics Federation (FRMA) for a fourth term. Guerrouj, who was aiming to bring a new spirit to the federation, considers the re-election to be a violation. The former athlete has told the media it is unjust for Ahizoune, who has been incumbent as the federation’s president since 2006, to continue for a 4th term.  Ahizoune was re-elected at the FRMA’s Ordinary General Assembly. The election took place yesterday, July 22 in Rabat after a fierce competition with El Guerrouj. During the campaign, both candidates used arguments against each other. While El Guerrouj urged Ahizoune to give up the post, Ahizoune said that his rival was not eligible to take the position from him. Chaos reigned at the general assembly, with some of the attendees criticizing El Guerrouj after his attempts to explain that Ahizoune’s fourth mandate re-election is against the law. “He is violating the law and the basic law that was voted on by all clubs in 2013,” El Guerrouj told the media. El Guerrouj said that legally Ahizoune cannot retain the position for a third nor a fourth mandate. “There are violations of laws, Ahizoune is not respecting the law in a country ruled by a King who respects the law. In all of his speeches, King Mohammed VI urges [all institutions] to respect the law,” Guerrouj added. The former athlete emphasized that the FRMA president “defied everyone and he did not respect the status adapted to the law 30.09.” Ahizoune, who also serves as Maroc Telecom Chairman of the Management Board since his appointment in 2001, has been the president of the FRMA since 2006. A man with power, the businessman also served as a Managing Director of the Office National des Postes et Telecommunications (ONPT) in 1995. The former Minister of Telecommunication (1997/1999), graduated from Telecom-ParisTech in 1977. Ahizoune is also the vice president of the General Confederation of Enterprises in Morocco (CGEM) and the administrator of the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity. Ahizoune also serves as the president of Maroc Cultures Association, which organizes Morocco’s annual international festival Mawazine. Moroccan media has long criticized Ahizoune’s record as the president of FRMA due to the lack of progress of athletics.

Rabat – Images posted on social media have revealed another side to the Algerian People’s National Armed Forces’ (ANP) promises of “full coverage” for football fans’ flights. Images of Algerian supporters sleeping rough in the streets of Cairo are now circulating online. Upon Algeria’s qualification to the African Cup of Nations’ finals (CAN), the (ANP) quoted by TSA, announced that it would reserve 6 military planes for the event. The ANP said that transport would be available for the fixed price of DA 35,000 ($293.16) per person. According to a statement from the Ministry of National Defense (MDN), “the High Command of the National People’s Army decided, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to provide six military planes to transport 600 Algerian supporters to encourage the national team.” The offer obviously interested thousands of football fans and almost 5,000 supporters flew to the Egyptian capital in 48 hours. Following Algeria’s triumph in CAN 2019, a video posted on Youtube showed a crowd of angry fans stuck at the airport. “Thousands of fans, who attended the competition’ s final could not find seats in the return flights to the country, families and even babies are laying on the airport’s floor,” said one of the supporters.  “The images of our citizens sleeping inside the Cairo airport, under the pitying gaze of the passengers, are distressing,” described another supporter. “We are on our own, without any assistance from the consulate or the embassy, ​​people are making fun of us, we feel worthless,” said an Algerian passenger. “I planned to spend a day in Egypt and go back home; I have no money, no food, you have to make sure we get home, just like you brought us here,” complained another. Internet users have also shared videos of scenes of jostling or even clashes with the Egyptian police, overwhelmed by an impressive number of supporters. Amine Andaloussi, director of communication at Air Algérie, told Algérie 360 that 3,000 people did not respect their dates of return. He specified that “in addition to fans who already made reservations through travel agencies, this significant number of late travelers also needed return flights.” “The company has mobilized 21 flights for July 20 and 7 flights for July 21, in addition to 2 others scheduled for the night from Sunday to Monday,” he added, pledging to repatriate all Algerian nationals, stuck in Cairo. Meanwhile, Gaid Salah sent a congratulatory message to the Air Force staff unaware of the distress experienced by Algerian fans who had been trapped for a whole weekend at the Cairo airport. Gaid Salah said, in his message, “you were the cement that consolidated the Army-Nation bond, both in difficult times, in joy, and in exploits.”

Rabat – The Ministry of Culture and Communication has donated hundreds of books in various literary and scientific disciplines to the University of Mosul in Iraq. The donation comes as part of the implementation of the recommendations of the 21st Conference of Arab Ministers of Culture in Egypt.  The donation was presented at a ceremony held at the Kingdom’s embassy in Cairo, in the presence of Iraqi Ambassador Ahmed Al-Dulaimi as well as officials from the League of Arab States. This initiative is part of the implementation of the recommendation of the League of Arab States to contribute to the revival of the heritage of this former university, destroyed by the terrorist organization “Daesh” during its occupation of the city of Mosul.  The move comes as part of the League of Arab State’s determination to support the initiative launched by UNESCO, aimed at the revival of the cultural heritage of the city of Mosul.

The university is one of the largest research centers in the Middle East and the second-largest university in Iraq. Tazi said, “the university had rare works, books, and manuscripts before its destruction, reflecting the richness of Iraqi civilization and history”. The Moroccan ambassador added that this donation of books covers various disciplines in order to emphasize the importance of the human and intellectual dimension in any reconstruction process. The ambassador also expressed the hope that Iraq would return to its former cultural and civilizational influence. Iraqi ambassador Al-Dulaimi expressed his regret for the destruction of the University of Mosul and expressed his gratitude to Morocco for being a pioneer in the implementation of this strategy.

Rabat – Chairman of the group of Justice and Development Party (PJD) MPs at the House of Representatives Idriss Al Azami Idrissi submitted his resignation letter to the secretariat of the ruling party on Saturday, July 20. The resignation letter does not include the reasons behind his resignation. Local news outlets, however, speculate that Al Azami’s move is due to the adoption of the new framework law for education. The Moroccan parliamentary commission for education adopted the law on July 16. The controversial law allows for scientific and technical subjects to be taught in foreign languages. Despite criticism for the law, the parliamentary commission approved the law by a vast majority (25 votes). While the Justice and Development Party has not yet confirmed Al Azami’s resignation, Moroccan television channel 2M quoted a resignation letter from al Azami.   The letter reads: “I regret to inform you that on Saturday I addressed a letter to the Secretary-General [Saad Eddine El Othmani] of my decision to resign from my job as  the chairman of the PJD in the House of Representatives.” Al Azami, a supporter of former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane, added that he will have the opportunity to disclose the circumstances behind his resignation. Morocco’s Minister for Education Said Amzazi described the adoption of the framework law 51.17 as “historic.” Ahead of the adoption of the law, a controversy ensued among political parties and politicians to emphasize the need to preserve official languages in Morocco, in accordance with the constitution: Arabic and Tamazight (berber). Benkirane, who also served as former secretary-general of PJD, was among the politicians who defended the Arabic language loudly. “If higher education in a foreign language is necessary one day, there is a better language for it than French,” Benkirane said in March. In addition to Benkirane, Al Istiqlal Party and The National Coalition for the Arabic Language also opposed the framework law when the government reviewed the draft. The coalition described the law as a crime and a violation of the Moroccan constitution, which establishes Arabic and Tamazight as Morocco’s official languages. “There is no evidence that teaching science in Arabic has caused the failure of the education system,” he said.

Rabat – While international human rights organizations have documented and strongly condemned the distressing situation of Uighurs or Chinese Muslims, more than thirty  Muslim-majority countries have signed a joint letter extolling China’s human rights records. The gesture, which came merely four days after a number of Western countries issued a somewhat mild condemnatory letter against China’s “genocidal” policies towards Muslims living in its Xinjiang region, has been interpreted as a remarkable show of sycophancy and appeasement from the signatories. Chinese outlet Xinhua reported earlier today that the signatories include “the ambassadors to UN at Geneva from Russia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Cuba, Algeria, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Nigeria, Angola, Togo, Tajikistan, Philippines, Belarus and a number of other countries from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and other parts of the world.” Observers have noted that the signatories feature countries that have traditionally taken pride in being the vanguards of the Islamic faith.   “We commend China’s remarkable achievements in the field of human rights by adhering to the people-centered development philosophy and protecting and promoting human rights through development,” one can read in the joint letter. The letter continues, “We also appreciate China’s contributions to the international human rights cause.” For the past three years, China has been under suspicion of ill-treatment, mass detentions, and forced indoctrination of Uighur Muslims.  But the global outrage gained more momentum last summer over concerted reports that an untold number of Uighurs were being rounded up to be locked in internment camps where they are being taught to renounce Islam and embrace traditional Chinese—and sometimes Marxist—values. “China is treating Islam like a mental illness,” an article in The Atlantic poignantly put it last August. That article, like a flurry of others before it, provided a wealth of data on China’s documented, “mindboggling” treatment of its own Muslim populations in the Xinjiang region. Being Muslim, the article argued, was seen like an anomaly, a concerning deviance from Chinese identity. Uighurs’ plight is measure against Islamist radicalization, terrorism In response, Beijing has implacably told the international community that its Uighur policy is a preventive measure against religious extremism and Islamist terrorism.  “If we do not eradicate religious extremism at its roots, the violent terrorist incidents will grow and spread all over like an incurable malignant tumor,” Beijing famously defended itself last summer. China has said the mass detentions centers described in international media are in fact “reeducation centers” for Uighurs to learn and embrace Chinese culture. The Muslim signatories of the controversial letter echoed Beijing’s concerns. As far as they are concerned, they pointed out, outside reports and data have exaggerated the gravity of the situation of Uighurs.  Instead of the blatant violations of human rights and torture in internment centers, they noted, what is really happening in Xinjiang is China taking the necessary measures to root out the seeds of extremism and ensure “security and fulfillment” in the region. “Faced with the grave challenge of terrorism and extremism, China has undertaken a series of counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang, including setting up vocational education and training centers…The past three consecutive years has seen not a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang and people there enjoy a stronger sense of happiness, fulfillment and security,” the letter stressed. On the continued global outrage over China’s grim human rights records, the letter’s signatories called “on relevant countries to refrain from employing unfounded charges against China based on unconfirmed information before they visit Xinjiang.” In a vehemently critical editorial on what it called “a shameful capitulation” from Muslim-majority countries, the Washington Post suggested that China’s growing global influence—especially the coveted Belt and Road initiative—is buying the guilty silence of countries that should have been more critical.  Rather than condemning the “abuses of historic magnitude” which Beijing has been inflicting on their fellow Muslims, the signatories chose to pander to China’s “economic clout,” the editorial argued. “The statement represents a shameful capitulation by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and other majority-Muslim states that frequently pose as defenders of the faith,” the Post said.  The move also suggests that, as China’s global influence grows, the article added in a rueful tone, foreign policy is bound to be “a world where most states meekly submit to Beijing’s dictates and endorse its crimes.” Of the predominantly Muslim countries, Turkey, Malaysia, and Morocco have notably not been associated with the controversial letter. But as China’s appeal grows stronger—and inevitable—it remains to be seen which countries will resist on principle and which ones will feel compelled to jump on the Beijing bandwagon.

Rabat – The NGOs Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and SOS Mediterranee announced on July 21 that a new vessel, the Ocean-Viking would be used for their rescue operations in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Libya. “We are returning to sea because people are drowning,” said MSF President Dr Joanne Liu in a press release.  “In 2019, one person dies for every 10 who arrive in Europe by sea,” she explained. “We are determined to continue to provide humanitarian assistance with Ocean Viking and our partner, SOS Mediterranee,” she added. The boat will patrol in the central Mediterranean, the source of the greatest number of distress calls, without entering the Libyan territorial waters,  explained Frédéric Penard, director of operations of SOS Mediterranee. MSF and SOS Mediterranee ceased their rescue operations in December 2018, after their vessel, the Aquarius, became the center of a legal and diplomatic crisis on the reception of migrants making their way to Europe from Libya. The Aquarius had assisted over 30,000 migrants since 2016. It was the last rescue boat operating off the coast of Libya when the NGOs announced the end of its operations, for what they described as a “smear campaign” by European governments. Legal and diplomatic battle In November, the Italian government sought a seizure of the Aquarius over the alleged dumping of potentially toxic waste in its ports. MSF called the move “unfounded and sinister,” reported the Guardian. In June 2018, Italy refused its permission for the Aquarius to dock, leaving it stranded in the Mediterranean carrying 629 migrants.  In September, Panama removed its maritime flag from the vessel, due to “non-respect” of “international legal procedures” relating to migrant rescues in the Mediterranean, reported the AFP. For the NGOs the revocation was in fact due to political pressure from Italy. Unable to sail without a flag, the Aquarius was laid up in the Marseilles port. MSF and SOS Mediterranee will now resume their operations on board the Ocean-Viking. “In the past months, we have not only strengthened our operations on land and reinforced our observance of the Law of the Sea, but also sought a new ship,” announced SOS Mediterranee in a press release on June 21. The  69m long cargo left port in Poland on July 18, and will take approximately two weeks to reach the Mediterranean, said Louise Guillaumat, the director of SOS Mediterranee. The vessel is Norwegian-owned, with a Norwegian flag.  It costs approximately $15,703 a day to run. SOS Mediterranee has launched a fundraising campaign to help meet the costs.

Rabat – Ugandan lawyer and Parliament Speaker, Rebecca Kadaga Altiwala, an influential figure in the East African country, has accepted Morocco’s invitation to discuss Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict. Altiwala has visited Morocco twice during the past four months. Her most recent meeting with the head of the Moroccan government, Saadeddine El Othmani, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, took place in July 2019. Altiwala, who visited Morocco with a parliamentary delegation, expressed willingness to benefit from the Moroccan experience in addressing the various challenges Uganda is currently facing. They discussed the fields of education, health, and the development of agricultural products. The two parties declared their shared desire to bolster the relations of friendship, consultation, and cooperation, through the exchange of visits of officials. They also plan to enhance the partnership through the strengthening of parliamentary diplomacy, the building of cultural bridges, as well as the exploration of partnership opportunities offered by the countries’ economies. During her last visit to the North African country, the Ugandan politician also met with the chairman of the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS), Khalihenna Ould Errachid, in Rabat. Their discussions included the latest developments in the Western Sahara conflict. Ould Errachid  briefed Altiwala on the Moroccan Autonomy Plan proposed for Sahara, which was submitted to the UN in 2007; The UNwelcomed as “serious, credible and realistic” by the international community and the African countries Ugandan President Museveni and the Polisario Front Altiwala’s visits to Morocco and her discussions with CORCAS over the Western Saharan territory, contradict the foreign policy adopted by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. Museveni  has backed the Polisario Front for 33 years.  During the Southern African Development Community (SADC) conference held on March 2019 to support the Polisario, the Ugandan President reinforced the position of the separatist movement while he criticized Morocco’s stance on the Western Sahara conflict. In May 2019, Museveni received in Kampala the Front’s newly appointed ambassador to Uganda, Hammadi Bashir.  This accelerated the Ugandan government’s efforts to uphold the self-proclaimed SADR. The 75-year-old Ugandan President is planning to bid for a sixth presidential term in 2021. In November 2018, the Ugandan media reported that the country’s former ministers highly encouraged Rebecca Kadaga Altiwala to run for the 2021 presidential election.  The Speaker of the Ugandan Parliament is determined to solidify Uganda’s ties with Morocco.  Altiwala has invited her Moroccan counterpart to participate in the 64th session of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Assembly held on 22-29 September in Kampala.  She also promised to launch a direct airline route between Morocco and Uganda.

Rabat – A group Sahrawis marched on Saturday in Rabouni to condemn the continued, forced disappearance of Polisario member Ahmed El Khalil, who has been missing for a decade. Former Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Oueld Sidi Mouloud posted a video of the protest on his Facebook page. The video shows Sahrawis chanting slogans and carrying banners to condemn the disappearance of El Khalil. The protesters urged the Polisario Front to reveal El Khalil’s fate. This week,  El Khalil’s family announced their decision to stage sit-ins near the high commission of refugees in Rabouni, near Tindouf Algeria.  For the sit-ins, the missing activist’s family are wearing white shirts bearing the hashtag“Freedom to El Khalil.”  El Khalil’s family also condemn Polisario’s ongoing silence on the fate of their relative. The family said in a statement earlier this year that Polisario leader Ibrahim Ghali has not fulfilled his promise to release information about the activist’s forced disappearance. The family further stated that Ghali has refused to engage in a dialogue with them. Algerian intelligence services along with Polisario members kidnapped El Khalil in 2009, two months after the Polisario had appointed him to monitor human rights in Tindouf camps. This is not the first time when members of El Khalil’s family have taken to the desert in Rabouni to condemn his disappearance. In February, Sahrawis took to the desert in Rabouni, where the Secretariat of the Polisario Front is located, to condemn his forced disappearance. They also launched an online campaign to condemn the kidnapping of El Khalil.

Rabat – Britain has called on Iran to release the British-flagged tanker and its crew, describing the seizure of the Stena Impero oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz as illegal. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards abseiled from helicopters and seized the tanker in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday, July 19. The seizure came in response to the British capture of an Iranian tanker two weeks earlier. Iranian officials were explicit that the seizure happened in retaliation for the UK’s capture of Grace 1. The speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, said the British “stole and got a response” from the Revolutionary Guards. “The ship was seized under false and illegal pretenses and the Iranians should release it and its crew immediately,” British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesperson told reporters on Monday, July 22. “We do not seek confrontation with Iran, but it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to seize a ship going about legitimate business through internationally recognized shipping lanes,” the spokesperson added. Footage obtained by an Iranian news agency on Sunday, July 21 depicted the British tanker docked in an Iranian port with Iran’s flag hoisted above it. Britain’s Prime Minister is chairing a meeting of the United Kingdom’s COBRA emergency response committee on Monday, July 22 to discuss the Iran Gulf crisis and the British government’s next steps. Meanwhile, experts on the region say there are few obvious steps London can take at a time when Washington has already imposed the maximum possible economic sanctions, banning all Iranian oil exports worldwide. The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is under pressure to join the US-led plans for an international maritime protection force in the Gulf, nicknamed Operation Sentinel, as speculations grow that Iran is preparing for a long standoff over the British tanker it has detained. According to Al Jazeera’s Laurence Lee, the British government was in “a very difficult position.” “They don’t want to back what the Americans want, which is to take part in this multinational coalition of warships [in the Strait]. But they don’t have enough warships of their own to protect their oil tankers there either,” Lee said. “This afternoon Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt spoke in parliament about limited sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and maybe sending some aircraft over there as well,” she said. On Sunday, July 21 the Foreign Office confirmed that Hunt had spoken with his French and German counterparts who agreed that a “safe passage for vessels” through the economically significant Strait of Hormuz was a top priority for Europe. The Foreign Office is seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict but has advised all British-flagged ships not to enter the Strait of Hormuz. “We must restore confidence in the security of ships passing through the strait, and if this necessitates the deployment of more naval vessels from the international community, we would welcome that,” said Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping.  The Iranian capture of the ship in the global oil trade’s most significant waterway was the latest escalation in three months of spiraling confrontation with the West that began when new, tighter US sanctions took effect at the start of May 2019. Washington imposed the new sanctions after President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal signed in 2015, which had provided Iran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear program.  Since then, European countries including Britain have been caught in the middle. They disagreed with the US decision to quit the nuclear deal but have not managed to offer Iran another way to receive the deal’s promised economic benefits and to protect the country from the austere sanctions.  Britain was thrust more directly into the confrontation on July 4, when its Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar. Britain accused Iran’s tanker of violating sanctions on Syria, prompting reiterated Iranian threats of retaliation. “The Revolutionary Guards responded to Britain’s hijacking of the Iranian tanker,” said Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani after the tanker’s seizure on Sunday, July 21. Stephen Zunes, a politics professor at the University of San Francisco, told Al Jazeera that the recent tension increases the chances of conflict even if neither side wants a war. “With the increasing military threats from the US, this is perhaps the Iranian government’s way of saying to the European community: ‘Hey folks, this is serious. You need to help us out here or things could get really bad’,” Zunes said. “I do not think either the US or Iran actually want to have a war. But this kind of mutual provocation, upping the stakes can create a situation where some kind of misunderstanding or accident will rapidly escalate, so it’s a very high stakes game,” he added.

Rabat – In February 2019, the government proceeded with the privatization of several public institutions. Through privatization, the government expects revenues of more than MAD 5 billion. The Mamounia Hotel, among other public institutions, is part of this initiative. The mythical palace was built in the early 1920s by French architects Henri Prost and Antoine Marchisio. It took its name from its magnificent gardens of Prince Mamoun. Surrounded by ramparts, offering beautiful views of the Atlas, with an 8-hectare garden, the hotel attracted some of the most prominent and powerful figures in the world. Winston Churchill, Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, Mick Jagger, Edith Piaf, and Jacques Chirac all stayed at the palace. Originally, in the 1920s, the hotel aimed to attract mainly long-stay clientele and included only fifty rooms on one floor. The painter Jacques Majorelle (whose villa and garden are one of the major attractions of Marrakech) decorated the lounge bearing his name. After the Second World War, the number of rooms reached 100. King Hassan II began a series of renovations in the 1980s. The hotel had a fourth floor, an additional wing, and a casino, and its capacity reached 200 rooms. The last major renovation was launched in 2009 by King Mohammed VI. The three years of work and decoration revisited by Jacques Garcia cost $120 million.  The hotel now exceeds 200 rooms, has expanded its pool, and has a large spa. The Mamounia is an example of traditional Moroccan crafts with its zelliges (local mosaics), lanterns, ironwork, or “tadelakt” (lime wall covering tinted with pigments). The privatization of Marrakech’s jewel caused public concern. People feared that La Mamounia would fall into foreign hands. Finance Minister Mohamed Benchaaboun hastened to reassure the public that “the hotel will remain Moroccan.” It is very likely that the Moroccan State will give up only a part of the hotel’s capital. The National Office of Railways (ONCF) currently owns 62% of the hotel, the rest is the property of the Deposit and Management Fund (Caisse des dépôts de gestion) and the municipality of Marrakech.

Rabat – Director of migration and border surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali discussed Morocco’s strategy and the 2013 migration policy implemented to curb irregular migration in an interview with Italian news agency LaPressa. During the interview, Zerouali said described Morocco’s migration policy as inclusive. “His Majesty the King [Mohammed VI] in 2013 decided that Morocco should adopt a humanist strategy, respectful of human rights.” Zerouali mentioned Morocco’s strategy to regularize the status of migrants, who seek to make Morocco a destination. “We believe that immigration is wealth for our society, we are not afraid of it,” said Zerouali. Zerouali echoed King Mohammed VI’s position on migration. The monarch urged the international community to take a positive stance on the phenomenon. In his message to the African Union (AU) Summit in 2018, the King said that migration should be seen as a “natural phenomenon” and should be celebrated. “We should adopt a positive stance on the issue of migration by highlighting the humanistic rationale of shared responsibility and solidarity,” said the King. Zerouali said that  Morocco’s policy has another aspect, which is the right to asylum. “We have dealt with the requests that were pending to regularize the situation of asylum seekers.” Zerouali said that Morocco’s migration policy also includes people who came to Morocco for transit to another country, but could not cross the border. He said that those migrants, who refuse to go back to their countries of origin, had also the opportunity to regularize their status. According to the official, “85% of the requests for regularization of stay have been accepted.” The official reiterated that Morocco is never afraid of migration. “We have always been a hospitable, welcoming country.” “For a number of African countries, a visa is not required. We are an African country and we have an African vocation,” Zerouali said. He added that regular migration should be encouraged. Zerouali also explained that the policy protects migrants from trafficking networks. “When you don’t have documents you are vulnerable but when you have a residence permit you are not that anymore because you have access to all the services we give in Morocco,” he said. When asked if Italy should follow Morocco’s policy, he said that  migration is a source of wealth, but “we must protect it from criminal actions.” Border control, according to Zerouali is fundamental. In recent years, migration resulted in pressure for Morocco and its strategic partner, Spain. Earlier this month, Zerouali said that Morocco has foiled more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since January 2019. Zerouali said that the number of foiled irregular migration attempts represent a 25% increase from the same period of 2018.

Rabat – Moroccan police found the body of a Caid, a law enforcement officer, in Morocco’s southern city of Laayoune in Western Sahara on the morning of Monday, 22 July. According to the local authorities of the wilaya of the Laayoune-Sakia Al Hamra region, the body of the deceased was marked with gunshot wounds, reports Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The region’s law enforcement services reported that the body was found near a service vehicle that the victim had been driving. Local authorities intervened to carry out preliminary investigations into the death. Police have transferred the body to the regional hospital of Laayoune for an autopsy. The death of the enforcement officer comes a few days after hooligans and vandals took to the streets of Laayoune during celebrations for Algeria’s CAN Triumph. The Wilaya of Laayoune, Sakia El Hamra, released a statement to emphasize that a group of people took advantage of the celebratory atmosphere to commit acts of vandalism. Hooligans also set fire to a bank agency. The statement added that dozens of police officers were injured. The widespread violence also resulted in the death of a 24-year-old woman. “Authorities have also opened an investigation in order to identify and arrest all those involved in these criminal acts,” says the statement. Security services in the region have opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the death of the enforcement officer under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia has offered hajj (pilgrim) opportunities to relatives of the “victims and injured” of the Christchurch, New Zealand, terrorist incident, Saudi outlet SPA reported last week. “Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has directed hosting 200 pilgrims of the families of the victims and injured of the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed 50 people and wounded dozens,” SPA wrote. The Saudi ministry of religious affairs, which is responsible for hajj logistics, has received instructions from the royal palace to make the pilgrimage a memorable experience for families of Christchurch victims, according to a statement from the ministry. Commenting on King Salman’s “generous gesture,” Sheikh Dr. Abdullatif bin Abdulaziz Al Al-Sheikh, the Saudi Minister of Religious Affairs, said that the decision to invite the families who suffered firsthand the pain of the Christchurch terrorist act is consistent with the Saudi kingdom’s firm rejection on terrorism. “The minister pointed out that the hosting of the families of victims and injured of the painful terrorist incident comes within the framework of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to confront and defeat terrorism and terrorists, as well as helping the families of the victims of this abhorrent act which violates all divine teachings and humanitarian values and principles,” the Saudi newspaper noted. The statement from the ministry promised that Saudi authorities will do their utmost to provide all facilities and ensure that the families from New Zealand perform their hajj “in ease and comfort.” The Christchurch incident, as the terrorist assault on two mosques in the New Zealander city, is widely known, left 50 people dead and a whole city torn asunder by the gravest hate-inspired tragedy it has experienced in recent decades. As the West goes through an epidemic of far-right parties dominating the political discourse and winning elections, the heinous event raised questions about the resurgence of white-supremacist organizations, as well as the worrying trend of rising Islamophobia and anti-immigration narratives.

Rabat – Israel’s Regional Cooperation Minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, has boasted that Israel is the only country that “has been killing Iranians,” after escalating tensions between the Western powers and Iran in the Gulf. “Israel is the only country in the world that has been killing Iranians for two years,” Hanegbi said on Sunday, July 22 in an interview with the Israeli radio station Kan Bet. “We strike the Iranians hundreds of times in Syria. Sometimes we acknowledge it and sometimes foreign reports reveal it,” he added. The country has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria against what it says are Iranian and Hezbollah military targets. Israel has vowed to impede Iran, the country’s main enemy, from entrenching itself militarily in the area. Hanegbi accused Iran of seeking to create “chaos” and “harm freedom of navigation.”  In response, Iran’s state-run news outlet Press TV tweeted: “This is how Israelis are freely and proudly talking about killing Iranians! Just imagine what would happen if it was the other way around!” When the minister was asked if he feared that Israel would not receive the backing of the United States in case of a conflict with Iran, Hanegbi suggested that Tehran would avoid such a confrontation. “[Iranians] are very restrained in their responses and it’s not because they don’t have abilities, but because they understand that Israel means business,” Hanegbi said.  Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke along the same lines last week during an interaction with the cadets of the National Security College. “At the moment, the only army in the world to fight Iran is the Israeli army,” Netanyahu said. In June 2019, the Israeli Prime Minister had warned that Israeli fighter jets can reach out any region in the Middle East, including Iran. “Israel has acted hundreds of times to prevent Iran from entrenching itself militarily in Syria, while it actively and openly calls and works for [Israel’s] destruction,” Netanyahu said in June 2019. Tzachi Hanegbi’s remarks followed the seizure of a British-flagged tanker by Iran on Friday, July 19 in the Strait of Hormuz, rising tensions between London and Tehran. After the incident, Britain told the United Nations Security Council that, while it doesn’t want a confrontation with Iran, it considers the Islamic Republic’s actions in Omani territorial waters “unacceptable” and “highly escalatory.” “International law requires that the right of transit passage shall not be impeded, and therefore the Iranian action constitutes illegal interference,” the UK said in a letter seen by CNN. Earlier this month, Britain seized an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar after speculations that Iran was smuggling oil to Syria, defying the austere sanctions imposed by the United Nations. The United Kingdom-Iran spat has intensified the ongoing tensions in the Gulf unleashed by the US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from a landmark nuclear deal signed with Tehran in 2015. The UK has worked to safeguard the landmark nuclear agreement, while appeasing Washington, a balancing act that has become increasingly difficult as Iran raises the stakes in the Gulf. On Friday, July 19 the Pentagon declared the deployment of around 500 US military personnel to Saudi Arabia as “an additional deterrent” in the face of “emergent, credible threats” in the volatile region.

Rabat – Spanish activists with the Opening Borders Caravan have rallied in Huelva to condemn alleged sexual assaults Moroccan female workers during strawberry picking season in Huelva, Spain in 2018. Spanish news outlet Rojo y Negro reported that a group of 300  activists launched a caravan which ended in Huelva where they protested alleged sexual assaults and violations of labor law in the region. Dozens of seasonal workers come to Huelva annually to work under contract. “In the protests it has been remembered that [the Huelva Federation of Entrepreneurs (FOE)] is responsible for a plan that is clearly insufficient to protect the temporary workers,” the news outlet reported. In May, a court in Huelva ordered the reopening of the case of Moroccan seasonal workers. The seasonal workers accused their managers of sexual assaults. The court previously closed the case on December 2018. The judge did not hear testimonies from the accusers. The New York Times narrated the stories of some of the workers who are still stranded in Spain waiting for trial after they filed complaints against alleged harassers. The US-based news outlet said that one  of the complainants is a pregnant Moroccan woman. The New York Times also put photos of rooms that seasonal workers share during the strawberry season. The pregnant woman said that her manager sexually harassed when she arrived in Spain to work. “He pressured her to have sex, promising her a better life and working conditions,”  the New York Times wrote. After refusing the manager’s demands, the woman said that the manager forced her to work harder. She gave birth to her child in Spain. “I feel depressed and I am scared to look for work,” the woman said. The news outlet said the husbands of some sexual harassment victims had filed for divorce. They have also been “shamed and blamed” by some family members. In addition to the New York Times, German investigative NGO Corrective published a story in collaboration with RTL Nachtjournal and Buzzfeed News released a report on Moroccan female agriculture workers. In the report, women claimed they were harassed, verbally, and physically abused. Rape cases were also reported. Morocco’s government has already reacted to the issue.  The Ministry of Employment issued a statement refuting claims that Moroccan seasonal agricultural workers in Spain were being harassed. The ministry also explained that the working conditions of female Moroccan workers conform to the employment contract concluded between the two parties.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Office for Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) presented its 2019-2023 ambitions at its board of directors meeting in Rabat, in the presence of the Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani.  The ONEE’s strategy is designed to improve access to electricity and drinking water across Morocco, the General Manager of ONEE Abderrahim El Hafidi stated in a press release. MAD 8.6 billion will go towards electricity production projects generating up to 4.262 MW. In accordance with Morocco’s renewable energy goals, 4.240 MW of this power will be generated from solar, hydroelectric and wind power. Morocco intends to produce 52% renewable energy by 2050. In addition to the renewable projects, ONEE announced its intention to oversee the completion of the Dakhla diesel power station projects (22MW) and the Abdelmoumen pumped-storage hydroelectricity station (350 MW) by 2023. French construction company Vinci won the tender for the MAD 3 billion Abdelmoumen station in January 2018. Construction work for the project began in October last year. Finnish corporation Wartsila won the tender for the Dakhla power station project in August 2017, but construction on the project has to this date not yet commenced. By 2023, ONEE also intends to invest MAD 8.7 billion in regional integration projects. ONEE is evaluating the feasibility of infrastructure connection projects with Mauritania and Portugal. The General Director of ONEE met with the General Director of the Mauritanian electricity body Somelec in December 2018 to discuss interconnection strategies, but until now no agreement has been signed. ONEE will also invest MAD 5.2 billion towards reinforcing access to electricity in rural areas, and extend distribution of electricity to 30,900 households across Morocco. ONEE is responsible for the delivery of drinking water across Morocco, and has pledged to invest MAD 25.5 billion to this end.  MAD 15.2 million will go towards improving access to water in urban areas, including the construction of 3400 km of new water pipes. MAD 4.6 billion will go towards reinforcing water treatment, through the construction of 64 new treatment plants by 2023.  ONEE will also invest MAD 5.7 billion towards improving access to drinking water in rural areas to 99.3%. The latest ONEE figures show 96.6% of households had access to safe drinking water in 2017.  Last week the French Development Agency (AFD) lent ONEE MAD 536 million towards a program to improve access to safe drinking water in Morocco’s northern provinces of Al Hoceima, Driouch, Nador, and Taounate. The AFD has now lent approximately MAD 1 billion to ONEE for this program since December 2018.

Rabat – 20 people, between the ages of 13 and 26, were injured, on July 21, in an amusement park in the Mghogha district near Tangier railway station. The carousel’s metallic support became detached causing a number of people on board to fall off. According to the local authorities of the Wilaya of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region, the injuries were caused by both the accident and the panic which ensued afterward.  A number of people sustained injuries as a result of jostling and pushing in the crowd. Local authorities, security services, and civil protection intervened to transport the injured victims to the Mohammed V Regional Hospital in Tangier.  Of the 20 people injured, 18 left the hospital after receiving the necessary care; only two people were placed under medical supervision. The authorities have opened an investigation under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office to determine the circumstances of the incident.

Rabat – Morocco is offering 120 scholarships for high-achieving Ivorian students, Ivorian media has reported. The local newspapers quoted a statement from the Ivorian ministry of foreign affairs as indicating that the scholarships are for the 2019-2020 academic year and would be available for grasp until mid-August for students interested in pursuing their studies in Morocco.  Of the scholarship offers, 100 are for university degrees while the remaining 20 will be taken at vocational schools in Morocco, the ministry explained.  The news comes as a further illustration of the “strong friendship” between Morocco and Ivory Coast. The West African country is a known, outspoken supporter of Morocco’s “African diplomacy” or South-South agenda, in addition to backing the Moroccan autonomy plan in Western Sahara. Last month, Ivory Coast became the first country to open a consulate in Laayoune.  Idrissa Traore, the Ivorian ambassador to Rabat, said that the move was not merely symbolic. Rather, he proposed, his country wished to overtly express its commitment to its “strategic partnership” and “multidimensional relations” with Rabat. As Morocco capitalizes on its “African gaze” in foreign relations, the country has maintained its policy of attracting more African students. The goal, according to Moroccan authorities, is to make the North African country a continental hub for scientific research and academic collaboration. Morocco has long been one of the most prized study destinations in Africa, especially for students from francophone Africa.  In recent years, scholarships and learning agreements with a number of governments across Africa have helped improve Morocco’s image in the continent, boosting its aspirations for continental leadership.

Rabat – A video showing an Egyptian-Moroccan family being forcibly removed from a plane flying from from Bucharest in Romania to Cairo is going viral, already racking up over 4 million views on Facebook. The nerve-wracking video shows the patriarch of the family, surrounded by his Moroccan wife and their children, being violently seized by police. In the background, his wife and other passengers can be heard objecting to the way the Egyptian man was being treated. 

His children can also be seen sobbing in fear. As the video progresses, the cries of fellow passengers begging the police and flight crew to let go of the man get more and more desperate.  The man, who has been identified as Hassan Salama, a restaurant owner living in France, said the argument erupted over a seating issue, with his wife being placed at the front of the plane and his son being placed at the back. His wife reportedly put her bag on the floor in front of her, unaware this was not allowed in the emergency exit section of the plane, and an argument erupted between the mother, her husband and one of the flight attendants.  Even after the mother changed seats, the argument continued. The hostess then called for reinforcement, leading to the altercation captured on video. Salama reportedly wants to file a formal complaint against the airline. The incident may also cause diplomatic tension between Romania and Egypt, with Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabila Makram telling the local press that she “followed the case” and that “contacts have been established with an international lawyer to help the Egyptian citizen.”

Rabat – During a joint press briefing at the end of the first meeting of the political consultation mechanism, chaired in Amman by Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita and Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and expatriates Aymen Al-Safdi, the two parties said that they “agreed to develop a detailed road map to give concrete substance to the conclusions of the summit meeting between the two Heads of State to achieve greater cooperation in the economic, cultural and investment fields.” The two ministers also decided to “institutionalize coordination at international gatherings and events in the service of bilateral and Arab issues of common interest.” The Moroccan and Jordanian ministries added that they “will work intensively to institutionalize and materialize bilateral cooperation through practical conclusions reflecting the solid fraternal bonds and the strategic partnership existing between the two countries.” In addition, the two foreign affairs ministries will, in cooperation with the relevant departments, provide the necessary support for the holding of a Private Sector Forum next September in Amman, said the two ministers. Bourita stressed that his visit to Jordan with a large delegation is pursuant to the instructions of King Mohammed VI “within the framework of the exceptional relations uniting the two Kingdoms, backed by the ties between the two Heads of State and based on permanent solidarity and consultation and on shared of views to all issues.” The meeting between the two heads of state, last March in Casablanca, was an opportunity “to position these relations in a clear strategic horizon, through coordination at all levels and the strengthening of bilateral cooperation through concrete projects”, he said. The meeting with his Jordanian peer provided an opportunity to discuss a number of regional and international issues, he added. Bourita stressed the two countries’ shared position on the Palestinian cause and their full support for the Palestinian people to recover their legitimate rights with the aim of establishing an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds as its capital, in accordance with the relevant international resolutions, the Arab peace initiative and the two-state principle. The talks with Al-Safdi also touched on the latest developments on the regional scene and the situation in the Arab world, notably the Syrian and Libyan issues, said Bourita. Morocco’s foreign minister noted that the meeting was an occasion to reiterate the shared views of the two countries on different matters. For his part, the Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates stressed that the summit meeting between the two Sovereigns, last March in Casablanca, led to important results based on the historical fraternal relations between the two Kingdoms. “On the basis of these results, it was our duty to examine ways to boost bilateral relations on a solid basis, laid by the leaders of the two countries,” he noted, adding that this meeting helped to examine bilateral issues to turn this will into concrete action. Al-Safdi welcomed King Mohammed VI’s initiative for the establishment of a vocational training center in Jordan, explaining that the talks were the opportunity to examine ways to carry out this lofty initiative.

Rabat – Morocco’s King Mohammed VI and his ex-wife Princess Lalla Salma have responded to the rumors flying regarding their parenting. Speaking through their lawyer, Eric Dupond-Moretti, to French celebrity magazine Gala, the Royal Family said that articles “suggesting a family tear are no longer bearable.” Dupond-Moretti said that the rumors are spurring from “foreign sites spreading false information for malicious purposes,” and asserted that this “act is a punishable form of defamation.” The lawyer, who said he is advocating respect for the family and the need to restore the truth once and for all, also said that he is outraged by the parallel being made between Princess Lalla Salma and other princesses. “The comparison is based on nothing but the fact that they are two princesses,” said the lawyer, referencing the Emir of Dubai’s estranged wife, Princess Haya, who sought asylum in Germany with her son and daughter after a very public split and abuse allegations. The French lawyer added that King Mohammed VI and his ex-wife Princess Lalla Salma jointly condemn and deny escape rumors circulating since the start of July regarding two children they share, 16-year-old Prince Moulay El Hassan and 12-year-old Princess Lalla Khadija. King Mohammed VI and Lalla Salma said the rumors are “intolerable” and are “firmly and formally denying” them, feeling “scandalized by extremely serious assertions.” The statement from the royals follows an article from site Afrik.com published earlier this month, claiming that Lalla Salma is not allowed to travel with both her children, in case she tries to flee.

Rabat – Mounir Bensalah, renowned human rights activist and youth leader, has been promoted by King Mohammed VI to secretary general of Morocco’s National Council on Human Rights (CNDH).  One telling characteristic of the new appointments was the conspicuous absence of Islamist figures (only one member of the Justice and Development Party, Morocco’s ruling Islamist party, features on the list of a dozen of appointees). For a country that is a few days away from celebrating two decades of King Mohammed VI’s reign, the appointment by the King of an overwhelmingly progressive team to lead the country’s highest authority on human rights is already widely interpreted as yet another vindication of the King’s genuine desire to act more seriously towards democratic consolidation. That spirit was pervasive in CNDH’s own communiqué on the appointment of the new leadership.  In line with relevant international agreements and in the spirit of “preserving the achievements” of the new democratic impetus since the 2011 constitution, one could read in the announcement, the appointment of Sebbar and the other members of the new CNDH crew is meant as a signal of the direction the King wants for Morocco.  Upholding ‘universality and indivisibility’ of human rights Morocco, the statement emphasized, wants to hold on to the democratic progress it has already achieved, while paving the way for yet further advances in terms of social inclusiveness, social justice, and the fight against torture and other human rights violations. “The composition of the new CNDH team is the reflection of the intellectual pluralism, as well as the social, linguistic, and territorial diversity” of Morocco, the statement noted.  Such an insistence on reflecting the country’s diversity and pluralism aimed, the statement went on to highlight, to “capitalize on preserving recent achievements and guarantee further progress” in supporting and protecting “the universality and indivisibility of human rights.” While reports in the Moroccan press have not been as wildly enthusiastic as CNDH’s communiqué, there were flashes of excitement and pleasure with the move. Observers have particularly welcomed Bensalah’s appointment. An indisputable, iconic figure of human rights and youth inclusion in Morocco’s activism circles, the blogger turned activist has earned himself a reputation for being devoted to and led by his political convictions. Bensalah, who is also an essayist, consolidated his reputation in his blog posts and two book-length essays published in 2012 in the heat of the Arab Spring.  One of the two books, “Moroccan Exceptionalism? The Arab Youth’s Quest for Freedom,” is an exploration of the changes and social movements that have swept the MENA region since the much-fancied Arab Spring.  After serving on the forefront of the 20 February movement, the activist argued in the books—as he maintains now—that the idea of Morocco being a regional exception will not be fully defensible until the North African country completes the democratic transition it began in 2011 after it adopted a more liberal constitution. Upholding international human rights conventions, according more visibility and equality for gender, religious, and linguistic minorities, as well as—and more significantly for him—including the youth in development measures have been the defining traits of Bensalah’s agenda and struggle as an activist, blogger, and essayist. As he now prepares to take on a significant mantle within the leadership of Morocco’s chief authority on human rights, all eyes are set on the activist turned holder of a political office to see which direction CNDH will take under his tenure as secretary general.  For his part, King Mohammed VI, who over the years has won deserved plaudits for liberalizing the country and giving it the outlook of a regional leader poised to consolidate its status as an exception in its region, hopes that the country would continue to lead by example on issues as different as women rights, religious tolerance, and political accountability. “The new members of the council will be tasked with implementing the agenda of a three-fold approach based on the protection of human rights and prevention of all violations in this regard… the protection of disabled people, and the reinforcing of an intervention mechanism to evaluate public policies,” stressed the statement from CNDH. Whether these proclamations are destined to be truly implemented or rather live the fate of other political slogans, more concerned with episodic feel-good than actual delivery on promises, is too soon to tell.

Rabat – Jordan has reiterated its firm position in favor of Morocco’s territorial integrity on Saturday. Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Al Safdi reiterated his country’s unwavering support for Morocco regarding the Western Sahara conflict.  “Our position on the question of the Moroccan Sahara is clear, namely the preservation of the territorial integrity of the kingdom of Morocco and the achievement of a political solution within the framework of the international system of reference and UN Security Council resolutions relating to this matter,” Al Safdi said.  Al Safdi reiterated his country’s position in a joint press briefing with  Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, who flew to Amman on July 19 for a three day visit to Jordan. This visit is also an opportunity to monitor the implementation of the content of the Joint Statement issued following Jordan’s King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein’s official visit to Morocco on March 27-28, 2019. During the visit, the two monarchs discussed recent developments in the region, including the situation in Syria and the Palestinian cause.  During Bourita’s visit, Morocco and Jordan signed a military and technical cooperation agreement. Both kingdoms also signed two memoranda of understanding on political consultation and collaboration between the Jordanian Diplomatic Institute and the Moroccan Academy of Diplomatic Studies.

Rabat –  The head coach of Morocco’s national football team, Herve Renard, has announced his resignation. The now former coach announced his resignation on Instagram with a message to Moroccan football fans. In his message, Renard expressed his pride in being given the opportunity to serve as coach of the national team. “For me, Morocco will always remain a country with which I experienced incredible emotions.” The coach also expressed his “sincere” love and respect for the members of the national team. “It was a great adventure,” he added.

Renard said that he made his decision after considering it carefully. He also said that he has officially informed Fouzi Lekjaa, President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation of his decision. “Thanks to the players, the staff, the fans, the honest journalists,” Renard added. Ahead of his resignation, Renard also addressed a message to King Mohammed VI on Instagram. “I would like to extend my warmest thanks to His Majesty King Mohammed VI, for all efforts to develop sport and football in particular. I would also like to thank the [Crown] Prince Moulay Hassan as well as the entire Royal family,” Renard wrote.

Rabat – I admit the process confused me at first. What sort of seafood restaurant doesn’t have any fish on the menu? Speaking of menus, why can’t I find one? Where is all this delicious-looking food coming from if I can’t order anything? The answer, explained the Essaouiri couple seated next to us, enjoying a hearty plate of grilled sardines on a sunny Sunday afternoon, was simple.  First, you head to a fish market to pick out whatever sort of seafood your little heart desires. Second, bring it to one of the many eateries in the seaside town which specialize in cooking your catch to order. Third, sit down and enjoy the freshest meal you’ve had in ages.  It was the perfect opportunity to try something new, delicious, and local, and have a little adventure in the process. Located on the Atlantic Coast, laid-back Essaouira boasts not one but two bustling fish markets. In the 1950s, it was the most important port for the sardine trade in all of Morocco.  The port is quieter now than it was half a decade ago. Competition from fisheries in other coastal cities, and unemployment have taken a hit on the fishing industry in Essaouira. Hundreds of fishermen still make a living at sea, hauling in their daily catch to sell at the port to vendors, restaurants, and individual customers.  Just through the Bab al Mersa, or the Gate of the Port sits the larger of Essaouira’s two fish markets, or marché aux poissons. Here the tip of the harbor juts out into the water where fishermen launch their boats for a day of work at sea. On land, dozens of vendors sell fish fresh off the boat: eels, squid, red snapper, and sardines, sardines, sardines.  After making a selection and negotiating a price, you can head over to one of the several restaurants dotting the port, just a stone’s throw from the rows of fishmongers. Give your haul to the cook, take a seat, and enjoy the view.  Dozens of blue fishing boats line the piers, moored side by side.  Several vendors offer sea urchins, conch, and other mollusks straight from the shell, ready to eat straight off of the cart. Across the marché aux poissons, dozens of kids laugh, taking turns showing off their diving skills as they plunge into the cool, bluegreen water.  Those who prefer a meal further away from the olfactory bouquet of the outdoor fish market, can head towards the centuries-old medina.  Just down a short passageway off Avenue Mohamed Zerktouni, the main throughway in Essaouira’s medina, sits another fish market, the Souk Laghzal. This smaller market has permanent stalls and offers a similar, but smaller selection of freshly caught seafood. Customers can also pick up spices at booths near the entrance of the market if they want to add a little extra flavor to their meal. Be specific about how much you want, unless you want extra spices to take home with you. Multiple restaurants sit tucked away on the myriad of winding side streets branching off of Avenue Mohamed Zerktouni, the main road running through Essaouira’s medina. These eateries grill the fresh fish brought by customers, serving the meals at colorful tables lining the walls of the medina. In the evenings, some offer a happy hour – salad, bread, and olives to go along with the main course. As the evening draws to a close, the crowd thins and the last diners linger at their tables, savoring the last of their meal as the sun sets.

Rabat – Jihad Bnimoussa, CEO of InspireCorp, a non-profit organization which aims to build psychological resilience and social and emotional skills amongst Morocco’s young people, welcomed me into her office, and apologized if she seemed tired.  Between recent travels – like participating in a UN ECOSOC Youth Forum in NYC and a Stanford Amends Fellowship in Tunis – along with keeping up with the daily grind of a new company, she was feeling a bit worn down. If she hadn’t mentioned her exhaustion, I wouldn’t have noticed as she didn’t show it in the slightest.  She spoke enthusiastically about her work at InspireCorp and the current mental health services in the MENA region.  At just 25 years old, she conducted herself in a way that made her seem much older, and while someone with as much knowledge as she has could perhaps be condescending, Bnimoussa was the opposite.   She was easy to talk to and after we had introduced ourselves and I had settled into the bright yellow couch in her office, she explained her long-standing draw to supporting young people as well as the ins and outs of the region’s current mental health resources.  Throughout the conversation, Bnimoussa’s passion for her work and desire to touch as many young people as she can was woven into everything she said. Pursuing a Deep-Rooted Passion for Youth Development Bnimoussa’s parents raised her and her younger brother and sister with the idea of giving back, telling them: ‘your job is something that makes a difference in the world.  If it doesn’t, it’s a hobby.’   “Your starting point [for giving back] are the people that are closest to you and that comes from your culture or your country of origin,” they told her.  “So, Morocco, for us, was always the base of giving back.” Bnimoussa spent her childhood in the US, but was born to Moroccan parents who were set on their kids learning Arabic and maintaining a connection to their Moroccan roots.  Her family moved to Saudi Arabia towards the end of her elementary school years, but soon after moved again to the more westernized and less conservative UAE.   In the UAE, Bnimoussa found herself immersed in Arab culture and a Muslim community while still surrounded by a ‘melting pot of cultures.’ However, she said it was the annual summers in Morocco, spent working or volunteering in Casablanca, where she connected to her country of origin and really found her passion. She explained that she’s always followed her curiosity when deciding which path to follow and remembered, even as a young girl, being determined to choose to volunteer in places that could possibly provide an answer to her questions. Bnimoussa described her fascination with adults’ expectations of youth, specifically during the transitional period of adolescence.  This led her to volunteer in the youth development sector – in summer camps, leadership workshops, and youth shelters. “That got me to really start understanding the huge gaps in service here in Morocco and start understanding the fragmentation of youth development and it’s lack of depth,” she said. While pursuing a degree in psychology in Istanbul, she continued working in youth development.  After graduating she moved to yet another country and worked towards a Masters in Child and Youth Care Studies in Scotland. Bnimoussa, who struggled with her own mental health as a teenager, said she felt like everyone around her had something they were struggling with, too.  But even though mental health issues seemed common, nobody was talking about it. More, she realized the same issues –  and the same lack of conversation- plagued youth everywhere she went – from the US to Morocco. “There was just this big disconnect between what young people were experiencing and the conversations around them and how adults treated them,” she said. Enter InspireCorp In 2017, still enrolled in her masters program, Bnimoussa moved to Morocco – where she knew she wanted to be based in the future – to work on her dissertation.  She created a focus group of Moroccan teen girls as part of her field research, hoping to understand their experiences with mental health and what help was available to them. One Saturday afternoon they gathered on the beach – where Bnimoussa had set up blankets and brunch – and exchanged stories about their own struggles.  The girls loved it. They wanted it to be a regular thing, not just a focus group. Bnimoussa created a Facebook group and within three months 300 girls had joined. Soon after, Bnimoussa’s friend, Fatima-Zahra Ma-el-ainin, joined Bnimoussa to help keep up with the community’s growing demand.  They worked together to analyze which mental health issues the girls were struggling with and which social and emotional skills they needed the most help developing. “A lot of the foundational social and emotional skills were just not there.  And it didn’t matter which socio-economic class they were from – it was just a universal need,” Bnimoussa said. By the end of 2017, Bnimoussa and Ma-el-ainin had piloted workshops in the girls’ schools for FairyLights, a mental health support group for girls.  They’d also began developing another program, called Resilience Education Boot Camp, to provide social and emotional skills training to any interested students. It was around this time that Bnimoussa realized this could be the start of something big. While she had always wanted to start an organization like this – she even came up with its name, ‘Inspiration Corporation,’ in highschool – she didn’t know if she was ready, having pictured herself graduating and getting experience working at a tech start-up before launching her own company. “But then I realized it doesn’t work that way,” she said.  “I’ve been seeing the need for years – every summer when I came here and also across the region.” Ultimately, InspireCorp, which Bnimoussa and Ma-el-ainin launched in early 2018, came about because the community asked for it – not because they were marketing programming to potential students. Now, a little over one year later, InspireCorp’s three branches – FairyLights, resiliency education and legal advocacy work – functions with the hard work of no more than 3 full-time employees at any given time.  Fairlylights was their first program which grew out of Bnimoussa’s focus groups and uses activities to build a safe space to open up a conversation about mental health among young women. “It’s largely a conversation between them. It’s not necessarily led by a therapist and it’s not meant to be therapy, but it creates a space for a lot of girls to really discuss these things for the first time,” Bnimoussa explained. FairyLights has been developed to be by-girls-for-girls so that female students interested in the program can bring it in their own schools and communities.  It’s now spreading outside Morocco, to the US, Tunisia, and France. InspireCorp is different from other services because it looks at designing experiences that are themselves therapeutic or allow the individual to learn something through the activity in an organic way. Bnimoussa says it is key to connect with young people where they’re at versus coming to them with an ‘expert’s’ perspective and, even though she is only 25, she said she works hard to stay connected to her past experiences and her own process of self-development. “Even though you transform and grow you stay connected to those experiences so that when you talk to a person who’s struggling with something that you struggled with in the past, you immediately know what they’re talking about,” she shared. Building upon its small group resilience ‘boot camps,’ InspireCorp produced an emotional intelligence guide and is spreading it through the public school system. So far they’ve trained teachers from 200 schools across Morocco – through the Mohammedan League of Oulemas – who then trained other teachers within their respective schools and began integrating emotional education into some of their lessons.   This is an ongoing project and is on track to impact 7illion young people in Morocco over the next three years. In addition to their programming, InspireCorp includes a legal team that advocates for policies that would integrate emotional education as part of the right to quality education on both a domestic and international level. “Our mission is to make emotional education a human right,” she said. Creating a New Model to Counter a Lack of Resources While Bnimoussa is proud of what they’ve accomplished so far – and a bit shocked that most of it has happened throughout the past year – she says a new model is necessary to be able to reach every young person in need of support. In order to counter the limited number of psychologists, psychiatrists, and general resources available to young people struggling with mental health, InspireCorp is currently creating a mobile application based on data from their own work and outside research. “[The app] looks at the core value of therapy and reengineers that model in order to make it more equitably accessible,” she explained. Bnimoussa, who admitted she “geeks out” over the tiny details of making everything cute and cozy, was able to describe the background functioning of the mobile application as easily as she described the details of the first FairyLights day on the beach. She explained the psychological processes behind the app’s function in a way that was easy for a non-expert to follow, yet without losing their significance in the methodology.   Therapy itself offers two main values, according to Bnimoussa.  It provides an empathetic conversation that normalizes the problem and makes the individual feel better while granting specific social and emotional skills that help the individual solve their current problem and similar problems in the future.   Traditionally this is done through therapy, but, because of limited resources and cost, therapy as a model cannot realistically be used for a large population. “You need to be able to provide both [values of therapy] in a different way.  In this way [using an app], you can cover millions of young people at the same time,” she added. Ideally the app will be able to cater to students’ individual needs and will be implemented through the education system so every student in partner schools will have access to it.   Those with severe issues will be able to contact a trained counselor 24/7 by text who can provide support or connect them with other resources. The app will also contain modules that aim to teach a specific social or emotional skills through daily tasks or challenges that could be recommended to students by one of the trained counselors or students can self-select for their own self-development. Bnimoussa said she is confident in students’ use of an app like this because, like their in-person programming, its creation is a response to community need and desire.  She said the global conversation surrounding mental health has grown and when they visit schools they’ll stay for hours talking with students and answering questions. While waiting for all the funding for the tech build-out to come through, InspireCorp is testing out potential modules with young people to see which social and emotional skills they need most.  “Everything we do we try to make it very inclusive of the opinions of young people,” she said.  “Their opinions have literally guided everything that we’ve done because they provide insight as to what is actually relevant to them.” Bnimoussa says they hope to release the app, in both English and Arabic, in 2020. Mental Health Resources in the MENA Region Bnimoussa hopes that InspireCorp’s work, especially the app, will help counter the current lack of mental health resources in Morocco and the MENA region and Africa as a whole. Throughout the MENA region and Africa, infrastructure to support people struggling with mental health, usually provided by the government through healthcare systems in places like the US and Europe, is missing. The government provides a limited number of psychiatric hospitals – often only one or two – in big cities with even less in rural areas.  These hospitals have a limited number of beds, typically offer very specific services, and often prioritize older members of the population. Even if individuals can afford therapy, there is only about one psychologist or psychiatrist for every 200,000 people across the region, making it difficult to get an appointment. “[These services] are usually just completely overwhelmed by the amount of people that they need to serve because there aren’t any other forms of mental health services,” she explained.  “Everything ends up being poured on top of them.” Morocco has one crisis hotline.  While they do have a mobile application, the hot-line is only open during normal business hours and has a limited number of counselors. Bnimoussa explained that, unlike other parts of the world where crisis hotlines can connect callers to outside support, Morocco’s hotline is unable to reach out to other services, like dispatching an ambulance if there is a risk of suicide. “That’s the nature of the region,” she said.  “Even if they wanted to refer out, they don’t have anyone to refer to.”   Ideally, InspireCorp’s app will also be able to serve as an improved hotline for students – it’s trained counselors will have the resources to provide a referral to a psychologist or dispatch an ambulance.  While some NGOs support youth in other ways, they often don’t have the resources or trained staff to help those facing mental health issues.  Additionally, due to lack of funding and trained individuals, it’s uncommon for schools to have trained counselors, according to Bnimoussa. The Pros and Cons of Being Based in Morocco She explained that by being in Morocco, versus somewhere like the US, she has been able to see the nuances in issues surrounding youth mental health firsthand. “I knew I wanted to be in Morocco and I knew I needed to do this work here because it does give us an insider perspective,” she said.  “We would not have thought about the issue in this very particular way if we weren’t here.” At the same time, she admitted that being in Morocco has also made her work harder, especially when considering mental health as a global issue.  InspireCorp’s approach to mental health care is progressive and, in this sense, it’s a downside to be in Morocco.   “When you’re outside of an innovation hub there’s a certain level of acceleration and access to opportunity that you are away from,” she said. If all goes as planned, InspireCorp will begin spreading the app globally in two years, which would likely require her to relocate to one of these hubs.  But for now, she’s learned to counter Morocco’s isolation through reaching out to bigger organizations and spreading the word through any and all connections she has. And, for a 25-year-old who’s startup hasn’t even celebrated its two-year anniversary, she has a lot of connections.  Bnimoussa said she’s been sharing her work with World Merit, the UN, WE.org and Crisis Text Line, who told her InspireCorp’s app could potentially help them with their own issues of reaching those in need of support in the region. Bnimoussa emphasized the importance of improving the situation in Morocco, the MENA region, and Africa overall, where there is both a greater lack of resources and a greater number of young people than other places in the world. Nearly 90% of the world’s youth live in developing countries, according to previous studies by the UN. “If we’re looking at our future as humanity and our world then the young people who are going to be leading it are in developing countries and they are not having access to the support and resources they need,” she said. However, InspireCorp’s work has the potential to improve the lives of young people around the globe. “[The app] is something that could have a global impact,” she said.  “It’s something that could provide a scalable, preventative model that would help solve some of the mental health crisis that we face.” A Future That Holds Emotional Education for All Bnimoussa said she frequently reminds her team that they’re working to build a hundred-year company – their long term goal to make emotional education a human right and ensure all young people have access to these skills isn’t going to happen overnight. Social and emotional skills are “just words” to most people, but someone who has gone through therapy would understand their value, she said. “There’s a reason they recommend therapy to anybody they talk to,” she said.  “It’s because the skills you learn through it, the way that you learn to think and the way that you learn to take control of your own mind is completely transformative.” It seems unfair that only those who have access to and can afford a therapist get to learn how to operate their minds.  Especially since often times it’s marginalized and less privileged populations that already have higher risk factors of mental health who need these skills but can’t access them, Bnimoussa added. “[Emotional Education] is a foundational thing that everyone should have so we could at least have a chance to build the kind of humanity that we dream of,” she said.  Every single person struggles with mental health throughout their life, according to recent comprehensive research from the Dunedin Study in New Zealand.   Their study tracked people throughout their lives and found that it’s not a percentage of the population that experiences mental health issues, as most studies conclude, but every person.  However, since individual’s struggles occur at different points in their lives and other studies focus only on one period of someone’s life, they haven’t been able to reach this consensus. Bnimoussa said growing up she looked at huge corporations that have so much influence and add so much value – in a product-centered way – to people’s lives and wondered:  “Why can’t it be an inspiration corporation?  Like a corporation that does have a lot of different projects but they’re all working to serve humanity.”

Rabat – Near the Morocco-Algeria border in Oujda, in Northeast Morocco, the Algerian football team’s victory against Senegal in this year’s Afcon final was celebrated with resounding messages of “fraternity” and “open the borders” as Algerian and Moroccans joined to rejoice and show solidarity. From the moment Morocco’s Atlas Lions were precociously and disappointingly eliminated from this year’s Africa Cup of Nations, Moroccans started rooting for  Algeria, which most of them tellingly call their “second country” or “sister nation.” As Les Verts—one of the two nicknames of the Algerian team—overwhelmed Guinea 3-0 in the round of 16, sent Ivory Coast out in penalty shootout after a tense and laborious 1-1 draw in the quarter-finals, and dramatically defeated Nigeria 2-1 in the semis after Riyad Mahrez, Algeria’s star player, sent home a late-minute screamer of a free-kick, the now epic “1, 2, 3; Viva Algeria” chant soon found its home in Moroccan cafes and streets. The emotion, as the Algerian team impressed and swaggered, has been one of shared pride and fraternity. But yesterday’s celebrations at the Moroccan-Algerian border were different, wilder, and more rapturous. The message was as unmistakable as the significance of the outpouring of shared joy among two people divided by politics but united in everything else. The celebrations meant, as the crowd of Morocco-Algerian supporters made it plain in their ecstatic chants, of the urge to remind politicians in both countries to take into account the deeply entrenched bonds of brotherhood and shared culture between the two peoples across the borders. “Look at the people in Oujda celebrating as though the victory was Morocco’s Atlas Lions,” one Moroccan tweeted. “How beautiful that is! Let’s open the borders,” said another. That “open the borders” message was not simply a plea in the rapturous chants as Moroccans and Algerians celebrated at the border near Oujda. More than a chant or a message, it was a palpable feeling, a lived reality that politicians have so far failed to catch up with. “Viva Algeria.” “We are all brothers.” “Let them open the borders.” The slogans changed throughout the celebrations. But the undertone, the underlying sense—or feeling—remained unchanged. This was people using the kind of wild happiness that only football can bring (at least across Africa) to rise above the kind of divisiveness and animosity that only politics can cause. And, as the crowd rose above the political divide and decades-long hostility between their two countries, they may have shown—which after all was their motivation in the first place—that the closed borders policy now in force between their two counties is not only anachronistic; it has never really been a reality in how the two peoples relate to each other on a daily basis.

Rabat – Currently on a three-day (July 19-21) working visit in Jordan, Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, has reiterated Rabat’s willingness to honor the agreements it recently signed with the Jordanian leadership. At a press briefing in Amman yesterday, July 19, Bourita told the Jordanian press that his visit is meant to reaffirm Morocco’s commitment to the new “communication and cooperation channels” initiated between the two countries under the leadership of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI and Jordan’s Abdullah II. According to reports, Bourta’s visit to Amman came in response to an invitation he had received from Aymen al-Safdi, the Jordanian foreign affairs minister. Al-Safdi, who was part of King Abdullah II’s delegation when he visited Morocco in late March, formally invited his Moroccan counterpart to visit sometime and “continue the work that our Kings have started.” In a statement, Morocco’s foreign affairs ministry noted that, in addition to upholding the spirit of the trade and business cooperation deals Rabat and Amman stroke in March, Bourita’s visit is putting on the bilateral table other alternatives to further the increasingly warming relations between the two kingdoms. The new Rabat-Amman drive includes extending trade and business partnership, but also political cooperation on a wide range of regional issues, mostly including security and peace matters.  With “shared interests” as the basis of their bilateral relationship, the two kingdoms have made clear their “deep concern” with the distress in regional hot spots like Libya and Syria, as well as the situation in Palestine. King Abdullah II’s March visit to Morocco made headiness because the Jordanian leader came to Rabat after he had ditched a visit to Romania to protest the European country’s decision to follow in the US’ footsteps by moving its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Bourita, whose Jordanian stay ends tomorrow, July 21, has so far used the visit to reiterate King Mohammed’s VI “personal commitment” to the joint declaration he made in March with his Jordanian counterpart on the need to preserve the multi-religious and multi-ethnic status of Jerusalem.

Rabat – Secretary of State to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Mounia Boucetta, attended the 2nd International Ministerial Meeting to Advance Religious Freedoms held between 16 -18 July in Washington. High-level government representatives, international organizations, religious leaders, and civil society activists gathered in Washington for the meeting. The delegates discussed concrete ways to combat religious persecution and discrimination and ensure greater respect for freedom of religion or belief. Speaking at the ministerial meeting, Boucetta stressed that Morocco “continues to be concretely committed to the actions undertaken as a follow-up to this conference.” Boucetta added that Morocco looks forward to hosting the 1st Regional Conference on the Preservation of Cultural and Religious Heritage in the near future. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said that the regional conference is one of four meetings held around the world to follow-up on the Washington ministerial meeting and the Potomac Declaration and Plan of Action (July 2018). According to the US Department of State website, “the Potomac Declaration reflects the views of the United States government on the importance of promoting religious freedom, a universal human right, as a means to ensuring greater peace and stability within and among nations.” The Potomac Plan of Action is a “framework proposed by the US government for activities that the international community can draw from to promote religious freedom and respond to abuses and violations of religious freedom.” Presenting Morocco’s actions in the field of interfaith dialogue and freedom of worship since the first ministerial meeting in July 2018, Boucetta recalled Pope François’ historical visit to Morocco on March 30-31. She described the visit as “an exceptional event that highlighted Morocco’s openness and ongoing efforts to promote peace through interfaith dialogue.” Boucetta also recalled the 2nd edition of the International Conference on the Dialogue of Cultures and Religions, held last September in Fez, under the High Patronage of HM King Mohammed VI. She further highlighted the Mohammed VI Institute’ s achievements in terms of training Imams, Morchidines and Morchidates (male and female preachers). Since its creation in 2015, the institute has trained more than 4,300 Imams and Morchidates from African and European countries. The Secretary of State also mentioned the launch, by King Mohammad VI, of the radio program “Addourous Al Hadithia” (lessons in Prophet Mohammad’s Hadith). The program aims at safeguarding and preserving the Prophet’s Hadith from any falsification, alteration, or instrumentalization for ideological purposes. The Secretary also indicated that HM the King launched, in April 2019, the construction works of a Museum of Jewish culture in Fez in order to preserve Morocco’s Jewish heritage. She also pointed out that the King, as Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, granted financial aid as a contribution to the restoration and development of certain areas in the holy mosque of Al-Aqsa and its vicinity.

Rabat – On July 19, Laayoune witnessed a series of incidents of vandalism following celebrations of the Algerian national team’s victory in the African Cup of Nations. The Wilaya of Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra released a statement saying that a group of people, encouraged by hostile individuals, took advantage of the celebratory atmosphere to carry out acts of sabotage and looting of property. The incidents took place immediately after the coronation of the Algerian national team. The police were forced to intervene to protect private and public property as the criminal acts continued until 3 am on July 20. The statement added that the acts of sabotage occurred in Laayoune’s main street where a bank agency was set on fire. Dozens of police officers were injured, four of them sustaining serious injuries. Amidst the chaos, a 24-year-old woman was transferred to hospital in a critical condition. She died of her injuries at the regional hospital in Laayoune.  An investigation is underway under the supervision of the Public Prosecution’s office to determine the circumstances of her death.  “Authorities have also opened an investigation in order to identify and arrest all those involved in these criminal acts,” says the statement.

By Natasha Maldi Rabat – Salima ‘Sally’ Kadaoui lived alongside the stray animal population as a young girl in Tangier. She often fed and played with one dog in particular, whom she called “Bonita.” A few days after giving birth to a litter of puppies, Bonita began to crumble before Sally’s eyes. Local authorities had poisoned her in an attempt to control the stray dog population.  Sally remembers watching Bonita dying slowly, too weak to move, as her newborn pups still tried to suckle. This moment catalyzed Sally’s mission to end animal suffering in Morocco. “That’s when I decided I wanted to change my country,” she said.  “For over 50 years, Moroccan authorities have focused on culling—the targeted poisoning and killing of dogs—to combat rabies and control stray populations,” Sally wrote to me. “Culling has been the only government response to stray animal populations.”  Culling includes both poisoning and shooting, both of which can be very painful for the targeted animal.  To save dogs like Bonita, Sally founded Le Sanctuaire de la Faune de Tanger (known familiarly as SFT Animal Sanctuary) in 2013 as a place for neglected, abused, wounded, or troubled animals. Located 30 kilometers from the center of Tangier, its 7 acres of land accommodates more than 550 animals (350 dogs, 120 cats, 35 donkeys, 30 animals with disabilities, two monkeys, and one stork with an injured wing). Sally knows all of them by name. “I would take in every street animal if I could,” Sally lamented, but the sanctuary has a relatively small capacity compared to Tangier’s stray dog population, estimated at a staggering 30,0000. So in 2017, Project Hayat was born.  “The only way to control the population of the strays is to neuter,” reads the Sanctuary’s website, “the only way to eradicate diseases is to treat and vaccinate.”  Project Hayat catches stray dogs and then neuters, treats, and vaccinates them before returning the dogs to their neighborhood with a yellow tag on each ear to designate them as rabies-free. While culling has unsuccessfully attempted to end rabies transmission through targeted killing, Project Hayat eradicates rabies from the source. “If there weren’t dogs on the streets, we would have a huge problem with waste, trash, and rats—which carry disease,” Sally added, emphasizing that “for each dog we vaccinate, we build a herd of immunity.” Project Hayat also includes an education arm to dispel the community’s fear of stray dogs, teach Moroccans strategies for how to respond to potentially dangerous animals, and encourage compassion for local animal populations.  To date, more than 25,000 students—from primary school to university—have been educated about animal welfare through Project Hayat.  The Sanctuary recently hired a dedicated staff member for community outreach due to increased demand for educational resources.  Indeed, Sally has seen a marked change in Moroccan’s attitudes towards animals since SFT’s founding.  Many Tangerois now take care of injured dogs, feed abandoned kittens, and call Sally when they need help with a stray. They’ve even taken a strong stance against culling: “Moroccans are literally going in front of the guns to stop the authorities from shooting dogs.” Sally and the Sanctuary’s work have garnered attention far beyond Tangier’s city limits. The Dodo produced a video about the Sanctuary in November 2018, amassing more than 4.5 million views on Facebook.  Yahoo News, Fox News, and Morocco World News have published articles highlighting the sanctuary’s mission. SFT also received the GARC Global Alliance for Rabies Control Award 2018, voted on by the WHO world health organization, CDC center for disease control, UN United Nations FAO and the OIE World Organization for Animal Health.  Despite these recognitions, Sally insists that Tangier—and eventually all of Morocco—have a long way to go.  “Morocco has two choices,” Sally insists, “We can carry on with the mass culling, give a horrible message to the rest of the world, and go against our own religion, or we can have healthy dogs, eradicate rabies, show what Islam is all about, and be an example to the rest of the world.” For more information or to donate, please visit www.sftmorocco.org/projecthayat. SFT Animal Sanctuary frequently updates its Instagram page, which can be found at @animalsanctuary_tangier.

Rabat – After our national team’s elimination in the round of 16, Moroccans found solace watching neighboring Algeria snatch its second continental title. Moroccan fans cheering for the players of ‘’Les Verts’’, as the Algerian team is fondly called in French, as if they were their own, is both a reminder of the close relationship between people in both countries and a wake-up call for our football officials. They need to work harder if they are really sincere in their proclaimed goal to see our team achieve what our Algerian counterparts have accomplished.  Watching Moroccan and Algerian fans, along the closed borders between the two countries, united in celebration of Les Verts’ wins during the AFCON is one of the most beautiful scenes of the tournament. People sent their love to each other across the borders, showing how much the game has brought them together despite the fact that the relationship between the two governments is as cold as ever. One imagines that Moroccan fans would not have cheered for the other two Arab teams, Egypt, and Tunisia, with the same enthusiasm they showed for Algeria. Morocco’s elimination probably gave more reasons for our football fans to cheer for Les Verts. They probably saw in the Algerian team what the Moroccan squad lacked. The Algerians played very well throughout the tournament. They showed a lot of heart and determination to prevail over their opponents. It was clear that their hearts were set on winning the title. It was not only the positive qualities of the Algerian team that prompted Moroccan fans to ally themselves with their neighbors. Moroccan fans cheering for the Algerian team were conscious of the history and culture they share with their neighbors on the other side of the border. What is striking is that games between the two teams have always been intense. Whenever Morocco managed to beat their neighbors, especially when it came to such impressive victories as in 2004 or 2011, this was always a reason for exuberant celebration for Moroccan fans. Other than that, one would mostly always expect that Moroccans would support Les Verts against any opponent. One might not be sure how far it is correct to say that the Algerian team, and their coach Djamel Belmadi, have provided us with a football lesson, but I would like to think of it that way. We saw how several players in the team played a key part in their journey towards the title. Youcef Belaili scored the winning goal against Senegal in the first round of the tournament. Riyadh Mahrez’s wonder free-kick goal put Les Verts in the final, and Baghdad Boundjah scored the most important goal for Algeria since 1990 when the team won their first continental title. Our team seemed to lack the ability to score goals by more than one player. We had to rely on one striker, Youssef En-Nesyri, during the team’s four games in the tournament. Not that Morocco lacked strikers. What was frustrating for Moroccan fans and some people in the media is that our former coach, Hervé Renard, continually chose to ignore players who stood out as top scorers in recent years. Among those is Youssef El Arabi, Morocco’s former forward and the Qatari League’s top scorer for two seasons in a row. While some used to find excuses for Renard by saying that the French coach favored players from European leagues because tournaments in the Gulf countries are not truly competitive, one needs only to remind them that Algeria’s Bounedjah also plays in the Qatari league. Abderazak Hamadallah, who became Saudi League’s top scorer in history joined the team shortly before AFCON. He was called up apparently only because of increased pressure on Renard. However Hamdallah mysterious left the squad as the Lion Atlas was preparing to fly to Egypt ahead of their first game against Namibia. Oualid Azarou was snubbed by Renard but was crowned the top scorer of the Egyptian league. Raja Athletic Club’s (RCA) forward Mouhcine Iajour, the Moroccan league’s top scorer last season, was also conspicuously missing from the team. Whether media reports that some French-speaking players in the team made sure to keep other players out is fact or fiction, or whether it was the coach’s decision, it was a dangerous gamble that Morocco paid for. What Moroccan fans would like to see is more transparency in the way things are run as far as the national football team is concerned. They also want to see that players who stand out are given the chance to represent their country, whether they play for teams in Europe, Africa, or the local Moroccan league. What they would certainly want to see is a Moroccan team with more consistency, and this is what Algeria showed in this year’s tournament. They won all their games, were the best scoring team with 12 goals and had the second-best defense. While Algerians deservedly celebrate Les Verts’ outstanding AFCON performances, Moroccans will gladly join in. The amount of love that people from both countries have shown for each other is a wake-up call for sports clubs, civil society, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens from both countries. They must continue building bridges that will allow people more interaction with one another in hopes of alleviating the burden of decades-long political hostility.

Rabat – Growing up, my grandpa used to say to me that mountains, as the lines formulating the entire natural scenery, can teach us more than books could ever reveal to us. My six-year-old self was listening to him utterly confused as to how an array of tall rocks could have the power to educate people.  I never really understood the true essence of this reiterated and seemingly hollow phrase, until I reached the age of 20 and climbed to the top of Mount Toubkal. I realized that nature can indeed unburden one’s inner strength and vigor to continue; to continue climbing; to continue ascending—to never give up.   The early A.M.s of Saturday, July 13, found our group of six at the roots of Mount Toubkal. Devoured by the darkness of the night and the strong breeze of the uninviting landscape, we were wearing heavy jackets and woolen beanies, holding trekking sticks and using our phones as flashlights.  We were finally ready to follow the long and rocky trail that would lead us to the summit. Although there were 4,167 meters separating us from Mount Toubkal’s top, we all knew that the best view comes after the hardest climb. “We began; there’s no way back,” I thought to myself. And at that moment, I knew that it would take us at least three hours to reach the summit—if we managed to make it. “You need to picture yourself at the top,” our guide repeated several times before we started our climb. “Don’t think for a second that you won’t make it.”  It was already too late for that. As we climbed higher, it was getting colder; the wind was blowing stronger, forcefully hitting our faces, rippling through our clothes and burning our skin.  Everything was pitch black, we could not understand the amount of distance we had covered, and we could not see what the remaining path looked like. I was trying not to check at the time; I did not want to be discouraged.  I was merely looking down at the trail we were following, faintly lit by our flashlights’ beam; full of rocks. In some places, thin as sand; our feet could easily dive in, in some others, giant and rough; demanding us to kneel and then climb. At times, I was looking at the sides. Our enormous shadows, enhanced by the flashlights, were reflected in the colossal rocks enclosing us. I was counting six; six shadows walking, kneeling, climbing and then I was looking back down.  During the short breaks we were taking, our guide demanded that we deeply inhale. He would then go on to explain that the higher up we went the less oxygen there was; we needed more air in our lungs. He would give us peanuts and Moroccan cookies to make sure our energy levels would allow us to continue. I could not resist; 4:30 A.M. Only an hour and ten minutes had passed, but it felt like much more. My body was already exhausted. I started feeling nauseous and the darkness surrounding us did not help. I asked to make a stop and sat on a wide rock. The group’s discussions sounded like far echoes to my ears. I tried to concentrate on what they were saying and realized they were looking at the stars above—so, I did too.  I had never seen anything similar to this before. The sky was full of stars, there was not a single space left uncovered. They were bright, forming clusters; all those delicately convoluted shapes that are never visible when you look above at a big city’s horizon. There were right there, just above us; it felt unreal. We remained silent; the only sound came from the wind. And at that moment, I felt small facing nature’s magnificence, beneath the most beautiful sky I had ever gazed at. And then, a shooting star crossed the starlit sky like a raindrop of jewelry, fading out in split seconds.  “Did you all see that?” someone uttered. We did. And it was high time we made that wish. “I wished to make it at the top,” one said.  “You should not say it, it won’t come true,” another said. I knew I wished the exact same thing and now I felt ready to do so —or at least that’s what I thought. We got up and continued. A few minutes later, I realized my hands were numb and almost bruised, as they had been exposed to the freezing air for a long time. Our guide immediately gave me thick skiing gloves and they instantly got better. I could finally feel my grip on my trekking stick again.  The decompression was now evident. My brain was lacking all the oxygen needed to even think straight, let alone support my body in the effort to ascend. And then I said it out loud.  “There’s no way I can make it.” How many times will one say this phrase in the span of a lifetime? And, what will it take to get up and continue on stronger? Moving forwards intact is all about determination and faith, whether that can be applied to ascending a mountain or overcoming a problem in real life.  Sometimes it’s all about our inner struggles, sometimes it’s just all mental—sometimes our own self is our worst enemy. And, indeed, those battles are the hardest fought, but give our triumph the greatest significance.   At the end of the day, difficulties are not stop signs, they’re just guidelines paving us the way; an entirely new trail that will make us stronger to succeed and better equipped for what’s to come.  And although nothing much can be seen through the mist, there is somehow the blissful feeling that one is looking at the right direction—always forwards; beyond our boundaries and limits.  In between those thoughts swirling inside my head, I noticed that few things in life are even more powerful than a positive push; a smile, a word of optimism, a “you can do it” when things get tough—five voices encouraging me to continue. “You are doing great, you got this.” “You have made it so far.” “You can do it—we can all do it.” “It’s 20 more minutes till we reach our stop for our long break and then half an hour to the top,” our guide said giving me three cubes of sugar to stop my dizziness. From this moment and onwards, everything was happening so fast. It was like my body had miraculously regained all the energy needed to continue. I started moving faster, feeling more determined than ever.  Day and night were finally merging. It was already dawn. Soon, the first rays of sunrise replaced darkness, breaking it up piece by piece, making us capable of seeing our surroundings. And there we were, ready to cross the last trail of our journey on the top. The view from the summit made us feel tiny as the imposing landscape unwrapped in front of our eyes, much wider than we could have ever expected. The sun was appearing little by little on the pink-tinted sky behind hundreds of mountain tops below Mount Toubkal. Everything was luminous—we had made it. We stayed there gazing at the sky, steadily holding the sun; a sigh of relief, a slight relaxing of tension. Peacefulness all over; everything was motionless —priceless moment. And at the top of the mountain, I realized I was at the bottom of another one for quite a while now. I would have to climb a lot more until I fully understood that every mountain top is within reach if someone just keeps climbing. Somewhere between the bottom of the climb and the summit lies the answer to why we climb. Whether that is an ascend towards the top of a mountain or towards the achievement of our goals in life, it’s completely irrelevant—one will always have to climb. Avoiding the pain of the ascent might as well mean missing out on the thrill of the summit. Life always demands us to go higher. The mind is our only limit. And, it is not about conquering the mountain; it is rather about conquering oneself.

Rabat – A time capsule sits hidden deep in the labyrinth of Fez’s thousand-year-old medina.  Inside, one won’t find a trove of sepia-toned photos or a dispatch to one’s future self, but a love letter to the golden age of North African music, carefully composed over decades by Mohammed El Hakim, who goes by the name he played under as musician: Al Araby.  For almost fifty years Al Araby has filled the walls of his shoebox-sized shop with songs. Piles of cassette tapes filled his booth, stacked high to the ceiling. The format may be dated, but Al Araby is content in his booth of tapes, surrounded by the artists he holds dear.  Al Araby’s motivation for running a cassette shop was simple. “Because I am a musician,” Al Araby said. “And I love music.” Al Araby’s thick, calloused hands pulled a case labeled Mohamed El Ghaoui off of a shelf dropped the cassette in the tape deck, and pressed play. The song started and a smile slid across his face. Al Araby looked up expectantly with eyes magnified by a pair of thick-lensed glasses that continually threaten to slide down his nose. He tapped the counter and hummed along, never breaking eye contact. It was an invitation to join his reverie. “I find myself at ease with music,” Al Araby said. “It calms me, ever since my childhood.”  When Al Araby opened his booth in 1970, he sold dresses, shirts, and another accouterment for a night on the town. Being a musician, he decided to start with he was familiar with – party supplies. Two years later he had grown bored of his wares and switched over to cassettes.  Over the last five decades Al Araby has accumulated so many tapes they sit stacked two-deep along the walls, further shrinking the already tiny shop. He estimated about ten thousand cassettes line the booth, floor to ceiling. While the shop might give those prone to claustrophobia the shivers, Al Araby feels right at home enveloped by the music of fellow Moroccans such as Abdelhadi Belkhayat, Naima Samih, and Abdelwahab Doukkali. These celebrated artists played epic live sets that would stretch on into the night. A single song might take up a whole side of one of the cassettes Al Araby sells at his shop. Growing up in Fez, Al Araby got his first taste of Moroccan music while celebrating Ashura with his family when he was six or seven years old. His parents bought him a set of tam-tam drums, and he was hooked. He began performing professionally in the early 70s, playing drums and singing with a group. Al Araby said he was never interested in money or fame.  “It was not about the musicians, it was about the audience. If we got a good audience, the party would go on and on, into the night,” Al Araby said. “Everybody was happy.“ Al Araby married and had two children, a son, and a daughter. Neither played an instrument, but like their father, both had an ear for songs. After a four-decade career as a musician, Al Araby laid down his drumsticks.  “I don’t like the parties these days,” Al Araby said. “Instead of playing music like this,” he continued, nodding at the stereo, now blasting a love song by Casablancan chanteuse Naima Samih, “they just play popular music.”  After he retired from performing, Al Araby continued working at his booth in the medina.  Al Araby lamented the change in music with the usual list of complaints: the internet, that it made attention spans shorter, lyrics less poetic, the art formless precious. 
 “Rai music, that appeared in the 90s in Algeria and the Maghreb in general, changed the mentality of the young people,” Al Araby said. “They play something for five minutes, and then it’s done,” he continued, referring to the hybrid version of Rai music that emerged in the 1990s, featuring shorter tracks and international influences. Instead of fighting the inevitable changes, Al Araby just stopped moving forward. Most of Al Araby’s customers are now over 30 years old, fans of the same musical era he specializes in selling. His older customers brought damaged musical treasures for Al Araby to repair, carefully mending the snapped or twisted tape inside the cassette. Several shops in the medina also sold music. Some offered a smattering of tapes but focused on more modern formats. Unlike the other booths, Al Araby’s shop was frozen in time.  “CDs aren’t authentic. They aren’t original,” Al Araby said. “As an artist, you can’t guarantee your rights. You can make a thousand copies in a second.”  Because the production of cassettes in Morocco phased out in the mid-90s, Al Araby estimated all of the tapes in his shop have sat on the shelves at least 15 years. Newer additions included recitations of Suras from the Koran with handwritten labels. Albums of older classic musicians dated closer to 40 years. “I start each morning with the Koran,” Al Araby said as he explained his daily routine in the shop. “After the Koran, I play instrumental music. Then maybe some Oriental music as the day goes on.” The other shop owners on the street, many who have also worked in the medina for decades, have never complained about the music emanating from Al Araby’s booth. Instead, they encourage him.
 “Sometimes my neighbors make requests,” Al Araby said. “I love this kind of music, it’s authenticity. It’s not about the money. If I wanted to make a lot of money, I know what to sell,” Al Araby said. “But that is not the point for me.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed a cable of congratulations to the Interim President of Algeria Abdelkader Ben Salah after Algeria’s national football team won the final match of the African Cup of Nations (CAN 2019). In his letter, King congratulated Algeria on the deserved victory. “I would like to express to the Algerian people my warmest congratulations on this continental football achievement of Algerian football.” The monarch also conveyed the Moroccan people’s congratulations to Algeria.  “On this historic event, on behalf of the entire Moroccan people, I am pleased to share with the Algerian people our pride in this deserved coronation.” The King said that this is the victory of a “neighboring and brotherly Maghreb country.”  For the King, the win is a victory for Morocco as well. King Mohammed VI said that he appreciated the high technical performance and the highly competitive spirit of the Algerian team throughout the tournament. Since the elimination of Morocco’s national team from the tournament, millions of Moroccan fans have cheered for the Algerian team.  After scoring their first goal, people in Moroccan cafes shouted the well-known chant: 1,2,3; Viva Algeria (long live Algeria). The chant is now widely repeated in the Maghreb region after the Algerian football team clinched the 2019 African Cup of Nations. Algeria won the final match against Senegal (1-0). Algeria’s Baghdad Bounedjah scored their solo goal in the second minute of the match.

Rabat – Spanish Minister of Agriculture Luis Planas has again expressed satisfaction with the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement. Planas said that the agreement is of greatt importance to his country as it allows the Spanish fleet to use Moroccan waters. He said that Spain will receive nearly 92 licenses, more than half of the possible 138 licenses. Planas added that the first joint commission of the new Morocco-EU fisheries protocol completed its work Thursday, July 18, in Rabat. The commission discussed the practicalities and technical aspects needed for the issuance of the first licenses, Planas said, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Planas explained that ship owners in Spain have already prepared their application files to obtain fishing licenses and made the necessary payments to start fishing activities next week. “With the commitment of the Moroccan side to ensure fast processing of applications, we hope that the first licenses can be issued and that fishing operations will begin next week,” Planas said. On June 24,  Morocco’s House of Representative adopted Law 14.19, approving the fisheries deal. Morocco and the EU signed an agreement to renew the fisheries deal on January 14. The deal covers the fishing area from parallel 35 and Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to parallel 22 and Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Moroccan southern provinces in Western Sahara. Spain considers the agreement of ultimate importance as it will provide greater flexibility in respect of “the obligation to land in Moroccan ports, as well as the maintenance of the amount of fees relating to the access to fishing areas used by Spanish vessels,” Planas said. The Spanish official added that the new fisheries agreement “should promote the sustainability of the fleet in its economic and environmental aspects.” He concluded that it will also help creating job opportunities and “wealth in areas highly dependent on fishing, as well as ensuring strict control of the catches made, while preserving fishery resources in the region.”

Rabat – The Spanish government approved the €30 million today, July 19. The amount comes in addition to the €140 million promised by the European Union to help Morocco fight against illegal immigration, announced the Spanish government spokesperson Isabel Celaa, at a press conference. The reinforced relations between Morocco and Spain have contributed to a 27% drop this year in irregular migration, according to a statement by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Two weeks ago Spain approved a grant of €26 million to buy and deliver to Morocco 750 vehicles, drones, scanners, radars and other technical equipment for strengthening the control of its borders, reported Spanish newspaper El Pais. The grant was the second installment of Spain’s contribution to the €140 million EU fund.  In a press release today, the Spanish government made clear that addressing illegal migration and human trafficking is a joint responsibility for “the countries of origin, transit, and destination,” making “cooperation with other countries the essential axis of the Spanish migration policy.” The latest grant is designed to reinforce Morocco’s existing capabilities.  Local authorities “are the ones that can develop the most direct actions for the dismantling of criminal organizations dedicated to human trafficking,” reminds the Spanish government. Morocco’s land borders with the Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla are points of concern when it comes to illegal immigration. This morning, close to 200 sub-Saharan Africans tried to force through the Melilla border post, climbing the fence between Morocco and Spain. Spanish and Moroccan border forces immediately responded to the incident, including deploying a Guardia Civil helicopter, reported Spanish news source El Espanol.  Up to 50 migrants managed to cross over into Spain, and made their way to the temporary migration facility (CETI), from which they cannot be deported.

Rabat – The Head of Government,Saad Eddine El Othmani, is expected in Dakhla on July 18, accompanied by a large ministerial delegation. El Othmani will visit the city at King Mohammed VI’s request. The King instructed the government to address the possible concerns of citizens and inquire about the progress of construction sites in Western Sahara, in southern Morocco.  El Othmani will visit projects under the Southern Provinces Development Program (2015-2021), especially those scheduled to be delivered this year. The projects are part of King Mohammed VI’s MAD 77 billion development program in the region. The King launched the program in Laayoune in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the Green March in 2015. In a speech, the King explained that the development model aims to “seal these provinces’ integration into the unified homeland and to enhance the influence of the Sahara region as an economic hub and a crucial link between Morocco and its African roots.”

Rabat – Around 7 am on Friday, about 200 migrants tried to scale the border fence in Morocco and cross into the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla. Around 50 reached the Temporary Immigrant Stay Center (CETI) after successfully crossing over to Spanish soil. This was the latest of an ongoing series of coordinated attempts the migrants, who hailed primarily from sub-Saharan Africa, have made to cross the series of fences dividing the two countries.  Alerts went out to local and national Spanish police warning them before the incident. Moroccan authorities stopped about 70 people before the migrants were able to climb over the fence. A further 25 individuals were apprehended in the border zone between the two countries and returned to Morocco. Prepared with grapplers used to scale the border fences, migrants were also armed with stones and other projectiles used as weapons against authorities. Six Spanish civil guards were injured during the incident. One migrant suffered a fractured leg. Of the migrants who successfully crossed into Spain, approximately 50 were able to run the 100 meters stretch to reach CETI where they are temporarily protected from deportation.  Although located on the African continent, Melilla is internationally considered part of Spain. Like Ceuta about 350 kilometers to the Northwest of Melilla, the port city remained Spanish territory after Morocco claimed its independence. The two countries are divided by a seven-mile-long fence, one of the most fortified borders on the planet. Multiple layers of chain-link fence, barbed wire, and a large ditch are arranged to keep people from crossing over to the Spanish side. Similar to attempts made last year, hundreds of migrants approached the fence in a coordinated effort designed to overwhelm border authorities. While the majority are apprehended and prevented from crossing over, the sheer number of migrants involved in these efforts usually means some will succeed. While Spain dedicates resources to prevent illegal migrants from entering their country, Morocco also has reasons for protecting the border fence. Morocco’s relationship with mainland Europe has earned the country Advanced Status Partnership. This affords the country certain economic and political advantages when working with EU countries.  In order to maintain this status, the North African country contributes to efforts to keep migrants in Morocco from crossing over into the Spanish enclave.

Rabat – “No to rape, terrorism, and violence,” and no to “hatred and violence” are among the slogans raised today in front of the Moroccan Parliament to denounce the rape and murder of a 34-year old woman in Mellah Rabat in June. Police found the victim, Hanane, left in a Rabat street after being violently sexually assaulted by a 56-year old rapist. Hanane died after complications from the injuries she suffered during the assault on June 11. The news of the rape case went viral after a video documenting the incident was posted online earlier this week. In response to the horrific incident, women took the decison to denounce the alarming number of rape cases in the region. Women activists held banners today, July 19, in front of the parliament, urging the government to take strict measures against perpetrators of sexual assaults against women. Bouchra Abdou,  an activist, feminist, and president of Tahadi Center was one of the women who called on the organization of the protest to condemn the rape and murder of the 34-year old. Angry over the incident, Abdou told Morocco World News that the rapist should receive the ultimate punishment for his crime . Abdou said that the crime transcended physical violence, to torture leading to death. “It is time for all those involved to shoulder their responsibility for protection,” she told MWN. She also emphasized the importance of the media in broadcasting educational programs against rape and sexual assaults. Abdou said that the education system should integrate programs to raise awareness  against violence. Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN)  announced earlier this week the arrest of the main perpetrator, who used bottles to rape the victim. The mother of the victim also said that the rapist and murderer had made holes in her daughter’s body with a screwdriver. After raping her, the suspect hit the victim in the head with a hammer. DGSN announced on Thursday, July 18, the arrest of eight more suspects involved in the crime, including the individual who filmed the video. The detained suspects are accused of not reporting the crime and not going to the victim’s aid after witnessing the incident.  The incident, which is among other heinious crimes that shook Moroccan society, came after the Moroccan courts implemented  Law 103-13 on gender-based discrimination, which came into effect in September 2018. The law punishes perpetrators of rape, sexual harassment, and cyber crimes. The law gives prison sentences ranging from one to six months for perpetrators of sexual harassment in public spaces, by use of words, acts or signals of a sexual nature for sexual purposes. The law comes after widely-publicized cases of rape, harassment, and violence caused outrage among Moroccan citizens.

Rabat – One of Marrakech’s most popular restaurants, Le Salama, is under fire for supposedly turning away Moroccans and only letting foreigners in. Moroccan photographer, Amira Azzouzi, was the first to draw attention to the issue on her Instagram account (@azamira), which has 13.6 thousand followers, in a series of stories. Azzouzi posted that she believes the restaurant does not accept Moroccans to maintain their reputation as a tourist hub, especially for the good-looking European kind. Azzouzi also spoke to Morocco World News, detailing her experience with the restaurant, which is owned by a Moroccan man, Nordine Fakir. Le Salama initially contacted her, she said, asking if she could photograph their restaurant. She quickly agreed and a date and time were agreed on. However, when she showed up to the restaurant at the scheduled time, with a friend in tow, security wouldn’t let her in as the restaurant was supposedly “full.” As she stood there trying to contact management so they could tell the bouncers to let her in, she watched them wave “two blonde tourists in, without being questioned at all.” Realizing she had been lied to about the restaurant being at full capacity, she then called reception who confirmed there was indeed space available at that moment. “When I tried to tell the receptionist what happened, she hung up on me,” Azzouzi told MWN. “I tried to call back five or six times, and eventually, she answered, but was super rude to me,” she continued. When she spoke to family and friends about the incident, she found others had had similar experiences. “I was outraged, so I decided to speak about it openly on my Instagram stories,” she said. “I was then overwhelmed by the responses, a lot of people had experienced the same thing at Le Salama, and others told me about other places that practice this ridiculous form of segregation.” Although the restaurant has since removed the ability to post and see reviews on their Facebook page, the screenshots circulating online from before the feature was removed seem to further substantiate Azzouzi’s story. “Apparently, the servers are the only ones allowed to not be blonde in this restaurant,” said one comment, echoing the sentiments of many others. “In France, it would be an absolute scandal if a restaurant was turning away Arabs. But in Morocco… and coming from a Moroccan… It’s pathetic and incomprehensible,” the user continued. The discrimination from the restaurant Moroccans are reporting seems to not be a recent thing, with complaints dating back long before Azzouzi came forward. Another woman, named Selima Zr, took to Facebook in February to condemn the restaurant.  “I never thought I would live an episode of racism in my own country. On the evening of February 8, we made a reservation at the restaurant Le Salama Marrakech. A woman named Karima asked us which riad we came from after we confirmed the reservation.  “Once there, we were told that there was no reservation in our name. We were at the door waiting for someone to come down to give us an explanation while Europeans entered freely without reservation,” the post read.  “Finally, the woman with whom we made the reservation told us that a riad more important than ours had made a reservation. I told her that it was not professional to cancel a reservation without warning. I asked her for a claims book, but her answer was a no with a mocking smile.” “All this because we are Moroccans and they only wanted Europeans. I wanted to cry, I never felt so much scorn and exclusion. She was rude, disrespectful and lying. Afterward, we knew that no riad had made a reservation, it was just an excuse. They are CLASSISTS AND RACISTS!” Selima also alleges that she, too, had many people come forward with similar stories after hearing hers. She also claims that the restaurant blocked her on Facebook and deleted her comments. Selima attached dozens of reviews to the post, of people shaming the restaurant for being racist and turning them away, just as they did to Selima and Azzouzi. Several people even claimed that the restaurant asked them for their passports and their religion at the reception. Morocco World News contacted Le Salama for a statement, and the restaurant simply responded: “Our restaurant is open to all. We are looking for customers and not nationalities.” A photo was also attached to the message, an apparent collage of Moroccans in the restaurant:  While Moroccans are represented on the restaurant’s Instagram, especially influential and conventionally attractive ones, such as Moroccan singer Redone, the page is mostly overwhelmed by photos of young, blonde women.     #lesalamaskybar#marrakech#marrakesh#marrakesch#paris#london#athens#warsaw#stockholm#oslo#copenhagen#riodejaneiro#saopaulo#vienna#berlin #stuttgart#bruxelles#madrid#ibiza#barcelone#milano#roma#kiev#odessa#moscow#prague#waiting4u#quebec#montreal A post shared by  𝕃𝕖 𝕊𝕒𝕝𝕒𝕞𝕒 (@lesalamamarrakech) on May 24, 2019 at 9:59am PDT      #lesalamamarrakech#whataplace#jemaaelfna#paris#milano#lisboa#barcelona#madrid#varsovie#helsinki#prague#hamburg#ibiza#anvers#cannes#toulouse#belgrade#waiting4u#kiev#moscow#dubai#budapest#geneve#ibiza#warsaw#bucharest#dublin#manchester#lviv#riga#amsterdam A post shared by  𝕃𝕖 𝕊𝕒𝕝𝕒𝕞𝕒 (@lesalamamarrakech) on Jan 29, 2019 at 2:15am PST  The restaurant owner Nordine Fakir has been flat-out denying the claims to multiple outlets, telling Telquel: that “any person with the characteristics of a customer is welcome, regardless of their origins, religion, or nationality.” “We are in Morocco, the restaurant is run by Moroccans, all the staff is Moroccan. I do not understand how, or why, we would do such a thing,” said Fakir. “There may have been confusion when customers come and ask for coffee because we are located in Jamâa El Fna, but in these cases, we simply explain that it is a restaurant.” He does admit that the restaurant mostly has foreign clientele, but says: “We are a Moroccan restaurant, offering traditional Moroccan cuisine, so of course our clientele will be mainly foreign.”  “This is not a choice or a selection that we make, and it is not because we do not accept Moroccans. This is simply because in general, it does not interest Moroccans to eat a tajine.”

Rabat – Speaking at a press briefing yesterday, July 18, Mustapha El Khalfi, the spokesperson of the Moroccan government, said that Rabat is pleased with the recent storm of scrutiny and condemnation that the Polisario is facing for its crackdown on dissent. El Khalfi said that recent reports have highlighted the difference between the predominant narrative in Polisario-friendly circles and the reality of suffering, distress, and restricted freedom in the camps.  For Morocco, the reports are consistent with its own repeated condemnations of Polisario’s mistreatment of refugees who do not subscribe to its separatist agenda. Morocco has repeatedly maintained over the years that many Sahrawis do not identify with the Polisario’s agenda in the decades-long dispute still going on in Western Sahara.  Reports of the group implacably mistreating dissidents and cracking down on sit-ins are bringing to light the discrepancy between Polisario’s narrative and the reality that many refugees are critical of the front’s agenda, El Khalfi explained. Of Morocco’s stance on ending the suffering of refugees in Tindouf, he stressed that Morocco was “greatly dismayed by reports of massive human rights violations” in the camps.  El Khalfi’s comments come after Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported on the arbitrary arrests and imprisonment of three Sahrawi dissidents.  According to HRW, the three detainees were arrested and jailed without due process for simply voicing their discontent with the Polisario leadership.  Prior to their arrest in June, all three dissidents had shared posts on social media in which they lamented oppression in the camps and demanded that the separatist front be more willing to engage in dialogue to end the Western Sahara stalemate. In its report, HRW urged Polisario to release the three detainees after failing to provide “credible evidence” showing that “they may be guilty of genuinely criminal acts and not just peacefully criticizing the Polisario.” Khalifi explained, however, that simply denouncing and condemning them will not be sufficient enough to end the “deeply concerning” situation in Tindouf.  A step in the right direction, according to the Moroccan official, would be for the international community to exert more pressure on the separatist front to make it commit to the ongoing UN-moderated dialogue for a mutually negotiated and lasting political settlement in Western Sahara.  “It is now time to address this conflict that has been going on for far too long,” he said, adding that “Algeria and Polisario should show more willingness to engage” in the UN-led political process.  The mention of Algeria reaffirmed Morocco’s position on Algeria’s full-fledged participation in the conflict.  Over the years, Rabat has maintained that Algeria is the main instigator and the brain behind Polisario’s narrative and agenda. The dispute would not have lasted this long without the North African country’s active support for the separatist front’s actions, El Khalfi suggested. But alluding to Algeria was also meant to echo Human Rights Watch’s latest report on arbitrary arrests and in the Tindouf camps, which also pointed out that Algiers has a hand behind the Polisario leadership’s every move. “Algeria cannot subcontract the protection of human rights on its territory and turn a blind eye if the Polisario violates them,” HRW said in its report, as the body called on Algeria to stop supporting the Polisario Front and its grim record on human rights.

Rabat – The prefectural police department of Agadir has decided to clampdown on professional begging with DNA tests. The police will now use DNA tests to verify the relationship of beggars to the children accompanying them. This initiative comes after the discovery of several networks specialized in begging and exploiting children and infants. The “human trafficking” mafias go even further by teaching the children how to trigger people’s pity. The professional beggars also give the children sleeping pills to assure they’re calm during ‘begging hours’. The initiative aims to fight against the proliferation of begging, especially during the summer which is a significant period for tourism in the city. Professional begging has become a widespread phenomenon in all parts of Morocco. Large cities such as Casablanca, Tangier, Marrakech, and Fez are the most affected by this trend. On April 20, passersby caught a man and a woman who were about to abduct a child in front of a kindergarten in Taddart, in the commune of Anza in Agadir. The incident was caught on camera. Following the aborted kidnapping, the woman said that they lure the children with treats before taking them in a car to a female beggar who lives in Izeggane, Ait Melloul (15 kilometers south of Agadir). Assabah Newspaper reported a similar case of the attempted kidnapping of an 11-year-old girl in the same neighborhood the day before, April 19. Luckily, local residents aborted the kidnapping. Many beggars use children to soften their potential targets. Children are often rented by drug-using parents to professional beggars. The Moroccan Penal Code sanctions professional begging. Article 326 stipulates that “anyone with means of subsistence resorting to begging shall be punished by imprisonment for one to six months.” Similarly, Article 330 addresses the exploitation of children. The article says that whoever delivers a child to one or more beggars or vagrants is punished by “six months to two years imprisonment.”

Rabat  – Morocco’s National Security Fund (CNSS) held a board of directors meeting this week, attended by the Minister for Employment Mohamed Yatim, to discuss 2018 activities and statistics on Moroccan wages. The average salary of Moroccans who were covered by CNSS in 2018 was MAD 5,188 ($541.63) per month, reports the social security fund. Broken down into specific sectors, the average wages vary. Public sector average wages sat at MAD 7,549 per month ($788.12). The highest paid workers were employed in the financial and insurance sectors (MAD 14,749 per month or $1,538.39), followed by the IT and communications sector (MAD 10,953 per month or $1,142.45). The lowest paid workers were employed in the agriculture sector (MAD 3,028 per month or $315.84), and in the hospitality sector (MAD 3,963 or $413.36). The median salary, which gives an indication of where most of the wages sit, was MAD 2,723 ($284.28). These figures only show data collected from the 3.47 million employees declared to the CNSS. Many Moroccan workers are not declared to the CNSS. While the overall average wage increased since 2017 by 1.7%, consumer prices have also increased. Many workers receive less than Morocco’s minimum wage of MAD 2570 per month, which paints a concerning picture when it comes to Moroccans’ purchasing power.  Price increases and a drop in purchasing power were at the heart of a national-scale consumer boycott last year. The boycott campaign spread through social media between April and June, targeting Centrale Danone (the Moroccan subsidiary of global milk product company Danone), Sidi Ali (a local bottled water producer), and the Afriquia petrol stations, as they upped their prices. The boycott was widespread, showing the populations’ concern with taking concrete action against economic disadvantage. Unlike the Hirak Rif uprisings in 2016 and 2017, where Moroccans from disadvantaged regions of the country demanded economic opportunity, last year’s boycott included Morocco’s middle and middle-to-upper classes.  Following the boycott, Danone’s annual 2018 sales in Morocco dropped by MAD 1.9 billion (approximately $200 million).

Rabat – After the Atlas Lions were knocked out of the African Cup of Nations (CAN) on July 6, thousands of Moroccan fans shifted their support to the Algerian team.  Last Sunday, July 14, enthusiasm grew when Algeria qualified for the final match. Activists seized upon the opportunity to build solidarity between the neighboring countries, whose border closed in 1994.  This weekend, Moroccans and Algerians will march to the border to demand that their governments reopen the doors between the two countries. “We must take advantage of this moment to send a message about the links that unite the two peoples,” human rights activist and march organizer Hassane Ammari told EFE. Instead of fostering a divide between fans, football has built alliances this summer.  Moroccans have long supported the Algerian football team. When Morocco was no longer in the running, the decision to root for their neighbors as Algeria fought their way to the final was immediate. Algeria will face off against Senegal in the final match of CAN on Friday, July 19.  On Saturday, marches will depart from sister cities on either side of the border, including Oujda in Morocco and Maghnia in Algeria, and Saidia-Marsa in Morocco and Ben M’Hidi in Algeria.  Activists have harnessed the energy CAN generated to draw attention to the economic and social repercussions of the closed border on surrounding communities, some of which were literally split in two 25 years ago. “The situation of the families living in Morocco and in the other side of the border is getting worse,” Ammari said. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Maghreb Union countries lose around $16 billion annually to border closure. Multiple protests to reopen the border have been organized in the past. Last July, activists participated in two simultaneous marches in both Morocco and Algeria, meeting on either side of the dividing fence in the border town of Zouj Bghal. Tensions between the countries have been inflamed by Algeria’s support for the Polisario Front, and by the 1994 bombing in Marrakesh involving terrorists of Algerian descent which led to the border officially closing later that year. However, the roots of the dispute stretch back further to territorial imbalances bourne out of the colonial era. Activists hope their governments will put aside decades of dispute that have jeopardized the safety and security of generations on either side of the divide. “This march will mainly call for the reopening of border,” Ammari said, “but will also demand the creation of a humanitarian bridge for the families.”

Rabat –  Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita has said that, at a regional level, Morocco and other parties to the conflict must move towards finding a mutually acceptable solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. The minister said that the conflict is a “case with well-defined outlines.” “What remains to be done is to find a final solution to this problem,” Bourita said in an interview with Italian press agency LaPressa. He also renewed calls for Algeria to shoulder its responsibility as a party to the conflict, rather than an observer. Historically, Algeria denies its status as a significant actor in the conflict, calling itself an “observer.” Bourita emphasized the need to bring both Algeria and the Polisario Front to join logical and pragmatic discussions. He explained that all parties need to be involved in working towards a final political solution so that “they can understand that it is time to resolve this dispute according to these parameters.” Morocco  has long emphasized that its Autonomy Plan, an initiative Morocco submitted to the UN in 2007,  will offer a mutually acceptable, pragmatic, and serious solution to end the decades-long conflict. Algeria has long claimed that the conflict should be settled between Morocco and the Polisario. The country, which hosts, finances, and backs Polisario’s separatist claims, defines itself as merely an observer, a neighbouring country witnessing the conflict, rather than as a party obliged to engage in negotiations for a political solution.  Morocco emphasizes that Algeria has a responsibility to enter into a dialogue on behalf of the Sahrawis resident in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. Morocco, who does not recognize the legitimacy of the separatist group, maintains that the Sahrawi refugees should be represented by Algeria, a legally recognized party to the conflict, during negotiations for a resolution. EU-Morocco partnership In the interview, Bourita also spoke about the importance of the EU-Morocco partnership.  He drew attention to the North African country’s assets which attract partners worldwide. Through its  partnerships with the EU, Morocco has managed to position itself as an important ally for theEU, the official said in an interview with Italian news agency LaPresse. “The kingdom is geographically the closest southern Mediterranean country to Europe, with which it has relations that span half a century.” Bourita recalled that the partnership between Morocco and the EU dates back to 1969. Touting Morocco’s assets, the minister said that Morocco has all the assets to “position ourselves as a reliable and useful partner, which is why we do not want an unbalanced relationship with Europe.”  
 The official said that Morocco want a mutually beneficial bond, offering Morocco’s model and strategy to fight s worldwide phenomenons such as irregular migration and terrorism. Morocco’s security services foiled more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since January 2019, according to the Moroccan director of migration at the Ministry of Interior, Khalid Zerouali. A transit country as well as a destination for migrants, Morocco has been increasing its efforts to crackdown on irregular migration networks. “In return, Morocco can also benefit from the partnership with Europe in terms of economy to boost trade and improve integration in the European market.” Bourita also expressed Morocco’s interest  in boosting cooperation with Italy. Bourita said  that Rabat and Rome are tied  by “strong friendship relations,” because of the large Moroccan community in Italy. The minister said that the two countries share common challenges in the Mediterranean. “ What we need today is ambition,” Bourita said as he emphasized his country’s decision to make Italy one of the top economic partners of Morocco. “We can do so many things: Morocco, which is today a platform for foreign investment, can attract Italians, given the natural location of the Kingdom as a bridge to Africa,” he emphasized. Bourita said that the two countries could also strengthen their relations through political dialogue as they are both facing different challenges related to terrorism and climate change. He also recalled that Morocco’s foreign policy is based on a win-win cooperation. He said that it is based on clarity, ambition, and principles. “King Mohammed VI’s  African policy relies on a solid historical and religious link, in addition to concrete projects of South-South cooperation, development and consolidation of infrastructure,” he said, quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat – The Coscharis Group plant will start assembling two models, the Renault Logan and the Renault Duster. Distribution of the cars in Nigeria is set to start in October, Renault announced in a press release on July 18. The partnership expands the Renault group’s presence in Africa. The car manufacturer currently produces cars in Morocco (402,086 cars were produced in 2018 across the group’s Tangier and Casablanca operations) and Algeria (70,597 cars in 2018). When it comes to sales, Renault identifies itself as leading the automobile sector in Africa with an 18% market share. The most important countries in sales volume are currently Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, and Egypt. “The group’s objective is to maintain its leadership within these countries and respond to the demand of the new emerging middle class of the countries like Nigeria,” explained Renault in the press release on the new Nigerian partnership. For Fabrice Cambolive, Senior Vice President of the Africa, Middle-East India Pacific region of Groupe Renault, with a population of over 200 million, Nigeria is a “strategic African country.” “The Coscharis Group is a recognized player in car assembly and distribution. Thanks to their expertise and our products adapted to the local needs, we will be able to answer immediately to the customers’ demand in Nigeria,” he added. The Renault group sold close to 3.9 million vehicles in 134 countries in 2018, with 36 manufacturing sites, 12,700 points of sales and over 180,000 employees. The company is “focusing on international expansion,” Renault explains.

Rabat- As Morocco prepares to celebrate King Mohammed VI’ twenty years in power, international observers are chiming in to praise the political reforms and socio-economic transformations Morocco has seen over the past two decades. In a recent opinion article for Daily Maverick, one of South Africa’s leading newspapers, Gregg Mills of the Benthurst Foundation, a Johannesburg-based think tank, extolled the transformations that have taken place in Morocco under King Mohammed’s guidance.  King Mohammed, Mills wrote, has propelled Morocco into the category of countries whose impressive changes in recent years mean they have gradually become of enormous importance in regional and global affairs.  Not only has Morocco changed on the domestic front, he argued, it is quickly becoming an inspiration for an Africa hungry for the kinds of development projects and social transformations that have become the signature of the King’s two decades in power. With telling congratulatory language, the article noted, “The king has led a gradual liberalization of the country, rolling out big infrastructure projects including Africa’s only high-speed rail network and the continent’s largest port complex. Where others have deliberated, Morocco has delivered.” The consensus among many Morocco-bound travelers is that places like Marrakech, Tangier, and Ouazazate, among others, are great holiday destinations. Nature is generous and hospitable in those places, while the urban infrastructure and city life graces visitors with the comfortable and cozy life most travelers crave.  While all that is a testament to a changing and vastly modernizing Morocco, the article contends, there is more to the North African kingdom’s success story than its exultant tourism and its mushrooming infrastructure. There is also, among others: Tangiers’ Med I and II, the Casablanca-Tangier high-speed train, the Hassan Tower project, the Renault plant in Kenitra, the overall booming aeronautical and automotive sector, and the colossal investment in solar power at Noor’s Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) tower. Morocco going through a ‘positive cycle’ All these massive projects point to a success ingrained in a measured combination of political will, qualified personnel, and a leadership operating with clear vision and a sense of responsibility to actually deliver. “The lesson of Morocco’s contemporary success at delivering and then using efficiently big infrastructure assets is down to a combination of leadership, vision, delivery – of the need, simply, for both software and hardware. Just providing infrastructure is not enough. You need skills and systems too, and a supportive policy environment,” Mills explained. On the political front, Morocco has gradually moved towards granting more rights to minorities.  This, according to the article, has been particularly visible in the advances that women rights have experienced in Morocco. In addition, there have been a series of government actions to achieve a more robust social inclusiveness (through social housing or university and vocational training scholarships for students from low-income backgrounds). Another ingredient in Morocco’s “positive cycle” under King Mohammed VI’s direction has been the development of Morocco’s foreign relations by solidifying relationships with traditional partners and investing in new friendships.  The strategy seems to have yielded satisfying results. Morocco has secured “preferential trade relations with 55 countries,” while consolidating its continental leadership “through a big diplomatic and economic push into Africa.” For Mohcine Jazouli, Morocco’s Delegate Minister for African Cooperation, the bulk of this progress boils down to King Mohammed VI’s enlightened leadership. When the King was crowned in July 1999, Jazouli told Mills, “he had plan.” He added, “Like a good commander, he has led his troops in a clear direction.” With this celebratory assessment of King Mohammed’s leadership of Morocco, Mills’s article joins the chorus of voices commemorating two decades of massive transformations marked by a perceived desire to move forward and “actually deliver” on promises.  Just last week, French newspaper Le Point also celebrated King Mohammed VI’s “royal vision.” The paper published an editorial which poured out words of celebration and compliments on Morocco, calling it an established continental power and a global power in the making.

Rabat – Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz announced on Thursday, July 18 that he had met his Bahraini counterpart, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa during a visit to Washington D.C. This meeting was the first between the two countries, which historically do not share diplomatic relations. Israel holds diplomatic relations with only two Arab countries: Egypt and Jordan. The country has voiced concerns over Iran which have brought it closer to the Gulf nations in recent years. According to an Israeli Foreign Ministry statement, the meeting was coordinated by the US State Department as part of a conference on religious liberty. It was organized in Washington by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The ministers “addressed the subject of Iran and regional threats as well as cooperation between the two states and agreed to continue,” the statement added. Katz took to Twitter to upload a photograph of himself smiling alongside his Bahraini counterpart Khalifa. Katz said the public meeting with the Bahraini minister was “another example of [the countries’] growing diplomatic connections.” “I will continue to work with Benjamin Netanyahu (the Israeli Prime Minister) to advance Israel’s relations with the Gulf countries,” Katz wrote on Twitter.  Gulf Arab Nations Interests The Gulf Arab nations share a common cause with Israel due to their hostility towards Iran. Tehran is widely accused by the Gulf states of wanting to expand its influence in the region, and of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. In June 2019, Bahrain hosted a conference to discuss what President Donald Trump has described as the economic part of the US Administration’s “deal of the century.” The ‘deal’ is a plan which aims to resolve the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict by economic means. The meeting came at a time of escalating tensions in the Gulf region between the United States and Iran, with the latter facing the austere sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.  In an interview with The Times of Israel on the sidelines of the conference, Khalifa expressed the desire for better relations and eventually “peace” with Israel. Israel, he firmly declared, is a part of the region and “there to stay.” He said that he would like to visit Israel in the future but was reluctant to normalize ties with Jerusalem in the absence of a peace deal. In the meantime, Bahrain’s Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday, July 18 that it will host a maritime and air navigation security meeting soon. The ministry said the meeting, which will also be led by the United States and Poland, is a follow-up to a February 2019 conference held in Warsaw.  Over 60 nations would be invited to the conference, the same number that attended the Warsaw meeting earlier this year. A lower-lever official from Israel will be invited, in what would mark a rare instance of an Israeli official visiting an Arab state for these purposes. That conference was originally organized as part of the endeavors to counter Iran, but later focused on the achievement of stability in the Middle Eastern volatile region. The meeting’s stated focus on air and maritime navigation comes amid rising tensions in the Gulf between the US and Iran, fueling concerns over potential Iranian attempts to impede international shipping. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that this meeting will provide an opportunity for consultation and exchange of visions among many countries in the world, to find ways to deter the Iranian threat and ensure freedom of navigation in this strategic region to the world,” according to the statement released by the Bahraini Foreign Ministry. Meanwhile, the US’s largest naval base in the Middle East is situated in Bahrain.

Rabat –  The Executive Committee of the African Confederation of Football (CAF) appointed Moroccan Fouzi Lekjaa as its second vice president after the General Assembly of the confederation held on Thursday, July 18, in Cairo, Egypt. Lekjaa, who is President of the Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), served CAF as its 3rd vice president since July 2017. FRMF elected Lekjaa as its president in 2014. CAF also decided to replace Tunisian businessman Tarek Bouchamaoui with Congolese Constant Amari as the head of the interclub competition organization committee. The role of Bouchamaoui, one of the most important businessmen in Tunisia, was crucial at the CAF. Tunisians praised the businessman’s intervention in the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League match between El Ahly and Esperance Tunis. Tarek Bouchamaoui was also instrumental in imposing sanctions against El Ahly, who paid $20,000 in fines. Sanctions also included the suspension of Moroccan striker Walid Azaro for two games. CAF  Executive Committee also appointed CAF  President Ahmad Ahmad as president of the organizing committee for the African Cup of Nations. In January, CAF decorated the FRMF and its president with the Best Federation Award. FRMF said that CAF’s recognition rewards the achievements of national football both in terms of technical  results and at the level of governance and management.

Rabat – On July 18, a Moroccan man tried to forcibly access the headquarters of the Moroccan television channel 2M. The man was apparently in an “abnormal state.” The suspect allegedly tried to enter the channel’s Ain Sebaa premises, threatening the security guards at the back door. He was carrying two knives (a long knife and a sword). Security guards tried to prevent him from entering. The perpetrator fled the premises in the face of the guards’ resistance.  2M security managed to neutralize him before putting him in one of their service cars to await the arrival of the police. The police took the individual to Ain Sebaa police station where he was held in custody. The General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) clarified in a statement that preliminary investigations show the incident was a personal dispute.  The statement explains that one of the security guards at 2M was involved in a dispute with a mason at a construction site adjacent to the 2M headquarters. The mason was under the influence of drugs according to the DGSN.

Rabat – The United States announced that a US Navy ship has “destroyed” an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, after the drone threatened the vessel. Iran has dismissed the claim. The Pentagon said in a statement that the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship, took “defensive action” against an Iranian drone at 10 am local time (07:00 GMT) on Thursday, July 18. US President Donald Trump said the Iranian drone had flown within 1,000 meters of the USS Boxer and had disregarded several calls to stand down. “This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters,” US President Donald Trump said. “The US reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities, and interests.” “The drone was immediately destroyed,” he added. The Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, denied the claim in a Twitter post on Friday, July 19. “We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else. I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] by mistake!” Araghchi wrote.  Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was in New York for meetings at the United Nations, said he had “no information about losing a drone.”  The implication took place in international waters while the ship was crossing the Strait of Hormuz to enter the Gulf. The Boxer is among several US Navy ships in the area, including the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier that has been operating in the nearby North Arabian Sea for weeks. “Tit for tat” Tensions in the Gulf are escalating with rising fears that a US-Iranian war may erupt in the near future. Washington has blamed Tehran for multiple attacks on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery. Tehran has denied all accusations. In June 2019, Iran shot down a US military surveillance drone in the Gulf with a surface-to-air missile. Tehran claimed the drone was in its airspace, but Washington maintains that it was in international skies. At the time, Trump said he had called off a retaliatory military strike on Iran at the last minute. The latest incident took place on Thursday, July 18 when Washington demanded that Iran immediately release a vessel it seized in the Gulf.  A US military commander in the region said that the US would work “aggressively” to ensure free passage of vessels through the vital waterway. Mark Fitzpatrick, the associate fellow at the US-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that both incidents involving drones intensify the potential for conflict in the region. “None of the incidents have resulted in casualties so far; the drones are unmanned, in a way that was tit for tat,” Fitzpatrick told Al Jazeera from Washington DC.  “They need to start talking to stop this escalatory cycle. Donald Trump himself has been saying he does want to talk with Iranians. So, what exactly is the US strategy? No one in Washington knows,” he added.

By McCarthey Dressman Rabat – Mohamed Mahna, a Masters student in Rabat, arched an eyebrow when asked about the tacos’ origin.  “I don’t know what nationality it is. I just enjoy it, but I have never asked myself,” Mahna said with a slight smile. “As long as it’s delicious, I don’t care about the rest.” Tacos in Morocco are not simply a variant of Mexican cuisine that has drifted to North Africa. Instead, the hearty snack is a distinctly multinational fast-food phenomenon — a culinary innovation which reflects how national boundaries are blurring and Moroccan eating habits are changing.   Instead of the ground beef, tomatoes, and cilantro one might find in Mexican tacos, the staples of tacos in Morocco are French fries, chopped meat (such as chicken nuggets), and seldom any vegetables. Wrapped and toasted in a container that more closely resembles a Hot Pocket than a loose tortilla, these fillings are doused in sauces ranging from the gooey “Cheezy Easy” to the spicy “Samouraï.”  Sources dispute the specific origin of this style of tacos, but most agree that the recipe was first created and popularized by Moroccans in southeastern France in the mid-2000s. In 2011, a pair of siblings from a suburb of Lyon moved their shop, Tacos de Lyon, to Casablanca, opening the first “French tacos” shop in Morocco. From there, the new snack came to dominate the Moroccan fast-food scene.  Tacos de Lyon now has 17 locations across the North African country, including five in the capital, Rabat. Rivals like Tacos de Nice, Tacos Mexico, and Royal Tacos also maintain a foothold in the Moroccan capital, and similar products can be found in less formal establishments around the city.    The names of most taco establishments cite France as their country of origin, yet the original creators of the cuisine were Moroccans, and taco shops are perhaps more common in Morocco than in France. To complicate matters, the name is shared with a completely different Mexican dish. So what type of food are these Mediterranean tacos?  “It’s different than Moroccan or French cuisine,” explained Nordine Menssour, manager of a Tacos Avenue franchise in Rabat. “It’s the cuisine of any nationality.”  Indeed, the décor and marketing of most tacos shops in Rabat evoke corporate multinationalism and modernity rather than parochialism or tradition. One evening’s playlist at Tacos Avenue, which began in France and just opened a second Moroccan location, includes French pop-rap, a collaboration between the Dutch DJ Tiësto and American superstar Post Malone, and “Despacito.”  Splashed in funky red lettering on the wall is the English phrase: “Hungry for Life.” The menu includes “Grec” tacos (with feta cheese sprinkled on top) and the “Italien” (garnished with basil and sweet peppers).  The multinational character of these fast-food restaurants is one facet of the increased penetration of corporate chains into the expanding Moroccan market. McDonald’s came to Casablanca in 1992 and now maintains 44 locations in Morocco; other chains like Pizza Hut and KFC also operate in the North African country. Frequent taco shop visitor Mohamed Mahna believes the new dining options are influencing eating habits in the nation’s cities.  “In Morocco, we are very traditional; we don’t trust such [fast food] places because we believe there are a lot of chemicals that they use to cook, so we prefer to stay at home and cook things we know — healthy food,” Mahna said. “But now things are changing.” Rather than eating at home or visiting street vendors, many Moroccans are frequenting the new fast-food franchises springing up in the cities. The franchise owner Menssour claimed that customers choose these fast food stores because they use better ingredients than are available in other establishments — although a basic taco costs 30 to 50 Moroccan dirhams, or $3-5, much more expensive than a 10 to 15-dirham bocadillos street sandwich.    “In the medina everything is basic… The quality is not the same, so the price [at fast-food restaurants] is a little higher. We use quality ingredients, even if they must be imported from outside Morocco,” Menssour argued. Mahna pointed instead to the convenience of tacos shops as a motivating factor.  “To save time, you just go to fast food and you grab something to eat,” Mahna said. “We cook on special occasions, but for the most part, fast food can serve the purpose, especially on active days.” Whatever the reasons for their popularity, tacos are ubiquitous in Rabat; a 900-meter stroll along Hassan II, a main boulevard of Rabat, reveals nine different shops with tacos on the menu, and the snack can be found in every quarter of the city.  Because of tacos’ complex origins and status as fast food, the innovative dish may never be claimed as the cuisine of any nation. But despite its indeterminate origin, tacos continue to impact Moroccan eating habits and culinary culture – just expect Moroccans visiting Mexico to be confused.  “No, I have never seen food like this,” Mahna said after peering at a picture of Mexican tacos. “Maybe I have seen something like this in National Geographic.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has addressed a letter to Moroccan pilgrims set to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage in 2019, urging them to positively represent their country and values. In his letter, the King said that he expects Moroccan pilgrims “both individually and collectively, to “embody the values of your homeland – Morocco – and reflect its civilization as well as the characteristics of the Moroccan identity.” Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Taoufiq conveyed King Mohammed VI’s letter on the event of the departure of the first group of Moroccan pilgrims on Thursday, July 18, at the Rabat-Sale airport. The King recalled that his letter  is an “auspicious tradition with the advent of each Haj season”  to address the message to women and men departing to the holy site to both congratulate them and to give his “sincere wishes for an accepted Hajj and for the best of rewards.” “I am addressing you to remind you not only of the virtues and good morals you should abide by in that sacred place, but also of the need to be knowledgeable about the pillars, obligatory rituals and habitual practices relating to pilgrimage and to the visit to the Sacred House of the Almighty, be it in connection with Tawaf, Sa’y or Wuquf at Arafat,” the King said. The King also prayed to God to help Moroccan pilgrims to “fulfill these rituals and obligations with ease and in a safe manner.” The monarch recalled the eminent significance of Hajj, one of the most important pillars in Islam. “Islam has made pilgrimage one of the pillars of our faith. The aim is to enable Muslims to get to know one another, to meet in one place and to come together in solidarity as brothers and sisters in order to uphold what is right and avoid sin and aggression,” the letter reads. The king also commended the efforts of Saudi Arabia and the joint cooperation between Morocco and  Saudi Arabia to “make sure the great Hajj experience goes according to Plan. Throughout his letter the King expressed his expectations of Moroccan pilgrims, urging them to be  among the “first to observe and comply with these measures and regulations, including those set by my Minister for Awqaf and Islamic Affairs.” The King also commended the Moroccan Islamic Ministry and its staff, including the minister of Islamic Affairs.  The monarch said that Taoufiq  “spares no effort to improve your travel and accommodation conditions, provide for your comfort, health requirements and administrative needs, and give you the necessary religious guidance, in accordance with my instructions to this effect.” Thousands of Moroccan pilgrims perform Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, every year.

Rabat – The World Health Organization (WHO) demanded greater international support for the DRC when it declared the region’s Ebola epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Wednesday, July 17. The first confirmed Ebola case in Goma, a city on the Rwandan border and a major transit hub, last week and recent attacks on community health workers within the region pushed the WHO to make its announcement. Since the epidemic was first declared on August 1, 2018, the WHO committee overseeing the situation has debated providing the PHEIC label three times, but has stopped short.  With 2500 cases and 1700 deaths, the situation in the DRC is the second deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.  The first was the outbreak that spread across West Africa a few years ago and killed over 11,000 people. “We need to do everything possible now to avoid reaching the scale of the outbreak we saw in West Africa five years ago when more than 10,000 lives were lost before a multi-billion-dollar response brought the cases down to zero,” UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock said at a meeting last week.  The WHO rarely declares a PHEIC – this is only the fifth – with the previous classifications being the West Africa Ebola epidemic (2014), the Zika Virus (2016), a resurgence of polio in some states (2014), and a pandemic flu (2009).  During their meeting, the WHO committee said that insecurity in the region is the greatest concern, especially after the deaths of two community health workers last week. Since January, there have been 198 attacks against health care providers, including 7 deaths, according to an earlier report by the WHO.  WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has previously stated that the attacks need to stop in order for responders to do their work and stop the spread of the virus. Additionally, the committee concluded the lack of financial and human resources adds to the challenge of responding to the outbreak. “Unless we get substantially more financial resources immediately, it will not be possible to end the outbreak. Every delay gives the virus an opportunity to spread, which has disastrous consequences,” Lowcock said. At first, Ebola symptoms are similar to the flu, but they can quickly escalate to internal bleeding, hemorrhaging, and death.  The disease is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or contaminated items, like needles. While experimental vaccines and treatments exist and have been used to counter the epidemic’s spread, the WHO said risk remains high nationally and regionally in DRC, though is low globally. Alongside its announcement, the WHO provided instructions for continued work countering the disease within the DRC as well as calling for greater international help.  Dr. Tedros emphasized that international restrictions on trade or travel should not be put in place since this would negatively impact the response and lives of those already suffering the most. Dr. Tedros said extraordinary work has already been done to counter the spread of this deadly disease, but the world needs to take notice and do even more.

Rabat – Maha Tazi, Moroccan researcher and professor at Concordia University in Montreal announced that she has arrived home. While she is happy to get back to Morocco, Tazi announced that Air Arabia  lost her suitcase at the “Lost &amp; Found” at Terminal 1 of the Barcelona airport. On July 16, Tazi posted on Facebook : “Arrived in Morocco, and my suitcase is lost by Air Arabia. Looking forward to the end of this nightmare.” She added that she is still “waiting for news from Air Arabia” about her suitcase. She also urged the company to take concrete action. “It has been three days since the incident with Air Arabia during which I was physically and verbally assaulted. I went home at my own expense, my suitcase is still lost somewhere in Barcelona airport,” she said. In a statement to Morocco World News earlier this week, Tazi said that she was “assaulted” at the airport when attempting to get onboard her scheduled flight to Casablanca. Two members of the ground crew of Air Arabia assaulted the Moroccan-Canadian woman following a discussion due to a  “small excess of weight in her suitcase.” One of the crew members prevented Tazi from boarding the flight and ripped her boarding pass as well as trying to take her passport, causing scratches in her hand. Tazi said that another  Spanish crew member intervened and told her: “We will send you to your f****ing country.” In another Facebook post, the Moroccan researcher has added that Air Arabia has still not found the missing suitcase on the fourth day since the incident.

Rabat – On Wednesday, Nadia Murad, a former IS prisoner who won Nobel Peace Prize last year for her efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict, met with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, July 17, to plead with him to help the Yazidis of Iraq. Murad, who belongs to the Yazidi minority, was enslaved and tortured by IS after the terrorist group overran her village on August 15, 2014. She also lost 18 family members that day. Joined by a group of other survivors of religious persecution who met Trump in the Oval Office on the sidelines of a major meeting at the State Department, Murad explained to Trump how her mother and six brothers were killed in front of her and that 3,000 Yazidis remained missing. However, Trump seemed unfamiliar with her work, quoted by AFP as replying: “And you had the Nobel Prize? That’s incredible. They gave it to you for what reason?” After pausing for a moment, Murad explained her story again to the US President and pleaded a second time for Trump to help the Yazidi minority.  “After all this happened to me, I didn’t give up,” she told Trump. “I make it clear to everyone that ISIS raped thousands of Yazidi women. Please do something. It is not about one family.” However, the conversation did not flow any smoother after she explained a second time and Trump, who boasted in 2018 that he had crushed the self-styled caliphate of ISIS that once stretched across Iraq and Syria, still seemed at a loss when she asked him to press the Kurdish and Iraqi governments to help the Yazidi people return safely to their homeland. “But ISIS is gone and now it’s Kurdish and who?” Trump asked, before later telling her, “I know the area very well.” Government ministers and representatives of persecuted groups, Murad included, are currently spending three days at the State Department for a meeting on religious freedom, which Vice President Mike Pence will address on Thursday. Murad’s story has touched the hearts of many, with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon being quoted as saying that he was “moved to tears” by the fate of the young woman, as well as by her “strength, courage and dignity.”  After IS started a bloodbath in her village of 2000 people, she was held captive by IS for a total of three months. During this time, she suffered the fate of many other Yazidi women and was used by IS as a sex slave. During this time, she was beaten, tortured, and raped. Unlike many other women who aren’t so fortunate, Murad managed to escape and has been living in Germany since, where many Yazidi refugees settled.  Just under two years later, she was formally appointed as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking in order to draw attention to the suffering of Yazidi women and children still held prisoner by IS. “I was not alone and perhaps I was the luckiest. Over time, I found a way to escape, while many thousands could not. They are still being held prisoner,” she said as she told her story to the UN in 2016.  “I am here in order to represent those who have been taken from us. We cannot bring them back. We will cherish their memory as we continue to fight.” She elaborated that the situation was so dire that many of the women took their own lives, but Murad did not. “I did not want to kill myself, but I did want them to kill me.” Due to her high profile activism, she has received death threats from IS according to DW Middle East, although death does not scare her. “Death is harmless in comparison to the hell that we all had to endure,” she said. In 2018, the 25-year-old became the second-youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate in history. She was honored along with Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.

Rabat – Huawei, a global provider of information and communications technology infrastructure and devices, outlined the goal for its Moroccan operations at the 9th annual North African suppliers conference in Skhirat, south of Rabat today, Thursday July 18. “We are the [world] leaders in 5G, and we want to be the leader in Morocco,” said Chakib Achour, the marketing and strategy director of Huawei in Morocco. “We want the Kingdom to be the first to launch 5G in Africa,” he specified. According to Achour, the company is now only waiting for the green light from the government. 5G is the new generation of mobile internet connectivity, which promises much faster data upload and download speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. Internet is important to Moroccans. According to a report released this week by the Moroccan National Telecommunications Regulations Agency (ANRT), access to the internet by Moroccan households has increased three-fold over the last eight years. 74.2% of households are now equipped with internet. According to ANRT, the leading reason behind the need for an internet connection is  “entertainment” (including games and social networks), with Whatsapp and Facebook being the most used apps.   Moroccan telecommunications provider Inwi announced in March that it was ready to launch 5G.  “5G is a reality for Inwi. It is a reality that we anticipated and prepared for through modernising out infrastructure […]. Inwi has modern and agile infrastructure, capable of adapting to all technical evolutions, now and in the future,” declared Fadoua Laaroussi, the performance director at Inwi, in a press release. Huawei has stated that Inwi is its “strategic partner in the North Africa region.” “Inwi is the first operator who has signed an agreement with Huawei for the 5G pilot projects […],” Huawei marketing vice-president Eric Liu said. Huawei is not the only player on the Morocco 5G field. In March, Huawei competitor Ericsson organised a live 5G demonstration at Maroc Telecom headquarters in Rabat, showcasing the technology’s capabilities. Huawei is firmly present in Morocco, with, according to Achour, an annual revenue of MAD 3 billion, reports Moroccan news source Aujourd’hui le Maroc. Huawei works with the three major local telecommunication providers: Maroc Telecom, Inwi, and Orange. Expansion into Africa might be Huawei’s next big move, as its future trade relations with the US are currently uncertain.  In early May, US President Donald Trump put Huawei on the “entity list,” on the basis of national security concerns, as part of a complex diplomatic battle between the US and China. The list essentially bars US companies from trading with Huawei without a special license. In early July Trump reportedly eased sanctions, although confusion remains on future trade relationships.

General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has  announced the arrest of the  other suspects, who are apprehended for their invovlement in the case. They are also arrested for not helping and reporting the crime. Earlier this week, the DGSN issued a statement to announce the arrest of the rapist, who appeared in a video assaulting “Hanan,” the victim.

After the rape, the main defendant moved the victim to a street in  Mellah, Rabat. A video documenting the rape went viral on social media, stirring a nationwide backlash and uproar to condemn the alarming number of sexual assaults in Morocco. The victim died on June 11 after complications from the injuries she suffered during the rape. The mother of the victim vehemently condemned the murder and rape of her daughter. She acknowledged that Hanan used to know the defendant. She said that he used to threaten her if she refused to go with him. “When I went to the hospital, I found out that my daughter is dead. I was at my sister’s in Sale and did not know what happened to my daughter,” she said. She also asked for death penalty of the rapist. “He used to threaten her. He has been sexually assaulting her for a long time. I could not do anything, he threatened to make a scar on her face,” the mother said.

Rabat – Recently, social media has been inundated with people posting photos of what they will supposedly look like years in the future thanks to “FaceApp.” More than 150,000 million people have downloaded the app from Google Play, and FaceApp is now the top-ranked app on the iOS App Store in 121 countries.  However, concerns have been raised over permission people are granting the Russian application as they hop on the viral trend. Agreeing to the terms of service reportedly grants the app a royalty-free license to do whatever they want with the photos uploaded to their servers. “You grant FaceApp a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display your User Content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with your User Content,” says the applications terms of service.  Joshua Nozzi, a software developer, was the first person to draw attention to the issue in a tweet published on the night of Monday, July 15t, and media outlets soon picked up on the claim. “BE CAREFUL WITH FACEAPP….it immediately uploads your photos without asking, whether you choose one or not.” The tweet has since been deleted. Concerns continued to escalate, with the New York Times’s Charlie Warzel tweeting:  “The app that you’re willingly giving all your facial data to says the company’s location is in Saint-Petersburg, Russia.” This tweet has also since been deleted. However, it seems the concerns were a false alarm, with FaceApp clarifying the reasons behind its terms of service and addressing the privacy concerns.  Speaking to American news outlet CNBC on Wednesday, FaceApp clarified that “it only uploads the photo selected for editing and that it does not upload any other images in your library.  While most images are deleted from its servers within 48 hours, it “might store” some uploaded photos in the cloud for “performance and traffic” reasons. It also said that while the app’s “core R&amp;D team is located in Russia, the user data is not transferred to Russia.” As FaceApp came to clarify the concerns, Nozzi, the man who initially raised the red flag over the app, posted a lengthy statement to his website stating: “First of all: I was wrong.” “I was wrong about what I thought the app was doing (uploading all pics once granted access), and I was wrong to have posted the accusation without testing it first. Full stop.”  However, while acknowledging he “may have overreacted,” he said users should still be wary. “I stand by my warning to be careful with this app and other fad apps just like it. I’d like to address a few issues that are still very real,” he said. “The biggest oddity is that the app asks for full, unfettered access to your photos (on iOS) without really needing to. It then begins doing … something … with them that takes time, as they appear a few at a time, and rather slowly.”  It’s important to note that while FaceApp’s terms of service uses concerning language, most popular platforms and apps, such as Google and Facebook, have the same language, without most users noticing.  Recently Google researchers disclosed that they used at least 8 million user images to train face recognition, and Facebook researchers mentioned using at least 10 million users. After the storm of worry and conspiracy theories about Russians on social media, the app now has a warning in place before users take a photo: “Cloud Photo Processing: Each photo you select for editing will be uploaded to our servers for imaging processing and face transformation.” Users can decide if they still want to proceed, or if they prefer not to give up their picture.

Rabat – A video has emerged of two men assaulting a father and his family for supposedly wanting to change religion.  The images are disturbing and grim. They show two men in hoods, with one armed with a large knife, forcing their way into the home of a man whom they accuse of apostasy and treason for “betraying the religion.” As the two attackers tried to storm the man’s home, whispers and sounds of a baby crying can be heard from inside the family’s locked home.  Meanwhile, the elder of the children tries to call the police to report the incident.  “Call them my daughter,” the man says, his voice suffused with panic and fear. The video does not provide context, nor do the viewers immediately know the buildup to the grim scene.  But the reason for the attack is apparent, clear enough from the short clip. “So you are planning to change your religion? You want to change? We will show you now,” the attackers say, as they threaten to cause a gas leak and burn down the man’s home.  The event highlights the silent plight of Morocco’s tiny minority of Christians. Morocco is overwhelmingly Muslim (almost 99%), and Islam is widely considered as the state religion.  While Christians from other nationalities report experiencing little or no hostility from Moroccans, Moroccan converts have repeatedly reported being the objects of ridicule and death threats. This was particularly the case recently, in March, as a number of Christian associations tried to use Pope Francis’s historic visit to Morocco to draw attention to their situation. As late as 2010, it was common for Moroccan converts to be considered traitors and undeserving of the Moroccan identity. Being Muslim was readily synonymous with being Moroccan, and death was the widely accepted sentence for apostates or Muslims who change their religion. But there have been a series of reforms in recent years.  Morocco’s King Mohammed VI has on multiple occasions expressed his attachment to religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue, which he has said constitute the founding pillars of Morocco’s Maliki interpretation of Islam. “I am the commander of all believers,” King Mohammed VI recently said, pointing out, as he welcomed the pope in March, that Morocco seeks to uphold equal treatment for all its citizens, regardless of their religious orientation. In early 2017, Morocco’s High Religious Committee historically changed its position on the fate of Christian converts and apostates.  In line with the country’s desire to emerge as a beacon of tolerant and difference-accommodating Islam, the body said that Moroccans would henceforth be free to change their religion.  Most recently, amid fears of a resurgence of fundamentalist interpretations of Islam after news emerged of the heinous beheading of two Scandinavian tourists, the council of Moroccan Ulemmas reaffirmed its stance on the need to foster tolerance and interfaith-dialogue. “An effective Islamic jurisprudence in the 21st century must think and accompany its environment’s social changes,” the body said. It added that Islam today needs to accommodate social and cultural changes and be “grounded in tolerance and openness.” But this latest heinous, fanaticism-drenched incident comes as a telling reminder that changes in Morocco’s official discourse and policy on religion have not trickled down to some parts of the country. Earlier reports of the horrific incident said the attack took place in Agadir.  However, preliminary findings from a police investigation have denied those claims. At the moment of writing, the investigation is ongoing to determine both the exact location of the incident and the identity of the attackers.

Rabat – After initial a successful pilot scheme which concluded on July 16, the governing council  of Spanish enclave Ceuta is set to implement facial recognition technology as part of its border security. The system is to be fully operational starting July.  Over 14 new cameras equipped with facial recognition technology have been installed over the months of June and July, replacing many of the outdated 1990s models that were still in place.  According to the government of Ceuta, this initiative serves two major interests. First, it should enhance security at the crossing  by making it easier to identify and stop suspects at the border. Second, it should also ease traffic and congestion by streamlining the border crossing process, especially time consuming security verification measures.  The Ceuta border is one of the busiest external borders of the European Union. Thousands of people and vehicles cross the border every day. In addition to facial recognition, Spanish authorities have also expressed their intention to heighten the barriers along the border for added security.  Morocco is also increasing its security apparatus on its side of the border by adding barbed wire and reinforcing border security measures.  Melillia, another Spanish exclave, is also set to implement similar measures in the near future.

By Safaa Kasraoui and Kawtar Ennaji Rabat – The Court of Appeal in Sale has delivered its verdict on the Imlil double murder case. Abdessamad El Joud, Younes Ouziad, and Rachid Afati, charged with the murder of two Scandinavian tourists, will all face the death penalty. The sentence comes after  two months of court hearings, the first of which began on May 2. The court further sentenced Abderrahman Khayali to life imprisonment. The remaining 20 defendants were sentenced to between 5 years and 30 years of imprisonment. Kevin Zoller Guervos, the Spanish-Swiss suspect, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In the civil case, the Court declared the claim for compensation, from the Moroccan State for the victims’ families,  inadmissible. However, the court ordered that the four main defendants jointly pay MAD 2 million to the relatives of the two victims in compensation. The four main suspects were charged with murder, incitement to commit terrorist acts, praising terrorism, and promoting extremism. The court announced the verdict hours after hearing the last of the defendants’ statements. The Spanish-Swiss suspect said, “ I have provided proof; give me back my freedom taken seven months ago.” He added,“I’ve never been extremist; I condemn this awful act.” The murders of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Norwegian victim Maren Ueland made international headlines. The public outcry caused international journalists to travel to Morocco in order to follow the case. Police found the bodies of the two victims on December 17, 2018. Before the verdict, the court was surrounded by police security, lawyers, and police. Morocco World News was at the court where the final hearing for the four main suspects was brief. Defence lawyer Hafida Maksaoui reminded Morocco World News that the four main defendants had confessed to the crimes they committed. She added that they expressed their regret and asked for God’s mercy for what they had done. The families of the Danish and Norwegian victims had called for the judge to give the ultimate punishment for the terrible crime; the death penalty. Capital punishment is not practiced in Morocco, but the lawyer of the victims Khalid  El Fataoui has faith in Moroccan justice. He told Morocco World News that he believed that the court would hand the “death penalty” to the suspects.  While capital punishment remains legal in Morocco, no executions have been carried out since 1993. The mother of Abdessamad Al Joud, one of the four main suspects, wrote a letter to the court asking for a commuted sentence. Al Joud is considered the mastermind behind the crime, and faced charges of “forming a gang to commit terror crimes and intentionally assaulting the life of persons premeditatedly.” Charged with several crimes, Al Joud has been prosecuted for inciting people to commit terrorist acts, praising terrorism, as well as promoting extremism. The mother of Kevin Zoller, Spanish-Swiss suspect maintains that her son was not involved in the crime. She claimed in a letter submitted to the court that her son came to Morocco to study Islamic religion “that is all.” She claimed that her son is “a victim just like Louisa.” In response, the lawyer of the victims told the press that the “ [the mothers of the suspects’] letters would not  be taken as official letters in the case. “They should have been submitted in previous trials,” he told MWN. He affirmed that “the presence of both victims’ families show Norway and Denmark’s  confidence in Moroccan justice.”  “This proves to what extent Morocco’s judiciary system is independent,” he added. The victims’ lawyer said that the court was expected to give the death penalty to the main 4 defendants, while the other suspects were expected to receive 20 years in prison. El Fataoui said that he considers that the defendants “committed atrocious crimes which go against humanity and international law.” “They are monsters and animals, and I take full responsibility for what I said,” he added. He also said that the defendants “have not shown any regret; they did not apologize to the families of the victims, but they rather apologized to God.” The lawyer suspects that “if the defendants were to leave prison, they would definitely reoffend.” He also recalled that the prosecution team had called on the court to consider that the state should compensate the victims. “We will have indementities either from this court or the administrative court because the family of Louisa have been suffering everyday,” the lawyer said.

Rabat – Defending Muslims in Melilla, Spanish political party Coalition for Melilla (CPM) has said that they will end the coalition with the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSO) unless the ban on sheep imports from Morocco is lifted. The CPM currently holds the majority in the government of the autonomous city. They are calling on the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment (Mapama) to allow the import of sheep from Morocco for the upcoming Eid Al Adha, the feast of sacrifice celebrated by Muslims across the world. President of the party, Mustafa Aberchan, said that if the ministry says that it has no agreement “under any circumstances, as we think it does, we would not reconcile the action  of the government with the party that supports the central executive,” according to Melilla Hoy. The president added that it will dedicate all its efforts to taking the case to court if necessary. Aberchan recalled that his party filed an administrative complaint for perversion of justice against former president of the regional ministry for Public Health, Paz Velazquez, due to the ban on sheep imports. “That is why the former president of the Presidency is sitting on the bench, because that behavior should not be allowed…  the only possible way is to expand the complaint,” Aberchan threatened the Ministry of Agriculture. The political party emphasized that Spanish laws “establish preventive measures” against foot and mouth disease for the entry of  animals to Melilla and Ceuta. However, the party president stressed that “At no time” the law “speaks of the prohibition” of access of sheep to both cities. Morocco is expected to celebrate Eid al Adha on August 12. The Eid is a religious holiday celebrated annually by Muslims worldwide on the 10th of the month of Dhu Al-Hijjah. It is the last and most sacred month in the Hijri Calendar (Islamic lunar calendar), and is the month in which the Hajj (pilgrimage) takes place.²

Rabat – Faycal Fajr, Moroccan international football player expressed regret and disappointment over Morocco’s elimination from the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Fajr took to his Instagram to convey the love he has for Moroccan football fans and for his country. “A disappointment is always difficult to overcome especially when it comes to a competition of this magnitude” he said. He acknowledged that the disappointment still continues. “The love I have for my country is indescribable, I am always at its service whatever happened.” Fajr said that  he wanted to speak about  the “problem” that occurred during preparation matches the team played before the CAN. The problem, according to FAJR “deeply touched” him. Fajr referred to an alleged conflict he had with A Moroccan football player Abderrazak Hamdallah, who was on the list of the  Moroccan lineup for CAN.  Just a week before the tournament was set to commence, the Royal Football Federation announced that he had sustained an injury which would prevent him from playing with the Atlas Lions during CAN games. Commenting on the alleged conflict, Fajr said that the “problem” was actually “a fabric of lies that I faced, and received boos and insults, negative criticism” for. Fajr described the problem as “false, distorted by some misinformed press.” “I did nothing at all, and I did not cause any harm to anyone. I like my staff, my teammates without exception.” Speculation spread on social media suggested that Hamdallah left the training camp after issues he faced with some members of the  Moroccan squad, especially Fajr. “A month now that I wanted to talk about it, but for me the team and the country went so much above everything, that I preferred to take on me, to remain silent for the sake of the flag. Always Morocco,” the football player concluded his statement. Morocco’s national team was defeated by Benin on July 5. The team lost the chance to reach the final or the title after weak performance, which was strongly criticized by Moroccan football fans.

Rabat – Olusegun Obasanjo, the former president of Nigeria, believes Morocco is emerging as one of Africa’s foremost leading voices on agricultural policies, sustainable development, and food security. As Morocco “looks south” and claims its leadership role in Africa, agriculture has proved to be one of the key areas in the kingdom’s expertise sharing platform with fellow African countries.  The Nigerian made the comments earlier this week while participating in a two-day event in Rabat, between July 16 and 17.  Obasanjo was also part of a sizable delegation of former and current African leaders from a wide range of countries, including South Africa, Kenya, and Lesotho, according to Moroccan outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Speaking during the event, Obasanjo focused on how Morocco’s expertise sharing and foreign direct investment in the agriculture sector have been changing the game across the continent.  In African countries where Morocco’s OCP, a global leader in the production of phosphates and fertilizers, is operating or has signed an array of cooperation agreements with authorities, there has been a perceptible impacts according to the Nigerian politician.  In addition to training local farmers in advanced, modern agricultural techniques to drive up yearly output, OCP Africa has initiated a number of other programs that have massively upgraded the scales in terms of sustainable agriculture policy and food security.  Some lingering challenges remain in many areas across the continent, Obasanjo acknowledged at some point, as he tried to make clear that this was not a naively optimistic take on the future of food security in Africa. He nonetheless stressed that what has so far been achieved heralds positive prospects for the continent.  As African continents realize that meeting continental challenges requires collective action—the African Union’s “The Africa We Want” and the much-discussed AFCFTA are the latest examples that spring to mind—it is essential that countries with more experience and more expertise step-up to lead the continental impetus, Obasanjo suggested.  In that regard, he added, Morocco can be a continental asset on the agriculture front. The challenge for other African countries would be to channel OCP’s expertise and replicate some of Morocco’s success story. The comments come as OCP, which has made no secret of its desire to intensify its presence in African markets and take center stage in helping the continent rise to the challenges of a prospective and much-needed green revolution, has continued to reaffirm its “pan-African” take on African issues. In April of this year, the company announced it was conceptualizing a scheme of “more ambitious projects” to help African agriculture meet the growing odds of an endlessly shifting, digitizing global economy.  As challenges take new forms, the continent needs to upgrade its tools. The goal, OCP has maintained, is to help realize the twin goals of sustainable development and food security.

Rabat – The US President may provoke more than just a media backlash with his recent comments targeting four American congresswomen, who are all women of color, telling them to go back to “the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.” Believing something must be done to formally condemn Trump for his racist comments, Democratic leaders are pushing for Trump to be censured or possibly impeached. The US Senate describes a censure as a measure that does not remove an official from office but instead “provides a formal statement of disapproval, that can have a powerful psychological effect on a member and his/her relationships in the Senate.” President Andrew Jackson was the first and only US President to ever be censured, and that was in 1834, over 180 years ago, meaning Trump’s possible censure would carry significant weight.  On Tuesday evening, the House of Representatives voted on a nonbinding resolution that affirms support for immigrants and condemns Trump’s comments. The House successfully passed the measure, even though just four Republicans out of 197 voted for the resolution. “President Donald Trump’s racist comments have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color: Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives […] condemns President Donald Trump’s racist comments,” said the resolution from the senate. The comments “have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may look to the President like immigrants, should “go back” to other countries.” Trump’s statements “referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as “invaders”, and by saying that Members of Congress who are immigrants (or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be immigrants) do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America,” said the concluding words in the resolution. While the resolution shows where the House of Representatives stands in regards to Trump’s racist comments, it is still not an official censure and Democrats are calling for further action to be taken. “This sends a very, very clear message,” New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. said of the condemnation resolution. “But a censure … is more forceful.” Some Democrats are calling for an even more extreme measure: impeachment. Impeachment would remove Trump from office, and the measure has only been taken against two US Presidents before.  On Wednesday, Texas Democrat Al Green filed a resolution to impeach Trump, but the measure failed to gain support, with 332 voting against it. However, a total of 95 Democrats voted in favor of the measure, showing a marked increase for Green’s two previous attempts to impeach Trump, in 2017 and 2018. Green said after Wednesday’s vote that he did not view it as a failure. “We got 95 votes this time, 66 the last time. So that’s a plus. But whether we get 95 or five, the point is we have to make a statement.” Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, said she did not want to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump until an ironclad case is built against him.  “We have six committees that are working on following the facts in terms of any abuse of power, obstruction of justice and the rest that the president may have engaged in. That is the serious path that we are on,” Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday. During all the commotion over his statements in the House of Representatives, Trump was at a rally in North Carolina.  At the rally, he again accused the 4 congresswomen he originally targeted – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who were all born in the US with the exception of Omar who came to the US as a refugee from Somali aged 12  -of “hating America.”  As he talked, the crowd cheered him on – chanting “Send her back! Send her back!” Trump also took to Twitter on Wednesday, where the controversy first began, to again attack the four women, calling them the “four horsemen of the apocalypse” and “wackjobs.” “In America, if you hate our Country, you are free to leave. The simple fact of the matter is, the four Congresswomen think that America is wicked in its origins, they think that America is even more wicked now, that we are all racist and evil. They’re entitled to their….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 17 juillet 2019  …opinion, they’re Americans. Now I’m entitled to my opinion, &amp; I just think they’re left wing cranks.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 17 juillet 2019 In response to the impeachment movement, he said it “ridiculous” and “should never happen to US President again,” especially to a president who “has led greatest Economic BOOM in the history of our Country, the best job numbers, biggest tax reduction, rebuilt military and much more.” The United States House of Representatives has just overwhelmingly voted to kill the Resolution on Impeachment, 332-95-1.

Rabat – Ali Maychou holds a leadership role with Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), a West-African militant jihadist group designated by the US as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in September 2018. JNIM was formed by a merger of three existing terrorist organizations in 2017. At the time of its creation, the group pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda, the Islamist organization founded by Osama bin Laden. According to a press release by the US Department of State, Maychou has held a leadership role with JNIM since its inception. He claimed responsibility for an attack on a military camp that housed Malian Armed Forces in Gao, Mali, and has had a role in operational activities of JNIM. On July 16, the US Department of State listed Maychou as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The department also designated Malien Bah Ag Moussa for his involvement with JNIM. The designation imposes sanctions on “foreign persons determined to have committed, or pose a serious risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.”  As a result of the designation, “all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Maychou has any interest is blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with Maychou.” It, therefore, denies Maychou access to the US financial system. According to US think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), JNIM’s ultimate goal is for Mali and the surrounding region to be ruled under Shariah law. The group seeks to incite the West African Muslim community to “remove oppression” and expel non-Muslim “occupiers,” CSIS adds. JNIM has claimed responsibility for dozens of deadly attacks in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. In March 2018, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting a number of locations in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, including the French Embassy and national military headquarters. The attack left 16 people dead, including eight gunmen, Mauritanian news agency Alakhbar reported.

Rabat – The United States House of Representatives approved on Wednesday, July 17, three resolutions aimed at blocking Trump’s planned sale of guided missiles and other weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan. The approval of the new measures marks another political rebuke of Trump’s relationship with Saudi Arabia. The relationship has already raised severe concerns in the US Congress over human rights abuses, and the alarming death rates from the war in Yemen. Save the Children, a US-based international non-profit group, has estimated that 37 children a month have been killed in Yemen by foreign-made bombs. A Save the Children hospital in Yemen was hit by an air attack on March 2019, resulting in seven fatalities. Amid the escalating military tensions with Iran in May 2019, Trump tried to bypass Congress to complete the sale of more than eight billion dollars in weapons to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Jordan.  The US President’s arbitrary move disregarded the US law which stipulates that the Congress approve any major weapons sales.  Many politicians view Trump’s claims of an emergency as exaggerated, highlighting that most of the weapons sales are transactions which could be postponed for months, even years. “There is no emergency. It’s phony. It’s made up. And it’s an abuse of the law,” said Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on June 2019.   Donald Trump is expected to veto the new measures. House Majority Leader and Democrat, Steny Hoyer said the three specific resolutions were “most significant” because they would cancel contracts related to arms that could be used in the war in Yemen. The US President’s three contracts relate to plans by the US weapons-maker Raytheon to build a co-production plant in Saudi Arabia to assemble “Paveway” smart bombs; the type weapons that in 2018 destroyed a school bus in Yemen killing more than 40 boys.  Raytheon’s agreement to co-produce hi-tech weapons in Saudi Arabia was reached in May 2017 during Trump’s visit to Riyadh. “It’s bad considering the Saudi war crimes in Yemen and the humanitarian crisis they are perpetuating through a blockade and airstrikes on so many civilian targets,” Hassan El-Tayyab, the co-director of Just Foreign Policy, a group in Washington advocating the end of Yemen’s war, told Al Jazeera. “It’s not a good thing for Yemen or the region or the national security interests of the US,” El-Tayyab added. It is not clear whether Congress has enough votes to override the President’s veto, but its opposition is a warning sign of potential trouble in the US-Saudi relationship if the impediment of business with the kingdom continues in the future. The US House vote on Wednesday, July 17 is the latest effort made by the Congress to condemn the US military support of Saudi Arabia, since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018. Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. According to reports, US intelligence agencies concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) ordered the murder, an allegation which Saudi Arabia denies. On Monday, July 15 the House approved a measure that would impose sanctions on officials involved in Khashoggi’s murder.  In April 2019, Trump vetoed a measure that sought to end US military implication in the Saudi-UAE war in Yemen.  Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee have also approved a bill that would close the loophole Trump had used for Saudi Arabia. House Representative and Democrat, Ilhan Omar has voiced destabilization and terrorism concerns on the matter. “Backing the Saudi government and the Emiratis is backing war crimes and crimes against humanity; providing them with arms is complicity,” Omar said. “The US relationship with Saudi Arabia in its current form is immoral,” she added.   R Clarke Cooper, the State Department’s assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, has said on multiple occasions that the arms sales are needed. He argues that this, combined with an escalation of US military posture in the Gulf region, was a necessity in countering increasing threats from Iran to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as Americans in the region.   “These malign – even provocative actions mark a new evolution of the threat Iran poses to the security of hundreds of thousands of Americans who live and work in the Gulf states, and to the security of the region and our partners,” Cooper said before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on June 2019. Cooper faced hostile questioning from Democrats and some Republicans on the committee. “The arms sales you’re talking about are controversial. There is significant opposition in Congress. And rather than confront that, you go around it,” said Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat.

Rabat – In 2003, Casablanca experienced terrorist attacks at a popular tourist restaurant and internet café. Sui­cide bombers, from the shantytown of Sidi Moumen, aimed an attack directly towards discouraging Western influence by literally ridding the place of who they saw as its perpetrators — Western tourists in Morocco.  The second attack, at an internet café, perhaps more indirectly discouraged Western influence because it was at a cyber venue. This could be seen as a statement against outside influences that could permeate Moroccan society by way of the internet.  However, radical Islamism is seen as a threat to the stability of Morocco’s government because it invokes violence and destruction, and it challenges the establishment. In Morocco, the radical Islamist narrative is a challenge to the Moroccan king because it casts doubt over his legitimacy as amir al-mu’minin — the “commander of the faithful” or head of religion.  As much as Islamism is concerned with permeating external areas of life, Sufism is focused on the internal workings of each individual. It sees religion as emphasizing personal enlightenment by encouraging people to look into themselves to find Allah.  Sufis are focused on their search for a way inside themselves which will lead them to God. They believe that the path to Him can be found through meditation and purification. Because Sufism is so internally focused, Sufis are seen as a political and uninvolved in political affairs.  Sufism encourages believers to disengage from the material world, which includes politics and government, to better align oneself with the spiritual world, and to learn the truth of God. Sufism teaches that the material world is all illusion and, because of its illusive nature, it is better to free oneself from the bounds of material life, and to search for reality and understanding in the divine.  Religion has always been important to Moroccans but it has been moderate and tolerant. Jews lived and thrived in Morocco for 2,000 years, thanks to this moderation. When the Sephardic Jews were kicked out of Spain in 1492, Morocco was one of the few countries that opened its doors to them.  Moroccan Islam — a term rejected by Islamists who believe there is only one Islam with no local colorations — is a mixture of Sufism and Maraboutism. The Sufis arrived from the east around the 15th century and spread across the country, preaching a moderate Islam to uneducated farmers.  On their death, they were elevated to the rank of saint: marabout. People built shrines on their tombs and gave them Baraka — divine grace — attributes that allow healing powers.  There are hundreds of shrines of saints around Morocco with a reputation of different healing powers and whose Baraka is celebrated every year at the end of the agricultural cycle with a festival organized by the entire tribe for days, reminiscent of ancient pagan rites.  Since the “Arab spring” in 2011, the establishment, which had always favored Sufi Islam, increased its support for religious lodges, such as the powerful Boutchichiya lodge in Berkane, which boasts 2 million members worldwide, including civil servants, intellectuals, and gov­ernment officials.  In Morocco, there are dozens of other Sufi lodges and orders that owe allegiance to the monarchy and give it its religious legitimacy and political strength.  Realizing that the fragmentation of religious representation will make the imarat al-mu’minin (commandership of the faithful) stronger and more legitimate, the king has even allowed the presence of Moroccan Shias in northern Morocco, under strict conditions of allegiance to the monarchy.  Morocco has gone through the Arab uprisings and the ensuing Islamist power takeover unscathed. This is thanks to the predominance of Sufi Islam in the majority of the Moroccan territory, which is almost as old as the monarchy itself.  Moroccan Sufism, represented by Maraboutism, is tolerant, open and accepting of the other in his “otherness.” It has earned the country worldwide respect. Today, many countries are approaching Morocco to benefit from its religious experience, especially in imam training. Dozens of foreign students are registered in the Imam Academy of Rabat.  Moroccan Islam is couched in Sufism. And that has proved to be a successful antidote against religious extremism and proof that the “Moroccan exception” is a tangible reality in the Muslim world.

Rabat – The Moroccan Minister of Health, Anass Doukkali, has launched a partnership with Sanofi Aventis Maroc, one of the country’s biggest operators in the pharmaceutical sector.  The agreement, signed on Tuesday  July 16th, aims to aid people living with rare illnesses by widening the range of services available to them, and educating the moroccan medical community on the problems they face.  This public-private  partnership is set to last through the next three years. It aims to  improve the existing medical infrastructure by launching specialized centers for these patients at major university hospitals.  In addition to this, the plan involves creating a national registry for rare diseases in order to better track and predict their instances. Through this, the initiative aims to reach a more efficient allocation of medical and financial resources . The registry is set to be in place by 2020.   The initiative also seeks to train and inform over 450 moroccan medical professionals so that they may be better able to recognize and treat these illnesses. Rare illnesses can often go misdiagnosed, to the detriment of patients’ health and finances.  Treatment of rare and neglected illnesses is often extremely costly, due to both their medical complexity and the lack of demand for treatment resulting in poor economies of scale for manufacturers. Thus,  a heavy burden falls on patients and their families. However, Moroccan civil society has stepped up in recent years in order to help the over eight thousand Moroccans living with these illnesses.

Rabat – The UN is currently under fire as its top leadership battles with suspicions of sexual misconduct, corruption, as well as an organized inside-UN cover-up network in order to “avoid bad press coverage.”  Inner City Press (ICP), a New York-based investigative outlet with reputedly problematic relations with the UN leadership due to its exposure of the organization’s darker side, reported on July 8 that the international organization was about to extend the mandate of one of its high-ranking officials, in spite of the massive sexual allegations surrounding him. Colin Stewart, the high-ranking official in question, is currently serving as the chief administrative officer of MINURSO, the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara.  Prior to joining his current post with MINURSO, Stewart served as Political Director at the UN office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It was there that he allegedly committed in serious sexual offenses involving young staff members. “While Stewart was Political Director at the UN Office in Addis Ababa the serious charge arose. In typical UN fashion a cover up began. But the charge gathered force and was soon seen as being inconvenient for Stewart’s immediate supervisor Haile Menkerios,” ICP stated. Instead of taking swift action against Stewart and members of the restricted circle of the UN’s Addis Ababa office involved in the secret of the sexual misconduct scandal, however, the UN’s leadership chose to cover up in order to salvage its image—but also “protect” both Stewart and other people, whom the UN leadership considered as loyal, reports have said.  The allegations recently came to light as the UN’s Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, is said to be considering whether to extend Stewart’s mandate as chief of the MINURSO.  More importantly, though, Guterres is himself under serious suspicions. The Portuguese diplomat is believed to have known about the series of cover ups and related scandals. However, he chose to sideline questions and complaints about Stewart and other UN officials facing the same allegations.  He purportedly chose to shield the UN from the #MeToo winds that have torn apart the careers of many in recent months, including some officials of a number of international organizations whose reputation have suffered as a result. Matthew R. Lee, ICP’ editor in chief, recently told Turkey’s TRT news outlet that Guterres’s claims to have a “zero tolerance policy” on sexual misconduct while brazenly covering up for employees he considers to be loyal to him.  Reiterating ICP’s report, which accused Guterres of “doublespeak, harassment, and hypocrisy,” Lee brought the charges to a much higher level, denouncing the whole culture at the UN. In addition to the covered up allegations facing Stewart, he pointed out, the UN as a whole has been plagued by scandals of corruption, vote-buying, and influence-peddling. “UN staff who are aware of the charges against Stewart are concerning Guterres—who like his spokesman may be going on vacation for the rest of July—will just haul off and reappoint Stewart. This should not happen,” he told the Turkish outlet. “I think it shows the total hypocrisy of the UN, and of Antonio Guterres in particular.” If proven true, these charges will have a significantly negative impact on the UN’s reputation as a principled and upright institution, especially when it comes to brokering breakthroughs in intricate cases like Western Sahara’s decades-long political stalemate.  As Guterres professes his and the UN’s UN’s genuine desire to monitor cease-fire violations and other breaches in Western Sahara in order to broker the much-needed political settlement, some observers have opined, allegations such as the ones facing Guterres and some top UN officials cast serious doubt on the organization’s trustworthiness and ability to solve complex crises.  The UN, they argue, needs a stellar reputation on issues involving the character of its leaders if it wants to be seen as a reliable broker and a dependable organization.  “Unless UN gets its own house in order, how can it be trusted to set standards anywhere in the world?” said Dr. Simon Waldman, Associate Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society. “The UN needs to lead by example.”

Rabat – The royal pair left Greece from Skiathos airport on a royal jet yesterday, reports Greek media. Greek press reported that while on their holiday, Lalla Salma and her son rented a  luxury yacht named “Serenity,” which costs €600,000 (MAD 6,465,545) to rent for a week. The 72-meter long boat includes 15 suites able to accommodate 28 guests, and a crew made up of 31 people. The boat was renovated two years ago and includes a swimming pool. Lalla Salma made daily excursions to different Greek islands. According to Greek online news outlet Taxydromos.gr, she ate lunch with the members of her escort at a popular tavern at Agnontas, a beach village on the island of Skopelos. The royal menu included lobster, rhubarb stew, salad, octopus and thistle, as well as the famous greek cheese pie. Lalla Salma spent last summer in Italy with her daughter Lalla Khadija. The King of Morocco’s wife has seldom been seen in public since 2017, and rumours are the royal couple have divorced.

Rabat – A video of a woman pushing a priest off stage in Brazil during the live broadcast of a mass has gone viral.  The woman was able to get past security and rush the stage to violently push the priest, identified as Father Marcelo Rossi, into the altar while he was delivering mass at the headquarters of Cancao Nova. Cancao Nova is a Brazilian community known for broadcasting religious content online. The motive for the violent push is supposedly because the priest said “fat women don’t go to heaven,” although the statement was not captured on camera. In the video, the 32-year-old woman seems to be grinning as she rushes towards Father Rossi. Fortunately, the priest was unharmed and the woman was arrested, according to Brazilian media outlets. He declined to press charges and the woman was released shortly after.  In a short statement, Cancao Nova said: “The priest is well. He was attended by the medical staff at the event and presided over the celebration to the end.”   In a short video after the mass, the priest said he just suffered mild pain but no serious injuries. He returned to the stage after the fall, telling the crowd in good humor: “It hurt, but pay close attention. I was just going to talk about pain but I did not imagine it was going to be like this.”

Rabat – The funding from AFD will go towards a program run by the ONEE to improve access to drinking water in northern Morocco. The parties signed the agreements on July 17. The purpose of the program is to ensure access to safe drinking water in the provinces of Al Hoceima, Driouch, Nador, and Taounate, in both urban and rural areas. The AFD is the main funder of the program, which is estimated to cost MAD 1.3 billion. The AFD has now lent approximately MAD 1 billion ($113 million) to ONEE, noting the parties signed an agreement in December 2018 for approximately MAD 534 million ($56 million) towards the initiative. The program is expected to benefit 150 000 people. “In a zone where access to drinking water in rural areas is at 86% as opposed to the national average of 96.5%, the project will generalize access to the resource: over 150 000 people living in 374 rural localities will be able to benefit from access to reliable drinking, both in quality and in quantity,” said Mihoub Mezouaghi, the director of AFD in Morocco, at the signing of the first funding phase.  AFD has contributed over MAD 60 billion ($6.3 billion) to development projects in Morocco since 1992.

Rabat – The president of the Confederation of African Football, Ahmad Ahmad, has declared that both the Champions League and CAF Confederations Cup finals will be played on a single match, instead of two legs, one  home and one away match. The decision was made after a meeting of the executive committee and was announced today by CAF’s president on his official Twitter account. African football fans on Twitter, however, criticized the CAF’s decision, arguing that finals with a single match will see low fan attendance as the case at the ongoing 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAF) in Egypt. Fans also said that Africa lacks adequate transporting services and is a poor continent whose residents cannot even travel to neighboring countries. Football fans also considered the long distance between nations as a factor that would discourage them from attending away matches. The decision will come into effect starting from the next season. On June 5, the CAF executive committee decided to replay the 2nd leg of the African Champions League finals between Morocco’s Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) and Tunisia’s Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST).  The final game saw refereeing mistakes and mismanagement by CAF, resulting in a win for theTunisian team. Frustrated over the course of the final game, and disagreeing with the CAF executive committee decision to replay the match, the WAC president has reached out to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS announced, in an official statement shared on July 13, that it would deliver a verdict on the EST-Wydad dispute on July 31.

Rabat – Not satisfied with their already overflowing bags of privileges, Moroccan MPs are pushing to be granted free rides onboard Al Boraq, the country’s newly inaugurated high speed train. Moroccan Arabic language newspaper Al Akhbar reported in its July 17 edition that all 515 members of the two houses of the Moroccan parliament have requested that they be given a free pass to the new high speed train.  Organized in small committees, the MPs addressed written requests to Habib El Malki and Hakim Benchemass, respectively presidents of the upper and lower houses of the Moroccan parliament. The two presidents, who would also benefit from the move should it pass into action, immediately green lighted it, according to Al Akhbar. The newspaper sardonically commented on how, at a Moroccan parliament where some of the most trivial questions take weeks and months of debates, sometimes ending with no conclusive decisions, MPs’ request in favor of a better treatment for themselves passed both houses in the blink of an eye.  More still, the request was met with  an absolute majority of votes approving the policy, a rare, if not impossible occurrence for a parliament where it is common for MPs of the same party to disagree on policy actions at the moment of voting. While the move is yet to be implemented, the path seems to have been completely cleared for MPs. Rabie Khlie, the director of ONCF, Morocco’s national rail operator, has also given his approval.  According to Al Akhbar, the ONCF director has said that his institution would happily print out free access cards for the MPs to travel onboard Al Boraq at will. This comes as an uncalled for addition to an already overflowing pile of privileges for Moroccan MPs.  A Moroccan MP is paid a monthly wage of MAD 32,800. That amount is increased by MAD 7000 if the MP occupies another function within either of the two houses (vice president or president of the parliament’s committee on education, for example).  In addition, all MPs have free access to regular trains (first class), a monthly allowance of MAD 800 for fuel, and a MAD 700 hotel room in Rabat paid for by the taxpayer’s money. They do not pay for motorway tolls charges and are paid MAD 2000 as pocket money when traveling abroad. The size of the entitlement pie gets even bigger for the presidents of the two houses. They are each paid MAD 42,000 per month, benefit from the above mentioned rights, in addition to a much more significant housing allowance. Self-entitled politicians The move is  set to be interpreted as yet another illustration of critics’ point that the seats of the Moroccan parliament are filled with MPs who entered politics for their own sake, rather than for speaking on behalf of their low-income, sometimes poverty-stricken constituents. Moroccans MPs are routinely criticized for standing up for their own interests rather than those of the constituencies they are supposed to be representing. They enter politics for personal advantages and not for defending political convictions they may have, critics have maintained. When King Mohammed VI and France’s Emmanuel Macron inaugurated Al Boraq in November of last year, many critics said the project was a luxury the country did not need, could not afford.  Rather than meeting important challenges like reducing poverty or bridging the expanding disconnect between extremely rich and low-income families, they said, Al Boraq was another illustration of the existence of “two Moroccos.” Adherents to the Al Boraq project shunned the criticism of the whole project being a luxury the country did not need.  One Al Boraq user, Hassan, told Morocco World News in December of last year: “Those who say that it is all about prestige are right. But they are missing something important: Prestige counts for an emerging country that aspires to greatness, to big development plans.” But even Hassan, for all his passion and enthusiasm for Al Boraq, acknowledged that the new train would make “visible,” affluent Moroccans much more satisfied with the grand projects the country has achieved in recent years. Meanwhile, though, nothing much would change in the lives of the other, less visible Moroccans. “This is Morocco,” he lamented. As MPs delight in adding another privilege to their already overloaded baskets of entitlements, “this is Morocco” is set to come across as the continuation of policies that add to the privileges of the well-off, while doing little for those in need of government intervention.

Rabat – The Palestinian Authority’s (PA) Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Wednesday, July 17 that Israel is “widely attacking Palestinian property in East Jerusalem.”  According to the Ministry, the Israeli attacks include the widespread demolition of homes as well as commercial spaces in different towns of East Jerusalem. In Sur Baher, a Palestinian neighborhood located southeast of Jerusalem, an unprecedented mass demolition took place on Wednesday, July 17, utterly shocking Palestine’s authorities and its public.  Last month, Israel‘s Supreme Court gave the green light for the demolition in Sur Baher.  The buildings in question were built, with construction permits from the Palestinian Authority (PA) on land designated under the civilian control of the PA..  Palestinian officials said that Israeli municipality staff and police escorted a bulldozer to the entrance of Sur Baher, where the heavy machinery demolished a car wash owned by a Palestinian man.  At least ten other buildings in Sur Baher, home to around 70 families, are at risk of demolition.  While most of Sur Baher lies within Israel’s unilaterally-annexed East Jerusalem boundary, part of the community’s land lies in the West Bank; territory that has ended up on the “Israeli” side of the internationally-condemned wall.  Representatives of the EU in Jerusalem and Ramallah voiced their concerns in a statement released on Tuesday, July 16 over Israeli demolition orders against Palestinian homes in Sur Baher. “The EU missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah are concerned about the stated intention of the Israeli authorities to proceed with the demolition of the Palestinian buildings,” the statement said.  “The statements of contempt by the international community are not enough and do not pose real pressure on Israel to stop its crimes,” the statement added.  According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), Israel has approved only 1.5% of the construction building permits requested by Palestinians.  Israel annexed East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and declared the whole city as its eternal indivisible capital in 1980- an arbitrary move that was never recognized by the international community.  Today, Palestinians consider East Jerusalem the capital of their future independent state. The Supreme Court’s decision to consent the demolition of Palestinian buildings sits awkwardly with its international reputation as a defender of human rights.  Hagai El-Ad, the executive director of human rights NGO B’Tselem, told Al Jazeera that in order to form a valid opinion concerning the Supreme Court, one needs to examine its record. “And record speaks volumes, demonstrating unequivocally how the court routinely rejects petitions filed by Palestinians – while providing a stamp of legal approval to systematic human-rights violations, including forcible transfer, collective punishment, blanket impunity to Israeli security forces and torture,” El-Ad said.  Sawsan Zaher, the deputy director of Haifa-based legal rights center Adalah, told Al Jazeera that the court uses “all kinds of excuses and interpretations to justify dismissal” when it comes to “cases that are at the core of the national conflict between the state and Palestinian citizens as a minority,” including issues related to land and demography. But it is the court’s intervention, or lack of it, in Israel’s discriminatory planning system and associated demolition of Palestinian homes, which has been most under the spotlight lately.   In April 2019, the court denied a petition on the demolition of Palestinian homes built without a permit, clarifying that they would not discuss the planning regime in which such demolitions occurred – only whether or not the structures had been built “legally.” B’Tselem, in a 2019 report on the Supreme Court’s responsibility for the dispossession of Palestinians, stated that “there has not been a single case in which the justices granted a petition Palestinians filed against the demolition of their home.” For Dalia Qumsieh, a senior legal adviser at Palestinian rights NGO Al-Haq, the Sur Baher case demonstrates a pattern of the Supreme Court refraining from deviating from the plans of the government, and even granting all its demands. “In general, the court does not question the legality of the policies or measures themselves,” Qumsieh told Al Jazeera. “Rather, it engages in technical, legal details pertaining to the implementation of such policies.”

Rabat – The results of the 2019’s second quarter household survey, conducted by the High Commission for Planning (HCP), show that the overall index of household confidence has continued to fall since last year. The index of household confidence (ICM) has dropped to 74.9 points compared to 79.1 points recorded the previous quarter, and 87.3 points recorded a year earlier.  The decline in household confidence levels during this quarter stems from the decline of all its sub-indicators (standard of living, unemployment, opportunity to purchase durable goods, and financial situation). Standard of living 46.2% of households reported a decline in living standards over the last 12 months. 32.9% reported that the standards maintained the same level, while 20.8% noticed an improvement. Over the next 12 months, 27.3% of households expect a decline in their standard of living. 40.6% believe they will maintain the same level, and the remaining 32% expect to improve their living conditions. In 2017, the World Bank published a Morocco Economic Memorandum entitled “Morocco 2040- Emerging by investing in intangible capital.” The memorandum explains that “historically speaking, it is interesting to note that the French had the Moroccans’ current standard of living in 1950, the Italians in 1955, the Spanish in 1960, and the Portuguese in 1965.” The same source added that between 2007 and 2014, subjective poverty, i.e. one’s own perception of poverty, increased from 42% to 45% across the country, affecting more than 54% of the rural population. Unemployment The survey shows that 83% vs. 6.1% of households expect a rise in unemployment levels over the next 12 months. Despite  the fact that Morocco has received millions of euros in loans to address the problem, unemployment in Morocco specifically affects young diploma-holders.  “Many educated young people leave Morocco to look for better opportunities, 600 engineers leave the country every year,” said Said Amzazi, Minister of Education, in 2018. Purchase of durable goods 61.4% compared to 20.1% of households participating in the survey consider that the time is not opportune to purchase durable goods. They consider the economic situation unfavorable to such purchase. Financial situation of households: deteriorating Regarding income vs. expenses, 62.4% of households estimated that their incomes cover their expenses. 34.2% reported going into debt or using their savings, and 3.4% affirmed being able to save a part of their income. 31.2%, compared to 12.9% of households in 2018, expect an improvement in their financial situation over the next 12 months.

Rabat – Jordan has taken steps towards restoring normal relations with Qatar, two years after Amman withdrew its previous ambassador from Doha in solidarity with its Gulf Arab allies.    Zaid Al Louzi, a senior Jordanian career diplomat and secretary general of Jordan’s Foreign Ministry, was appointed as the country’s new ambassador to Qatar on Tuesday, July 16.   The Jordanian government said it had also accepted Qatar’s nomination of Sheikh Saud bin Nasser bin Jasem al Thani, a member of Doha’s royal family, as ambassador to Amman.  Jordanian diplomats said the timing of the move could reflect the country’s yearning for allies amid the US President Donald Trump’s approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict. According to Jordanian officials, Gulf Arabs’ dependence on the US to confront Iran, makes them hesitant to challenge Washington’s possible abdication of a Palestinian state under any future peace plan. This is particularly important to Jordan, given the long border it shares with Israel. Having the longest Arab border with Israel, Jordan feels. Amman downgraded its diplomatic representation to Qatar in June 2017, a few days after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain broke off ties with Qatar, accusing the country of promoting “terrorism” – a charge Doha denies.  The four countries placed trade and travel sanctions, imposing a land, sea and air blockade against Qatar.   “The countries who imposed the blockade on the state of Qatar interfere in the internal affairs of many countries, and accuse all those who oppose them domestically and abroad with terrorism; by doing so, they are inflicting damage on the war on terror,” said Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in a speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2017. “We have refused to yield to dictations by pressure and siege.”  Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed Momani said that the country’s decision to scale back its diplomatic ties with Qatar was made to ensure regional stability, coordinate the policies of Arab countries and “end the crisis” in the region. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar responded to the initial announcements by saying that there was “no legitimate justification” for the actions taken by the four countries to cut diplomatic relations.  The Gulf state added that the decision was a “violation of its sovereignty” and that it would work to ensure that it would not affect the citizens and residents of Qatar.  Two years on, there has been little progress towards a resolution of the conflict.  The resumption of normal ties between Jordan and Qatar followed initiatives taken by Doha, when its deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defense Affairs, Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, visited Amman in April 2019 and signed military cooperation accords.  The agreements aimed at increasing cooperation between the countries’ armed forces and enhancing the armed presence in their militaries’ at the technical and organizational levels.  In June 2018, Doha extended a $500 million aid package to Jordan only days after Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia announced their $2.5 billion support to the country.   Qatar’s five-year package included the opening of 10,000 jobs for Jordanian nationals in Doha, as well as the investment on the country’s infrastructure and tourism sector. Wealthy Qatar, which has a large stake in Jordan’s second largest bank, has also pledged to pump hundreds of millions of dollars in coming years in what diplomats say is an attempt to drive a wedge between Amman and Saudi Arabia. The aid packages from the Gulf states aimed to help Jordan overcome an economic crisis the nation suffered following a wave of rare anti-government protests.  Jordan, which unlike Gulf Arab states lacks oil reserves, has long depended on foreign assistance to satisfy international lenders and its public.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) issued a statement to announce the arrest of the suspect involved in the rape and murder of a woman in Mellah, Rabat. A video documenting the rape went viral on social media, stirring a nationwide backlash and uproar to condemn the alarming number of sexual assaults in Morocco. DGSN, in a statement, said that Moroccan judicial police had opened an investigation, prior to the release of the video, after authorities found the 34-year old victim in a serious condition in Rabat. The press release added that the victim died on June 11 after complications from theinjuries she suffered during the rape. The mother of the victim said that her daughter was raped at night. “One of the passersby filmed the incident, but no no dared to help,” said the grieving mother.  “If they were really men men, two or three people should have trapped him and helped her instead of watching him raping her,” the mother added. “When I went to the hospital, I found out that my daughter is dead. I was at my sister’s in Sale and did not know what happened to my daughter.” The mother said that the killer hit her daughter on the head with a hammer. She added that the murderer had also marked her daughter’s body with a screwdriver. The mother said that the 56-year old year old  killer has been threatening her daughter over a period of time and that he used to take her with him by force. “If I reported him, he would have killed me as well. He attacked people at their houses in Mellah,” she said. The mother said that she lost her daughter. “I am sick, I don’t sleep, and I don’t eat anymore.” “I am asking King Mohammed VI to intervene. I want the killer to face death penalty or to die in prison,” she said. Reports say that the killer forcibly penetrated the victim using objects such as a bottle.. “He used to threaten her. He has been sexually assaulting her for a long time. I could not do anything, he threatened to make a scar on her face,” the mother said. Morocco has witnessed several shocking rape cases in recent years.  Cases of sexual harassment and violence against women are also prevalent. One of the cases that made international headlines and fueled the activism of national and international NGOs was of Khadija, a teenager who was allegedly kidnapped, raped, held in captivity, and forcibly tattooed last summer. A  report issued by the King’s Attorney General, Mohamed Abdel Nabawi in 2018 said that there were over 1,600 rape cases reported in 2017.

Rabat – King Felipe VI of Spain has decorated Moroccan Nezha Hayat, president of  the Moroccan Authority of Capital Market (AMMC). Spanish ambassador to Morocco Ricardo Diez Hochleitner presented the decoration to Hayat on Tuesday, July 16 in Rabat. The Spanish King decorated the Moroccan expert for her “commitment and her work for strengthening Moroccan-Spanish economic relations.” “During her professional career, Mrs. Hayat showed not only a careful attitude toward Spain but also a very positive attitude towards Spanish companies that approached her for advice, support, and follow-up,” Diez Hochleitner quoted as saying by Maghreb Arab press (MAP). The Spanish diplomat added that Hayat is “very committed to the respect of transparency in business.” Diez Hochleitner added that Hayat is also “loyal and devoted to her work and to her country.” Morocco and Spain maintain strong diplomatic relations, further ingrained by the recent royal visit of the Spanish King, and Queen Letizia in February. In addition to diplomatic ties, Morocco and Spain share strong economic cooperation. In January, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP)  shared statistics from the European Statistics Office, showing that Spain remains Morocco’s top trade partner. The statistics showed that Moroccan exports to Spain increased by 5.4% during the first 11 months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. According to the statistics, Moroccan imports of Spanish goods registered an increase of 2.6% annually. Imports from the whole of the EU increased by 4% during the same period. Spain is the biggest importer of Moroccan goods, and takes in 41.6% of all goods Morocco exports to the EU. France receives 28.6%, Italy 6.3%, the UK 4.8%, and Germany 4.4%.

Rabat – Bosch-Siemens will not be setting up a factory in Morocco but has agreed to source parts from the kingdom for its factories in Europe.  Under the agreement, around 15 Moroccan suppliers will deliver metal, plastic and electronic parts to the home-appliance giant. Two companies have already signed an agreement to join the ecosystem: Virmousil, which builds electrical parts, and Sigit, which supplies plastic parts to the automobile industry. According to the Minister for Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy, two further signings are imminent. Spanish company Gravalos Construcciones will also invest MAD 40 million into an induction plate factory in Morocco.  This arrangement will form Morocco’s first home-appliance commercial ecosystem. Ultimately, the sector aims to create 2000 new jobs and an export value of MAD 1.65 billion by 2023. According to Elalamy, the launch of an ecosystem of suppliers is a “prelude to setting up home-appliance factories.” “This sector is one of Morocco’s target sectors, so we won’t be stopping here,” he adds, hinting at future developments in local home-appliance production. Bosch-Siemens is one of the worlds largest home-appliance companies, with 42 production sites across the world. The company opened an office in Casablanca in 2016.

Rabat – The governments of Morocco and Uganda have expressed their shared enthusiasm for establishing strong diplomatic relations. The two governments wish to rekindle “parliamentary diplomacy” and facilitate cooperation on a number of development-related issues. Meeting with Rebecca Kadaga Alitwala, the speaker of the Ugandan parliament, Saad Eddine El Othmani, Morocco’s Head of Government, reiterated the North African country’s will to uphold its Africa-oriented diplomacy. He also emphasized Morocco’s determination to strengthen cooperation with fellow African countries.  He said Morocco would be happy to share with Uganda its experience in coming to terms with challenges in a wide range of sectors, including education, security, insurance, and agriculture. El Othmani, speaking animatedly of Morocco’s increasingly active role in Africa, said that the country has a genuine interest in taking part and playing a much bigger role in the advancement of the African continent, which it considers its “home.”  He described the prospective diplomatic breakthrough with Uganda as a logical extension of Morocco’s eagerness to improve relations with the rest of Africa.  Alitwala, who is heading a parliamentary delegation tasked with laying the groundwork of increased diplomatic relations with Morocco, emphasized the need to invest in “parliamentary diplomacy.”  This, she argued, would be an effective way of ironing out differences and bridging the gaps of any divergence that may have kept the two countries from engaging with one another for four decades. Reiterating El Othmani’s most important points, she highlighted the advantage that both countries will gain from strengthening their bilateral connections.  The Ugandan MP spoke about the need for increased exposure to each other’s realities as the basis for a strong bilateral cooperation. Her country, she stressed, has indeed a lot to learn from Morocco in areas like education and banking. To do so, she proposed establishing an exchange program for Moroccan and Ugandan students to learn more about their two countries After 40 years when “nothing much has been going on” between the two countries, she argued, the desire from both countries to commit to much stronger relations would require solid institutional foundations. “The bilateral is something we need to develop,” she said. For Morocco, rekindling ties with Uganda comes as yet another important step forward in the realization of its African gaze.  Since the North African country reunited with its fellow African countries in January 2018, when it joined the African Union, cooperation with Africa seems to have emerged as perhaps the foundational pillar of Morocco’s identity in the international arena. “For us, cooperating with the rest of Africa is not only a desire; it is a priority,” one high-ranking Moroccan official said recently. El Othmani echoed that sentiment throughout his meeting with Alitwala. He noted that “commitment to Africa” is of paramount importance to King Mohammed VI, the main initiator of what has come to be known as Morocco’s “royal diplomacy” aimed at asserting the kingdom’s Africanness.

Rabat – American pop star Lady Gaga launched her makeup line for “Haus Laboratories,” for presale on Amazon Prime Day on July 15, where it will be sold exclusively. The deal with Amazon marks the first time a major beauty brand has partnered exclusively with the e-commerce giant. Despite the crowded market, with competition from other pop stars such as Rihanna with Fenty Beauty, the makeup line is already a bestseller. Gaga seems to be aware of this oversaturation but believes the brand won’t be affected, saying in her campaign video: “The last thing the world needs is another beauty brand. Too bad!” The line, which won’t ship out to customers on September 17, is offering 6 kits combining lip gloss, lip liner, and all-over color. The kits will be priced at $49, and the glosses are available individually for $16 or in a duo for $22. Lady Gaga told media launching a makeup line is a dream 30 years in the making, beginning when she was just a child watching her mother apply makeup. “I remember watching my mother put her makeup on every morning, basking in the glow of her power to put on her bravest face as the hard-working woman she was. I then began to experiment with makeup as a way to make my dreams of being as strong as my mother become true,” Gaga said on Instagram. “It was then that I invented Lady Gaga. I found the superhero within me by looking in the mirror and seeing who I wanted to be.” “Makeup changed my life. I never felt beautiful, and I still have days that I don’t feel beautiful. All of the insecurities that I’ve dealt with my whole life from being bullied when I was younger, they come right back up to bite me,” she explained, elaborating on her deep passion for makeup. “Then I put makeup on, and before I know it, I feel this superhero within. It gives me those wings to fly. I’m not saying that makeup is the only thing that does that, but it did that for me,” she added.

Rabat – The director of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), Abdellatif Hammouchi, taken steps to ensure that police officers remain professional during interactions with citizens. Hammouchi has given instructions to officers on how to approach traffic offenders.  . The Arabic speaking newspaper Al Massae reported on Wednesday, July 17, that El Hammouchi has reiterated his insistence on certain principles to which police officers must adhere. He reminds the police force that they must make themselves visible when carrying out traffic control checks. El Hammouchi further stipulates that police officers must maintain the legal distance from suspected traffic offenders while checking their documents, as well as speaking to suspects with respect. The newspaper reported that this reissuance of protocol follows the tragic death of a police officer while exercising his duty in M’diq (northern Morocco) on Sunday, July 14. The policeman was in pursuit of a biker, the pursuit began in Marina Smir and continued to M’diq. The reckless motorcycle driver hit the police officer at a high speed. In addition to issuing new orders, El Hammouchi will provide his officers with the latest technology traffic equipment to better monitor the road. The equipment includes breathalyzer equipment to monitor alcohol consumption  and cameras to film discussions with drivers. The new instructions aim to create an atmosphere of transparency and respect for citizens’ rights and duties. Morocco is currently witnessing a modernizing shift in terms of road safety. The government has recently approved the installation of state of the art speed radars to more efficiently detect traffic offenders from long distances and during the night. The Ministry of Equipment and Logistics has announced a program to repair the old radar system, as well as adding to it with new equipment.

Rabat – When Morocco introduced a more flexible exchange rate policy in January of 2018, it aimed to keep the county’s economy competitive and maintain the value of the Moroccan Dirham (MAD). The IMF has since reported that the transition was a success. On Tuesday, the IMF urged Morocco to expand its exchange rate flexibility by again increasing the float of the MAD.  In an effort to boost resilience and increase exports, Morocco first introduced a floating exchange rate in January of 2018, increasing the rate from 0.03% to 2.5%. In a report released on Tuesday, the IMF’s Executive Directors said “they welcomed the beginning of the transition to greater exchange rate flexibility last year which will help the economy absorb potential external shocks and remain competitive. They encouraged the authorities to use the current window of opportunity to continue this reform in a carefully sequenced and well-communicated manner.” Moroccan Authorities responded to the IMF’s continued encouragement by saying reforms would continue, economic conditions in the country permitting. In a floating rate rate system, a currency’s value is typically determined by supply and demand on the open market. The value of a currency over time is an indication of the country’s relative economic strength. Prior to 2018, Morocco’s currency operated on a fixed exchange rate. In a fixed exchange rate a currency is tied, or held at the same value relative to a major world currency such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. The flexibility of a floating rate offers an advantage in case of an economic shock where significant pressure is put on foreign exchange reserves.  Not everyone is in favor of continued reform to the MAD. High Commissioner for Planning Ahmed al-Halimi warned that Morocco needs to focus on other reforms before pursuing reforms to the currency exchange system.  In a country with a 10% unemployment rate, and where one third of college students graduate unqualified to find a job, Halimi said Morocco needed to instead focus on education and vocational training systems.  “What is needed now in a country like Morocco is not a reform in the currency exchange system,” Halimi said last August. “Before we do that, “We must first carry out other reforms or finish the reforms already initiated.”

Rabat – A Spanish judge at the National Court sentenced, on Monday July 15, Moroccan national Allal El Mourabit to prison for allegedly “glorifying terrorism.” The judge sentenced the Moroccan national  after considering evidence concerning charges of promoting terrorism. The arrest took place at 7.A.m on Saturday in north west of Pamplona in Spain. Security services apprehended the suspect driving a truck which was searched for evidence. Security services suspect that the Moroccan national was encouraging terrorist attacks online using several internet profiles. The suspect had previously been incarcerated on charges of “spreading terror propaganda messages through social networks.” Spanish police, according to the news outlet, have no evidence  that the suspect was planning “an impending attack.” The news outlet added that the Moroccan national was arrested in December 2016 while he was driving a truck. Authorities suspected that he would use the vehicle to commit an attack. When searched, the vehicle was found to contain extremist literature and information about terror attacks. This is not the frist time Spanish police arrested a Moroccan national for alleged terrorism charges. In June 2018, Spanish authorities arrested a 30-year old Moroccan near Barcelona under an international arrest warrant from Moroccan police.  El Mourabit fled Morocco in September 2018 following the dismantling of a terror cell. He is allegedly a member of that dismantled terror group. Moroccan and Spanish security services regularly collaborate on the fight against drug trafficking, irregular migration networks, and counterterrorism. In April, Moroccan security services, in cooperation with Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services, arrested a Moroccan terror suspect who was allegedly planning a terror attack in Seville, southern Spain. In 2018, Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell described Rabat-Madrid counterterrorism cooperation  as an example for other countries to follow.

By Margot Eliason &amp; Kawtar Ennaji Rabat – The Moroccan parliamentary commission for teaching, culture, and communication has approved a new framework law for education. The framework law allows for technical subjects to be taught in foreign languages, and require Tamazight to be taught to all Moroccans. The parliamentary commission approved the framework law by a vast majority. 25 voted in favour of the new law, while two voted against the framework. There were also three abstentions. The commission was, however, divided on two controversial provisions. A number of members of parliament abstained from voting for Article 2 and Article 31, which were only approved by 12 and 11 votes respectively. Article 2 specifies that scientific and technical subjects can now be taught in foreign languages through a pedagogy called “Linguistic Alternation” (the equivalent of Content Language Integrated Learning). The article defines the “Linguistic Alternation” method as a “progressive educational choice used in multilingual education, in an aim to diversify the teaching of languages.”  However, the framework stresses that this new method should be followed “while prioritizing Morocco’s two official languages [Arabic and Tamazight (Berber)].” Article 2 adds that this reform “will be carried out through teaching some subjects, in particular scientific or technical subjects, or chapters of certain subjects in one or more foreign languages.”  Article 31 relates to teaching Tamazight in school. It states that “upon completing high school, students should have mastered both Arabic and Tamazight in addition to two foreign languages.” The law also states that, “all foreign schools based in Morocco are required to teach Arabic and Tamazight to the Moroccan children enrolled in classes.” The framework does not appear to apply to foreign students.  The new framework law promotes multilingual education. The choice of foreign language, and its integration into the curriculum will then be a matter of choice for the school.  Teaching in languages other than Arabic has raised controversy. Some schools already teach scientific subjects in French. Some say this entrenches disadvantage when it comes to accessing higher education which is delivered in French. In January 2015, the Higher Council of Education discussed prioritizing teaching English over French as a foreign language. For some, English is an “international” language which will provide students with a competitive advantage. “English is becoming more and more essential in higher education schools and universities,” Samir Benmakhlouf, CEO of London Academy Casablanca, told Moroccan newsource Le Matin in February. “The mastery of this language is crucial as the majority of international conferences and scientific journals are in English,” he added. “In the job market, it is the linguistic dimension that makes the difference between two otherwise equal candidates,” he explained. The Minister for Education Said Amzazi stated that the approval of the legal framework today was a “historical moment.” It is the first time that the education sector will have its own legal framework, which is a first step towards the Moroccan education system “taking off,” Amzazi told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The legal framework aims to promote access to equal education for all Moroccan children.

Rabat – Levothyrox has been out of stock for up to a month in some parts of Morocco. Some patients are facing serious health risks, and are angry at the Ministry of Health’s innaction on the matter. One Twitter user raged “Levotirox [sic] is out of stock. Let’s just say that it is a treatment for a chronic illness, with no alternative treatment, without any communication from the ministry and/or the pharmacy syndicate who are just as confused as the clients.” The lack of communication on the shortage is a concern. “More than three days after the official announcement of Levothyrox […] stock shortage, there has been no article in the Moroccan press, and no announcement by the ministry in charge. Is this normal,” another Twitter user said. Yesterday the Ministry of Health did finally acknowledged the shortage in a press release, reassuring that the “supply of the medication would progressively stabilise from the end of July onwards.” Cooper Pharma, the company responsible for the distribution of the medication in Morocco, was not available for comment on when the drug would be back on the market. According to the Ministry of Health, the stock problems are due to an increase in global demand for the product. On June 21, the American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP) also announced a shortage of the drug in the US due to increased demand. The Levothyrox shortage is not an isolated incident. Morocco has faced a number of drug shortages in recent months, affecting a range of medication including Cardioaspirine (used in treating cardiac disorders), Benadryl (against allergies), and Microdiol (a contraceptive). Konakion MM Paediatric, or Vitamin K, used to treat hemorrhages in newborn babies, was also unavailable in some pharmacies for at least two months earlier this year. “The last time I sold this medication was in February. Since then, we have witnessed an absence of this molecule across the whole country. I usually recommend to my clients to get it in Europe or in Sebta if they can,” a pharmacist told Moroccan news outlet Media24 in March. The issue is complex, especially when supply issues are due to global shortages. The Ministry of Health is working towards a solution. Improving access to medication is one of the pillars of “Health Plan 2025” strategy, although the Ministry has not yet announced any concrete solutions to the medication shortage problem.

Rabat – According to a statement from Morocco’s National Confederation of Tourism (CNT), upper-middle-class Moroccans are going abroad for vacation, as they can find better quality holidays abroad for the same price. Every year, the number of Moroccans leaving for the summer increases, and the trend is having a negative impact on the balance of the tourism industry in Morocco, says CNT.  “The trend is caused by growing competition from near and far destinations such as Spain, Turkey, and even Asia,” says the vice president of CNT, Fouzi Zemrani. He noted that while many Moroccans look to destinations at home like Agadir, Taghazout, and Marrakech, where overnight stays cost anywhere between MAD 500-2000, some foreign destinations are offering the same experience for less money, and often with a better quality of service. Zemrani listed Turkey as one of the biggest tourist destinations for Moroccans, thanks to visa-free travel and low costs. “Between the absence of a visa and only 4 hours by plane, this country that has a hard time has an incredible rating all year round, especially since it offers all-inclusive packages, for Moroccans to discover a country they often see in Turkish soap operas,” said the CNT representative. “Between affordable prices, cleanliness, freedom, crafts … Turkey really has everything to please tourists and is becoming a real competitor for our national tourism,” says Zemrani, adding that Morocco should be inspired by Turkey’s high tourist return rate. He also named Spain as one of the biggest tourist destinations for Moroccans, despite the visa requirements. “As a receiving market for foreign tourists, Morocco has transformed itself into a powerful market that is not negligible, however, there is even talk of nearly a million Moroccans traveling abroad,” reiterated the vice president.  “The first to have understood this evolution are the Spaniards who, starting from April, organize Eductours all over Morocco. Their tour operators come and offer their products (hotel rooms, apartments …) to Moroccan travel agents.” “In addition, representatives of several Spanish hotel chains in Morocco are also approaching local operators to send them customers, especially to the Costa Del Sol.” Moroccans are eager to jump on the offers, where it “costs around MAD 1,000 for stays of 7 to 15 days in furnished accommodation for at least 4 people located in residences with swimming pool and even a concierge.” Prices that are clearly very competitive with a stay in Marrakech, where a single night can cost that much, as mentioned above. “To top it off, the proximity of supermarkets and cheap food products combined with affordable entertainment means that Moroccan holidaymakers can spend a holiday for a very decent budget,” he elaborated. “Thanks to this, some small towns of Costa Del Sol like Fuengirola are becoming predominantly Moroccan resorts with a dedicated offer of halal products and even mosques.” “Apart from affordable prices, for the upper-middle class, there is also more freedom at these destinations. For example, tourists can be assured that no one will look awry at their wife or daughter, whether in bikini or burkini,” he points out.

Rabat – The High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) survey provides quarterly data on household perceptions of living conditions in Morocco. These include savings and the cost of groceries. According to the report, 31.2% of Moroccan households expect an improvement in their financial situation over the next year. However, only 16.7% of households expect to save money in the next 12 months, according to the HCP household survey for the second quarter of 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, 89% of households reported that food prices have risen in the last 12 months. A much smaller proportion of households (0.1%) reported a decline in prices. According to 86.5% of households, food prices are expected to continue to rise over the next 12 months. The remaining 13.5% expect the prices to maintain the same level. Some Moroccan families are struggling to deal with the rising cost of living, Fettouma Nourdy from Casablanca told Morocco World News that “higher prices have made it almost impossible to save.”  “Especially when people need to deal with expenses of summer vacations, Eid-Al-Adha, and the new school year, all in a very short period of time,” she added. Fettouma’ s husband, replying to her statement, said “Morocco is bordered by two oceans, yet fish prices are hitting the roof.” He then added, “we buy fish at a higher price than europeans to whom we export it; some of us can not afford to include certain types of fish in our diets.” The month of Ramadan (May 2019) was characterized by a higher demand on fish accompanied by higher prices. Since then, the prices have not returned to the norm. A number of fish remain unaffordable even for the middle class. During Ramadan the price of sardines fluctuated between MAD 10 and 25 per kilogram, depending on the species. It reached a minimum of MAD 15 per kilogram on March 24. Moroccans used to buy sardines at MAD 8 or 10 maximum. The rise in price was supposedly the result of the meteorological conditions which had made fishing unsafe.

He said that the commitment has been an essential factor of Rabat’s diplomacy and public relations efforts.

Renard will officially  terminate his contract with the national team without financial compensation as stipulated in the contract, reports the TV channel. The decision, according to Medi1 television program “Saat Lcan” (CAN Hour), will be irrevocable. Renard’s announcement is expected to come after the final match of the 2019 African Cup of Nations between Algeria  and Senegal, which will take place on Friday, July 19. Rumors of Herve Renard’s resignation went viral recently. Morocco’s Football Federation (FRMF), however, denied the reports. “President of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa had two meetings with Renard on Sunday and Monday to evaluate Morocco’s performance during the 2019 African Cup of Nations,” FRMF said. Renard also  took to his Instagram to announce his meeting with Lekjaa. “At my request I met Mr Lekjaa president of the FRMF. We have taken stock of the competition that has just ended for us. We also talked about the future, I gave him my opinion.  We have agreed not to make any public statement,” wrote Renard. The coach’s yet to be announced decision  comes a few weeks after the exit of the national team from 2019 CAN after disappointing performance against Benin on July 5. Before the CAN, Lekjaa said that there is no “guarantee” that Renard will stay with the Moroccan team after the African tournament. Lekjaa said that Renard’s future depends on the team’s performance in an official competition. The FRMF president suggested that the outcome of CAN for the Moroccan team would have a definitive bearing on Renard’s future with the Atlas Lions.  The  FRMF president added that after each competition, both parties should take a moment’s pause “before moving forward.”

The National Telecommunications Regulations Agency (ANRT) has released its annual report into telecommunications access and usage in Morocco. The ANRT report analyzes information from 5820 households and 5820 individuals aged 5 years and over, to identify trends in mobile phone, laptop, and internet usage. According to the report, 99.8% of Moroccans have mobile phones, and of these, 75.7% have smartphones. This is a significant increase from 2011 figures, when only 12% of phone owners had smartphones.  The data shows Moroccans seem to prefer smartphones over computers, as smartphone ownership growth rates far exceed computer ownership rates. In 2018, only 60.6% of Moroccans had computers, up from 34% in 2010. According to ANRT, access to the internet by Moroccan households has increased three-fold over the last eight years. 74.2% of households are now equipped with internet. Access rates in rural areas remain lower than in urban areas. The report finds eight out of ten households in urban areas have an internet connection, compared to just over half of households in rural areas. 74.2% of people access the internet from their phones.  Those who do not have internet in their homes cite a number of reasons for this: lack of need (51.6%), high price of equipment and connection (60.4%), unavailability of internet (14%), access to internet elsewhere (15.1%), confidentiality and security (5.5%), cultural reasons (4.9%), and absence of electricity in the household (1.4%). The reasons for having an internet connection are diverse. The leading reason is “entertainment” (including games and social networks) at 95.2%, following the news (86.1%), work (51.3%), studies or research (33.3%), and access to television through the internet (17.1%).  The report finds that Whatsapp is the most used online social network in Morocco, used by 96.5% of respondents. Whatsapp is closely followed by YouTube (90.6%), then by Facebook (88.4%), and Instagram (44.7%).  Millions therefore noticed when Whatsapp, Facebook, and Instagram were down for a few hours on July 3. Users blamed Maroc Telecom for slow internet, but the national network provider quickly issued a statement explaining that the problem “came from platforms located outside the national territory.”

Rabat – Moroccan international football player Romain Saiss acknowledged that the days after Morocco’s elimination from the 2019 African Cup of Nations  (CAN) were “a little hard.” In an interview with France Football, Saiss said that he faced sleepless nights “with a lot of disappointment.” “I hope that the two weeks of vacation before the recovery will allow me to move easily to something else,” Saiss said. The football player was praised his performance during the first two games in 2019 CAN. However, the Atlas Lions’ disappointing performance against the Benin Squirrels, which led to their premature exit from the tournament, was met with waves of criticism from fans.  “It was a failure, one should acknowledge,” Saiss said. He added that the failure resulted in a feeling of shame. “We were representing Morocco, we aspired to go very far in this competition.” “With all my respect to Benin, when you get sent home by this team when you had the opportunity to go far, it is annoying,” Saiss said. Benin defeated the national team on Friday, July 5  in a penalty shootout after Moroccan key football player Hakim Ziyech missed a penalty in the last minute of the game’s ordinary time. Missing the penalty led the  Moroccan national team and Benin to extra time and then a penalty shootout in which Benin scored 4 penalties to Morocco’s one. . Saiss said that after the defeat there was a “dead silence in the locker room and on the bus.” “We try to be constantly serious because we always want to do something good. But that was  not enough,” he said. He added that the national football team faces difficulties with “small teams” more than giants in the field. Saiss recalled Morocco’s hailed performances during the 2018 World Cup against Spain and Portugal. The football player also defended his teammates, including Youssef En-Nesyri and Hakim Ziyech. He said that the national team often receive criticism over lack of attackers.  Recalling Youessf En-Nesyri’s performance, Saiss said that the football player did “very well. He scored two goals and put in a lot of effort. “ Commenting on Ziyech’s  performance, Saiss said that football fans have been expecting “more from him,given the season he has done [with Ajax].” “It is normal for people to be disappointed because he has not scored or delivered a decisive pass,” he added. Saiss said that  Ziyech was “very tired” due to his season with his Dutch football club. “We played matches where it was 37 or 38 [Celsius] degrees without a break.” Saiss also commented on rumors that head coach of the national football team is expecting to leave the Atlas Lions after the elimination. “There have never been any problems between us and the coach. The atmosphere has always been good,” said Saiss. The football player said that all players in the team, without exception, want Herve Renard  to stay. “He did beautiful things. Any player on the team will tell you that they have to stay and continue,” Saiss said. An uproar emerged on social media after the elimination of the national team, especially when Renard’s alleged salary was disclosed. Renard allegedly earns a month  €120,000 from the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF).

Rabat – On Sunday, July 14, US President Donald Trump made headlines with a barrage of tweets which targeted at four democratic congresswomen, who are all ethnic minorities. The tweets caused a public outcry, with many dubbing the tweets racist and xenophobic. “So interesting to see ‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,” the US president tweeted. “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how ..it is done,” he added. “These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!”  While he did not explicitly name the women, the context makes it clear who he meant. The four women he was targeting, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who were all born in the US with the exception of Omar who came to the US as a refugee from Somali aged 12, have hit back at Trump.  Ocasio-Cortez, who is of Puerto Rican descent but was born in the Bronx just 12 miles from the hospital Trump was born, replied saying: “You are angry because you can’t conceive of an America that includes us.” You are angry because you can’t conceive of an America that includes us. You rely on a frightened America for your plunder. You won’t accept a nation that sees healthcare as a right or education as a #1 priority, especially where we’re the ones fighting for it. Yet here we are. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 14, 2019  Pressley, who is an African American born in Ohio, also hit back on twitter, saying: “THIS is what racism looks like.” THIS is what racism looks like. WE are what democracy looks like. And we’re not going anywhere. Except back to DC to fight for the families you marginalize and vilify everyday. pic.twitter.com/vYzoxCgN0X — Ayanna Pressley (@AyannaPressley) July 14, 2019  Omar also replied, calling Trump the “most corrupt and inept president” president the US has ever seen, and accused him of stoking white nationalism. Mr. President, As Members of Congress, the only country we swear an oath to is the United States. Which is why we are fighting to protect it from the worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen. https://t.co/FBygHa2QTt — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) July 14, 2019  You are stoking white nationalism bc you are angry that people like us are serving in Congress and fighting against your hate-filled agenda. “America's answer to the intolerant man is diversity, the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired.” -RFK — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) July 14, 2019  Lastly, Taib, who was born in was born in Detroit to Palestinian parents and was the second ever Muslim woman to be elected in to congress after Omar, tweeted: “I am fighting against corruption in OUR country.”  Yo @realDonaldTrump, I am fighting corruption in OUR country. I do it every day when I hold your admin accountable as a U.S. Congresswoman. Detroit taught me how to fight for the communities you continue to degrade &amp; attack. Keep talking, you’ll be out of the WH soon. #TickTock — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) July 14, 2019  Despite the backlash, on Monday, July 15, Trump stood by his statements during a press conference in front of the White House. “These are people that in my opinion hate our country,” President Trump told reporters. “As far as I’m concerned if you hate our country, if you’re not happy here, you can leave. You can leave right now. I don’t know who’s going to miss ’em,” he said. When asked by one reporter whether he was concerned about people dubbing his tweets racist, he responded: “It doesn’t concern me because many people agree with me.” In response, the four democrats also called a press conference on Capitol Hill that afternoon. “We don’t leave the things that we love,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “We are focused on making it better.”  Pressley shared a similar sentiment, and encouraged “the American people and all of us in this room and beyond to not take the bait. “This is a disruptive distraction from the issues of concern and consequences to the American people,” said Pressley. Omar simply described his comments as “ridiculous.” This is his plan to pit us against each other.” she added. The press conference seemed to only further anger Trump, who went on another Twitter tirade, today, July 16. “Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body!” Trump insisted. Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show “weakness” and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2019  …..Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country. Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said. Omar is polling at 8%, Cortez at 21%. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2019  While the Democratic party was vocal and quick to denounce Trump’s statements, his own party remained mostly silent, except for two who condemned the tweets. Republican Senator Susan Collins said in a statement the tweets were “way over the line” and should be removed. Republican Congressman Will Hurd, who is African American, described the comments as “racist and xenophobic.” But one Republican, Congressman Andy Harris, defended Trump. Speaking to a radio station, said: “Clearly it’s not a racist comment. He could have meant go back to the district they came from, the neighbourhood they came from.”

Rabat – Human Rights Watch (HRW) has condemned the Polisario Front’s use of arbitrary arrests and torture to silence dissidents.  In a report published on its website on July 16, the rights advocacy group called on the Polisario, the separatist militia administering the refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria, to release three dissidents recently arrested and jailed without any “credible evidence” against them. HRW’s report comes a month after the Polisario Front arbitrarily jailed three prominent Polisario critics, activists Moulay Abba Bouzid and Fadel Mohammed Braikaa, as well as journalist Mahmoud Zeidan.  The three men, who according to HRW are “known as dissidents in the refugee camps,” are currently being detained “while an investigating judge explores treason and other charges against them.”  According to HRW’s telling, the common denominator with the three detainees is their unwavering criticism of the deep-seated corruption, tribalism, and dictatorship plaguing Polisario’s leadership.  In addition to lashing out at the front’s corruption and crackdown on freedom of expression in the camps, the three detained critics have recently lambasted the separatist group’s “lack of alternatives to oppression” and the “absence of dialogue” to settle the four-decade-long hostility in Western Sahara. The report pointed to the arbitrariness of the men’s detention and the dubious circumstances of their arrests. There seems to be no reason for the three men to be put behind bars other than their harsh denunciation of the front’s human rights violations in the refugee camps it administers, according to Lama Fakih, HRW’s Middle East and North Africa director. Fakih demanded that the three dissidents be released as the Polisario has so far failed to “show credible evidence” to suggest that they “may be guilty of genuinely criminal acts and not just peacefully criticizing the Polisario.” In response, the Polisario leadership suggested it has no intention of releasing the three dissents. Instead, the Polisario envisions putting the three on trial for “slander, insults, and incitement to disobedience,” according to a statement from a Polisario “court.”  In an email to HRW on July 15, the Polisario leadership doubled down on its refusal to consider the body’s call that the men be let out of jail for lack of incriminating evidence.  Where HRW speaks of lack of conclusive evidence at best and an organized campaign to silence dissent at worst, Polisario is pointing to the three detainee’s acts of treason towards the separatist leadership. Polisario’s email to HRW explained that the dissidents were “in preventive custody” while awaiting their trial for “treason against the nation, acts of segregation against the Sahrawi state, sedition, vandalism, defamation, and slander.”  The three dissidents are currently being detained in the notorious Edhabia prison, a Polisario-administered facility near Tindouf, and where many dissidents have perished or been tortured over the years.  The three were arrested in mid-June. A month has passed since their arrest but the Polisario has been unable to produce any credible evidence to buttress its case against them, HRW lamented. Bouzid, one of the two jailed activists, told his sister, who recently visited him, that he was tortured during interrogation sessions. He added that his interrogators also tried to force him into signing a written confession of the charges the Polisario seems to have fabricated for the three detainees. But the advocacy group did not simply condemn the front’s crackdown on dissent in the refugee camps under its rule.  In addition, HRW is also calling on Algeria, Polisario’s strongest supporter, not to turn a blind eye to human rights breaches happening under its nose. For the group, the separatist front cannot conceivably do what it is doing without Algiers rubber-stamping it. “Algeria cannot subcontract the protection of human rights on its territory and turn a blind eye if the Polisario violates them,” the body said.

Rabat – Mustapha Hadji, the second assistant of head coach Herve Renard, broke his silence to reveal the reasons behind the shocking and premature elimination of Morocco’s national football team from the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). The Moroccan team, who were favorites to win the 2019 CANt, lost to Benin in the knockout stage, leaving the Moroccan football community shocked. Fans were particularly disappointed after the last-minute missed penalty that, if scored, could have seen Morocco go on to the quarter-finals.  Contacted by Radio Mars, Hadji commented on the mistakes made by the technical team. Hadji explained that the team had all the means and qualities to go all the way to the final, but it was the bad decisions made by the technical staff which caused the Atlas Lions’ premature exit from the CAN tournament. “We are responsible for this performance and the defeat against Benin. We made bad choices and we could not find solutions against a team that terminated its game with 10 [players]. Players must not be blamed nor the federation [FRMF], it’s the fault of the technical staff,” Hadji revealed. When asked about Renard’s choice to exclude certain Moroccan players performing at the national league, Botola Pro, from the national squad, Hadji said he was disappointed not to see them among the 23 man Moroccan squad. He added that some of them have played in African competitions and have gained a lot of experience during this year’s continental tournaments. “We started having a structured championship. There are four clubs that have been at the top level this year and have players capable of giving a plus to the national team. In the future, they should be present,” he added. Hadji admitted that he disagreed with the way Renard handled the additional time against Benin, in the match that knocked out the Moroccan team. He added, however, that Renard is his boss and his decision should be respected. “In my opinion in football, when you get into a field and you’re afraid of losing, that’s when you lose. You already anticipate the defeat. That’s what happened to us,” explained Hadji. Criticized for his lack of communication with the squad, Hadji clarified that he chose to remain silent to avoid a repeat of the 2018 scenario which caused tensions with Mehdi Benatia, the team’s captain. “When I reacted in the World Cup, you saw what it cost me. It’s been said that I have no right to talk as I’m not the coach. In Russia, I felt that the group is not the same that I knew and I regret not reacting before the match against Iran,” asserted Hadji. Subsequently, Hadji preferred to remain silent and act as an observer so as not to become “the disruptive element.” The former Moroccan player further commended Renard’s efforts with the national team. According to Hadji, Morocco’s long-awaited qualification to the World Cup 2018 in Russia is owed to Renard. “I will be faithful if he wants to continue the adventure. He made people vibrate. Thanks to him, we arrived at the World Cup after 20 years of absence. He also brought us many things. We found our stability and our identity in the game,” he continued. After reports emerged stating that Hadji receives a monthly wage of MAD 300,000, the assistant manager denied the rumor and declared that he earns much less than that. He did not disclose his salary.

Rabat – Nassar Taqatqa, 31, has died just weeks after his imprisonment, leaving his family members in utter shock.  Taqatqa was arrested on June 19 after Israeli forces raided his family residence in Beit Fajjar, a village in Bethlehem located south of the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian man was initially taken to the Jalameh interrogation center, where detainees have previously reported being subjected to physical and psychological abuse atthe hands of Israeli officials. According to the Palestinian Prisoners Center for Studies, two weeks later he was transferred to the Nitzan prison in al-Ramleh where he was placed in solitary confinement. “We were shocked to learn of his death this morning,” his cousin Mohammed Taqatqa told Al Jazeera on Tuesday, July 16. “We still haven’t received his body, but an autopsy will be conducted to find out the cause of death,” he added. Taqatqa’s family confirmed to the local media that Nassar did not suffer from any health problems. They also confirmed that this was the first time he had been arrested. Through tears, the mother of martyr Nassar Taqatqa expressed her devastation at the loss of her son to a local news outlet, saying that she wished she could die instead of Nassar. Described by his cousin as a “simple, honest man,” Taqatqa was one of six brothers and worked in a stone quarry.   Taqatqa was still undergoing interrogation and no official charges had been brought against him. A court date for the extension of his detention was set for Wednesday, July 17. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called for an international inquiry into Taqatqa’s death in a statement released on Tuesday, July 15. The Palestinian Prisoners Center for Studies also said in a statement Israel was responsible for the death. The Center accused the country’s officials of torture and medical negligence, bearing in mind that Taqatqa was not suffering from any diseases prior to his arrest.   Israeli officials have not yet released a statement on the case.  Qadri Abu Bakr, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Affairs Committee, told local media outlets that Israeli forces claimed that Taqatqa’s death resulted from a stroke.   “We will not accept the Israeli version of Taqatqa’s death,” Abu Bakr said. “We demand an autopsy to be carried out as soon as possible to determine exactly the cause of his death,” Abu Bakr said. Amina al-Taweel, a researcher at the Palestinian Prisoners Center for Studies, called Taqatqa’s death a “cold-blooded execution.” Al-Taweel further described the Nitzan detention center as “one of the worst prisons” in Israel. “It is known for its horrific conditions and cruel guards,” Al-Taweel told Al Jazeera. “During Taqatqa’s detention, he was not allowed access to his lawyer, family visits or any communication with others.” The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics says there have been approximately one million arrests made against Palestinians since 1948.   According to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoners’ rights group, there are currently 5,250 prisoners in Israeli jails, including 205 children and 44 women. Following Taqatqa’s death, Hassan Abedrabbo, a spokesman for the Palestinian Prisoners‘ Affairs Committee, told local media that Israeli forces had shut down all jails holding Palestinian prisoners. Prison authorities have also denied entry to lawyers and have cancelled prisoner transfers as well as court sessions for the day. Abedrabbo added that Israeli prisons were in a state of “tension and alertness” in fear of a Palestinian prisoners’ protest against Taqatqa’s death. “As soon as they heard the news of Taqatqa’s death, the prisoners have been banging on their cell doors, and have informed the prison administrations that they would not receive their meals,” the Palestinian Prisoner Society posted on Facebook.  The Palestinian Prisoners Center for Studies said Taqatqa’s death meant that the number of Palestinian prisoners who have died in Israeli prisons since 1967 has increased to 220.

Rabat – Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has hit back at the US President Donald Trump’s call for new nuclear negotiations which would include discussions on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme.   In an interview that aired on NBC news on Monday, July 15, Zarif accused Washington of bringing the already volatile Middle East region to the brink of “explosion” through arms selling to its Gulf allies.  “If you want to discuss ballistic missiles, then we need to discuss the weapons sold to our region,” Zarif said.   “These are American weaponry that is going into our region, making our region ready to explode. So, if they want to talk about our missiles, they need first to stop selling all these weapons including missiles to our region,” he added.   Last year, the United States withdrew from the 2015 landmark multilateral accord. The US wanted to negotiate a new deal to encompass Iran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region.  Zarif told NBC that it was the US and its allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who were responsible for the turmoil in the Middle East region due to selling arms  and proxy groups interests.  “Last year Iran spent $16 billion altogether on its military, we have an 82 million population. UAE, with a million population, spent $22 billion. Saudi Arabia – with less than half of [Iran’s] population – spent $67billion, most of them are American [arms],” Zarif said hinting that Tehran’s missile programme does not add up to the escalating tensions on the Gulf region. “Are we involved at all in North Africa? … Why do you have chaos in Libya? Is Iran involved in Libya? … in Sudan? … in Algeria? Why do we have all this turmoil? I believe if you want to look at the right place for those who have malign activity in our region, the US needs to look at its own allies, not at Iran,” he added. Zarif stressed that Iran would only proceed to negotiations with the United States if the US agreed to lift economic sanctions on Iran. Iran also requires the US to reaffirm its commitment to the 2015 accord. The Islamic Republic invested in its ballistic missiles and nuclear programmes for defense in the face of international sanctions. The country has been subject to a variety of sanctions since its founding in 1979.  “Once those sanctions are lifted, then … the door for negotiations is wide open,” Zarif said. “It is the United States that left the bargaining table. And they’re always welcome to return.” The new US sanctions have plunged the Iranian economy into crisis and caused a shortage in crucial medicines, putting the Iranian population under huge humanitarian pressure.  “They are terrorizing our people,” Zarif said. “They are targeting ordinary Iranian civilians. That’s worse than war.”

Rabat – UK newspaper the Guardian has unearthed deeply Islamophobic comments made in recent years by Boris Johnson. Conservative member of parliament Johnson is the frontrunner to replace Theresa May as Britain’s Prime Minister. While Islamophobia and anti-immigrant flavored claims are anything but alien to Johnson’s decidedly rightwing rhetoric, the latest comments delve much more profoundly into what Britain’s to-be-PM thinks of the wider Muslim world.  Johnson claims countries where Islam is the main religion have historically espoused “a fatal religious conservatism” that leaves little or no room for the kind of progress and prosperity witnessed in the West. The Guardian’s report found that the British politician claimed that Islam is the main explanatory factor of the Muslim’ world inferiority when compared to Roman—by extension Western—achievements. The comments were found in an essay included in “The Dream of Rome,” a book Johnson wrote in 2006 as he praised Roman history and civilization.  Islam inherently inhibits the path to the type of accomplishments that have made the West proud, one can read in the infamous essay. Johnson’s central point is that Islam is the single reason, and the most compelling case for why, in his opinion, the West has outpaced the Muslim world in many areas.  Or, as Johnson went on to postulate in an essay called “And then Came the Muslims,” which was added to the 2007 edition of his book, “There must be something about Islam that indeed helps to explain why there was no rise of the bourgeoisie, no liberal capitalism and therefore no spread of democracy in the Muslim world.” One unmistakable watershed moment in world history is the Romans’ success story, the essay argued. The Roman, or Byzantine, Empire epitomized the best the world could offer or be at that particular point in history, Johnson rhapsodized.   He presents the episode as a tale of unvarnished prosperity and a flourishing, with Romans charming the world with its arts and way of life, so making Istanbul an enlightened, revered city  with the empire making its impact felt throughout the world.  Under the Ottomans (who were Muslims), however, Istanbul was no longer the city it once was; it lost most of its cultural prestige and lagged behind in scientific progress and human ingenuity, according to his claims.  The explanation for so striking a contrast is self-evident as far as Johnson is concerned. “Something caused them to be literally centuries behind,” he wrote. That “something” was Islam, according to the British politician. Apparently aware of the backlash such views were set to trigger, Johnson tried at some point to find refuge in the fact that his great grandfather, Ali Kemal, was of Turkish origin and therefore Muslim. Instead of quickly painting him with the Islamophobia brush and dismissing his essay’s central premise, he seemed to offer, it would perhaps be better to look at the evidence without passion or emotion.  Once this is done, Johnson maintained, it would be easy enough to agree with historic figures like Winston Churchill about the fact that Islam is indeed the main problem with the Muslim world. (Churchill once said that there is “no stronger retrograde force” than Islam.) “It is time to get deep down and dirty and examine the central charge made by everyone from Winston Churchill to the Pope, namely that the real problem with the Islamic world is Islam,” the essay hammered. “We must be honest and accept that there is more than a grain of truth in Churchill’s analysis of the economic and social consequences of the religion.” The unearthing of these viciously Islamophobic ideas have—predictably—ignited debate in Britain over what Johnson’s premiership would mean for Britain’s Muslims.  The question, although differently phrased, has been about what the country’s Muslim citizens would make of a PM who seems to identify with forces (white-supremacy, for example) that contest their claim to equal humanity. In the heat of the Tory (conservative) leadership contest in what could be post-Brexit Britain, what, by extension, does it mean for the country to have a section of its parliament elect a PM who brazenly holds in contempt a religion practiced by a sizable portion of its populations? Tell Mama, a body that monitors anti-Muslim discourse and hatred in the UK, said that Johnson’s views show a deep lack of understanding of the religion in question.  “There are many Muslims whom Islam has inspired to produce some of the most beautiful art forms in their love for life and beauty. We hope Johnson works to support all communities in the future, and we are here to assist and support that,” the body pointed out.  The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), for its part, visibly dismayed by the blithe anti-Muslim rhetoric underpinning Johnson’s points, rhetorically queried whether the country’s sure-to-be-PM still holds these views. “Many of us would be interested to find out whether Mr. Johnson still believes that Islam inherently inhibits the path to progress and freedom.” It is unclear whether Johnson would be as brazen in his future public statements as Britain’s highest ranking politician.  However, there is a wealth of evidence suggesting that the controversial views may well be the cornerstone of Johnson’s political philosophy—at least on deeply divisive questions like the meaning of British identity or the role of religion in public. He is no stranger to such backlash, and his views have apparently not changed despite the constant scrutiny. While on a visit to Myanmar in September 2017, Johnson, who was then Britain’s Foreign Secretary, awkwardly and “inappropriately” recited “The Road to Mandalay,” a Rudyard Kipling poem suffused with nostalgia about Britain’s lost colonial empire.  “It was stunning he would do that there,” one official said at the time. The official highlighted that Johnson evinced “an incredible lack of understanding,” no less because the poem he viewed as “good stuff” carried a history of violence and national “humiliation and insult” within the Burmese national imaginary. Much more recently, in August of last year, Johnson ignited another media firestorm on British identity and Islam in a column where he likened women wearing the Burqa, a Muslim head covering which leaves only the eyes visible, to “letter boxes” and “bank robbers.” The column received a tide of backlash from the British political commentariat and policy circles. Some critics called Johnson out for the “ugly and naked Islamophobia” of his remarks.  Others, however, took a more cynical stance. Although they were outraged by the anti-Muslim undertone of the column, they resigned to the fact that the outrageous comments and the reactions that ensued were “all business as usual.” The suggestion, unmistakably, is that critics could whine and call out the outrage for what it is, but no substantive change would follow.

Rabat – The family of  Ahmed El Khalil, a former Polisario member who has been missing for a decade, announced their decision to stage a sit-in near the high commission of refugees in Rabouni near Tindouf, Algeria. The sit-in aims to condemn the forced disappearance of El Khalil and to put pressure on Polisario, as well as Algeria, to reveal his fate. El Khalil went missing10 years ago under unknown circumstances. Algerian intelligence services along with Polisario members kidnapped El Khalil in 2009, two months after the Polisario had appointed him to monitor human rights in Tindouf camps. The family of the kidnapped activist said they held a meeting on July 12 with Polisario “officials,” including the leader of the front, Ibrahim Ghali. In a statement, the family said that Ghali, who has promised to reveal the fate of their relative, refused to engage in a dialogue. “There are no updates regarding the case of El Khalil,” the family said. In February, Ghali vowed to finally share information with Ghali’s family regarding his disappearance. The promise came amid increasing pressure on the Algerian government and the Polisario Front from El Khali’s family and supporters. This is not the first time that the El Khali family and other human rights activists have called for El Khali’s release.  In February, Sahrawis took to the desert in Rabouni, where the Secretariat of the Polisario Front is located, to condemn his forced disappearance. Sahrawis have also launched an online campaign to draw attention to the kidnapping of the former Polisario member. Friends and relatives of the kidnapped member also threatened to organize demonstrations in European capitals if their demands are not met. The Polisario Front has long been linked to kidnapping accusations. Spanish news outlet El Confidencial reported in 2018 that Polisario members were involved in the kidnapping of Spanish citizens working in the Phosboucraa site, Laayoune, in 1974. The Polisario is also facing pressure following a series of arrests in a crackdown on human rights activists who have been protesting the violations in the Tindouf camps.

Rabat – In the past weeks, Moroccan Customs and Excise at the northern borders have seized several large sums of money from travelers attempting to illegally divert funds out of Morocco. The illegal diversion of funds out of the country negatively impacts Morocco’s economy, creating a deficiency in the country’s foreign currency stock. To control excess currency diversion, a specific annual allowance is allocated to each citizen. In January 2019, the Office of Exchange set the allowance at MAD 45,000 (nearly €4200) per year. The total amount of the allowance can not exceed MAD100,000 per person per year. Moroccan citizens can legally carry this sum outside Morocco after notifying the authorities. Any additional or undeclared sums are considered illegal. In practical terms, this means that both Moroccan and foreign citizens cannot carry more than the specified amount of MAD out of the country. It is also illegal to use international credit cards to withdraw excess sums abroad, or make bank transfers which exceed the prescribed amount.  In light of a noticeable rise in attempts to divert funds out of Morocco, state services are deploying every effort to fight against currency trafficking. The Ministry of Finance has issued a circular urging the Customs and Indirect Tax Administration to strengthen control mechanisms to prevent foreign currency trafficking. The circular also calls on customs officers to be more vigilant, encouraging them to carry out manual searches of travelers’ luggage in addition to checking with scanners. The circular requires customs officers to coordinate with the other security services. The ministry aims to fight against the increasing number of currency trafficking operations at the country’s borders. Within one week, police arrested 11 people involved in the illegal transfer of large sums of currency exceeding their annual allowance. Among them, a Moroccan national, residing in the Netherlands, was caught crossing the border in possession of nearly €12,000. Following the arrests, the customs officers wrote a seizure report pending the results of an investigation. Elements of the judicial police will conduct an in depth investigation into the case. Similar operations occurred earlier this year. On February 19, customs officers seized €149,570 during six distinct operations at Tanger-med port. In February 6, 2019, customs aborted two trafficking attempts of more than €168,000 in Tanger-med port.

Rabat – Nicknamed the child of Sous (a region in mid-southern Morocco), Jiyed Redouane was born and raised in Agadir. He learned about discipline and physical endurance from a very young age.  These traits paved the way for him to initiate his 26-year-old career. and become the most requested Moroccan international referee. He went on to whistle in decisive games and high-risk national matches such as the 2018 Moroccan Throne Cup. Read also: Tunisian TV Channel Claims CAF-Morocco Plotted Tunisia’s CAN 2019 Elimination At the age of 14, Jiyed started his journey to become the respected Moroccan international  referee he is today. He joined the regional Sous League Arbitration School at the beginning of the 1993-1994 season, where he had his introduction to his future career. Having received the proper training, Jiyed was admitted to the rank of league referees during the 1994-1995 season. Remarkably, he then managed to become an inter-league referee in the 1998-1999 season.  In 2002, at the age of 23, Jiyed officially became a federal referee, successfully officiating many games in Morocco.   At the age of 30, Jiyed was promoted to international referee. He quickly became respected and venerated within the sport’s community, through his firm and judicious decisions during several games. At that time, Jiyed was the youngest international referee Morocco had ever trained. Since then, he has had the opportunity to arbitrate in many championships and matches under the CAF, and to even participate in football games outside Morocco. Today, Jiyed has already refereed 96 matches; a number which highlights the football community’s trust in his managerial skills.  Besides his participation in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), Jiyed arbitrated in the 2017 African Nations Championship (CHAN), the 2015 U20 and U23 CAN and in 14 additional high-risk games during the African Champions League.  In the course of his career, Jiyed has won honors and titles which have made him a hero in his home town. Recently, he was awarded the title of best Moroccan referee of the year 2018-2019 by the Moroccan Union of professional footballers. Jiyed’s career path honors the memory of the respected referee Said Belqola, a Moroccan icon who had a significant impact on the history of African and international arbitration.  During the 2019 CAN, Jiyed refereed the Mali-Angola match and the Nigeria-South Africa quarter-final, alongside Lahcen Azgaou and Mustapha Akarkad. The trio of Moroccan referees gave a great performance at the CAN officiating the games in Egypt. Besides his laudable CAN performances, Jiyed’s participation in the Tunisia-Senegal semi-final gave rise to negative speculation from Tunisian media outlets.  On July 14, 2019, Jiyed became the first Moroccan referee to join a video referee team during the Tunisia-Senegal game and award a goal from the video assistant referee (VAR) view.  After Tunisia’s loss to Senegal, Tunisian media blamed Jiyed and the VAR referee for Tunisia’s elimination from the 2019 CAN. Tunisian sports commentators strongly criticized CAF for putting a Moroccan referee in the VAR room during the semi-final match, suggesting that it was a Moroccan-CAF plot against the Tunisian national team. In a Tunisian televised program called “CAN diary,” the commentators stirred rumors that the decision to prevent Tunisia from taking a penalty was an intentional move against the Tunisian football team. Tunisia expressed anger after the Ethiopian referee Bamlak Tessema Weysa decided to use VAR to double check his decision to award a penalty to Tunisia. After checking the VAR, the Ethiopian referee waved his arms to announce no penalty for the Tunisian team. After the decision was announced, commentators began to speculate that it was a hostile move from CAF and Morocco. “It should be noted that the referees of the VAR did not call the referee Bamlak to check the first, or the second penalty whistled respectively for Tunisia and for the opposing team,” said the Tunisian news outlet. Jiyed has not yet commented on the allegations from the Tunisian news outlet.

Rabat – After widespread complaints, local authorities have demanded that an unsightly cellular antenna in Fez be removed by the telecommunications company who installed it. The antenna, installed just this month, was ruining the beautiful view of the “Borj El Kawakib,” a site overlooking Fez’s medina. The historical site had just been renovated, to the cost of MAD 6 million. King Mohammed VI visited the site several times during renovation to personally oversee the works.  The antenna installation caused frustration among tourists and advocates for preserving the heritage of Fez. The complaints were so widespread that Mohamed Laarej, the Minister of Communication and Culture, went to see the antenna for himself on July 12.  Swift action was taken soon afterwards, with the antenna being removed by the telecommunications company responsible on Sunday, July 14. The removal came just two days after the minister’s visit. The quick removal of the antenna reflects the recent efforts of the Ministry of Culture, as well as other advocates, to preserve and restore Fez, often called “Morocco’s cultural capital,” to its full potential.  In March, Morocco’s Tourism Minister Mohamed Sajid announced plans to rebuild Fez’s image to increase tourism in 2019. Sajid’s plan is to “give back to the city its old attractiveness,” according to an official statement on March 3. In recent years, the city has seen a resurgence of government-funded reconstruction projects. Under King Mohammed VI, an initial MAD 583 million urbanization project was launched in 2018 to give the city a new and attractive look. The project included the renovation of dozens of historical monuments, street maintenance, improved or modernized urban planning, the construction of new parking spots with extended capacity, and reconstruction work in and around the medina.

Rabat – The Moroccan Treasury has released public finance figures for the month of June 2019. The figures show that Morocco’s budget deficit has increased to MAD 21.8 billion ($2.28 billion). Gross tax revenue rose 4.5% to MAD 110.8 billion in June, up from MAD 106 billion at the same time last year. The Treasury figures also show state spending stood at 182.5 billion in June 2019, up 15.4% since last year. The budget deficit would have been much greater had it not been for the government’s sale of 8% of its shares in the Moroccan telecommunication provider Maroc Telecom last month. The sale was the first step in the government’s plan to raise up to MAD 6 billion in privatisations, selling its assets to reduce the budget deficit. The government also plans to sell shares in “Energie Electrique de Tahaddard,” which runs a hydrothermal power plant, and the famous Mamounia Hotel in Marrakech (65% owned by the state railway operator ONCF). According to a press release by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) last week on Morocco’s 2019 economic situation, state spending in 2019 represented close to 25.9% of GDP, an increase from 25.2% of GDP in the previous year. According to the HCP, the budget deficit this year would therefore have increased by 4.5% in 2019, up from 3.7% in 2018, without including the privatisations taking place this year. Counting privatisation revenue, the deficit represents 3.6% of GDP, notes the HCP. HCP expects treasury debt to increase to 65.3% of GDP in 2019, up  from 64.9% in 2018. The HCP also predicts a slowdown in economic growth to 2.7% in 2019, down from 3% in 2018.

The number of prisoners who achieved “very good” (A grade), “good” (B grade), and “quite good” (C grade) reached 63 or 17.21% of the total of inmates who sat for the exam. The normal session of the Baccalaureate exams took place from June 11 to 14. Retake exams took place on July 4-8. In June, after the announcement of the normal session results, the ministry said that 212,169 Moroccan students passed the exam in the June session. The statistics represent a passing rate of 65.55%. The ministry said in a statement that the total number of female students who passed the exam was 121,673, representing 57.35 % of the overall number of successful candidates.

Rabat – On Saturday, July 13, General Khalifa Haftar’s forces announced that they will enter Al Karama Martyrs Square in the centre of Tripoli in a bid to take control of the Libyan capital.  Fighting in Tripoli has been ongoing since the Haftar-led, self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) launched an offensive on Western Libya on April 4th. The defending Government of National Accord (GNA) mobilized its security forces to combat the attack. Over 1000 people, including civilians, have been killed in the clashes.  Haftar’s announcement on Saturday marks the latest attempt by the LNA to seize control of the capital city, home to more than 1 million people. “The full liberation of the Libyan capital Tripoli is approaching.” LNA Brigadier General Saleh Buhliqa told Russian news outlet Sputnik.  Haftar said his push for control was a fight to defeat terrorists, whom he claimed had infiltrated the GNA.  Clashes have been ongoing since the first Libyan Civil war erupted eight years ago. In 2011, Muammar Gadaffi, who had ruled Libya for over four decades, was overthrown  during the Libyan revolution. In the absence of the leader, multiple parties fought to fill the power vacuum.  Established after the first Libyan Civil War and headed by General Haftar, the LNA has received support from the United Arab Emirates, as well as neighboring Egypt who has fought its own battles against Islamic extremism. Haftar served in the Libyan army under Gadaffi. After defecting from the military in the 1980s, Haftar lived in Virginia, eventually earning US citizenship. He returned to Libya in 2011 during the revolution.  When a coup ousted Gadaffi that same year, Haftar held a senior position in the armed forces that overthrew the Libyan leader. The GNA was formed in 2016. The interim government was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, who recognizes the GNA as the only legitimate executive authority in Libya. Despite the diplomatic and military support the opposition forces have received, backers of both the LAN and GNA have pressed both sides to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict. Last Saturday’s announcement made clear that, at least for now, Haftar favors a military solution. As the GNA and Haftar’s LNA continue their deadly battle for control, hundreds of civilian lives have been lost and tens of thousands more displaced. The same decade that witnessed Libya dissolve into civil war twice has also seen a massive migration crisis as millions of refugees from the Middle East and Africa fled violence, famine, and drought. Seeking better lives in Europe, many of these refugees followed a path of migration that took them through Libya in hopes of crossing the Mediterranean. Thousands of those caught attempting to migrate illegally are held in migrant detention centers in Libya. These centers have become increasingly dangerous as fighting has escalated in Libya.  On July 3, a pair of airstrikes hit a migrant detention center on the outskirts of Tripoli, killing 53 and injuring an additional 130 people. Haftar’s latest offensive could bring another wave of violence to the capitol, again leaving hundreds of civilians vulnerable. UNHCR special emissary Vincent Cochetel warned that those held at migrant detention centers remain in particular danger.  “These warehouses within military facilities are unsuitable to keep arbitrary human beings,” Cochetel said on Twitter. “Other tragedies can happen.”

Rabat – The High Authority for Audiovisual Communication (HACA) decided to suspend two shows broadcast by Radio Mars host, Adil El Omari, on July 11. “The Scientists of Mars” and “Sports Issues Through The Eyes of Moroccans Abroad,” will both be suspended for a period of 15 days. During “The Scientists of Mars” July 4 show, El Omari made sexist comments which have caused outrage on social networks.  Reading a message from a female listener expressing her opinion on the Atlas Lions’ participation in the African Cup of Nations (CAN), the host made sexist comments.  El Omari told the female football fan that she’d better “take care of her cooking, watch Choumicha’ s shows (famous Moroccan cooking show) and leave the national team alone.”  Radio Mars consequently issued a statement on July 5, announcing El Omari’s three-day suspension despite his official apology on air. On its official website, HACA announced that they had “received about 114 complaints about El Omari’s shows.” Of these  complaints, 22 were specifically filed after “The Scientists of Mars” July 4 show. The Higher Council for Audiovisual Communication (CSCA) held a meeting on July 11 to discuss the two Radio Mars shows following HACA’s complaints report.  After deliberation, the CSCA decided that Radio Mars violated the legal and regulatory provisions in force, in particular those relating to the fight against stereotyped negative images of women.  The CSCA considered the host’s statements to the female listener to be “an insult to her sense of belonging.”  According to the official decision, this is a matter of disrespect for human dignity, the fight against stereotypes which undermine the dignity of women, and the principle of non-incitement to violence or hatred. Radio Mars will also be obliged to broadcast CSCA’ s statement during the time usually allocated to the two shows hosted by El Omari. Both of the host’s radio shows on the station will be suspended for 15 days. The statement includes, among others, the following message: “such statements undermine the function of women and their social contributions and diminish their competencies. They also cancel their freedom and their right to express their opinion.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Metal, Mechanical, and Electromechanical Industry has suffered a 57% drop in industry investment since 2010.  According to the Federation of Metal, Mechanical, and Electromechanical Industry, trade protection measures in favor of Maghreb Steel are the issue. Investment in the metal sector has dropped 57% since 2010, from MAD 3.5 billion to MAD 1.5 billion in 2016, reported the Moroccan Federation of Metal, Mechanical and Electromechanical Industry (FIMME) at a conference in Casablanca last week. According to Chafiq Essakalli, the director of Moroccan metal company Chantiers &amp; Ateliers du Maroc, the problem comes from the trade protection measures in favor of Maghreb Steel, Morocco’s only flat steel supplier, which negatively impact local industry competitiveness. His views echo a previous FIMME statement. Maghreb Steel produces sheet metal in Tit Mellil east of Casablanca and has benefited from trade protection measures for five years. For Essakali, the state protection measures in favor of Maghreb Steel increase raw material costs. Faced with more expensive local products, public infrastructure project developers like the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), the national electricity body ONEE, and the National Port Agence (ANP) prefer to turn to cheaper overseas suppliers. “Preference towards national industry presupposes competitiveness. It makes no sense to ask someone to buy something at a more expensive price, when they can buy it elsewhere for cheaper,” Essakalli notes. “Our product needs to be competitive before we can require public infrastructure developers to choose local industry. But we can’t be competitive if, because of the Maghreb Steel trade protection measures, we are required to buy raw materials at a higher price than the international market price,” he explained at the conference, reports Moroccan news source Media24. On 24 May, the Ministry of Industry launched an inquiry into a request by Maghreb Steel for further trade protection measures. On July 4, the FIMME officially opposed the decision. In a letter to the Minister, the FIMME reminded that the measures impact the competitiveness of the industry, risking “serious consequences.” At the conference last week, a Moroccan tube producer explained the impacts of the measures: “I buy steel for MAD 15 from Maghreb Steel, but the tube that is my finished product comes from Turkey for MAD 9. If it goes on like this I will have to close down.” For Hatim Senhaji, the director of Maghreb Steel, removing trade protection would kill Maghreb Steel. The solution is to impose trade protection measures on finished products, as well as the sheet steel.  A move which FIMME sees as unrealistic. “It is impossible to protect the finished product market, for the simple reason that the range of products is infinite. […] The only solution is to be competitive,” explains Tarik Aitri, the president of FIMME. “We have to try before we say it is impossible,” says Senhaji.

Rabat –  Portuguese Defense Minister, João Gomes Cravinho, received his Moroccan counterpart, Abdellatif Loudyi, at the Fort of São Julião da Barra in Lisbon on July 12. During his visit to Portugal, Loudyi, Minister Responsible for the Administration of National Defense, also visited the naval base of Lisbon and its famous shipyard, the Arsenal of Alfeite. Following his talks with Loudyi, Cravinho said that they “discussed the possibility of strengthening the cooperation between the two navies and also the maintenance of the Arsenal de Alfeite.”  “We are going to work with Morocco in developing its submarine capacity and, therefore, the Arsenal de Alfeite was part of this conversation,” he added.  The Portuguese minister, also pointed out that “the two countries have long shared good relations and the Government expects further cooperation.” Cravinho explained that Portugal and Morocco share a “very wide maritime border” and “similar concerns regarding the Atlantic.” As a result, this cooperation will benefit both countries. Concerning Europe-Africa relations, the minister said that Morocco represents a significant ally in controlling migration flows and fighting against terrorism. Thus, the main geo-strategic challenges of Portugal “are important challenges for Morocco and vice versa,” Cravinho added. Portugal will therefore receive Moroccan Navy officers on board its own submarines during exercises for training purposes. The Portuguese Defense Minister even disclosed that “Morocco is in the process of procuring submarines and therefore needs to have knowledge about how the navies and submarines of neighboring countries and friends operate.” The Morocco-Portugal collaboration comes at the same time as Morocco’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its navy through both equipment (frigate Fremm) and infrastructure (naval base Ksar Sghir).

Rabat – Two Barbary lion cubs were shown to the public for the first time last week at a zoo in the Czech Republic. The pair, one male and one female, were born on May 10 in the Dvur Kralove zoo west of Prague. Barbary lions, sometimes called Atlas lions, are the largest lion subspecies, famous for their larger, darker manes. The Barbary lion once roamed across North Africa, from the Atlas mountains in Morocco to Egypt. Rock carving sites across Morocco show carvings of the lion species, alongside carvings of elephants and other animals long extinct from the region. The Barbary lions were kept by the royal families of Morocco and other African nations, and battled in the famous gladiator tournaments in the Coliseum, finds research published by the Scientific American magazine.  The last recorded wild Barbary lion in Morocco was likely shot in the 1940s, and the last wild sighting of the animal was in Algeria in the late 1950s, the research adds.  The only Barbary lions still alive are found in zoos across the world, including at the Rabat National Zoo in Morocco. The Moroccan national soccer team is nicknamed “Atlas Lions.”

On July 14, amid heightened security, the 35-year-old main suspect in the rape and murder of the 10-year-old Reda in Meknes reconstructed the scene of his crime. The child was found dead and abandoned in a building near Sahrij Swani in Meknes on July 11. Police who found the victim’s body reported that he had been choked with an electric cable. His body showed signs of sexual and physical violence. The main suspect, known as “Biour”, has a criminal record. The suspect’s record includes premeditated murder as well as physical and sexual assaults. According to a Youtube video of the crime scene reconstruction, “Biour” lured the victim to the door of the abandoned building. He then forcibly pushed the victim inside by choking him as he resisted. Once inside the building, “Biour” tied his victim’s hands and raped him alternately with another suspect, known as “Haska.” The latter is still subject to a search warrant. Afterwards, “Biour” hit the child’s head three times using a wooden stick, followed by “Haska” who did the same with a stone. At the end, “Biour” tied his victim’s neck to the iron bars of a window using an electric cable ensuring the death of the child. The third suspect, referred to as “Ramjani,” is a 17-year-old minor. While “Biour” spontaneously told the crime’s details, in the video, “Ramjani” appeared reluctant. In the crime scene footage, “Ramjani,” standing at the door of the building, said that he had fled the scene before the victim was killed.   “Ramjani” stated that he had discovered the body of the deceased after he tried to discover what was happening in the building. He then admitted that he had found the first two suspects raping the child and “could not run to inform the police.”  “I feared they would do the same to me; I did not do it, they forced me to rape him too,” he added. The Public Prosecutor’s Office in the court of appeal in Meknes ordered the detention of both of the accused in “Toulal” prison pending trial.

Rabat – Maha Tazi, Moroccan researcher and professor at Concordia University in Montreal,  has condemned the behaviour of Air Arabia Maroc ground crew members at Barcelona Airport, Spain. Tazi told Morocco World News that she was “verbally and physically assaulted” at the Barcelona El Prat Airport (BCN) when attempting to get onboard her scheduled flight to Casablanca. The Moroccan researcher said that she was assaulted due to a small excess of weight in her suitcase. She said that she was trying to reduce the weight by moving some items to her hand luggage. The researcher said that a member of the Air Arabia ground crew verbally assaulted and harassed her while she tried to remove the extra kilograms from her luggage at the check in desk.  “When I told her that it was not the right way to talk to customers, she told me to go file a complaint and not to bother her,” Tazi told MWN. Tazi said that two fellow passengers, who had witnessed the exchange, also suggested that she should file a complaint, saying that the Air Arabia crew member had no right to speak to her in such an aggressive way.  “They accompanied me to file the complaint upstairs, where the crew member was present.” The crew member saw Tazi attempt to file a complaint with her colleague. Tazi said that the Moroccan crew member who assaulted her spoke fluent Spanish. When the researcher tried to get onboard, the crew member prevented her from getting into the plane and took her passport by force. “I told her that she did not have the right to take my passport as she is not a security member. She refused to hand me back my passport and she ripped off my boarding pass,” said Tazi. Tazi said that another  Spanish crew member intervened and told her: “We will send you to your f****ing country.” The researcher also shared with Morocco World News photos of her hands covered in  scratches. The crew member allegedly caused the marks while Tazi attempted to retrieve her passport. The researcher condemned Air Arabia’s response, as she was stuck in the airport with no one to assist her.  She told MWN that she received a message from Air Arabia to inform her that they will offer her a flight in 48 hours. Tazi told MWN“If a friend that I know here did not offer help, I would have been left alone in the streets,”she said.

Rabat – The saga of the scandalous ES Tunis vs. Wydad of Casablanca match is still ongoing, undimmed, and fueling debates in international football’s highest body of controversy arbitration. But a final, irrevocable decision could be arrived by the end of this month. In an official statement shared over the weekend, on July 13, the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), the independent body tasked with resolving sports-related controversies, conflicts other specialized bodies failed to settle, announced that it would deliver a verdict on the EST-Wydad wrangle by July 31.  The background: Mutual accusations of manipulations CAS’s statement comes amid heightened hostility and a climate of mutual distrust between Wydad and EST executive boards. Both clubs have accused the other of having skewed African club football in their favor in recent years. The divergence between the two clubs started in late May, when the two played the final of the African Champions League over a two-legged confrontation.  During the first leg in Rabat, the match ended in a 1-1 draw. But the refereeing seemed blissfully unaware of regulations when they did not favor the Tunisian side.  On that occasion, both the Moroccan and Tunisian media spoke of “unfair,” “biased,” and “scandalous” refereeing that ended up “robbing” the Moroccans of a victory they roundly deserved. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) later punished Gehad Grisha, the Egyptian referee of the first leg. But the 1-1 result stood. The second leg, which was played a week after the first at the Rades Stadium, in the outskirts of Tunis, was just as shrouded in controversy.  In that match, ES Tunis was more dominant and more present in the first minutes; the Tunisian club scored before the end of the first half. But Wydad, who had become more spirited after the match resumed, overwhelmed their Tunisian hosts in the second half, scoring an equalizer at the 57th minute.  Bakary Gassama, the game’s Gambian referee, wrongly ruled out the goal, however.  Gassama decided the Wydad player was offside. After minutes of heated discussion, with Wydad players insisting that the referee checked VAR, the video system referees now rely on for clarification when dealing with delicate decisions, the Gambian official decided to end the match. CAF then decided to declare EST as the winners, arguing that Wydad players refused to resume the game after the referee rejected their call for consulting VAR. But Wydad contested CAF’s decision.  The president of the Moroccan club argued immediately after the fiasco that his club never refused to resume the match. Instead, he explained, everything had been set up, manipulated by the Tunisian club for the game’s result to be of their liking. He called the event a “disgrace” and an “insult” to African football, emphasizing the fact that VAR was defective and no one knew except EST staff and players.  Meeting on June 5 in Paris in the heat of the controversy, CAF’s disciplinary body overruled the earlier decision that EST were the winners of the match.  The meeting ruled instead that the match be replayed at the end of the now ongoing African Cup of Nations. To avoid a repeat of the controversy-drenched experiences over both legs, CAF said the rematch would be played a “neutral pitch.”  No one is happy with the rematch option From the legal battle going on between the two clubs, however, it appears none of them is particularly content with CAF’s ruling of a rematch. EST argues that CAF’ calling to annul an already sealed match is unprecedented in football and against the game’s spirit. Once a game’s winner is decided, there is no going back, no matter the dubious circumstances that may have led to the win, the Tunisian side appears to have claimed in defense of its position, according to CAS’ statement.  There are also claims about the Tunisian club challenging CAF’s decision as “biased” and “manipulated” to suit the interests of a Moroccan club.  Ahmad Ahmad, the CAF president, is a self-declared “lover” of Morocco, in recognition of what the kingdom has done over the years for the advancement of African football.  As a result, EST’s CAS file is believed to have channeled Ahmad’s close relationship with Morocco, presenting the closeness between Ahmad and Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation, as one solid reason why an organization led by the former would bend the rules in favor of the latter’s country. For its part, Wydad is building its cause on the “scandalous” defection of the VAR system on match day.  An important note is that CAF’s decision to overrule its earliest call in favor of EST was arrived at after “concordant evidence” showed that the Tunisian club may have knowingly left VAR unattended to hours before the game against Wydad.  In addition to this, reports that Wydad officials and players did not know about VAR not being operational later buttressed suspicions that the Tunisian club “deliberately” created the VAR incident and hoped the confusion would benefit them. In its appeal to CAS, Wydad’s executive board essentially put its fingers on this hot-button issue of EST “deliberately tricking” the VAR system. Wydad insisted such a “trick” was in flying defiance of the game’s founding “fair play” rules.  Because of this, Wydad’s appeal maintained, the rematch decision should be overruled for the Casablanca club to be declared the “rightful winners” of this year’s African champions League.  CAS says it has “taken note” of both side’s complaints and body of evidence and that its final verdict will be made public by the end of this month, by July 31. But with politics having largely entered the scene, and polarization having reached a level so deep that the tug-of-war between two football clubs has widely been interpreted as a battle for national honor, it is to be seen whether CAS’s verdict will appease both sides’ burning desire for revenge.

Rabat – Activists in Tindouf camps are accusing the Polisario Front of committing “serious human rights violations” in the Edhebia prison.  Quoted by pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara, an opposition  activist told his family that the front committed serious violations against him and two other activists. The front arrested the three activists  in a crackdown amid protests to condemn human rights violations in the camps. The activist told  his family that he spent 36 hours in a secret prison before the Polisario transferred him to a prison in Rabouni. “We were taken to a prison in one of the centers of gendarmeries in Rabouni, where we spent  nine days.” The Sahrawi activist added that the Polisario “authorities” used a blindfold while they were interrogating the three activists. “When we were in the national gendarmerie center.. I was blindfolded and one of my hands was tied to a chair, while the other hand was forcibly put on a table. Later,  the doctor, we are not even sure f [he] was really a doctor or a member of the ‘national gendarmerie’ put a syringe in my fingers. I do not know whether it was to measure diabetes blood sugar or  if it was an unknown injection. I did not have the right to know the nature of this injection or its causes,” the activist said. The activists spoke to other prisoners being held with them. The other prisoners told them that they had never been given injections. The activist said that, after nine days of incarceration, the Polisario took them to the “public prosecutor” to give a statement.. “We were then transferred to the Edhabia prison,” he said. The activist described the conditions of detention in the Edhabia prison as “miserable.” He said that in the Edahbia prison they were not blindfolded but “were placed in solitary cells.” The activist added that the “public prosecutor” told his lawyer not to ask what happened to them before the transfer to the Edhaibia prison. The Polisario  then moved the activists out of solitary confinement. During the hearing with the “public prosecutor” they were told that they had the right to visits. . “Visits are allowed only for 5 to 10 minutes although the prosecutor said that the visit duration is at least an hour,” said the activist. “We were investigated under an atmosphere of intimidation and threats,” the activist added. This is not the first time that the Polisario has faced such accusations. In June, the Polisario Front arrested Sahrawi journalist and activist Moulay Aba Buzid during a solidarity demonstration. Meanwhile, the family of Ahmed El Khalil, a Polisario member who went missing for more than 10 years ago, are still urging the front to reveal his fate. In February, Sahrawis took to the desert in Rabouni, the location of the Secretariat of the Polisario Front, to condemn the disappearance. These human rights violations are taking place amid a deafening silence from the United Nations and human rights watch dogs, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

Rabat – Saad Eddine El Othmani, Morocco’s Head of Government has added fuel to the idea that despite the episodic disagreements and an emotionally charged history, the French and Moroccan people have kept “special bonds” of friendship. Speaking on Sunday in Rabat at en event to commemorate the 14th of July, El Othmani said that France and Morocco have weathered trying times to remain exemplary, “exceptional” friends. The 14th of July is France’s closest equivalent of Independence Day. It marks the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison, a decisive moment in the 1789 French Revolution To add weight to his idea of France and Morocco sharing a “special, singular” type of friendship, El Othmani pointed to the two countries’ always being supportive of each other’s agenda on issues of “particular importance” for their “national causes.” (On the international stage, France is one of the strongest, foremost advocates of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara, a proposal Paris has repeatedly described as credible and politically feasible.) El Othmani’s point, however, went beyond the political dimensions of the Franco-Moroccan friendship.  In his July 14th speech, the Moroccan minister pointed particularly to the human, cultural, and economic side of the “exceptional relationship” the two nations have maintained over the years. El Othmani’s enthusiasm about the “exceptional” friendship also comes 20 years after France allowed a large contingent of 360 elements of the Moroccan Royal Guards to march on the iconic Champs Elysée Avenue.  Clothed in colors echoing the French flag and intoning songs drenched in the “Franco-Moroccan spirit,” the 360 royal guards added a Moroccan flavor to the march of their French counterparts on the occasion. That day, Morocco’s late King Hassan II, who was a connoisseur of French history, and called by the French government “a good friend of France,” attended the festivities as the “distinguished guest of honor.” Parenthetically referencing that singular episode in the history of the Franco-Moroccan relationship, El Othmani stressed that on the human and cultural level, France and Morocco share profound, deeply-rooted values that the two countries’ political direction can only sustain and nourish. El Othmani’s statements come at a fragile time for France’s reputation in its former colonies, however. France’s relations with its former colonies have been shrouded in suspicion of exploitation and neo-colonialism.  Many critics are saying that France’s continued relevance as “a great nation” or a world power has only been possible because of the European country’s continued colonization of territories formerly under its rule.  But still, the Moroccan head of government seemed to propose, a new type of friendship is possible between the two old, “special” friends. This would be a friendship that recommits to the same values underpinning it now, but also one in which minor changes would be made to tune with each government’s priorities. El Othmani’s enthusiasm about Franco-Moroccan relations has precedence in French policy circles. Recently speaking after reports that Morocco is the second country in the world to receive the highest number of visas from France, Jean Yves- Le Drian, France’s Foreign Affairs Minister, said that the high number of Moroccans residing in France and the equally big number of French visas delivered to Moroccans yearly are illustrative of the historical and cultural ties that bind the two nations.  “We have a will to continue together in a real partnership,” said the French diplomat, citing France’s contribution to the realization of Morocco’s high-speed train project as a further vindication of the strong friendship. Morocco’s King Mohammed VI shares both El Othmani’s and Le Drian’s enthusiasm about the “exceptional” Franco-Moroccan relationship.  In April of this year, as France and the world mourned Paris’ emblematic Notre Dame cathedral, the Moroccan King was among the first world leaders to join France in mourning a tragedy he said “affected the lives of millions of worshippers.” In the ensuing days, King Mohammed VI instructed the Moroccan government to send in an important financial contribution to the Notre Dame reconstruction efforts. Most importantly, perhaps, the King also shared his thoughts on the July 14th commemorations over the weekend, congratulating President Emanuel Macron on the historic occasion.  After evoking the historical significance of the event, the Moroccan King went on to point to the deep-seated, historical bonds. He enthused about the “undoubtedly exceptional Franco-Moroccan partnership.” As both the French and Moroccan government strive to meet their peoples’ expectations and rise to global challenges like sustainable development, the king stressed, the two country’s “bilateral relations ought to reaffirm the singularity of our friendship.”

Rabat – On Friday, July 12, two British women were removed by police from a Thomas Cook flight from Turkey to London’s Gatwick Airport after they had a racist meltdown. The two women were objecting to three Muslim men wearing traditional white robes being on board. The women called the Muslim passengers “terrorists“, “disgusting,” and a “threat” to the plane, according to other passengers. One passenger, Mario Van Poppel, said all the passengers were “united in anger against this crazy racist woman.” a passenger on our Thomas Cook flight #MT105 from Dalaman to Gatwick refuses to board the plane because three bearded men in white prayer robes are on board. All passengers are united in anger against this crazy #racist woman. It’s 2am #fedup — Mario Van Poppel (@poppelmario) 11 juillet 2019 
“What she was saying was appalling. She was screaming saying they were a ‘threat.’ Kids were crying. An elderly woman behind me was reduced to tears. The Muslim men were offended but they kept their cool,” Van Poppel later said.  Another passenger, Shanea Kerry, said when she leapt to the defense of the three men, the woman called her “a fat bitch.” *THREAD*
So today my flight was delayed 2/3 hours cause 2 racist white women refused to fly with 3 Asian Muslim men. When confronted for their disgusting behaviour 1 went on to scream abuse &amp; call me a ‘fat bitch’ a thread&amp;footage is coming
twitter get ready to do your thing🤬 — YT : SHANEA KERRY 🎥 (@shaneakerry) 12 juillet 2019 
“I called her out for her racism &amp; highlighted her stupidity in flying to a country rooted in Islamic values then discriminating against Muslims. She then responded with verbal abuse? calling me a ‘fat bitch‘ as mentioned above,” Kerry said on Twitter. Kerry also complained of Thomas Cook’s handling of the situation, saying the three men who were subjected to racial abuse were not given enough support by the airline. once they left the plane or were apparently removed, @TCAirlinesUK apologised only for the delay of the flight &amp; the ‘ scene ‘ &amp; failed to apologise to the victims of the racist abuse. — YT : SHANEA KERRY 🎥 (@shaneakerry) 12 juillet 2019  I don’t believe there was any support offered to the distressed victims of her racist abuse or any sanctions given to her. One air hostess was even laughing &amp; joking about the situation. — YT : SHANEA KERRY 🎥 (@shaneakerry) 12 juillet 2019 
The plane was reportedly delayed for 70 minutes before the women were escorted off the plane. The moment was captured on film by a passenger, who uploaded it to YouTube.  The video shows one of the women removing her bags from overhead lockers while swearing and calling staff “disgusting,” before being taken off the plane by Turkish police. In a statement to British paper the Daily Mirror, a Thomas Cook spokesperson said: “Two passengers on flight MT105 from Dalaman to London Gatwick were removed from the aircraft by police following offensive behavior onboard.” “The safety of our customers and crew is always our first priority and we do not accept this kind of behavior on our aircraft. We are sorry to our customers for the delay this caused to their flight,” the statement added.

Rabat – Moroccan and Algerian internet users have launched a social media campaign to demand the reopening of the Moroccan-Algerian border. الحمد لله على نعم الله لم تعد هناك خلافات و نزاعات زرعها المستبدون الفاسدون بين الشعب المغربي و الجزائري الكل اليوم في المغرب يفرح لحراك الجزائريين و منتخب محاربي الصحراء اليوم الكل ينادي بفتح الحدود اليوم الكل ينادي خاوة خاوة خاوة 🇩🇿🇲🇦❤❤❤ — Faridkaddouri (@Faridkaddouri3) July 12, 2019  The move is not unprecedented, citizens from both countries have launched previous unsuccessful campaigns to reopen the border. The Morocco-Algeria border has been  closed since 1994. The new campaign emerged after a video showing Moroccans and Algerians celebrating together went viral on social media. من المفروض ان تكون من بين ثمار الحراك الجزائري تحسين العلاقات مع المغرب. فتح الحدود و تطوير العلاقات الاقتصادية و السياسية اصبحت ضرورة ملحة في أفق تفعيل المغرب العربي. الصور الصادقة للمغاربة و الجزائريين على الحدود لتبادل التحايا و للأحتفال بتأهل المنتخب هي صور مؤثرة. — DAKIR (@DAKIR9) July 12, 2019  The video shows  many Moroccans expressing joy and pride over Algeria’s victory against the Ivory Coast in the semi finals of the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) on July 11. The video emphasized the respect and love that Moroccan and Algerian citizens share for each other, despite political tensions. Two Algerian citizens defied authorities and climbed the border fence to join the Moroccan supporters celebrating Algeria’s victory. الفديو لجزائري يخترق الحدود المغربية تعبيرا عن فرحته بفوز منتخب الجزائري.   لماذا لم يتم فتح الحدود البرية #بين_المغرب_والجزائر https://t.co/bwWt5SYX7i — mohmed aksasse (@MAksasse) July 12, 2019   Internet users also launched the #khawa_khawa (brothers_brothers) on social media, emphasizing that Morocco and Algeria have a shared history and a close relationship.. The campaign also reflects the fact that many Moroccans and Algerians have shared heritage;  Atlas Lions’ captain Mehdi Benatia’s mother is Algerian, while Mahrez, the star of Algeria’s Desert Warriors, has a Moroccan grandmother. Moroccan supporters could be seen jumping for joy in cafes all over the country when Algeria qualified for the final, after a deserved victory against Nigeria on Sunday, July 15. Despite the close bonds between Moroccan and Algerian citizens, the two countries have been at political loggerheads for decades. Algeria closed the border with Morocco in 1994 after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens. Rabat’s decision came following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Tension between Morocco and Algeria dates back to 1963, when they fought the Sand War over the border near Figuig in eastern Morocco. The war ended a year later when the US, the African Union, and the Arab League mediated the conflict. Algeria also financially supports the Polisario Front and its “independence” claims. Backing the Polisario Front is a provocative move, directly questioning Morocco’s territorial integrity. Despite the decades-long conflict, Morocco extended its hand to break the stalemate. King Mohammed VI proposed a mechanism of dialogue and consultation to promote warmer relations between the two countries. Algeria, however, turned a deaf ear.

Rabat – The report also shows that 31% of public service users have paid a bribe, while 74 % think the government is doing a bad job of tackling corruption.  The survey reveals, however, that 49 % think that ordinary citizens can make a difference in the fight against corruption. The survey, which is the largest and the most detailed in the world, covered 47,000 African citizens from 35 different African countries, including 1,200 Moroccans. The intent was to highlight the attitudes and experiences of bribery and corruption in their countries.  The report indicates that Moroccans think bribery is most prevalent among members of Parliament with 41% saying that MPs receive bribes. MPs were closely followed by the Prime Minister at 39 %, Local government officials at 38%, and Government officials at 37%.   Outside politics, 28% said that Business Executives receive bribes, judges and traditional leaders came in at 26%, police at 24%,  and Government Organizations 22%. Religious leaders had the lowest rate at only 11%. In terms of Public service users, 32 % have paid a bribe to the health service, and  31 % to police,  while the lowest percentage was recorded in Public schools ( 6%).  The highest rates of bribery in the African continent were recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (80%), followed by Liberia (53%), and Sierra Leone (52%). The lowest rates were recorded in Mauritius (5%), Botswana (7%) and Cape Verde (8%)  Even though 49% think that ordinary people can make a difference in fighting it, the report’s key findings indicate that corruption in Africa is on the rise. The statistics through the integrity of public officials into doubt, despite government efforts to change the trend.

Rabat – Ismaila N’Diaye, a 32-year-old former Amazon customer service employee has come forward with his horror story of working with the e-commerce giant. The former employee worked at the company’s facility in Rabat, Morocco, known as RAB1, Amazon centers all its French-language customer service centers in the Maghreb, in Rabat, as well as Tunis, Dakar, and in Madagascar.  The wage for a starting customer service employee at RBA1 where N’Diaye worked,  is approximately €500 a month, or roughly 40% of France’s minimum wage. The center employs almost 600 people.  N’Diaye told the British socialist group, International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI), that when he began working at Amazon’s Rabat call center in 2015, he was given extreme quotas to meet and allowed almost no breaks. While the official staff quota was to speak to five customers an hour, “in practice they are pushing the employees to go up to 100 per day because there is not enough staff,” N’Diaye said.   If the excessively high quota is not met, managers would harass employees, he added. He quoted his supervisors, as saying “your customer satisfaction is down. The number of emails is too low.”  To meet these grueling targets, staff reportedly spend 8 to 10 hours on the phone and are not allowed bathroom breaks without permission, which is sometimes denied.  “If you want to go to the toilet you have to write a message to a ‘Real Time Analyst,’ who will come to your desk, and often say they won’t respond to the request,”  he said. “It was just exploitation,” N’Diaye said. “Pure exploitation.” When N’Diaye eventually decided to lodge a complaint with HR after seeing the awful conditions employees were subjected to, it backfired on him and his wife, who also worked at the center.   “I told HR that the employees are suffering,” he said. “That’s when my problems began. The managers did everything to make work a nightmare for me and my wife.” The managers reportedly piled work on the pair, even more than the other employees, causing extreme stress. It was amid this ordeal, in June 2018, that N’Diaye’s wife, Khoukoud, found out she was pregnant. Even though the company was made aware of the pregnancy, managers continued to ramp up pressure on Khoukoud.   They continued asking her to do more, to reply to more emails than before,”  explained. “She was not eating correctly and had low energy.”  His wife told the manager that she had always exceeded Amazon’s quota, but now that she is pregnant, the workload was simply too much. “The manager did not listen. Every day he put pressure on her. He took her into a separate room to inquire about her results. Once it was to inform her that on a 15-minute break, she had taken 16 minutes,” N’Diaye continued.  It was that point of extreme stress, in August 2018, that Khoukoud’s pregnancy began to have complications. While the couple was entitled to medical and financial help from Amazon, the company reportedly did nothing.   If Amazon’s medical team had recommended a hospital visit, the health insurance would have covered all fees. Instead, she didn’t even get time off from work, where the pressure was continuing to increase. “We had the right to be recommended to a clinic, to have a doctor see the wife, check the baby, and get the medicine she needed. They left us totally on our own. They put pressure on her. It was retaliation against anyone who protests. They don’t want you to talk, just to do what they say.” That same month, the couple lost their child to a miscarriage, due to the stress the expecting mother was under. After Khoukoud had to undergo surgery following the miscarriage, she only received 30 days leave from Amazon. Still reeling from their miscarriage, their alleged mistreatment from the e-commerce giant wasn’t over. On August 21, while his wife was still on her short medical leave, N’Diaye suffered an injury himself, making him unable to work. “I had had an allergic burn reaction to skin treatment. We were completely collapsed. We were stressed and at home,” he said. “A doctor from the company came to our door from Amazon—not to check on us, but to try to catch me and make sure I was really sick enough to be at home.” Not only does N’Diaye allege he did not receive the sick pay he was owed, but he wasn’t paid for his hours from August 1-21, when he was working as normal amid his family crisis. “I was told that if an employee misses 10 days a month, they receive no salary or benefit at all. I said, ‘What is that law?’ It is slavery. I had never heard anything about it before.” “But since there is no law in Morocco, that’s why Amazon goes to invest there,” he said. “That’s why they’re there, in Tunis, in Senegal. They want to exploit more people, use more people, and kill more.” It was then in September 2018 that N’Diaye was fired, for supposedly not meeting his quotas. He then unsuccessfully appealed his against his termination to Amazon’s ethics board and to the Moroccan state’s work inspection board. “They’re actually together,” he said. “When I went to the government work inspection, there was an Amazon representative in the office as I arrived.” In a dire situation, with rising medical bills and his salary from Amazon still unpaid, the couple declared bankruptcy and moved to Istanbul in January to escape their financial woes.  “If we return we will be arrested at the airport because we cannot pay our mortgage. Amazon has made a fugitive of me in Morocco,” said N’Diaye. “We have to make sure that what happened to me doesn’t continue to others,” N’Diaye said, explaining why he felt the need to share his story. “Amazon killed my child. It must be stopped.” “Amazon is a murderer,” he reiterated. “It is a danger to the people. It must be stopped. They are killing people’s babies. They are making people mentally ill. They are making us homeless. Then they kick them out after exploiting them for years.” “Jeff Bezos (Amazon’s CEO) gets $30,000 in 10 seconds. An employee cannot get that even in one year. We are told about Amazon’s progress. But it is not robots or Jeff Bezos doing that. It’s humans—workers.” “It’s not Jeff Bezos answering the phone, responding to customers, selecting packages. The employees go through all this while he gets richer and richer. Jeff Bezos is a murderer standing on the bones of children.” N’Diaye finished his statement to ICFI by saying his hopes his story leads to change and actions against Amazon. N’Diaye isn’t alone in his experience with Amazon, which employs more than 600,000 people worldwide. Employees in the US, Spain, and Germany, among other countries, have all staged strikes to protest unfair working conditions. Similar to N’Diaye, these workers complain of long, backbreaking hours, and being fired for taking toilet breaks. Just like N’Diaye’s wife, workers also say their health concerns are ignored. Today, Monday, July 15, Amazon employees all around the US are staging walk-outs while demanding better conditions. In correlation with the strike, activists are delivering petitions to Jeff Bezos’ $80-million-dollar New York residence to demand better treatment of employees. Amazon is worth $790 billion, and Bezos was recently named the world’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $165 billion.

Rabat – The European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers warned that the landmark pact could collapse amid the US Iranian tensions. The group of states also called for the reopening of dialogue between Washington and Tehran in a joint statement released on Sunday, July 14. Britain, Germany, and France, who signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) four years ago in Vienna, stated that it could fall apart after the renewed sanctions on Iran by the United States.  “The risks are such that it is necessary for all stakeholders to pause, and consider the possible consequences of their actions,” the joint statement released by the French president’s office said. “We believe that the time has come to act responsibly and to look for ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue.” The 2015 accord promised sanctions relief, economic benefits, and an end to the international isolation of the Islamic Republic in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme. But after the US withdrawal, the deal became fragile and the parties’ commitment uncertain Tensions rose between Washington and Iran when the US President Donald Trump pulled out from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on Iran’s crucial banking and oil sectors, that had been previously lifted under the pact, causing the country’s economy to freefall. In response, Tehran announced in May 2019 that it would curtail its commitments to the deal, despite calls from the European parties to continue its full compliance.  Since then, the Gulf country has increased its stockpile of low-enriched uranium above the agreed limit, and has begun to enrich uranium above the 3.67% permitted under the deal’s obligations. At a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday, July 15, the European actors will seek to defuse tensions in the volatile region. “The deal is on the brink; the message on Monday will be to show EU unity but make it clear to Iran that it needs to come back into line,” a European diplomat was said to Reuters news agency. “For now, nothing is reversible, so we have more room for diplomacy.” Speaking before the Brussels meeting, France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Europe has to remain united in its attempts to preserve the deal and convince Tehran to shift its decision not to comply with parts of the accord. “The Europeans have to stay united on this issue,” Le Drian told reporters. Iran’s decision to reduce compliance with the deal that the United States abandoned last year was “a bad response to a bad decision,” he said. In the meantime, Iranian foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hinted at the Europeans’ reluctance to protect Tehran from the US sanctions. “There is a serious difference between doing something and announcing your willingness,” Iranian state TV quoted Zarif saying. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, July 14, 2019 that Tehran is open for dialogue if the sanctions are lifted and the US returns to the nuclear deal’s pact. “We have always believed in talks; if they lift sanctions, end the imposed economic pressure and return to the deal, we are ready to hold talks with America today, right now and anywhere,” Rouhani said in a televised speech. Matters were further complicated by Iran when it made any talks conditional on being allowed to export the same amount of oil as it did before the US withdrawal from the nuclear pact. Trump has shown no sign of backing down and said he would put yet more pressure on the Gulf country with more sanctions. “We’re putting additional sanctions on; some of them are already in place,” said US President Donald Trump in June 2019. “The sanctions have hit them hard.”

Rabat – The Ministry of Islamic Affairs has published new guidelines to ensure the smooth roll-out of the Hajj pilgrimage in August this year. Under the new guidelines, an increased number of support staff will be made available to pilgrims, from the moment they leave Morocco to when they return home. One member of support staff will be available for every 50 pilgrims, to assist with logistics. Each year, during the last month of the Islamic calendar millions of Muslims make their way to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the five-day Hajj pilgrimage. In 2018, more than 2 million pilgrims undertook the pilgrimage, including approximately 32 000 Moroccans. Due to the high numbers of Muslims wishing to go on pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia allocates pilgrim quotas to each country. Pilgrims are selected by ballot and sign up to packaged deals which include flights, accommodation in Mecca, and logistical support during the pilgrimage.  Last year, a number of videos of Moroccans in Mecca complaining about the conditions of the Hajj pilgrimage went viral. The pilgrims complained of insufficient food, delayed transport, inadequate support, and overall poor management of the event. To limit the recurrence of these issues in 2019, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs has set out a list of requirements to be met by support staff.  The support member must set up a contact list of all pilgrims in their group and ensure regular communication with them. Once in Mecca, they must also coordinate with the Mutawif, the person responsible for accompanying the pilgrim over the five days of pilgrimage, to ensure the smooth roll-out of the pilgrimage.  The Moroccan Ministry of Islamic Affairs set the total price of a Mecca pilgrimage package this year at MAD 49,906 (approximately $5230). Moroccan company Royal Air Maroc and Saudi Arabian company Saudia are the designated air carriers.

Rabat – A Moroccan teenager living in France, Omar Benharbit, is garnering praise online for his rendition of the Moroccan national anthem on piano. Watch the video here for a treat. The iconic national anthem was written in 1969 by Moroccan author Ali Houssaini Squalli, who has been on the mind of Moroccans this year, perhaps inspiring Benharbit. Known as one of the most patriotic Moroccans, Squalli was well respected for the mark he left on Morocco. The whole country mourned when Squalil died in November 2018. King Mohammed VI described Squalli as one of the “pioneers of modern Arabic literature, the creator of the national anthem who enriched the national library.” In honor of his contribution, in 2018 Squalli was posthumously named the Moroccan “Man of the Year.”   J’ai finalement décidé de partager! 🇲🇦Merci à Zineb Benharbit pour avoir risqué sa vie en filmant,❤️Enjoy! 😁 Publiée par Omar Benharbit sur Jeudi 11 juillet 2019

Rabat – Morocco’s Football Federation (FRMF) issued a statement on July 15 to deny the resignation of Herve Renard, head coach of Morocco’s national football team. FRMF said in a statement that it denies all reports that Renard has resigned from his post. “President of the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) Fouzi Lekjaa had two meetings with Renard on Sunday and Monday to evaluate Morocco’s performance during the 2019 African Cup of Nations,” FRMF said. The statement added that Lekjaa and Renard also spoke about the future of the national team and decided to hold another meeting in the near future. Last week, a close source to Renard denied the coach’s intention to resign.  The source reported that Renard only took a  break to think about his future with the Atlas Lions, adding that the coach’s decision will be based on the performance of the Atlas Lions during the CAN. The denial was prompted by several rumors that Renard had already resigned. On July 9, Moroccan television channel Arriyadia reported that the coach had left the Atlas Lions. The rumors of Renard’s resignation came in the wake of the Atlas Lions’ shock exit from the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019. Renard served as a coach of the national team since 2016. He previously coached Cote D’Ivoire and Zambia, winning the Africa Cup of Nations with both teams. After Morocco’s exit from the 2019 CAN on July 5, an uproar emerged on social media, especially when his alleged salary was disclosed. Renard is said to receive a salary of  €120,000 from the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF). Some Moroccan fans condemned the performance of the national team and Renard, who receives the highest salary in African football. FRMF is expected to hold a meeting on July 22 to speak about the situation of football in Morocco. Football experts will convene during the event.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI welcomed the “Moroccan-French exceptional partnership” in a congratulatory message addressed to French President Emmanuel Macron on French national day, July 14. Bastille Day or French national day is a festival celebrated annually in France. The day marks the anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789.  The event was a turning  point in the French revolution. The Celebrations, which are held across France, symbolize unity, equality, and brotherhood between French people. Every year the president of the Republic inspects a large military parade to mark the celebrations.

The King said that the  “excellence of these links is illustrated through the density of cooperation oriented towards the future and the regularity of the dialogue and political consultation.” Morocco and France recently renewed their commitment to reinforce their diplomatic ties during the recent visit of French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian to Rabat in June. Le Drian praised the business relations between Morocco and France. He recalled that more than 900 French companies are directly or indirectly operating in Morocco, creating “thousands of job opportunities.” “We have a will to continue together in a real partnership, which was singularly illustrated at the inauguration of the LGV [high-speed train],” Le Drian said. He referred to the visit of President Emmanuel Macron, who inaugurated Africa’s first LGV with King Mohammed VI in November 2018. In June, the French ministry also announced that a high-level France-Morocco meeting is scheduled to take place in the fall of 2019.

Rabat – Members of the Royal Moroccan Navy rescued 161 irregular migrants in the Mediteranean  on Friday. The would-be migrants were aboard tiny unsafe boats when the Moroccan navy  intervened to assist them, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Last week, Moroccan director of migration at the Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali  said that the law enforcement forces   foiled more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since January 2019. Zerouali said that the irregular migration attempts foiled so far represent a 25% increase from the same period of 2018. He stated that the flow of irregular migrants persists despite concerted efforts from Morocco and its international partners, including Spain. “It is true that on the Spanish side, we feel that the migration pressure has decreased, but on our side, it continues to increase,” Zerouali told El Pais. While highlighting  Morocco’s efforts to curb the flow of undocumented emigration to Europe n, the official said that illegal migration networks now use other routes to transport would-be immigrants.  These networks “have become sophisticated. Now candidates for illegal immigration are trying to leave from south Casablanca. There are also attempts to reach the Canary Islands from the coast between Agadir and Dakhla, the official said.

Rabat – Moroccan police arrested a man suspected of  raping and murdering a 10-year old child in Meknes. According to a  statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), the police arrested the 35-year old suspect following “intense research and investigations.” Scientific and technical investigation revealed suspect’s connection to the murder and sexual assault, Maghreb Arab Press reported on Sunday quoting DGSN statement. Police found the body of the 10-year old child in an abandoned building next to the Sahrij Swani in Meknes. He was choked by an electric cable after being raped. Police also arrested a 17-year old minor suspects of complicity in the case. Investigations are ongoing to arrest a third suspect, DGSN added. Police put the main suspect in custody for further investigations. A number of harrowing crimes of pedophilia have shocked the Moroccan public in recent years.    In another widely-publicized case of pedophelia, a 60-year old man attempted to rape a child in October  2018 in a public hammam (sauna) in Fez. In January 2018, Fez police arrested a 58-year-old French pedophile who raped two little girls. The pedophile drugged and raped the minors. The Frenchman admitted that he raped the two minors. He claimed  that he could give the children “what they were deprived of: toys, food, gifts and money.”  In March 2018, the Fez appeals court gave an eight-year prison sentence to the pedophile. In 2014, a two-year-old girl was raped and killed by her uncle in a town outside of Casablanca.

Rabat – The unexpected death of model Imane Fadil, who was only 33, has been shrouded in mystery. Before her death, the model spent “a month in agony,” suffering from an undiagnosed illness in hospital, according to her brother and lawyer. Fadil reportedly told her brother and lawyer before her death that she suspected she had been poisoned, due to her role as a key witness in the trial against ex Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. After the trial, he was cleared of paying for sex with an underage prostitute but convicted of tax fraud.  Fadil gave evidence against him in 2012, and was reportedly working on a memoir when she died. Titled “I met the devil,” the book was going to give first-hand accounts of Berlusconi’s nefarious activities. Following Fadil’s comments that she may have been poisoned, Italian magistrates opened a murder investigation to shed further light on her death.   Speculation swirled in the media, with some outlets reporting tests showed the model had high levels of heavy metals in her body, and others completely disputing this. However, tissue samples from the model’s kidney and liver were sent to specialists who said it was “increasingly unlikely” on the basis of initial tests that she had been contaminated by radioactive substances. The autopsy shows that she had a tumor, which could have affected her bone marrow, finally clearing the mystery up.

Rabat – The existence of informal and illicit trade networks among North African countries is not unheard of, nor is it a new phenomenon. Despite decades of war, failed diplomatic efforts, and a closed border, smugglers in Algeria and Morocco have kept close ties.  Perhaps this is not by accident.  Throughout North Africa, consumer goods such as food and textiles are often “moved in accordance with informal agreements between smugglers and state agents that regulate the types of goods coming through, their costs, and how much can be transported,” according to a June 2019 Washington Post article by Max Gallien.  Gallien’s conclusions are informed by the 14 months he spent conducting fieldwork on the political economy of informal and cross-border trade in North Africa. Based on over 200 interviews with smugglers, state representatives, and civil society groups, Gallien found that much of the region’s smuggling occurs in conjunction with local and state authorities. He maintains that explanations of lawless spaces and individualized corruption are not suitable for analyzing the high levels of illegal trade in North Africa. States do not simply tolerate or turn a blind eye to certain smuggling activities; rather, states carefully regulate them “to maintain social peace in their borderlands,” says Gallien. Regional differences in taxes, subsidies, and availability of goods have long nurtured the growth of these smuggling networks between Morocco and Algeria, which bypass formal tariff and trade regulations. Not only do the low-priced goods benefit consumers in both countries, but the activity of smuggling itself employs thousands of people who otherwise have very few economic opportunities.  In this sense, smuggling is the foundation of numerous borderland economies along the northern boundary between Morocco and Algeria.      Algeria’s greatest export, in both legal and illegal trade For years, the most lucrative link in the chain of goods being smuggled in North Africa was not drugs or weapons but in fact a perfectly legal commodity: gasoline.  Although Morocco is not Algeria’s top trading partner–and certainly not a close ally–the neighboring kingdom, despite its closed border, is one of the main destinations for smuggled Algerian petrol. This relationship is “a modern incarnation of age-old trade networks, enabled by deep cross-border ethnic and tribal connections,” claims a 2015 report on the Maghreb’s border security challenges by the United States Institute of Peace (USIP).  The demand for black market petrol is driven by high fuel costs in Morocco, where drivers are currently spending about $1.08 (10.34 MAD) on a liter of gasoline. In contrast, a liter of gasoline in Algeria is $0.35 (42 DZD or 3.38 MAD). This translates to $4.08 per gallon in Morocco and $1.33 per gallon in Algeria. Other cheap consumer goods such as medicines, scrap metal, household appliances, tobacco, agricultural goods, and vehicle parts are routinely smuggled into Morocco from Algeria.  “Algeria now feeds the whole region,” an Algerian customs official remarked to USIP in 2015, given the country’s abundance of subsidized products.  Thwarting survivalist smuggling Morocco’s northern borderlands, specifically around Oujda-Angad and Berkane, are still teeming with well-organized contraband networks that have long-standing family and trade connections with smugglers in Algeria’s Province of Tlemcen.  Thanks to modern highways, contraband leaving Oujda can arrive in Rabat in five hours and Casablanca in six, decreasing smugglers’ risk of arrest or conflict.  Despite the attractive financial rewards to be reaped from smuggling, the everyday dependence on illicit economies along the border does not come without its disadvantages.   The livelihood of thousands of people involved in smuggling is entirely at the mercy of security forces who can crack down on specific networks or individuals at any given time. This can completely disrupt communities which are already socially, economically, and geographically marginalized.  The revenue generated from smuggling also offers political influence to otherwise undesirable characters, and the security personnel, political elites, and formal businessmen who have ties to illegal trade are prone to corruption. But these drawbacks are tolerated in exchange for a booming housing market, steady youth employment, and  comfortable livelihood.  However, years of maintaining a porous border did not only make desired commodities more affordable.  While Algeria was losing billions in tax revenue to fuel smuggling, the Moroccan government sought to reduce the flow of undocumented migrants, tobacco, and medicines into the kingdom.  Smugglers of fuel, cigarettes, and cannabis had been using donkeys and mules to transport jerry cans of contraband. To undermine this strategy, Morroccan authorities began tagging donkeys for traceability, while Algeria shot at unaccompanied animals near the border.    Anour Boukhars notes contemporary security tactics in an article for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Modern methods include “building miles of trenches, barriers, and fences, as well as employing sophisticated drones and surveillance technology.” Both governments began fearing the exploitation of the border’s smuggling routes by drug cartels and armed terrorist cells. Consequently, they each made independent efforts to impede these movements over the past decade, but “it was ultimately the 2011 Arab uprisings and the resultant political turmoil. . . that drove both Algeria and Morocco to tighten border control,” states Boukhars.  From clothes to cocaine The cross-border smuggling of consumer goods such as fuel, dates, milk, cigarettes, and Turkish-made clothes has been significantly curbed by new border control measures.  But rather than fading away, smugglers simply adapted to the new challenges posed by heightened border security. Despite the crackdown on smuggling consumer goods, illegal trade between Algeria and Morocco has not subsided. And the developments in border security characterized by new walls, fences, and cameras have only served to further hurt already struggling borderland economies. Since the market for consumer goods has been reduced, smuggling between Morocco and Algeria has taken an even more lucrative turn: well-resourced trafficking networks are now putting their efforts towards smuggling irregular migrants, weapons, counterfeit medicine, cocaine, and psychotropic drugs.  With its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Africa, Morocco is an attractive transit hub for cocaine coming from South American cartels. In Temara, cocaine dealers have recently begun supplying a growing demand.   “It wasn’t always a problem here,” a 25-year-old resident of Temara told MWN. “It started last year. They’re like a mafia. I’ve heard they’re violent.” Karkoubi: a weapon of mass destruction Morocco has always been one of the world’s top cannabis producers. Now, Moroccan smugglers exporting cannabis to Algeria are bringing back amphetamines.  When abused, amphetamines can lead to “psychosis and delusions” along with “feelings of paranoia and hostility,” according to Medical News Today.  Amphetamines are more commonly known as speed or crystal meth. In Morocco, the drug arrives in pill form, composed of cheap psychotropic drugs, cannabis, alcohol, and glue. Although considered a poor man’s drug, amphetamines infiltrate all levels of society. In Morocco, amphetamine use has spiked among the country’s youth, particularly young men. The prevalence of the drug, locally known as karkoubi, has dangerous consequences. Notably, a serial killer under the influence of karkoubi killed 14 people in Rabat from 2004 to 2005.  More recently, in 2015, a group of German tourists were randomly attacked in Fes by two knife-wielding men allegedly under the influence of karkoubi.  Karkoubi induces feelings of power in users, called the “Rambo effect,” alongside rage, impulsiveness, self-mutilation, and suicidal thoughts. Those under the influence of karkoubi may feel compelled to commit heinous crimes–such as rape and murder–only to not remember them after coming down from the high.   “For five years now, we have witnessed a spectacular upsurge in aggression and barbaric crimes,” Fatiha Daoudi, a lawyer and human rights activist, wrote for the Huffington Post in 2015.  “Not a day goes by without hearing about young delinquents, often minors, armed with cutlasses, causing panic under the effect of karkoubi. There are now whole neighborhoods held hostage by this type of offender.”  The drug first gained popularity in Casablanca before spreading throughout the country.  “I had a friend who went crazy because of karkoubi,” a 20-year-old Temara resident told MWN.  “He became violent and started fighting a lot, and he was stealing from people–his friends–for no reason. With time he just lost his mind.” No end in sight Reports of smuggling busts have been routinely flooding Moroccan media for years. Although the heroic efforts made by police to combat trafficking are certainly not lost on Morocco’s populace, the astounding frequency of these reports indicate a larger problem.  While the masses may be comforted by exciting stories of security forces impeding drug traffickers, disrupting human smuggling rings, and seizing hoards of weapons from would be terrorists, the reality is that these criminal networks have just recently emerged in response to increased border security–and they’re thriving. So while security forces are digging trenches, shooting suspicious donkeys, and locking up 16-year-old fuel smugglers from poor border towns, a hundred more traffickers of cocaine and crystal meth lie in waiting.  An end to the demands met by smuggling is nowhere in sight, nor is the reconciliation of diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco needed to adequately fortify the border.  But even with a cooperative anti-trafficking strategy, smugglers will continue to find a way. And they will make more money in doing so.   As explained by renowned American political theorist Wendy Brown, great floods of commodities and migrating peoples, “like any other kind of flood, inevitably breach or flow around walls and dams.”

Rabat – On a hot Friday afternoon, a dozen tour buses and vans line the long driveway of Chellah, one of Rabat’s busiest historical sites.  Blue taxis make their way around the cul de sac, dropping off parents with their children before making a hasty departure. Tourists and locals alike swarm the front gate of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, navigating through the electric turnstiles being installed in preparation for Mawazine.  A red carpet has been set on the floor for the music festival, and workers race to cover it with plastic tarps before Chellah’s visitors soil it with their dirty shoes.   Despite the flashy decor and high-tech security measures, Chellah remains frozen in time.  Throughout the stone remains of the Roman city and the old Islamic complex, storks nest atop the exposed pillars and arches of the old Quranic school. A pair have proudly claimed the peak of the tall minaret of the old mosque, while dozens more make their homes in the “stork condos” just past the lower gardens.  In Chellah’s eastern quarter, the white walls of the marabout tombs with their seafoam-green accents shadow le Bassin aux Anguilles–the eel pool. Legend has it that feeding boiled egg whites to the eels will bring fertility and easy childbirth, attracting women who wish to fall pregnant. In this lush corner of the medieval necropolis, Chellah’s cats find their sanctuary. Cats can be found all throughout the site, but in the area surrounding the eel pool and the tombs, several dozen are gathered at any given time to eat, drink, and rest. A quick Google search of “Chellah’s cats” will produce dozens of images and blog posts from travelers who were captivated by these beauties and charmed by the new varieties of life that now occupy these crumbling ancient ruins. While the historical landmark is an attractive enough destination in its own right, animal-loving tourists are undoubtedly thrilled to discover that Chellah is also a paradise for stray cats. An angel in a tan djellaba Like the perpetual ruins of Chellah, the calm atmosphere surrounding the basin and the tombs is unchanging. Although the place is packed on this particular summer day, the cats lounging by the tombs appear unbothered.  Five cats are perched on the low wall facing the pool of the sacred eels, legs tucked under their bodies and eyes closed, visibly content. A litter of seven-week old kittens lay on the ground next to the pool. A lone rooster clucks his way past the sleeping kittens and settles in the bushes. Upon first glance, all seems right in the world of Chellah’s cats. A closer look, however, will reveal that some of the cats are actually dirty, sick, and weak. Some have severe eye infections, others are very thin, and one kitten, visibly soiled, appears to be dead–that is, until you look close enough to notice his haggard breathing.  When I first visited Chellah on a rainy April day last year, the cats seemed healthy and well taken care of. And I, like most tourists, took this for granted.  I remember seeing one kitten with an eye infection, and I watched as a woman in a tan djellaba applied medicine to the kitten’s eye. After finishing with the kitten, the woman brought out dry cat food, called croquettes, and distributed it among two terracotta tajines. A dozen cats, who had been quietly resting nearby, instantly perked up and flooded the feeding area. The woman smiled as she watched over them.  “She’s an angel,” I thought.  The woman in the tan djellaba left an impression on me, and I’m surely not the first to be captivated by her. As an animal lover, I am always happy to see Moroccans looking out for neighborhood strays. Doing so is no easy task, especially given the risks of disease and the high costs of food and medicine for cats and dogs. To see someone taking care of cats full-time was touching, and I wanted to learn more about this generous woman. After arriving in Rabat this June, I had the privilege of meeting her and hearing her story. A family legacy  Fatima* has been in this corner of Chellah for ten years, entirely of her own accord. She has followed in the footsteps of her late father, who started caring for Chellah’s cats in the 1950’s. After he passed away, Fatima’s mother took his place until she fell ill a decade ago.  Since then, Fatima has been carrying on this benevolent tradition.  Every day, she takes care of the cats, feeds the eels, keeps the area clean, and preserves the integrity of the basin and the tombs. Contrary to my own assumptions, she is not employed by the site’s administrators, nor does she get paid for any of the work she does. She is there as a volunteer purely out of love for the cats, and doesn’t work anywhere else to make up for her lack of pay. All that she can offer the cats comes from the donation bowl, the few dirhams she can make selling eggs to tourists who are looking to feed the eels, and the two or three dirhams to be made from selling candles sporadically brought to the tombs.  Even though the cats of Chellah are adored by so many tourists, the administrators who benefit the most from their presence are largely uninterested in their wellbeing–and that of their caretaker.    Fatima had been living in the marabout tombs for almost six years, which allowed her to dedicate more attention to the cats and provide them with special care if they got sick. However, she was asked to leave by Chellah’s administration.  “They told me, ‘it’s a historical site, not a living facility,’” she recalls. “The government wouldn’t approve if they found out.” Whatever it takes Since moving, her time with the cats is now limited to Chellah’s regular hours of operation, which are usually from 8:30 am to 6:30 pm. Working for ten hours without pay is no easy feat, especially when your work offers a lifeline to creatures that otherwise have to fend for themselves.  However, Fatima does not complain about the lack of compensation for her time, and she has never asked the administration to give her an official position. She is there as a cat-loving volunteer–nothing more, nothing less. She loves what she does, even if it is taken for granted.  Of course, donations are greatly appreciated, but Fatima is not concerned with money.  “I don’t know how much it costs,” she says when asked about her cat-related expenses. “I don’t count. I just do whatever I can to take care of them.” A brief aside The donation bowl on the ground has a decent amount of coins. Mostly ones, twos, halves, and quarters. Maybe a couple fives. Just a few feet away, the mossy floor of the eel pool is littered with change. Several ten dirham coins, distinguished by their size and gold details, catch my eye. I can’t blame visitors for wanting to throw coins into the pool. No matter where you’re from, tossing a coin into some form of water is almost an instinctual urge. Who am I to tell people where they should put their money?  Of course, I’m biased. Personally, I would much rather offer my spare change to the kind woman who feeds the cats that I’m posting on my Instagram. I know that for my fellow American travelers, ten dirhams is only about a dollar, which seems like a meager addition to a steep food bill. But those ten dirhams can be the difference between feeding the cats croquettes or crumbs.  I must admit, it broke my heart to see those gold-lined coins at the bottom of the pool.  Dozens of mouths to feed Fatima keeps track of every cat living near the basin and tombs. At present, she takes care of 33 cats on a daily basis, although cats from all over Chellah visit her for food.    “There used to be more than 40 here, but a lot of them died recently,” she sadly admits.   She explains that when the cats get sick, she either can’t afford their medicine or doesn’t know what to do for them. Without access to a veterinarian, she can only offer them basic or substandard treatment.  For almost five years, Fatima’s efforts were abetted by a woman from an animal association in France.  The woman, who was living in Morocco, would bring Fatima cat food, take sick cats to the vet, and help with anything else the cats needed. Additionally, the cats were vaccinated and sterilized by a local association in Rabat. But as the association struggled with its own bills and mounting debt, they had to stop helping Fatima.  As for the French woman, she returned to her home country a few years ago. Since then, Fatima hasn’t been able to provide the same care.  Without any formal assistance, Fatima relies entirely on donations. However, donations will never be enough to maintain the services provided through associations: sterilization and vaccinations cost about 1200 MAD per cat. On top of that, feeding 33 cats basic dry food or a rice-based mixture likely costs around 2000 MAD a month. Medicine for infections and other illnesses is yet another cost to consider.  Even on a busy day, Fatima barely earns enough in donations to feed the cats. When she is short on funds, she has to improvise with food scraps.  During this visit the tajines are peppered with stale chunks of bread.  Empty promises Not once throughout the 60+ years of her family’s involvement with Chellah have any officials stepped in to improve the cats’ quality of life.  “I have never heard of the government coming to check on the cats,” Fatima says.   Consequently, it is up to generous visitors and animal associations to enable the proper care of these cats. Over a year ago, a member of a foreign animal association visited Fatima and promised to fund her work. But this promise was empty.  “I never heard from him again,” she says. “He didn’t keep his word. ” Although Fatima is no stranger to disappointment, not all hope is lost. Once a month, a local resident brings her a large bag of croquettes and some pate, which is a type of wet food. She receives daily donations from visitors and has friends who stop by on occasion to offer their help.  Perhaps as local associations get their footing, they will be able to resume sterilizing and vaccinating Chellah’s cats.    Looking after these animals, especially without the financial means to fully care for them, is undoubtedly emotionally exhausting. But Fatima doesn’t dwell on what she can’t provide for them; rather, she hopes her efforts will inspire others to treat their neighborhood strays with the same kindness they see at Chellah.  The future of animal welfare Although there have been calls to develop the kingdom’s position on animal rights, Fatima is not optimistic about the future of animal welfare in Morocco.  In order to reduce the stray population and end the widespread suffering of unwanted animals, reforms are needed locally and nationwide.  However, in a country that also needs better schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, stray cats and dogs don’t place very high on the official list of priorities.  Fortunately, there are people like Fatima all over Morocco.  Moroccans in every city are caring for strays. Whether this be putting out food and water for cats, assembling makeshift shelters for dogs, or donating time and money to local animal associations, the social aspect of animal welfare is progressing every day. But until a large-scale government effort is made to improve the living conditions faced by animals in the streets, the cats and dogs inhabiting Morocco’s bustling medinas and quiet villages will have to rely on friendly neighbors to survive.  If you would like to learn more about the fight for animal rights in Morocco, check out some of these organizations:   Association de Defense des Animaux et de la Nature (ADAN) – Rabat La Tribu des Quat’pattes – Rabat SFT Animal Sanctuary – Tangier L’association Mchichates

Rabat – One major reason why Morocco’s economy is struggling has to do with the gaping, worrying gulf between employment prospects, and the number of graduates that Moroccan universities and vocational schools produce yearly, according to statistics from Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP). HCP’s assessment is also emphatic about the equally deepening disconnect between big, lofty government promises and the much more gloomy reality of Morocco’s employment market.  Starting in 2017, Moroccan education institutions have produced over 290,000 graduates. By contrast, less than a quarter of those fresh, opportunity-hungry graduates have been absorbed into the formal labor sector. Specifically, Morocco’s labor market has only generated a little over 57,000 jobs on a yearly base since 2017. The discrepancy between the number of jobs created and that of job seekers education system pours into the already stuttering labor market every year, is hardly a new phenomenon in Morocco. The reality, however grim, has been part of the fabric, the functioning of the country’s economy.  But even with the sense that this is the way things have always been, HCP’s analysis of the yearly trend since 2004 suggests that the period since 2017 marked a particularly low point.  Since that year, according to HCP statistics, the mismatch has become wider and far more worrying. One reason, the report suggests, is that there seems to be no precise governmental strategy to reverse the tide, despite grand promises to lower the discrepancy by 2021, when the mandate of the current ruling party ends. Between 2011 and 2017, the number of job created fluctuated between over 75,000 and approximately 100,000 (97,000 in most years), meaning that despite the mismatch the economy could still absorb well above 45% of graduates. Since 2017, however, that ratio has depressingly decreased to 20%.  This bleak reality stems from a mingling of contributing factors, according to HCP.  Factors include a glaring disconnect between the skill requirements of an endlessly shifting labor market and stagnant school curricular; mismarriage a between rapidly growing population and slow economic growth; as well as the contradictions of an apparently thriving industrial sector sustained more by automation than job creation. Although HCP’s figures contrast with the more sanguine government reports, the body’s grim reading of Morocco’s labor sector comes with, as is often the case with bleak predictions in the Moroccan context, a deep sense of déjà-vu.  In early January, Les Inspirations Eco, a Moroccan publication with focus on economy and finance-related topics, criticized the country’s PJD-led government for its lofty idealism in dealing with unemployment.  While the government oozes confidence, promising that it would lower unemployment rate to historic low 8.5% by 2021, the reality suggests much more disheartening prospects, the newspaper reported. Not only is the government lagging behind when it comes to hitting its unrealistic goals by 2021, but its prevailing denialism and complacent optimism may even be more frustrating for Moroccans than the recognition that things are really bad.  For both HCP and Les Inspirations Eco, acknowledging that the reality is far from the sanguine and optimism-clothed pronouncements from the government would spur the need for a thought-out strategy to avoid future collapse. Other experts have predicted that failing to tackle the worrying unemployment may precipitate yet another series of boycotts and popular discontent. “Even though the Arab Spring was nine years ago now, it’s still washing up on our doorstep. The political reverberations of it have not gone away,” one expert said last month after growth indicators once again suggested a cautionary tale for the Moroccan economy, despite an apparently strong industrial sector.

Rabat – Mohamed Henni, the French-Algerian YouTube sensation mostly known for smashing his TV when his favorite teams lose, has slammed Algerian football fans’ “disrespectful” and “un-Algerian” display of emotions as Algeria’s football team continues its stellar display at the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Henni’s latest video comes amid ongoing conversation in France about street violence and reported acts of vandalism while Algerian football fans celebrated Algeria’s good performances at the 2019 CAN. “I really do not understand why you are doing this,” Henni said in the video, referring to the overflowing crowds of Algerian supporters in cities across France. “When Algeria wins we break things. When we lose we break even more. When our matches end in draws, we break again. I for one am fed up my friends, fed up!” The TV smashing fan went on to wonder about the magnitude of the wild celebrations should Algeria go on to win the Africa Cup of Nations. Half-jokingly, he showed a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower, saying: “My friends I’m in Paris as you can see. So let me show you one last image of the tower before they [Algerian supporters] come to destroy it.” Algeria on Thursday, July 11, played against Ivory Coast in a quarter-final match that has been widely interpreted as the best game produced so far at the ongoing CAN. In a physically intense and technically tense confrontation that ended in a 1-1 draw after 120 minutes of play, Algeria went on to win 4-3 in the penalty shootout. In France, the victory against Ivory Coast was celebrated with great fanfare as Algerian fans took to the streets around the European country to express their joy and show solidarity with the national team. But the raucous celebrations stirred controversy in France after reports that fans’ celebrations were mired in violence. Near the Champs Elysees Avenue in Paris, crowds stormed and vandalized two shops, according to reports in the French media. But the incident that hit a special nerve, generating backlash from French society, was the report of the death of a young mother hit by a car in Montpellier, Southern France. Meanwhile, her baby, who was also hit and gravely injured, is undergoing intense medical care. “We cannot condone this as Algerians. We are responsible for doing the cleaning in our own house,” the YouTuber said, in reference to “fucked up” reputation Algerians have in France. “Our parents struggled hard to make ends meet, to earn a stellar reputation…. And you guys come along and want to ruin everything, ruin that hard work in just three days! As Algerians we have to make two or three times more effort to have a good name… because we have a much fucked up reputation.” Towards the end of the video, however, Henni slammed far-right personalities who have argued that people who identify more as Algerians than French have no right to take to French streets and brandish Algerian flags in celebrations. “France stayed more than 130 years in Algeria, and some do not even want Algerians spending two or three hours at the Eiffel Tower. What is that all about? We are all brothers. Normally, we should all celebrate alongside each other whether it is Algeria or France that wins.”

Rabat – On July 11, an 11-year-old boy was found dead near the former Education Academy in Meknes. The child had been choked with an electric cable after being raped; his naked body showed traces of sexual violence. Mohammed al-Amiri, the father of the victim, said that his son left their home on the evening of July 9 and never came home. After searching for him in vain, the father informed the police of his son’s disappearance. He received news of his son’s death on his way to hand the police a photo of him. Shocked by the incident, several neighbors expressed their outrage. In a video posted on Youtube, one of the neighbors stated, “we’re living in a jungle; all kinds of drugs including cocaine are sold in our neighborhood.”  Another neighbor, with tears in her eyes, expressed her concern for all the children of the Beni Mohamed neighborhood. “All our children are in danger; our kids, teenagers, adults, boys, and girls are all using drugs,” she shakingly added. She also appealed to officials and the police forces to increase police patrols in the neighborhood.  Other women stressed the devastating effect of drug-dealing and drug-use among the neighborhood’s youth. “Everytime I leave the house to work, I keep imagining my son being attacked or manipulated into taking drugs,” one of the women added.

Rabat – The national platform “Morocco Digital University” (MUN) is a project dedicated to online courses (MOOC). The platform,  the first of its kind in Morocco and Africa, aims to develop private small group online courses (SPOC). The Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research developed MUN  in partnership with the French public interest group “GIP FUN-MOOC”. Both parties were present at the launch of MUN in Rabat, on July 12. The project is part of the ministry’s efforts to generalize the use of information technologies in higher education. The use of MOOCs is intended to solve issues related to overcrowding in universities as well as the quality of training and insertion of young graduates into the workplace. Speaking at the launch of the platform, Amzazi commented that,”this national project is capable of containing the overcrowding in Moroccan universities which host every year 250,000 new graduates.”  MUN is a bespoke program, adapted to the precise needs of higher education in Morocco. The platform is designed to promote cooperation between Moroccan and French universities in the field of joint distance education. The MUN platform offers content in various fields: education and training, engineering sciences, computer science, economics and finance, basic sciences, health, languages, management, entrepreneurship, environment, human sciences, and law. Minister of Education Said Amzazi co-chaired the platform’s official launch ceremony with his French counterpart, Frédérique Vidal. During the ceremony, Amzazi said that the “platform offers quality content that will be continuously consolidated in favor of the Francophone community in Morocco and Africa.”  In a statement to the media, Amzazi explained that MUN is based on modern pedagogy. Its aim is to offer students the opportunity to acquire new skills and better prepare their integration in the labor market. The French Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, Frédérique Vidal, noted that “MUN is likely to help more people in particular situations such as people with disabilities or living far from cities to follow quality courses.” “It is also a continuous training tool allowing everyone, including people with disabilities, to obtain a diploma, to carry out professional reconversions, or to consolidate their knowledge,” she added. The French Minister’s participation in the ceremony comes as part of her working visit to Morocco. Accompanied by a delegation of high level academics, the minister’s visit is in line with the two countries’ efforts to strengthen cooperation in higher education and scientific research.

Rabat – It is hard to define education and the extent to which it can alter a human being, as well as society as a whole. It can be described as a transition from obscurity to light, from an empty mind to an open one; or even as a ceaseless journey towards constant growth and limitless discovery. Once someone develops a passion for learning, they become unstoppable. Education is the investment each generation makes in the future—and there is no future without education.   But what about when people neglect its true essence, as the key to every civilized society? In the ancient times, Persian Islamic scholar Al-Tirmidhi preached that the seeking of knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim.  Centuries later, education, as the highest of virtues, has been overthrown in the Arab world. According to research conducted on the education sector, this poses a vehement threat to the younger generations, who desperately dream of a future intact from the system’s inadequacies.  One of them is 19-year-old Oumaima Latrech of Salé, Morocco who just completed her first year studying journalism at the Higher Institute of Information and Communication (ISIC). She considers herself amongst the “lucky ones” who get to receive a higher education in the North African country. “Concerning the quality of education here in Morocco, that’s probably the most discussed topic nowadays amongst students and also amongst parents, because everyone is looking for a place that would give them the best educational background to get a better job in the future —and Morocco might not be it,” Latrech told Morocco World News.   “Morocco’s education system is kind of a mess; having experienced college life here, I think school doesn’t really give much to students,” she added.  In Morocco, the education sector is not considered a top priority for the government which overlooks the implementation of tools that would offer a significant boost to the educational system.  Despite some reform endeavors that have been witnessed over the years, such as human resources enhancement and financial aids, none of them has succeeded to redress the complex root of the problem—one that holds many responsible, including the government, the parents, teachers, and the students of the country. According to Latrech, her college experience in Morocco taught her that if she wants to be the best she could possibly be in the field of her studies, she should seek to further broaden her understanding and knowledge counting on her own meticulous research and individual effort. “If you want to learn, self-learning is the best solution to develop yourself and skills and gain more knowledge,” Latrech said. “If any student wants to be something in the future, they shouldn’t only focus on what the country’s education has to offer, instead they should search for things themselves,” she added. The latest World Universities Ranking, published by the British magazine Times Higher Education, indicates that Moroccan universities are not faring well on the international scale.  Based on the universities’ teaching methods, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook, Moroccan universities came at the bottom of the list, with Marrakech’s University of Cadi Ayyad and Rabat’s Mohammed V University ranked as the 801th and 802th among the 980 listed institutions. “People here also play a big role in the educational system’s inadequacy, because you can’t expect to fix something without starting from yourself; statistics are shocking,” Latrech said. In Morocco, illiteracy is still prevalent, with 32.2% of Morocco’s population older than 10 years of age classed as illiterate. A study conducted by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) revealed that Moroccans over the age of 15 only spend an average of two minutes a day reading. “The illiteracy rates are huge in Morocco, we don’t really focus on education as much as we should be,” Latrech said. “If a person does not start from themselves to develop their knowledge and skills, then I don’t think the government or universities could be much help for them.” Despite Morocco’s current inefficient education system and the scarce opportunities it offers to its students, the latter have not ceased to imagine a future vividly shaped according to their own dreams and aspirations. “Definitely each one of us has their own dream; someone wants to be a TV reporter, someone wants to work on radio, someone wants to do communications and public relations,” Latrech said. “As we start growing up each one of us has their own goals that they try to work on in order to achieve them, still, we don’t know if that’s possible here—but it’s worth trying to see how far we can go.”  With two years remaining before her graduation, Latrech plans to invest in Morocco to gain the necessary knowledge that will make her fully competent to face the future in the tough professional world, as well as to travel and obtain an additional degree at an institution abroad. “If I ever get the chance to study somewhere else, I would definitely get it; it would be a great opportunity to compare the educational systems and see how things work outside of here,” Latrech said.  “I don’t know if I will work in Morocco or abroad; ideally, I would like to choose for a place where I would feel more comfortable, more motivated and where I could be productive to give my best,” she added. Latrech still has not fully turned her back on Morocco as a country where she could possibly work and complete her studies at. She is proud of her birthplace and acknowledges that giving up is not always the solution.  “I don’t know how many opportunities I am going to take or how many opportunities I am going to miss, but I believe that hard work pays off and if I do my duties as I should do them, I can have a successful future even in my country,” Latrech said “As a Moroccan, I am the next generation; we all are the next generation, and this generation should contribute to develop Morocco, because if we don’t do that then who is going to do this for us?” she added.  Knowledge is life; it can cure any epidemic deeply ingrained in modern societies. According to Latrech, each country alongside its citizens should focus on improving its education system and the quality of knowledge it offers to the younger generations —its own bright and ambitious representatives in tomorrow’s challenging world.  After all, Malcom X was right; education graciously grants one’s access to every tomorrow. And, where would we be without tomorrows?

Rabat – The law is the latest step in the development of Islamic finance in Morocco. Sharia insurance, known as Takaful, is a growing industry in the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond. Over the past four decades hundreds of Takaful companies have opened, proving insurance coverage for Muslims in accordance with Islamic law. Starting in 2017, Morocco began to pave the legal path for Takaful companies looking to establish themselves in the North African country. The legislation still needs to pass through the 395-member House of Representatives in Rabat. Islamic banking professionals in Morocco told Reuters that once the law is enacted, insurance companies will then be able to launch Takaful subsidiaries. Said Amaghdir, President of the Moroccan Association for Participatory Finance Professionals told Reuters that after the law has been passed, Islamic banks in Morocco will be able to offer life and general insurance policies. Morocco’s efforts to strengthen Islamic finance may be relatively recent, but elsewhere in the Muslim world Takaful companies have been in operation for decades. The first Takaful company, the Islamic Insurance Company of Sudan, was established in 1979.  In 1985, the Grand Council of Islamic Scholars in Saudia Arabia passed a resolution stating that conventional insurance is not acceptable from a Sharia point of view. The industry continued to expand as Takaful companies sprung up around the Arabian peninsula. By the mid 1990s, seven companies were in operation in several Muslim countries including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. By 2016 over 300 Takaful companies operated worldwide in an industry valued at over 33 billion dollars, according to a 2016 World Takaful Report. However, the initial foundation for Sharia-compliant companies stretches back much earlier.  Islamic scholars first forbade conventional insurance over a century ago, citing passages in the Quran that outlawed practices such as gambling and usury.  Sharia insurance differs from conventional insurance primarily in that it operates on the basis of solidarity and mutual assistance. Muslim countries wanting to stay in accordance with Islamic law have chosen to enact legislation regulating the operation of Takaful companies. While conventional insurance companies rely on each individual member paying a premium for coverage, members of Takaful companies all contribute financially to a fund to provide mutual assistance to anyone in need. The practice of high premiums, interpreted as usury by most Islamic scholars, is also forbidden. As are uncertainty and gambling, which some scholars also allege are characteristics of conventional insurance coverage. This unilateral contract allows members to retain a right to collect the surplus on funds they have contributed, should no insurance claims be made. However, Amaghdi told Reuters in order for Sharia-compliant insurers to thrive, they still need access to capital markets. Despite the growing number of Takaful companies, some Islamic scholars have questioned the legitimacy of the industry.  “We can make insurance a not-for-profit activity,” said Islamic economist Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui. “But it does not change the essential nature of what is being done.”

Rabat – Nana Akufo-Addo, Ghana’s president who is famous in pan-African circles for “telling the truth to the West,” has yet again said that Europe shares blame for a number of realities on the African continent. Speaking in Paris yesterday, July 11, to France’s Emmanuel Macron in front of over 400 representatives of the African diaspora, the Ghanaian president said that Africa needs to rethink how it engages with Europe—and other parts of the world for that matter—to ensure that its dealings with the outside world actually benefit Africans. Relations with Europe must change Even as the rapid transformation of this age have made it imperative for Africa to establish social and economic links with other continents, it must do so by emphasizing the need to be self-reliant and capable of one day exploiting its large quantity of raw resources. “Africa and Europe are natural partners,” President Akufo-Addo said, adding however that the terms of the partnership need to change to pave the path for “a relationship that has to be different from what we’ve had up to now.” He explained: “That relationship has enriched Europe but has not enriched Africa. So, we need to change that dynamic and we can only do it by ourselves, taking the correct measures for our future.”  He further argued that, “We have to get away from the idea that there is some Father Christmas who’s going to come and develop our continent for us. There is no Father Christmas, there is just us.” President Akufo-Addo went on to speak in warm and profuse terms of the emerging pan-African mindset across the continent. He dwelled on China’s success story, especially stressing how the Asian country’s image and reputation has significantly improved as a result of the economic prosperity it has achieved in recent decades. Because “that development of China has changed the status and the position of Chinese all over the world,” he argued.  Once Africa finds a way to educate its populations, “give them skills, and put Africa “on the path to a very, very strong economic growth,” the continent might as well gain the respect and consideration that China has secured of late, he postulated. Turning to President Macron, the Ghanaian leader hastened to make his point much clearer, saying that he does not wish for Africa to cut links with the world.  Instead, the continent needs to claim its due and deal with partners in a way that is different than what Akufo-Addo sees as the patronizing and Africa-belittling partnerships that currently prevail. “So, Mr. President, we’re saying the time has come for us to take our destiny in our own hands.” The Ghanaian leader was onto something of significance to African policy circles when he raised the point about the need for a paradigm shift in Euro-African relations.  Speaking at a Euro-African conference in Vienna in December of last year, Rwanda’s Paul Kagame blamed a sizable portion of Africa’s problems on Europe’s wrong-headed policies on the continent. Of the deepening immigration problem, Kagame said it is partly Europe’s failed policies that are driving millions of Africans out of their continent. “Europe has a migration problem because it failed to address the issue early. Instead of helping Africa, it further impoverished the continent. Don’t misunderstand me: I am not blaming Europe for the problem of migration. It is a shared problem.” Meanwhile, African leaders have taken many steps in the past months to realize their aspiration of a much more interconnected, prosperous, and internationally vocal Africa. Ongoing projects such as the single African passport, or the Africa free trade area have been presented as part of a broader ambition of realizing African unity and solidarity on a wide range of topics as well as development affecting many lives on the continent.

Rabat – French newspaper Le Point has hailed Morocco as a world power in the making, drawing attention to the list of social and economic changes the North African country has witnessed of late. The paper’s almost eulogistic coverage commends  Morocco socio-economic transformations, detailed in a July 11 editorial headlined “Morocco, the New Power.” The article draws a fine portrait of an already established continental or regional giant consistently flexing its muscles to make a full-throated entrance into the court of a much more respected kind of giants: world powers. Morocco, Le Point argues, has changed for the better. And, while there are still some loopholes in the North African country’s grand design,—there is always room for improvement—the magnitude of the change and the apparent existence of the political will to move things forward make Morocco’s case more forceful to international observers. “Morocco,” the editorial puts it bluntly, is “a new power.” To give a sense of why the north African country deserves this litany of compliments, the article went on to cite a flurry of international reports from acute observers, from the IMF to the World Bank. When it comes to the health of the Moroccan economy, and the promises of its market, most reports agree that the kingdom is a good place to invest, Le Point emphasized. Part of the Moroccan success story has to do with an “enlightened royal vision,” “good policy choices,” a functioning multipartism, increased visibility for Moroccan women, and an increasingly robust institutional framework to meet the challenges the kingdom has set for itself in its new development plan. ‘Blossoming’ Morocco But there is also the construction of hypermodern infrastructure mushrooming in cities across the country.  Such strikingly “modern” infrastructure, the editorial reminds its readership, include the newly completed Tangier Med Port and the equally newly built high speed train line now connecting Tangier and Casablanca. “Here blossoms what tomorrow’s Morocco will look like,” the article says of the “audacious” urbanization projects gradually taking shape in numerous Moroccan cities. The strength of this assertive and constantly changing Morocco resides in its qualified and country-loving human resources, Neila Tazi, a leading businesswoman and member of Morocco’s General Confederation of Enterprises (CGEM), told the French newspaper. “We may not have oil, but our real strength is found in human and geographical capital,” the businesswoman said. Towards the end of its celebratory portrait of Morocco, Le Point acknowledged that, of course, all is not a bed of roses in the emerging, assertive Morocco. Some “fragile” points remain and need tackling.  Those have to do with a stuttering public education system, “persisting social inequalities,” an insufficient application of gender equality laws, as well as a poignant “brain drain” as a number of highly qualified Moroccans elect to emigrate for better opportunities and treatment. Despite these persisting “fragilities,” Le Point stressed, Morocco’s openness to global free trade, its rapid industrialization, its expanding network of modern infrastructure, as well as the existence of a genuine political will suggest that “tomorrow’s Morocco” will be an even more important actor in global dealings. Le Point may have given little space to the challenges still holding Morocco back to make its overreaching case of Morocco becoming an indispensable player on the world stage. But the French magazine is hardly the first to shower Morocco with approving nods.  Over the past three to five years, Morocco has collected applause for, among other things, its growing assertiveness in Africa, its liberal-minded reforms, and its improving migration policy (even if some latest reports have indicated grey areas in terms of Morocco’s treatment of its expanding migrant populations.) Writing in February of last year, Ozy Media dubbed Morocco “the new emerging African power.” Since it joined the African Union, Ozy remarked, the North African country has been “riding on a combination of politics, economics and religion” to influence African politics “at a time when there’s a regional vacuum to be filled.”

Rabat – The Spanish government has refused to grant asylum to Zakaria Bembouzza, a 21-year old man from Al Hoceima. His request was based on the claim that he fears being apprehended by Moroccan officials for his alleged participation in the Al Hoceima protests in 2016 and 2017. The protests hit the province after the death of Mouhcine Fikri, a local fishmonger who was crushed in a garbage truck in October 2016. The protests aimed to condemn social disparities in the region. Spanish news outlet El Faro De Melilla reported that the young Moroccan national, who studies law in Tangier, does not see a future for himself in Morocco. The 21-year old man submitted his asylum request on March 28 in Melilla, after crossing the Beni Enzar border. Speaking to an El Faro, Benmbouzza said he does not consider himself to be Moroccan. When asked about his future should he return to Morocco, the 21 year old said, “black, in prison, this is clear, I see nothing else.”  Benmbouzza’s asylum claim was refused on the grounds that he is Moroccan, however the activist sees himself as a “Rif republican.”. The self-declared activist claims that  the Rif is “under the occupation of the Moroccan regime.” In addition to Benmbouzza, Spain also denied asylum to Abdelkarim Oudriss, Mustapha Bellouch, and Azis Belharch. El Faro de Melilla said that the claimants are all from Nador, but declared themselves to be activists from Rif. In 2018, the Spanish government received a “record-breaking” number of requests for asylum. El Pais said that the number reached 54,000 requests. The country, however, accepted a “far lower rate” of requests compared to other European countries. Spain accepted only 12, 000 claims last  year. In the same year, Spain received 765 asylum requests from Moroccan migrants. Spain only granted asylum to 55 of the claimants. In February 2019, El Pais reported that Moroccans “appear in the statistics among the main beneficiaries of refugee status for the second consecutive year.” Most of the asylum seekers’ claims have been accepted due to their sexual or gender identity. Hirak Rif activists are also among those who have gained political asylum, according to the Spanish newspaper. Spanish Secretary for Migration Consuelo Rumi explained that applications from Moroccans for political asylum are generally rejected because Spain does not view Moroccan migrants as refugees.  The minster said, during her 2018 visit to the country, that Morocco is not a “country whose inhabitants are granted asylum or refuge.”

Rabat – Spanish police dismantled on Friday, July 12, a new network specialized in cyber fraud. During the police operation 24 people were arrested.  The network is made up of 47 people in total, among them Moroccan nationals. According to the Spanish news outlet El Comercio, Moroccan authorities have arrested the 23 remaining individuals in Morocco. The network carried out their criminal activities in multiple countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Morocco. According to an investigation of the Spanish police, the cybercriminals have scammed more than 300 people across Spain and were able to embezzle more than € 1 million a year, which was laundered through the purchase of cryptocurrencies. The investigation first began in April 2018, when victims filed complaints including  fraudulent online purchases and money withdrawal from ATMs. Police found out first the method by which scammers fool their victims. To leave no trace, the cybercriminals used open WIFI networks or hotel or commercial establishments to send their fraudulent emails, telling victims to enter their personal and credit card details. Once obtained, the criminals link the victims’ cards details to a mobile application called “wallet,” which requires the availability of Near Field Communication (NFC) feature on the phone. This allows the scammers to carry out online purchases, contactless payments, and withdraw money from ATMs.  Scammers enter the credit card details in the NFC feature, which allows wireless interactions between a phone and another device.  Latest payments method adopted the use of NFC allowing the transmission of a credit card details without having the card to hand or needing to access a card terminal.

Rabat – This week, the Spanish Civil Guard dismantled a major drug trafficking crime ring. The network was smuggling hashish from Morocco to Spain by sea.  In total, 150 agents from several units took part in the bust, and six people were arrested. Three boats were also confiscated in the raid.  The crime ring had reportedly established a base near the Chafarinas Islands, three small islands located off the coast of Morocco, 3.3 km from the Moroccan village of Ras El Ma and 46 km southeast of Melilla. The base was used to supply drugs and fuel on the high seas to third-party vessels operating on the peninsula. According to the Civil Guard, the system of keeping the drugs on boats provided the ring with greater security than keeping the drugs on the ground. The strategy has been dubbed a “Drug and Fuel Maritime Day Care.” Recently, a variety of boats have been used to traffic drugs from Morocco to Spain. Last May, authorities found three tons of hashish on a luxury yacht near the coast of Malaga.

Rabat – FIFA has amended its disciplinary code, under the new rules victims will be heard in person by FIFA judging panels. The new FIFA disciplinary code will go into effect next week. Prior to the reform, FIFA imposed a sanction of five games on players or officials guilty of discriminatory or racist acts. Under the new amendments, sanctions will rise to a 10 game suspension.  “Topics like racism and discrimination have been updated, putting FIFA at the forefront of the fight against this appalling attack on the fundamental human rights of individuals,” FIFA said in a statement on Thursday. “FIFA will not let down victims of racist abuse, they may be invited by the respective judicial body to make an oral or written victim impact statement,” explained FIFA. “For a first offence, playing a match with a limited number of spectators, a fine of at least 20,000 Swiss francs ($20,000) shall be imposed on the association or club concerned,” the statement continued. In addition to imposing a $20,000 fine, FIFA has decided to open hearings to the public, offer legal counsel to parties, and publish the verdicts online at the request of the victim.

Rabat – As technology continues to be central in the world’s vision for the future, the development of artificial intelligence (AI), the simulation of human intelligence by computers and machines, has become an increasingly important field in science. Meanwhile, Morocco, along with the rest of Africa, has largely failed to capitalize on this demand for AI research and development. However, all of this will change in the future, with the opening of a new school dedicated towards AI in Fez. In September, the Euromed University of Fez (UEMF) will open its doors to the Euromed School of Digital Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (EIDIA), a brand new center dedicated towards AI research, development, and education. The facility will be a first for both Morocco and the rest of Africa, and will help to establish Morocco as a prospective leader in AI technology. Out of over 1,500 candidates who have applied to study at the center, only 100 science graduates will be given the opportunity to pursue the training program. A contest on July 25 will determine which students are selected for the specialized training. Complete with training programs at the Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate levels, the EIDIA will offer education in a myriad of fields, ranging from robotics and artificial intelligence to cyber security and web technologies. The university will also be supported by the French university Ecole Polytechnique (l’X), which is renowned for its engineering and polytechnic education programs.  Following an agreement signed on July 12, l’X gave its full support for the EIDIA, promising that it would contribute to the Moroccan school by “associating the entire ecosystem of the X to this project.” With AI expected to generate over 2.3 million jobs by 2020, Morocco’s focus on expanding and improving its education in this field has the potential to turn the country into a regional and global leader in an increasingly important industry.

Rabat – Responding to a wave of criticism from fans, Moroccan football player Youssef Ait Bennasser has released a video of himself insulting his social media followers.  The reckless reaction came after a fans heavily criticised the player following the Atlas Lions’ defeat against the Benin Squirrels in the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN) on Friday, July 5. 😱 Le craquage de Youssef Aït Bennasser après l’élimination du #Maroc…@WeAreMalherbe 😂#FRMF #CAN2019  #ASSE @Alex_InDaHouse2 https://t.co/rYGdnYt3pN — Benjamin Monier (@MonierBenjamin) July 12, 2019  Already disappointed by their team’s shock exit from CAN, Moroccan football fans were taken aback by the angry post. Ait Bennasser has since acknowledged his mistake in an Instagram, expressing his sincere apologies to Moroccan football fans. “I wish to apologize to everyone I have offended. Still very touched, like all my teammates, by our elimination.” He said that he received a lot of backlash on social media following the Benin-Morocco game. Some users had gone so far as to wish death on his family.  “This is not an excuse for my behavior, which reflects neither my values nor the education that my parents gave me. I am really sorry about that and I am ready to take all the consequences for my actions,” he added.

Rabat – French-Moroccan comedian Gad Elmaleh has again been accused of plagiarism, this time with other comedians coming forward.  After YouTube channel CopyComic, which exposes plagiarism, targeted Elmaleh multiple times this year, the comedian defended himself on TV channel Europe 1 on July 9. “I started my career in 1995 with a sketch called” Monsieur Seguin’s Goat,” it was a ​​parody. I do not know who wrote it (laughs) but it was my vision,” the comedian said. Just two days after Elmaleh’s TV appearance to defend himself, on Thursday, July 11, French paper “Society” published a possibly damning article revealing the full extent of his supposed plagiarism. Taking a different approach from CopyComic, who plays Elmaleh’s sketches side by side with the original version, Society sought the testimonies of other comedians whose work Elmaleh may have pilfered. One of these comedians, who chose to remain anonymous and is described by Society as a “renowned humorist,” said that he already had seen two of his sketches stolen by Elmaleh, before a third was revealed by CopyComic.  He had let the first two pass, but three was too much, said the anonymous comedian. “It really hurts the job. It’s something serious, humor.”  Marseille-based comedian Kamel Bennafla also came forward to claim that one of Elmaleh’s most famous skit characters, “The Blonde,” a goody-two-shoes who does everything right,  was actually his idea. Bennafla alleges that two met at the Festival d’Avignon in the late 1990s when he was “already a star” and Elmaleh “was still a young comedian.” The two then appeared together on the radio show Europe 2 Avignon, where Bennafla told the story of “a nice blond kid, who does everything well and ridicules others” as part of a skit. Bennafla alleges that after the show, Elmaleh asked him for the tape so he could use it “to practice his budding comedy skills.” “Now, when I perform the sketch I thought of a decade ago, people tell me Elmaleh invented it first. I immediately understood how this happened,” said Bennafla.  He alleges he then tried to get the tape from the Europe 2 Avignon radio host as proof, but the host refused, not wanting to butt heads with Elmaleh, who is now a comedy giant with his own netflix show.  Another comedian, this time a Quebecois named Mike Ward, told Society that Elmaleh was planning on plagiarizing him too. Ward alleges that after he performed alongside Elmaleh at 2015 Hamac Festival in Paris, the French-Moroccan comedian approached him backstage. “He asked me if I performed often in Paris, and I said no. He then asked me if my material was known in France,” said Ward. “I told him right there, that if he stole from me, I would destroy him, and I would humiliate him publicly. It put a huge discomfort backstage. In other words, he never dared to steal my jokes.” Elmaleh was born in Casablanca to a Jewish family and attended high school in Quebec. At the age of 21, Elmaleh moved to Paris to pursue his dream of acting. The 47-year-old comedian performed comedy in France for over 23 years and gained wide fame there. The stand-up comedian and actor has starred in several feature films, including “Coco” (2008), “Priceless” (2006), and “La Doublure” (2005). He was voted the “funniest person” in France, and France’s Minister of Culture named him Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. Elmaleh also became a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. The French-Moroccan’s career skyrocketed even further in recent years, with his own Netflix original show, “Huge in France,” having premiered in April. Elmaleh is yet to respond publicly to the damning article, and it remains to be seen whether the allegations will have a longstanding effect on his career.

Rabat – The majority of Moroccan abattoirs do not meet the minimum health and hygiene standards according to a statement from the ONV. “Aside from eight abattoirs which have been approved by the by the National Health Security Office of Food (ONSSA), the majority of abattoirs in towns and in rural areas do not meet minimum required in relation to hygiene and health standards,” the body stated in a press release. Following ONV’s press release, the Moroccan Federation for Consumer Protection Association (FNAC) warned of the “real danger” for consumers buying red meat in Morocco. “We have watched with great interest the state of the public abattoir situation (municipal and communal), which don’t even maintain minimum conditions for sanitary security,” said the FNAC in a press release, warning that this  “represents a real danger for the health of consumers.” ONSSA is responsible for inspecting and certifying Moroccan abattoirs, a process which includes veterinary inspections of the premises by ONV vets. On July 6, ONSSA announced it would suspend inspections of the abattoirs that it considers do not meet Moroccan health standards. ONSSA does not have the power to close abattoirs, but by suspending inspections and certifications, it is putting pressure on the abattoirs to lift their game.  “It’s the first time ONSSA has taken this type of action,” the president of the ONV National Council, Doctor Badr Tnacheri, Ouazzani told Morocco World News. “The reasons is likely to be consumer pressure. Moroccan consumers have high expectations of the quality of the meat,” he said.  In terms of abattoirs getting up to standard, “some abattoirs need a small boost, while others will need more than that,” noted Ouazzani.  According to ONSSA statistics, Morocco has 179 municipal abattoirs and 670 rural abattoirs. ONSSA monitors approximately 200 000 tons of meat per year coming from abattoirs.

Rabat – The Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, declared on July 9, that in order to save pension plans, wage cuts and the retirement age would have to be increased, starting this year. Speaking in the House of Councils, he admitted to being unable to cancel ministers and parliamentarians’ pensions. His statement came in response to the countrywide campaign for pensions’ abolition. The civil pension plan El Othmani’s new initiative comes after the publication of the 2017 report by the Authority For Control of Insurance and Social Welfare (ACAPS). The report reveals that pension funds in Morocco are currently facing bankruptcy. Despite the previous government’s progressive reform of the civil pension plan, the pension funds are in acute financial crisis. In order to solve the crisis, Abdelilah Benkirane’s government put into  motion an initiative to increase both wage cuts and the age of retirement.  Both wage cuts and retirement age were set to increase incrementally. Wage cuts will reach 14% this year, while the retirement age was set at 61 in 2017 and reached 63 in 2018. During the House of Councilors’ monthly session on general policy, El Othmani announced a further reform plan. The new reform plan which will  involve Morocco’s four pension funds, as well as the relevant government sectors, is under way. The funds affected by the reform are the Moroccan Pension Fund (CRM), the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) representing 33.4% of declared retirees.  The second two schemes are the Moroccan Inter-professional Pension Fund (CIMR) with 10.3%, and finally the Group Retirement Allowance Plan (RCAR) 6.9%. The first step of the reform was setting the minimum pension payment at MAD 1,500 per month in the public sector, and MAD 1,000 in the private sector. The change has been in effect since January 2018. El Othmani acknowledged, however, that any reevaluation of the pensions’ minimum amount “would threaten the plans’ equilibrium and the sustainability of their action.” Ministers and Parliamentarians’ pension  El Othmani also said that the cancellation of ministers’ pensions was impossible.The pensions became a controversial topic in Morocco following the launch of a national campaign to cancel them in December 2015. The campaign argued that these pensions benefit ministers and parliamentarians only, at the expense of public funds. The Head of Government stated that “he had tried to cancel the pensions but failed as the question of ministers’ pensions is not his decision to make.” He even appealed to the parliamentarians to revise the law on ministers’ pensions themselves. He indicated that “the cancellation of this pension is the Parliament’s responsibility and not the government’s.” Pointing out that the issue is intra-Parliamentary, El Othmani reiterated that “the government will not subsidize this pension not even with a penny, whether it is kept or abolished.” “This is the only bill in which the government will not intervene,” he added.

Rabat – Upon Algeria’s qualification to the semi-final round of the African Cup of Nations (CAN 2019) on Thursday, July 11, many Moroccans joined their Algerian brothers at the Morocco-Algeria border. Fans from both nations shared their joy at Algeria’s success.  Moroccans can be seen in a series of viral videos expressing their joy as though it were their national team that had qualified.  The footage shows the depth of the brotherhood between Moroccan and Algerian citizens, despite tensions in the political arena.  In a further show of this brotherhood, two Algerians climbed the border fence in order to join the Moroccan supporters on the other side. The scene was captured on video. Morocco and Algeria have a long shared history, with many citizens on both sides of the border sharing ancestry.  The images and videos inundating social media are proof that politics is just a tool to divide nations and create conflicts and that sports can unify people regardless of the color of their skin, religion, or beliefs. Since frustrated Moroccan fans saw the Atlas Lions lose to the Benin Squirrels and leave the CAN 2019 on Friday, July 5, many have chosen to support Algeria. Since then, social media platforms have been inundated with images of the brotherhood between fans.  A hashtag was even launched, called # khawa_khawa (brothers_brothers), meant to cheer on both nations in the African Cup of Nations. The ‘brother’ hashtag refers to Moroccan football team captain Mehdi Benatia whose mother is Algerian, and Algeria’s winger Riyad Mahrez whose maternal grandmother is Moroccan.

Rabat – The Minister for Economy and Finance, Mohamed Benchaaboun, and the World Bank Country Director for the Maghreb, Marie-Françoise Marie-Nelly, signed the agreement on July 11. The World Bank announced its intention to support Morocco’s preschool education system reform program on June 20. “This new program will reinforce the efficiency of the education sector by improving access to preschool education,” Mare-Nelly stated in a press release. While Morocco promotes free universal preschool access to all children, only 50% of children aged four to five currently attend preschool, noted the World Bank. Rectifying the issue requires a targeted intervention, the organization adds. The intervention includes training 20 000 preschool teachers and supporting them while they integrate into the education system, and throughout their careers. The program includes online training for teachers and a streamlined teacher recruitment and placement process. Finally the program will reinforce the education system management program. Data will be stored electronically so that information on preschool education can be added to the Moroccan national database for education statistics (MASSAR).  According to the World Bank, the new program is “based on Moroccan authorities’ vision for a ‘new Moroccan schooling system,’ where children are ready to learn, teachers are better prepared to teach, and the system is overall more efficient in supporting the teaching and learning process.” At the signing ceremony, Marie-Nelly congratulated Morocco’s preparation of the program, noting its ambition to set the Moroccan education system on an “upwards and sustainable trajectory,” reports Moroccan newsource Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).

Rabat – The Princess of Morocco Lalla Salma and her son, Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, arrived on the island of Skiathos in Greece on the afternoon of Sunday, July 7, for a holiday. Skiathos, a Greek island in the northwest Aegean Sea about 140km from Athens, is best known for its beaches and buzzing, youth-driven nightlife scene. The two members of the royal family arrived on the island in a private jet at Skiathos airport. The pair then headed to a luxury hotel in Koukounaries, the island’s main town. Making the absolute most of the trip, Princess Lalla Salma has rented a yacht aptly named “Serenity,” which costs €600,000 (MAD 6,465,545) to rent for a week. The hefty price tag comes of this 72-meter long boat comes with 15 suites capable of accommodating 28 guests, and a crew made up of 31 people. The boat was renovated just two years ago and includes a swimming pool as well as a diving platform so guests can jump straight into the ocean.  Greek media have reported that the boat is in Agnontas Bay, Skopelos. Despite some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, the mother and son duo have stayed aboard the yacht. Since the yacht rental includes scuba gear, jet skis, kayaks, and fishing equipment, there’s no shortage of fun activities on board.  It’s not the first time Princess Lalla Salma has holidayed in Greece, having been spotted there multiple times over the years, either alone or with family. In 2012, Lalla Salma visited Ilia in Western Greece, after visiting port town Kyllini the year before. Making her love for Greece even more apparent, in 2017, she purchased a €3.8 million villa in Kea, a Greek island in the Aegean Sea’s Cyclades archipelago. The island is known for its hilly countryside and quiet beaches. However, this seems to be the first time she’s taken her son Crown Prince Moulay Hassan along with her. The Crown Prince recently turned 16, on May 8, 2019.

Rabat – The US Senate is taking an unprecedented amount of time to confirm its ambassadors. The prospective Ambassador to Morocco,David Fischer, is still waiting 586 days after his nomination by President Donald Trump.  The delay is a stark contrast from previous administrations, with the past four US ambassadors to Morocco only having to wait on average 94 days.  A communiqué in 2017 first announced that President Donald Trump had nominated American businessman David T. Fischer to be the next US ambassador to Morocco, but nothing stirred in the Senate. In January of this year, federal documents indicated that the Senate failed to confirm Fischer as US ambassador to Rabat. Congressional records for January 4 indicate Fischer was among the nominees for high-ranking federal positions whose nominations had been sent back for presidential consideration.  President Trump stood by his decision, nominating the car dealer from Michigan, known for being a major Republican donor, for a second time.   Fischer contributed $250,000 to President Trump’s inauguration funds, and his nomination to the post US ambassador has been largely perceived in US policy circles as an expression of gratitude for Fischer’s contribution to President Trump’s inauguration. However, six months after the second nomination, the Senate is still in a standstill. For now, Stephany Miley is holding her position as charge d’affaires.  David Fisher is not the only ambassador waiting to be appointed, with Doug Manchester at the top of the list. The nominee to be envoy to the Bahamas, has already waited 785 days, while a slew of others have already waited between 500-600 days.  The delay is mostly likely due to ongoing clashes between Republicans and Democrats occupying the Senate. Republican President Donald Trump has pointed the finger at the Democrats, tweeting at the Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in December 2018, during the government shutdown: “Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace!” “360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administration in history. These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair!” Trump tweeted.

Rabat – The defense team has asked the court to allow a mental health test for the  four main perpetrators who murdered two Scandinavian tourists near Imlil, Morocco, lawyer of the suspects Hafida Makssaoui told Morocco World News. The lawyer argued that the main perpetrators could have been “brainwashed,” explaining that they belong to an economically disadvantaged class. She further emphasized the importance of a mental health test. The public prosecution and the judge had admitted that the crime is “not normal and the perpetrators are not ordinary,” according to Makssaoui The trial, which was continued today, July 11, has been postponed to Thursday, July 18.  The Sale Court of Appeal has already closed the hearing of the 23 defendants involved in the killing of the two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal. The four main perpetrators appeared in a video to pledge allegiance for ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi shortly after the police found the two victims’ bodies. They have been charged with  “forming a gang to commit terror crimes and intentionally assaulting the life of persons premeditatedly.”  The main defendants will also face charges of inciting people to commit terrorist acts, praising terrorism, and promoting extremism. The two Scandinavian tourists were beheaded, the Head of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation Abdelhak Khiame announced after the murder. The four main defendants both confessed, some of the remaining 20 defendants confessed only to some charges. Others completely deny any involvement in the murder. It remains to be seen whether the final verdict will be announced on Thursday. Both the  public prosecution and the mother of the Danish victim have called on the Sale Court of Appeal to impose the death penalty on the three main suspects involved in the murder. Four main suspects The four main perpetrators are Younes Ouzayed, Rashid Afatti, Abderrahman El Khyali, and Abdessamad Al Joud. Al Joud is considered the leader of the group, and is facing charges of “forming a gang to commit terror crimes and intentionally assaulting the life of persons premeditatedly.” Charged with several crimes, Al Joud will also be prosecuted for inciting people to commit terrorist acts, praising terrorism, as well as promoting extremism. El Khyali, the second key defendant in the case, traveled with the other suspects to Imlil for the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists, before returning to Marrakech to find a hideout.  Ouzayed will face charges of forming a gang, and committing terror acts, as well as harming people’s lives intentionally. Like Al Joud, he will also be prosecuted for inciting people to commit terror crimes, and praising terrorism, as well as participating in unauthorized activities. Affati was the suspect who filmed the crime carried out by Al Joud and Ouzayed. He faces charges of  forming a gang to commit terrorism, as well as committing violence. He will also face charges of attempting to manufacture terror explosives to undermine the stability and security of the country.

Rabat – The United Kingdom‘s government claimed on Thursday, July 11, that five Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) vessels had unsuccessfully attempted to hinder the passage of a British oil tanker through the Strait of Hormuz.  According to a statement from the UK government, on Wednesday, July 10,  the Iranian ships withdrew after receiving “verbal warnings” from a British warship accompanying the British tanker, Heritage. “We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to deescalate the situation in the region.” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denied the allegations, according to Fars news agency. “Apparently the British tanker has passed; what they have said themselves and the claims that have been made are for creating tension and these claims have no value,” Zarif said. The IRGC also denied any involvement in the incident in a statement issued on Thursday, July 11. A manned U.S. reconnaissance aircraft watched the scene unfold from above.  The US observers reported that the British warship was less than five miles behind the tanker, but soon intercepted the Iranian boats and threatened to open fire. Iranian forces left without opening fire.  “The Royal Navy HMS Montrose, which was also there, pointed its guns at the boats and warned them over radio, at which point they dispersed,” one of the US officials said. “It was harassment and an attempt to interfere with the passage,” the other US official added. The US military acknowledged the incident in a statement but did not disclose any further details. “Commanding control in the military government and especially in the IRGC is very linear and it is unlikely that anything like this would have happened without clear directives through commanding officers, through linear lines of ranks,” said Al-Jazeera’s Zein Basravi.  rReporting from Tehran, he  hinted that it is not clear whether Iran was carrying out a probing attack or “a rogue group of military on the ground.” Escalating Tensions The incident came after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned on Wednesday, July 10, that the UK would face “repercussions” following the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker last week off the coast of Gibraltar. The British government said the Iranian tanker was suspected to be carrying two million barrels of crude oil to Syria. This move was in breach of European Union sanctions against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Tehran denied that the tanker was affiliated with Syria and interpreted its seizure as “piracy.” Iran also summoned the British envoy to Iran to protest against the action. Is there a way out of the Iran-US crisis? Tensions between Iran and the US, as well as its allies, have largely increased since last year when Washington unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal signed between Tehran and world powers in 2015. Since then, the administration of US President Donald Trump has accelerated economic sanctions against Iran. He has also moved to bring the country’s oil exports to zero as part of a “maximum pressure” policy to grant regional security. Several oil tankers were attacked in the waters near Iran’s southern coast in May and June 2019, for which the US blamed Iran; Tehran denied any involvement. Last month, Iran shot down a US drone near the Strait of Hormuz, prompting Trump to order retaliatory air raid, only to call them off at the last minute. On Tuesday, July 9, the US announced its decision to form a military coalition to safeguard strategic waters off the coasts of Iran and Yemen. Amid the pressure created by sanctions, Iran has delivered threats to disrupt oil flow through the strategic Strait.  In April 2019, an IRGC commander threatened to block all exports through the Strait if the blockade on Iranian exports were to continue.

Rabat – “Chibanis”, which translates to “white-hairs” in Arabic, are the North African workers who emigrated to France in the 60s and 70s, working and making up for labour shortages in the country. Under a new French law, chibanis will now be able to return to their country of origin, without risking losing their French pensioner rights. The law was voted in November 2018 and came into effect on July 1. Previously, if chibanis left France for more than six months, they would forfeit their rights to French social security benefits, in particular healthcare reimbursements. This meant that many were left torn between living in France and their country of origin. Some chose to return to Morocco, but were obliged to visitFrance every six months to remain eligible for payments.  Under the new law, immigrant retirees holding a Schengen visa, resident permit, or retirement card are able to seek medical treatment in France or in Morocco as they please, regardless of their country of residence.  To access these newly enshrined rights, retirees must have the “Carte Vitale CNAREFE,” proving they are receiving pension benefits. The card is issued by the National Center of French Retirees Living Abroad The law applies not only to Moroccans, but to all non-European migrants who have worked in France for over 15 years, and who have chosen to return to their country of origin, at least for part of the year. The Moroccan NGO “Cap Sud MRE” was instrumental to the changes in the law. The NGO raised the issue with the French government and has been advocating for the rights of chibanis since 2011. The new French law will benefit approximately 330 000 pensioners living outside the European Union, including 240 000 chibanis living in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.

The Moroccan Observatory for Prisons released its annual report in Rabat yesterday July 10, revealing Morocco’s incarceration figures for 2018. According to the report, 83 757 people were incarcerated last year, an increase of 655 prisoners from the 2017 figures. The increase “aggravates the phenomenon of overpopulation in prisons,” notes the report. The report finds that 12 of Morocco’s 15 prisons currently exceed their maximum inmate capacity. The prison of Al Arjat 1, a few kilometers north of Rabat, is at 205% of its capacity, while the Moul El Bergui Safi prison is at 173%. Morocco’s largest prison, the Oukacha prison in Casablanca, is at 172% capacity. Prison overpopulation has been an ongoing concern in Morocco, placing pressure on staff and inmates. The Delegation for Penal Administration and Reinsertion (DGAPR), the Moroccan government body responsible for prison administration is working to resolve the issue. In 2018, the DGAPR renovated prisons across Morocco, increasing the floor space per prisoner from 1.87 square meters to 1.89 square meters. DGAPR intends to launch a 2019-2021 strategy to increase floor space to 3 square meters per inmate. But floor space is not the only concern. Overcrowding places pressure on staff. In November last year, DGAPR reported prisons staffing was one staff member for 40 inmates during the day, and one staff member per 500 inmates at night. The situation “is exhausting human resources who are working in difficult and risky conditions,” said Mohamed Salah Tamek, the director of DGAPR at the law and finance budget for 2019 announcement last November.

Rabat – In a recent report written following a visit to Morocco for the Human Rights Council, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Racism Tendayi Achiume called on Morocco to fulfill its anti-discrimination and racial equality commitments. Achiume praised the Moroccan government’s 2011 Constitution for its “vision of a diverse but unified society, where all can enjoy full human rights and full political and social membership.” However, she cautioned that this vision “is one that the Government of Morocco – like all other governments, must continue to work hard to implement.” “Equality in law alone does not ensure equality in fact,” the Special Rapporteur continued. “Serious challenges persist and important work remains to be done to ensure racial equality and the right of all persons to be free from racial discrimination.” In her report, Achiume cited the lack of a comprehensive anti-racism framework as one of the biggest holes in Morocco’s fight to ensure equality. “Contrary to recommendations made by a variety of international and national stakeholders, Morocco has no comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation or specific law prohibiting racial discrimination,” said Achiume. This lack of framework hinders the enjoyment of human rights in Morocco, she added. “The adoption of a new law, or amendments to existing legislation, are urgently needed to fully implement the racial equality framework contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.” Achiume, who took up her role as UN Special Rapporteur on Racism in 2017, said that “persistent discrimination faced by Amazigh communities” further underscores this lack of legal framework. Amazigh people face discrimination, structural exclusion, and racist stereotyping on the basis of their Amazigh language and culture, said Achiume. She added that Amazigh women, in particular, are disadvantaged. “Amazigh women reported that they often experienced multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination on account of their gender and their Amazigh identity.” The UN expert says this discrimination requires the Moroccan government to “immediately ensure that individuals with Amazigh heritage enjoy, among other rights, equal access to justice, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and economic, social and cultural rights.” She also referred to Article 5 of the Moroccan Constitution on the status of Amazigh language, calling the government to implement it through the adoption of organic laws. Her report not only focused on Amazigh communities, it also highlighted the discrimination migrants and refugees allegedly face in Morocco, who mostly come from Subsaharan Africa. “Some migrants and refugees, especially those of black, sub-Saharan origin, reported incidents of racist and xenophobic stereotyping when accessing health care, housing, education and employment, and in other settings.” Achiume also expressed concern that Subsaharan migrants are subject to forced relocations, evictions, and racial profiling, as well as other forms of discrimination. According to Achiume, further reforms are needed to ensure their rights to racial equality and freedom from racial discrimination. “Although national law and policy guarantees a range of rights to migrants and refugees on an equal basis in all of these contexts, rights violations persist and discrimination remains a key barrier to integration,” she said. She also urged Morocco to “stop any and all immigration enforcement policies that result in gross human rights violations, including in forests in the north and other regions close to its frontiers with Europe. “ She added that to ensure the rights and safety of migrants in Morocco, “the European Union and its member states must take responsibility for the role they must play.” “Europe must take active steps to create legal pathways for migration, including for Moroccans and other African migrants who seek to migrate. And international organizations, including the International Organisation for Migration, must ensure that human rights are front and center in all practices,” she said. Despite the reforms she recommended, Achiume finished off the report by acknowledging and commending Morocco for its leadership and “tremendous steps to advance the human rights of migrants and refugees.” She also said was heartened by the government’s “political will” and “praiseworthy commitment” to protecting and integrating these vulnerable populations. She also praised the government’s “rejection of European Union attempts to locate offshore asylum processing or “regional disembarkation” centers within Moroccan territory.”

Rabat – The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), an international body that settles sports-related disputes, has appointed Moroccan lawyer Karim Adyel as an arbitrator. Adyel becomes the first Moroccan lawyer ever to be appointed as a CAS arbitrator. Although he pursued a career in law, the Moroccan judge is passionate about sports and was a tennis player in the 80s. “My passion for sports law and my specialization in the field stems from my love for sports, and particularly as I was a tennis player in the 80s,” Adyel told Maghreb Arab Press agency (MAP). He added that the arbitrator must have several qualities, namely “neutrality, confidentiality, discretion and professional competence.” He further specified that an arbitrator must also have impartiality in his relations with all sports components. Karim Adyel is also a professional mediator, international consultant, as well as a member of the International Association of Football Lawyers (AIAF). The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is an institution independent of any sports organization. It was established to settle sports-related disputes through arbitration or mediation, by means of procedural rules adapted to the­ specific needs of the sports world. Founded in 1984; the CAS is placed under the administrative and financial authority of the International Council of Arbitration for Sport (ICAS). The Court has nearly 300 arbitrators from 87 countries, chosen for their specialist knowledge of arbitration and sports law. Around 300 cases are registered by the CAS every year.

Rabat – On July 2, two successive airstrikes hit the Tajoura detention center, located in the outskirts of Libya’s capital, Tripoli. Part of a large military compound, the center housed approximately 600 people at the time of the attack, including 18 Moroccans. The strikes killed at least 53 people and left 130 more injured. The survivors, still held at the center after the bombings, protested over the weekend to demand safer housing conditions. On Wednesday, July 9, officials allowed the migrants to leave the center, some relocating to temporary aid facilities. However, their safety and security remains in question. “Aid organizations don’t protect us from bombs and fear,” one teenager told Voice of America as he walked away from the center. The situation at Tajoura became so dire following the July 2 attack that hundreds of migrants went on a hunger strike to protest their conditions and demand release. Others slept outside, fearing the building could be targeted in another attack. Two and a half years after Libya and Italy signed a Memorandum of Understanding to curtail illegal migration into Europe, immigrants held in Libyan detention centers continue to pay a heavy price. The agreement between the two countries, and endorsed by European leaders, aimed to “stem the influx of illegal migrants.”  As a result, migrants caught by Italian authorities while trying to cross into the country by sea would be brought back to Libya and held in crowded detention centers.  Libya remains one of the most common points of departure into Europe for refugees fleeing countries in Africa and the Middle East. These migrants have become victims trapped in the crossfire between the UN-backed General National Army (GNA) and General Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. The violence in Tripoli increased in early April when General Haftar’s troops advanced on the GNA-controlled capital.  Both sides have blamed the opposition for the deadly airstrikes on the detention center, which the UN said may constitute a war crime. The UNHCR released a statement saying “55 of the most vulnerable refugees, which included women, children, families and unaccompanied minors, were identified for relocation” elsewhere in Tripoli, then hopefully onward to a third country.   While still in Libya, the migrants remain vulnerable as the civil war continues.  “Options for humanitarian evacuations out of Libya continue to be limited,” the UNHCR said.

Rabat – The mother of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, the Danish tourist killed near Mount Toubkal, called on Moroccan justice to exert the death penalty on the four key perpetrators. Today, July 11, the lawyer of the Danish victim handed a letter from Jespersen’s mother to the Sale Court of Appeal, where the trial continues. Lawyer of the suspects Hafida Maksaoui told Morocco World News that the bereaved mother said in the letter that “the world will be better” without the perpetrators. She also thanked Moroccan security services for their efforts in the fight against terrorism. The mother of the victim is not the first to call for the defendants to be executed.  On June 27, the prosecution office in Morocco urged the Court of Appeal in Sale to sentence the three main suspects to death. While capital punishment remains legal in Morocco, no executions have been carried out since 1993. On June 27, Maksaoui told Morocco World News that the public prosecutor also condemned the “savagery” of the crimes, asking for the ultimate punishment. During the same trial session, the prosecution office also disclosed the autopsy report which outlined the horrific injuries sustained by the two victims. The report showed that Jespersen sustained 23 injuries. A rupture in the neck and decapitation caused her tragic death. She was injured in her left eye, forehead, and left ear. She also sustained several other injuries to her left hand, fingers, and leg. Norwegian victim Maren Ueland suffered seven injuries and two fractures, one of which was in her ribcage. She also suffered from a deep wound of 20 centimeters on her throat. Moroccan security services apprehended 23 suspects involved in the double murder, including a Spanish-Swiss suspect. The four main suspects, Moroccan nationals, who committed the crime later appeared in a video to pledge allegiance to the ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. The video surfaced days after security services found the bodies of the two victims on December 17, 2018. The  main suspects, who already confessed to the crimes attributed to them, are facing multiple charges. The list of charges includes: inciting people to commit terror acts, praising terrorism, and promoting extremism.

Rabat – Morocco and India have shared cordial relations since as far back as the 14th century, when the scholar and explorer Ibn Batuta embarked on a journey to India. Centuries later, India was among the nations active in supporting Morocco’s decolonization and independence, recognizing the country on June 20, 1956. Moreover, Morocco and India are both members of the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of 120 developing countries which are not formally aligned with any major world power. Regardless, both India and Morocco have made efforts over the last few years to further improve relations with one another. The latest move is a visit by an Indian naval vessel to the northern city of Tangier. On July 8, the Indian Naval Ship (INS) Tarkash dropped anchor at the port of Tangier for a three day visit to the country.  Considered one of the Indian Navy’s most state-of-the-art vessels, the INS Tarkash is currently part of the ongoing peace mission to the Mediterannean. The mission is intended to further cement India’s relations with Morocco, among other countries. During its stay in Tangier’s port, a number of Moroccan officials — including high-ranking naval officers — are scheduled to visit the vessel. The Tarkash has also planned to participate in a number of activities with the Royal Moroccan Navy, including a Passage Exercise at sea. For years India has been working to establish stronger relations with Morocco, and the Tarkash’s stay in Tangier is another step in strengthening the bond between Morocco and India. Beginning with the India-Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi, bilateral relations between India and Morocco have drastically improved over the years, exemplified by 19 ministerial visits between the two countries since the forum in 2015. In 2018, trade between the two countries surpassed $1.5 billion USD, with the commercial relationship between Morocco and India being the best it has ever been. With both Morocco and India continually becoming more powerful players in international affairs, each country has seen the relationship as a mutually beneficial opportunity. Relations between the two countries will remain cordial for the foreseeable future.

Rabat – How much does Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) pay Herve Renard for his services with the Moroccan football team? The answer may further irritate his rapidly expanding circus of critics. Ahead of last year’s World Cup in Russia, reports indicated that Renard was by far the highest paid coach in Africa. At the time, Renard was reportedly paid MAD 800,000 (€ 80,000) per month. However, recently updated figures by Al Massae, the same Arabic language newspaper that revealed last year’s statistics, show that Morocco almost doubled the Frenchman’s salary ahead of the ongoing continental football contest. The current number, €120,000, maintained Renard in his, by now familiar, status as the African coach with the highest remuneration, and royal treatment. Far behind Renard stood the now sacked Javier Aguirre of Egypt (€108,000), Cameroon’s Clarence Seedorf (€96,000), South Africa’s Stuart Baxter (€62,300), and Algeria’s Djamel Belmadi (€50,000). Al Massae also revealed that the coaching staff of the Atlas Lions was overall the most “spoiled” at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). Renard’s two assistants, the French Patrice Beaumelle and the Moroccan Mustapha Hadji, were more handsomely paid than most head coaches at the tournament. Beaumelle’s reported €55,000 salary puts him well above Algeria’s Belmadi, whereas Hadji’s €30,000 put him on equal footing with Guinea’s Belgian head coach, Paul Put, who according to the Guinean football federation is the fifth highest paid coach in Africa. Besides the glaring disconnect between the Moroccan staff’s princely treatment and its meager results, the most arresting detail for Atlas Lions fans may be that Beaumelle’s salary is superior to that of Belmadi, who has so far had a fabulous CAN with Algeria. (Belmadi has done wonders with the Algerian team since coming on board in August of last year. Under his tenure, Algeria has put to rest the series of disappointments that followed their brilliant world Cup in Brazil five years ago. Algeria, now the grand continental favorite, is playing today, July 11, in the CAN quarterfinals against Ivory Coast. Whatever happens in today’s game, though, there is already a robust sense among the whopping majority of CAN watchers that Belmadi’s Algeria has produced the most tactically mature and ruthlessly clinical football in Egypt, something many Moroccan fans expected from their Renard-coached Lions.) The news of Renard’s stupendous salary demands comes as Morocco’s spirit-dumping elimination from the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations is quickly turning into a live trial for both the players and the coaching staff. Increasingly—and predictably—the team’s head coach has become the living embodiment of the monumental failure in Egypt, with questions now flying from everywhere to scrutinize the massive disparity between his priceless treatment and his lukewarm results with the Moroccan national team. With this Al Massae report, many critics may feel further emboldened to ask for radical changes in high places of Moroccan football. But while Renard’s job is obviously on the line, the Frenchman has so far reacted with surprising composure. “I have a contract with the [Moroccan] federation until 2021, and I intend to honor it,” he said immediately after the last-16 debacle against Benin. Most recently, he has said that he is “taking the necessary time” to reflect on his future with the team. Will Renard stay? Months ago, Moroccans’ response to that question would be an energetic, “He should” or a gigantic, wholehearted, “YES! We love our coach, for God’s sake…” This time around, though, almost no one, even Renard’s harshest critics or loudest supporters (and they are not many at this point), seems rushing to say the obvious. Not that he should stay, but that yes, it has been a lovely journey, but can we please part ways here, to avoid hard feelings should this last longer than it really should? So Renard is left alone in his thinking, with most Moroccans hoping, and critics inaudibly but no less aggressively demanding that he make the right choice. Renard seems to have heard it all, the silent entreaties that he not make this more awkward than it already is. With the unmistakable uneasiness among Moroccan fans and the sinking feeling of an establishing pattern of what ifs and disastrous near-misses, it will be of little surprise if, in the following days or weeks, both the federation and Renard resort to severing ties. Renard could say for example: “Everyone could see that we were the better team in all of our matches; that we were and deserved being among the most serious contenders for this year’s CAN; that we played with our hearts out but lacked the bit of luck that could have made the difference, all the difference. I am sorry to have disappointed you, but I am proud to have been part of this amazing journey. I feel that it is perhaps time to try something else with somebody else. Thank you for everything.”
Or he may not. But should he, Moroccan football fans will most probably call for a “man of the country” to manage the Atlas Lions, some sort of a Moroccan version of Belmadi– to inspire rupture and change where a series of the most kingly treated European coaches have failed. But who will be Morocco’s Belmadi? Again Rachid Taoussi or Badou Zaki, whose good but not entirely satisfying results paved the way for Renard’s appointment in the first place? Or rather Jamal Sellami, the coach of the local national team, whose CHAN exploits remain the sole, tiny silver lining in four decades of fiascos of successive Moroccan teams? “To stay or not to stay,” that was Renard’s question months ago as his team’s underwhelming but brave World Cup performance revealed glimpses of fissures in the FRMF-Renard romance. But times have changed, and very dramatically so. “To resign or be pushed out,” is the new question.

Rabat – A video of Moroccan journalist Alae Sanawbari pretending to be broke and asking for help from Egyptians  has gone viral. The Chouf TV journalist carried out his prank following the 2019 African Cup Nations Morocco-Benin match in Egypt on Friday, July 5.  Wearing a Moroccan flag t-shirt, the journalist, man tried his luck with several Egyptians,convincing them that he had lost his money,  flight ticket to return to Morocco, and his identity card.  The video shows the Moroccan man attempting to speak Egyptian dialect mixed with Moroccan Arabic (Darija) to convey his message to Egyption passersby. The first scene shows the Moroccan man talking to a woman, telling her that he lost all his papers and he needs money to eat as he had not eaten for two days. The young man, however, was not successful in convincing her of his plight. However, the Moroccan national did convince a number of other Egyptians. Several Egyptians reacted by lending a helping hand to the Moroccan man, offering him money as well as a place to stay for the night. “We are all one, you would have done the same for me if the same case happened to me in Morocco,” a young Egyptian man told the Moroccan national. Another Egyptian man said: “Come with me so we can eat first, after that we will go to my house to sleep. I shall take you to the Moroccan embassy tomorrow morning.”

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced the new format for African nations hoping to qualify for the World Cup 2022. The format is different from the 2018 World Cup in Russia, however, it is the same as the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The CAF determined three phases for World Cup 2022 qualification:  The 40 teams will be divided into 4 levels according to the FIFA ranking. Each of the 10 groups will include a team from each level. In 2018, the CAF used a different system for World Cup qualification. The system consisted of two knock-out stages and a group stage.  The group stage included twenty teams divided into 5 groups.  The highest ranked team of each group qualified directly to the World Cup, namely Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, Senegal, and Egypt. The 2022 Qatar World Cup will be the last to contain 32 teams. Future World Cups will feature 48 teams competing for the most prestigious title in football.

Rabat – “Unfinished business” is the caption Morocco’s kickboxing champion Badr Hari used to announce the date of the revenge fight against Dutch Glory Heavyweight champion Rico Verhoeven. Hari announced that his Glory Collision 2 fight against Rico will take place on December 21. The kickboxing superstar has been promising fans a re-match with Rico after his recovery.

The superstar has fulfilled his promise and was the first to announce the date of the fight on his Instagram account. During his break to recover, Hari has been working hard to generate strength for his future adventures “I cannot push myself beyond the limits because I have no limits,” Hari wrote in one of his posts on Instagram.   I cannot push myself beyond the limits because I have no limits.  #TheyAreNotPrepared A post shared by  Badr Hari (@badrhariofficial) on Jun 16, 2019 at 7:30am PDT  Hari’s fans often give  the 34-year old superstar the nickname of the “beast” or the “golden boy” to describe his commitment to work out and strength. Verhoeven also expressed excitement over the rematch. On his Instagram, the Glory champion said: “the wait is over… On December 21st I’ll finish what I’ve started.”   The wait is over….

In 2018, Rico challenged the Moroccan golden  kickboxing superstar, saying “I am waiting when I will be informed of the date and the location where the combat will take place.” In August, Hari wrote a post on Instagram, saying “I don’t like retrospectives because there is still much work (KOs) to be done but it seems to be a (funny) list day…. Unreachable Bad Boy. There will be no loophole for my opponents,” citing some of the most challenging games he has won.

Rabat –  Platinum Power and CFHEC will also partner on renewable energy projects elsewhere in Africa, reports Reuters. This will be the first time the companies have partnered on a project. Platinum Power is a Morocco-based company, majority-owned by US investment fund Brookstone Partners. It specializes in the development, financing, and construction of renewable energy projects. It is a key player in the hydropower industry in Morocco. In October last year, the company received authorization from the Moroccan Ministry of Energy to build eight new hydropower projects across the country. Platinum Power is also currently developing projects in Cameroon and Ivory Coast.

Rabat – In apparent response to calls that the destination of Tindouf-bound humanitarian aid be more effectively monitored, the UN will act to establish stricter controls in concerned areas. According to reports, the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, wants to make it part of his legacy on the Western Sahara question that cases of reported smuggling and mismanagement of international aid to Tindouf refugees be effectively dealt with. That determination to strictly monitor Tindouf-bound aid was in full display last week as dozens of officials from the MINURSO—the UN peacekeeping mission in the disputed territory—took part in “special” seminars and technical trainings as a prelude to a “new electronic surveillance” system to track the movements of Tindouf-bound aid. Reporting on the move in its July 10 edition, Moroccan Arabic language newspaper Assabah emphasized the political repercussions of the development on both the separatist Polisario Front’s legitimacy claims and “political game” in the distressed Tindouf refugee camps. According to the paper, the development is “another devastating blow” to the separatist front, especially considering that most of the UN resolutions of the Western Sahara conflict have tended to adopt, perhaps incidentally, Morocco-friendly talking points. During last week’s “special trainings,” Colin Stewart, the MINURSO chief coordinator, and Major General Zia Ur Rehman, commander of the MINURSO forces, supervised the mission’s administrative and military officials as they were introduced to the new electronic mechanism to monitor the entry, exit, and distribution of humanitarian aid to the afflicted Tindouf refugees. In addition to highlighting Guterres’ “personal involvement” in ending years of embezzlement or misuse of UN aid, Assabah argued, last week’s episode also came with a strong message as to Guterres’ position on the importance of the peacekeeping operation. MINURSO has been at the forefront of heated debates in UN Security Council discussions. Most recently, the US questioned the effectiveness of the mission and asked—successfully—that its mandate be reviewed to six months as opposed to the traditional one-year period. By contrast, the official announcement of last week’s training sessions provided a glimpse of the UN Secretary General’s unchanged confidence in the necessity of keeping MINURSO operational. The document points to an working budget of $60.45 million from July 2019 to June 2020, a conspicuous deviation from the Security Council’s decision that the peacekeeping mission be only valid for a renewable six-month mandate. The contrast, although not a very pointed one, speak volumes about Guterres’ own take on MINURSO. The Portuguese diplomat appears to genuinely believe that the body is of great significance in brokering the much-hoped for political settlement in the decades-long stalemate in Western Sahara. As far as the soon-to-be-upgraded monitoring mission goes, Guterres’ instructions to MINURSO officials stressed that effectiveness not be only limited to the tracking of humanitarian aid. In addition to the aid-tracking electronic system, the UNSG reportedly instructed that air and maritime surveillance be increased in disputed areas to more easily identify and track all violations of the UN spirit in the Western Sahara standstill, from Polisario’s reported embezzlement of humanitarian aid to all stakeholders’ reported episodic violations of the UN-brokered ceasefire agreement. The news of UN upgrading its monitoring of Tindouf-bound products is sure to be welcomed in Morocco with a sympathetic nod. Rabat has been one of the most vocal voices in the Polisario and Algeria-damning chorus regarding the mismanagement of Tindouf-bound humanitarian aid. Having repeatedly lashed out at Polisario and its Algerian backers for what it sees as sustained “human rights abuses” in the Tindouf camps, Rabat has unceasingly called for more international action to monitor the “tragic situation of the camps’ inhabitants due to the violation of their rights and the embezzlement of humanitarian aids.”

The Independent Union of Public Doctors (SIMSP) has announced that Moroccan public sector doctors will be on strike for five days during August. The scheduled strike comes as a protest against “the Health Ministry’s failure to manage the industry.” According to the SIMSP, the public health sector is collapsing, and the Ministry for Health is not taking enough action. Doctors will be on strike August 15, 16, and 19, as well as August 22 and 23, announced SIMSP in a press release. The strike will involve doctors from public institutions, except those working in emergency units and resuscitation wards. The boycott will also affect the medical caravans which treat patients located in regional areas, and school health campaigns (due to “the absence of medical and administrative norms”).   Medical examinations in specialized diagnostic centers, and the preparation of medical certificates required for driving licence tests will also be affected by the upcoming strikes.. Public doctors are angry about the working conditions in the sector. SIMSP wants action to be taken now in relation to “the improvement of work conditions,” and the improvement of patient management “to preserve human dignity and the constitutional right to health.”  The increase in wages, including the payment of additional benefits, and “the provision of security in public health institutions in response to growing verbal and physical attacks on staff,” rank amongst a  number of other requests. Ongoing protests Doctors have been protesting on and off since 2017, with strikes gaining momentum this year. On April 29, hundreds of doctors demonstrated outside parliament in Rabat. “If we don’t protest like this, then the government will never listen, and everything will get worse,” a Marrakech-based female general physician told Morocco World News, requesting anonymity due to employment concerns. The public medical industry is also dealing with mass resignations. In April, close to 300 doctors resigned in the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region citing; “the deterioration of the health system in the Tangier region and the absence of [proper] work conditions in public hospitals.” In its press release this week, SIMPS draws attention to the fact that over a thousand public sector doctors have resigned. Compounding the staff shortage problems, “only a few dozen doctors have joined the public service, despite over 500 jobs opening up.”  “The Government must hold its promises and respond favourably to our requests in a serious and responsible way,” SIMSP added.

Rabat – Eid Al-Adha is a religious holiday celebrated annually by Muslims worldwide on the 10th of the month of Dhu Al-Hijjah.  It is the last and sacred month in the Hijri Calendar (Islamic lunar calendar) and is the month in which the Hajj (pilgrimage) takes place. During the religious holiday, Muslims sacrifice cattle, sheep, or goats in observance of the Sunna of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The sacrifice is a commemoration of the Prophet Abraham’s “unfinished” sacrifice of his son Ismail. In line with the astronomical forecasts, the current month of Dhu Al-Qaada began in Morocco on July 4.  Unlike other Muslim countries which accept the observation of the crescent with an optical lens of a telescope, the start of a new month in Morocco is officially announced only after observing the new crescent with the naked eye. The new moon of the month of Dhu Al-Hijjah will be born on the evening of August 1 but will be too small to be visible. However, on August 2, it will be visible to the naked eye throughout Morocco and even the Middle East. The month of Dhu Al-Hijjah 1440 will, therefore, begin the next day, August 3. The tenth day of the month will be August 12, 2019. Moroccans will celebrate Eid Al Adha 1440 on August 12 and 13.

Rabat – On July 9, the Court of Lisbon sentenced Moroccan national Abdessalam Tazi to 12 years in prison for his involvement with ISIS. The judge sentenced Tazi after the Portuguese court found the defendant guilty of recruiting young Moroccans to fight for ISIS. Most of the young men recruited by Tazi were of Moroccan nationality. The 65-year-old Moroccan national was convicted on seven charges. Besides recruiting fighters for ISIS, he was found guilty of providing financial support to the terrorist group via forged credit cards. However, the public prosecution office failed to find evidence proving Tazi’s direct affiliation with the leaders of ISIS.  During the hearing, the prosecutor recognized that Tazi was a highly intelligent person who had been able to bring Moroccan citizens to Portugal with the intention of sending them to Syria. Tazi’s lawyer, Lopez Guerrero, told reporters that he was surprised to hear the verdict, stating that he was considering an appeal. “He was acquitted of belonging to an international terrorist organization, but he was convicted of recruiting people to an organization he does not belong to,” he added.

Rabat – MASEN opened tender applications for Phase II of the Noor Midelt solar project on July 9, requesting interested parties submit pre-qualification documents. Applications for tender will close on September 16 at 10 am GMT.  This is the first step in the selection process for the private partner which will take charge of the design, financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of Phase II of the Noor Midelt solar plant in Morocco’s central north-west region. The Noor Midelt solar project will be made up of two solar plants which will combine thermosolar and photovoltaic technology to produce 800 MW of renewable energy, with a storage capacity of 5 hours. The hybrid technology will optimize energy production, leading to competitive pricing (MAD 0.68 per KwH at peak time). Noor Midelt will be built over two phases. In May, Masen announced the winning bidder for Phase I, which will be led by French company EDF Renouvelables in collaboration with UAE renewables developer and operator Masdar, as well as Moroccan company Green of Africa. The Noor Midelt project is part-financed by the World Bank, which provided USD 125 million towards the project last year. The Noor Midelt power complex will be Morocco’s second concentrated solar power technology complex, after Noor Ouarzazate. Noor Ouarzazate is also being built in phases, and once complete it will be the second-largest solar plant in the world after Solar Star in California. The Noor Midelt project is part of Morocco’s broader renewable energy strategy, which has promoted solar, hydroelectric and wind farm projects across the country. Morocco’s objective is to produce 52% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.

Rabat – The vast majority of Jazzablanca’s listeners attended the BMCI Stage, open to the public and located by Casablanca’s United Nations Plaza downtown. The same press release shared that “more than 65,000 people [attended] the 12 concerts of the BCMI Stage.” On another side of the city, nearly 14,000 people attended the 40 concerts hosted at the Casa-Anfa Hippodrome. Headlining the event was Grammy-nominated Scottish rock group Franz Ferdinand. Michael Kiwanuka, a Ugandan-British artist played on Thursday, July 4, serenading Casablanca with his soulful, politically engaged songs like “Black Man In A White World.” Metronomy, an electronic band also hailing from the British Aisles, played their electronic anthems on the Anfa Stage, on Friday, July 5. Trinidad and Tobago’s Calypso Rose performed calypso ballads from her 6-decade long career, bringing Afro-Caribbean music to Casablanca. Meanwhile, Al McKay’s Earth Wind &amp; Fire performed funk classics such as “Let’s Groove” and “Boogie Wonderland.” Jazzablancaalso welcomed 76-year-old saxophone virtuoso Maceo Parker who blew Casablanca away on Saturday, July 6. Parker’s virtuosity on saxophonist earned him collaborations with Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, and James Brown. Jazzablanca made official calls for Moroccan performers in March 2019, a call answered by  Gnawa musician Mehdi Nassouli and the Moroccan DJ, Daox, among others. Despite being bolstered by a 4,000-person margin, Jazzablanca 2019’s numbers are still dwarfed when compared to those of Rabat’s festival, Mawazine, which is currently the largest festival in the world to date, with a whopping 2,750,000 concert-goers in 2019. On Saturday, June 29, some 200,000 people attended on a single night, to hear a performances of reggaetón stars Maluma and Karol G.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has finalized the draft decree No. 2.19.328, related to the application of Law No. 2.18.781 on the establishment of the Moroccan Health Insurance Fund (CMAM). The CMAM is a single fund meant to replace all national insurance funds including the National Fund of Social Welfare Organizations (CNOPS), and public sector cooperative funds. According to a statement by the Department of the Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, the draft decree is expected to be presented for discussion to the Government Council on July 11.  The CMAM will be responsible for providing the basic Compulsory Health Insurance system (AMO) for the benefit of employees, pensioners, their beneficiaries in the public sector.  The CMAM will also cater to students in the public and private sectors, victims of human rights violations during the period between 1956 and 1999, and their dependents. According to CNOPS’ website, the number of AMO beneficiaries (managed by CNOPS) reached 3.030.448 people by the end of 2017, with an overall increase of 0.2% compared to 2016. However, the text of the decree-law says, “for more than 13 years, we have observed several shortcomings in the implementation of the provisions related to the governance of the AMO managed by CNOPS.” The decree-law further states that the aim of “the creation of the CMAM is to contribute to the reform of this public service by subjecting it to the rules of good governance to which all public institutions are subject.” The CMAM is expected to handle all the missions previously assigned to CNOPS, as well as its personnel, files, and contracts. The Council will also consider a draft decree related to the extension of the term of office of certain members of the Board of Directors of CNOPS, the statement continues.  On the same topic, the Council will examine proposals for appointment to high office in accordance with Article 92 of the Constitution. The draft decree aims to implement the law establishing the CMAM, focusing on the articles related to the government authority responsible for trusteeship, the board members, and the procedures of their appointment. According to Article 1 of the draft decree, the governmental authority in charge of employment is to be responsible for the CMAM, taking into account the powers vested in the Minister of Economy and Finance. The latter, together with the Minister of Labor and Vocational Integration, will be responsible for the implementation of the draft decree, as stipulated in Article 6. Finally, Article 5 states that members of the Board of Directors will be appointed by the Head of Government, for a period of five years, renewable only once.

Rabat – The UK Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office confirmed that 65-year-old Sir Kim Darroch’ resigned from his post as British ambassador to the USon Wednesday, July 10, 2019. The diplomat’s resignation came amid the eruption of a diplomatic row between the US and the United Kingdom.  “The current situation makes it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like,” Sir Kim said following the leak to the Daily Mail newspaper of critical comments about the Trump administration. Some of the British ambassador’s remarks addressed the Trump administration as “uniquely dysfunctional, clumsy and inept.” “That tranche of documents – diplomatic telegrams – was leaked by either a politician or civil servant who is sympathetic to Donald Trump and wanted to embarrass the ambassador,” said Al Jazeera’s Laurence Lee from London. Following the leak, Trump launched on Monday, July 8, a volley of tweets against UK Prime Minister Theresa May. The tweets also state that the United States would “no longer deal” with the British diplomat following the leak of his assessments.  “The wacky Ambassador that the UK foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with,” US President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday, July 9. “I don’t know the Ambassador but have been told that he is a pompous fool,” added the American president. Inquiry In the meantime, Britain has launched an inquiry to investigate the leak of the diplomat’s confidential memos which caused the backlash from the US president. .  “Contact has been made with the Trump administration setting out our view that we believe the leak is unacceptable,” UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesperson told reporters. In response, Trump took on twitter to criticize May’s handling of Brexit,   saying she disregarded his advice. “What a mess she and her representatives have created,” Donald Trump wrote. “The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister.” “While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent State Visit last month – it was the Queen who I was most impressed with,” the US President added. Just last month, Donald Trump enjoyed his visit to the UK and talked to the historic and deep links between the two countries.  Hours after Trump’s tweet, May’s spokesperson reiterated Britain’s initial stance on the leak’s unfortunate nature.  The spokesperson added that Sir Kim “continues to have the prime minister’s full support” over the matter.  Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, one of two men who might replace May as prime minister by the end of the month, said: “I have made it clear that I don’t share the ambassador’s assessment of either the US administration or relations with the US administration.”  Hunt added that “I do defend his right to make that frank assessment.” Diplomats serving abroad are obliged to send honest assessments to their home country’s government, as part of their mission.  Hunt promised “serious consequences” for whoever had leaked the memos. In fact, this is not the first time this year that confidential UK government information has been leaked to the public. In May 2019, May fired Defense Minister Gavin Williamson after secret discussions in the National Security Council about Chinese telecoms firm Huawei were disclosed to the media. An inquiry is currently in progress to determine who is behind the second serious leak of confidential material this year. May’s spokesperson said police would be involved if any evidence of criminality is found.

Rabat – The High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami announced Tuesday, July 9, in Casablanca that Morocco’s economy is expected to grow by 3.4% in 2020 compared to 2.7% in 2019. Alami explained, at a press conference dedicated to the presentation of the national economic situation in 2019 and its outlook in 2020, that the value-added of the primary sector will slightly increase by 4.6% instead of a decline of 2.1% in 2019. He further noted that the non-agricultural sector is expected to increase by 3.2%, up by 0.4% from 2018. The increase is due to the improvement of secondary activities by 3.5%, up by 0.5% from 2018. As for tertiary activities, Alami predicted a 3% growth, up by 0.3% from 2018.  In the secondary sector, processing industries are predicted to continue their recovery, growing by 3% in 2019. The economist noted that the building and public works sector will grow by 1% in 2019, up by 0.9% from 2018. This growth is thanks to an increase in the number of infrastructure projects. Alami added that the mining sector’s added value would continue to improve, forecasting a growth of 3.9% in 2019, down by 0.8% from 2018.  Market services are expected to grow by 3% in 2019, up from 2.4% recorded on average between 2013 and 2018. Services provided by public administrations are predicted to generate an added value of 3.4%, up by 0.9% from 2018. The HCP projected a decline in inflation from 1.1% in 2018 to 0.8% in 2019. Alami went on to add that Morocco’s budget deficit is expected to jump to 4.5% of GDP in 2019, up by 0.8% from 2018. He added that considering privatization revenues, the deficit will fall to 3.6% of GDP. The national savings are predicted to experience a slight decline from 27.6% of GDP in 2018 to 27.3% in 2019. The savings are expected to remain lower than the gross investment which will experience a decline from 33.5% of GDP in 2018 to 32.6% in 2019. The external trade balance of goods and services is expected to rise to 18.7% of GDP in 2019, up by 0.1% from 2018. The overall public debt ratio will continue to notably increase to reach 81.3% of GDP in 2019 compared to 73.4% on average from 2010 to 2017, and an average of 60.2% from 2005 to 2009. The overall debt ratio of the Treasury is expected to increase to 65.3% of GDP, up by 0.4% from 2018.

By Perri Huggins Rabat – Friday marked a long-sought milestone for Sudan’s tenacious masses. Ethiopian and African Union (AU) mediators helped opposition groups and the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) reach an agreement after months of unrest.  The TMC facilitated a military takeover in April of this year, ousting former president Omar al-Bashir. Since the coup, a powerful movement continues to protest. Civil society calls for civilian-led government rather than military rule.  Per Friday’s agreement, a council run by five military members and six civilian representatives will rule the country on a rotating basis. The council will rotate “for a period of three years or slightly more,” said Mohamed Hassan Lebatt, an AU mediator.  The council is expected to install a temporary parliament and a new government during the three-year transitional period. This could be a major step forward for a country which started protesting the authoritarian leader’s rule as food prices soared back in December.  Following a long struggle, not all believe the agreement’s implementation will succeed.  “We would like to see many more guarantees from the TMC because they’ve made many promises on handing over power only to backtrack later on,” 34-year-old engineer Mohamed Ismail told Al Jazeera. The agreement also mandates an independent investigation into a violent military crackdown in Khartoum, since dubbed “the Ramadan Massacre.” Attacks on June 3 left hundreds dead, bodies thrown into the Nile, men, women, and children raped en masse, and set a precedent for unchecked violence against civilians.  The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which back the TMC, tweeted a response to the agreement on Friday: “We hope that the next phase will witness the foundation of a constitutional system that will strengthen the role of institutions with broad national and popular support,” posted UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash.  He added that Abu Dhabi will stand with Sudan “in good times and bad times.” In a sad twist of irony, the Sudanese people could not access this online message. The Sudanese suffered a month-long internet blackout. As of Tuesday, internet access is slowly being restored. “Keep in mind that many of those out on the streets are only aware of what was announced in the presser (thanks to internet blackout) and not the composition of the presidential council or that TMC will choose their “President” first,” tweeted Sudan-based journalist Yousra Elbagi on Friday. Both parties are expected to officially sign the agreement within the next few days.

Rabat – The Moroccan General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) and the embassy of Japan in Morocco signed an agreement on a project for the reintegration of young Moroccan detainees and the fight against violence on Wednesday, July 10. The agreement between Morocco and Japan on the reintegration program also includes the signing of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Fully funded by the Japanese government, the one-year reintegration project seeks to  prevent violence and re-offending. It also aims to have a tangible impact both in prisons and in society, said a press release from the DGAPR. The strategy aims to humanize prison  conditions, reintegration of prisoners, safety, and security of detainees. The strategy also takes into account the environment, gender, and level of vulnerability. UNDP will collaborate with DGAPR in the implementation of the strategy conditions. The strategy benefited from the Japanese government’s grant, as well as technical support from the Rabita Mohammadia of Uelma [scholars] (RMP). The program aims to ensure the rights of inmates in line with the international laws and regulations for detainees. According to the UNDP, the DGAPR has “the necessary tools and skills to implement its strategy and monitor the prison population. UNDP also trusts DGAPR’s skills to mainstream the environment, gender and vulnerability.” The project also includes  a religious aspect to promote tolerance and the prevention of extremism in the prisons of Meknes, Sale, Kenitra, Agadir, Safi, and Fez. Vocational training, which will allows inmates to find job opportunities after serving their sentences, is another part of the project. The  vocational training workshops includes carpet weaving and traditional sewing in the local prison of Bourkaiz in Fez, ceramic pottery at the Safi local prison, and tapestry in the Ait Melloul Local prison 2 in Agadir. UNDP said that the first phase of the program was the project “Support to Reform the Prison System for Better Reintegration.” The project, according to the statement, is part of the program to support the implementation of the 2016-è2018 DGAPR strategy in partnership with UNDP. The project is a one-year initiative (2016-2017), which was fully funded by the government of Japan. “The project allowed partnerships and  exchanges of good practices at the international level,” according to UNDP. The project also includes a religious aspect to promote tolerance and the prevention of extremism in the prisons of Meknes, Sale, Kenitra, Agadir, Safi, and Fez. Vocational training, which will allows inmates to find job opportunities after serving their sentences, is another part of the project. The  vocational training workshops include carpet weaving and traditional sewing in the local prison of Bourkaiz in Fez, ceramic pottery at the Safi local prison, and tapestry in the Ait Melloul Local prison 2 in Agadir.

Rabat – On Monday, July 8, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled the Trump Administration’s new Commission on Unalienable Rights.  Pompeo said the panel was created to provide an “informed review of the role of human rights in American foreign policy.” Critics have expressed concern that the Commission may serve to roll back the same rights that it was assembled to defend.  Appointee to the Commission and Muslim Scholar Hamza Yusuf has been questioned for his willingness to coordinate with an administration repeatedly accused of Islamaphobia. American-born Hamza Yusuf converted to Islam in 1977. In 2010 he co-founded Zeitouna University, the first Muslim college in the United States. The Guardian has described Yusef as “arguably the West’s most influential Islamic scholar.” Yusuf’s decision to align himself with the Trump administration has been harshly critiqued by his academic peers. Islamic scholar Dr Usaama al Azami said Yusuf’s choice “to throw in his lot with the most venal and Islamophobic administration in American history” was problematic, especially to fellow Muslims. Speaking to Middle East Eye, Azami described the move as “an unforgivable lapse in judgement which will not easily be forgotten.”  This is not the first time Yusuf has come under fire for his alliances. In 2018 Yusuf served as Vice President for the United Arab Emitates-founded Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies. At the forum, Yusuf described the UAE, whose government has a history of violating human rights, as “a country that is committed to tolerance.” Pompeo told reporters the commission would prioritize “principles” over “policy, but exactly how the panel would function or its actual objective remains unclear. Even the foundation of the Commission on Unalienable Rights has been called into question by critics. Harvard Law professor Mary Ann Glendon will head the Commission. The staunchly Catholic Glendon’s inclusion on the panel has raised alarm. Glendon, Pompeo’s former mentor and one time US Ambassador to the Vatican is vocally pro-life and once opposed the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS.  Pompeo’s use of ambiguous language when discussing human rights has caused concern as well. “How do we know or how do we determine whether that claim that this or that is a human right, is it true, and therefore, ought it to be honored?” Pompeo said when he unveiled the Commission at the State Department on Monday.  Pompeo described the commission’s panel as being composed of human rights experts of “varied backgrounds and beliefs.” The commision of ten individuals from a range of political and religious faiths is primarily white and male. The Trump administrations’ track record on human rights has been questioned on multiple occasions.  President Trump continues to support the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia used in the devastating war in Yemen. He has refused to condemn Saudi Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for his role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and expressed his appreciation for oppressive world leaders including President Kim Jong-un of North Korea and President Rodrigo Duterte of the Phillipeans.

Rabat – The French National Agency for the Safety of Health Products (ANSM) announced, on July 9, its decision to require laboratories to include an “Overdose = Danger” caution message on paracetamol-based medicine packages. This decision concerns more than 200 paracetamol-based products marketed in France. The ANSM has given pharmaceutical companies nine months to comply with the new caution message regulations.   The ANSM’s decision comes as part of their campaigns to reinforce the prevention of liver damage linked to overdose of paracetamol. According to an ANSM statement, this measure follows a public consultation launched by the agency in August 2018. The consultation aimed to sensitize patients and health professionals to the risk of toxicity to the liver in case of overdose. Paracetamol is the most commonly prescribed and used medicine. Alone or in combination with other active substances, it works as analgesic (anti-pain) or antipyretic (anti-fever) for adults and children. In 2011, paracetamol-based “Doliprane” ranked first as the most-sold medicine in Morocco both in terms of quantity and revenue. 17 million boxes of Doliprane were sold that year. Used wisely, paracetamol is safe and effective. “However in case of overdose, paracetamol can cause irreversible serious liver damage in some cases,” says the ASNM. The agency added that the misuse of paracetamol is the leading cause of drug-induced liver transplants in France. The term “overdose” refers to the use of an unsuitable dosage, an intake that is too large per dose or per day, and a minimum interval between doses which is not respected. Consuming more than 4 grams of paracetamol per day can damage the liver in 24 to 48 hours.

Rabat – While domestic violence remains one of the most serious concerns in Moroccan homes, the crushing majority of victims do not report it, a government-sponsored survey has found. Speaking in Rabat on Tuesday, July 9, at a forum on women’s rights in Morocco, Bassima Hakkaoui, the Moroccan Minister for Family, Solidarity, Equality, and Social Development, talked at length about the root causes of domestic violence in Morocco. Hakkaoui highlighted the country’s deep-seated patriarchy, arguing that societal constraints are keeping most victims of gender-based violence from speaking about their sometimes immensely traumatizing experiences. In practical terms, a whopping 93.4% of sexual violence victims have not reported their plight to authorities, according to the study. The study, which was sponsored by the government and conducted between January and March of this year, found that domestic violence and gender-based assaults are still alive and well in Morocco’s social fabric. The minister called gender-based violence a “prevailing reality” in Morocco, indicating that the national average for gendered violence stood at 54.4% at the time of the survey. Surprisingly, perhaps, the survey’s findings established that domestic violence is more pervasive in urban settings, with 55.8% women reported to have experienced it in some form—pointed or more subtle— between January and March. The figure stood at the slightly lower 51.6% for women in rural, remote zones. The survey predictably found that women aged 25-29 are the biggest victims of the bleak practice. 59.8% of women in that age category are said to have encountered gender-based violence in the past twelve months. But despite such concerning figures, the grim reality of domestic violence is especially worrying—and difficult to tackle—because the majority of women do not report it. Resigned to the patriarchal stereotypes of “brave women” whose courage fundamentally resides in “supporting the consequences,” however horrifying, of marriage or motherhood, only 6% of victims reported their situation to authorities. The contrast between the staggeringly high number of existing cases and the insignificant number of reported incidents may also have to do with the prevailing societal belief that families’ dirty laundries are not to be exposed in public. Hakkaoui regretted that so few women would approach authorities to denounce the plight that heir partners put them through in their households. She pointed out that existing legal frameworks to protect women will be of little use if women do not take it upon themselves to report their experiences. But the minister also suggested that authorities may bear part of the responsibility for the marginal number of reports. For women to file complaints against their partners, male relatives, or bosses, they first ought to know about the existence of the legal frameworks in their favor, as well as the administrative process needed to make use of those legal instruments. She said in this regard that the government and regional authorities must put more efforts in awareness raising campaigns to “inform and educate” women about their rights. Hakkaoui emphasized that women particularly need to be empowered and taught about human rights to embolden them to file complaints against their abusers. Other forms of violence highlighted in the study entailed psychological violence, digital or internet-based violence, as well as sexual assaults in public spaces or in work settings. 12.4% of Moroccan women faced sexual assaults in public spaces in the past twelve months, according to the survey, with the break down in terms of categories being: 66.5% of sexual nature, 49.1% of psychological nature, and 33.2% were physical assaults. 24.3% of female employees reported having been sexually assaulted, while 13.4% said they were victims of digital gendered violence. The two categories had a point in common: most of the women concerned are more often than not “educated” and “well-accomplished.” The statistics suggest that the more a woman is seen as “educated” and “emancipated,” the greater the likelihood of her facing gendered violence online or in “professional” settings. Minister Hakkaoui concluded by saying that Moroccan women are emerging as “invaluable agents” of the country’s socio economic developments in various walks of life. An interesting finding was that marriage is only one of the many contributing factors in the pervasiveness of domestic or gendered violence in general in Moroccan society. While the percentage of sexually assaulted married women remains high at 52.2%, it was even higher and more concerning among not-yet-married couples. 54.4% of women identified as “fiancées” were sexually assaulted by their partners in the past year. For divorced and widowed spouses, the percentage of sex-based violence stood at 30.9%. As women’s roles in and importance for public life grow, she stressed, the government and regional authorities should devise joint platforms to ensure that they be “economically empowered” and their rights as individuals also be protected.

Rabat  – Naima Zaizaa, an Arabic teacher who works with the Moroccan Embassy in Belgium, has filed a sexual harassment complaint against the program’s coordinator. Zaizaa works with the embassy’s ELCO program which aims to connect Belgian Moroccans with their culture. “As soon as I arrived in Brussels, this man had a bizarre behavior with me,” the 33-year-old teacher told Belgian newspaper DH. He reportedly commented on her physique multiple times and praised her for not wearing a veil. “I knew he did not just see me as a teacher and he had ideas in his head. He kept complimenting me, to the point that my colleagues even thought I was having a secret relationship with him,” Zaizaa continued. The coordinator also reportedly kept finding excuses to get Zaizaa in his office, telling her she “deserved a man who would help settle my situation in Belgium. “But, I saw through his game and avoided going to his office, especially after an incident where he touched me,” she continued. She also alleges that the coordinator, who is married, had a complete change of behavior to her after she rejected his advances and allegedly wrote several untrue reports about her work performance. Zaizaa’s complaint has been accepted by Brussels police.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami spoke about his rift with Moroccan international football player Hakim Ziyech in an interview. The international football player had accused the minister of lying concerning retirement rumors. Alami said in an interview that Ziyech was framed  by “some confused people.” Alami emphasized that the President of Morocco’s Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, contacted Ziyech to find out what had pushed the player to publish the instagram post in which he accused the minister of lying. . Alami said that Ziyech did not answer Lekjaa’s call, but his agent did. According to Alami, the football player admitted that he had been given false information. “He promised to clarify the issue and deleted the post after he knew the truth,” said Alami. On his Instagram, Ziyech published two posts, saying:  “Next time if you want to come up with something then come up with something true and no lies.” The instagram post came after Alami claimed in a plenary session at the parliament that Ziyech refuses to answer phone calls.  Alami claimed that Ziyech said that he “cannot continue in this condition and atmosphere,” questioning his future with the Atlas  Lions after the defeat of Morocco against Benin in the knockout stage of the 2019 African Cup of Nations. Alami suspected that there are some people who aim to “disrupt and destabilize the Moroccan team and unfortunately they succeeded.” Alami said that some people contacted Ziyech and “conveyed false news, such as the fact that I held a press conference and attacked him, and that I mentioned at the same conference his retirement.” Alami also condemned fake news about Ziyech regretting his choice to play for the Moroccan  national team. In the interview, Koora asked lamir directly about Ziyech’s possible retirement. When asked if he is “sure” that Ziyech plans to retire, Alami said that he does not tell lies.  “I hope Ziyech does not retire from playing with the national team. I was in Egypt, and I saw how painful it was for Ziyech when the national team was eliminated,” Alami said, commenting on the Atlas Lions’ match against Benin. Ziyech missed a penalty at the end of the match, which took place on July 5. He faced heavy criticism from some Moroccan football fans. “We tried to raise his spirits and did not succeed” Alami explained. Alami added that he was informed of Ziyech’s intention to stay away from the national team. Lekjaa repeatedly called the footballer to confirm the news of his retirement.  “I received the same news from a source  close to the player, who told me about Ziyech’s retirement.” The minister added that his statement on Ziyech’s retirement was not an attack on the player, but a response to those who had criticised  the midfielder after the Morocco-Benin mach in Egypt. “I defended him in parliament,” Alami said. The minister highly appreciated Ziyech’s choice to represent Morocco instead of the Netherlands. “He is our son,. We appreciate his patriotism. I personally will not hesitate to defend him after the fierce campaign against him which was created to destabilize the Atlas Lions.”

Rabat – World-renowned British chef and TV personality, Gordon Ramsay, looked to Morocco as the focus for an episode for his new 6-part National Geographic series, “Gordan Ramsay: Uncharted.” In the episode, Ramsay starts off exploring Morocco’s Atlas Mountains to get a taste of Amazigh (Berber) cuisine and culture. Along with Abdullah, a local who dubs himself the “King of Mushrooms,” Ramsey forages for mushrooms in the Middle Atlas mountains.  Fitted in a climbing harness, Ramsay and the guide rappel down the length of a waterfall into a canyon. “I’m a big adventurer and I love mushrooms,” he says. “But that’s the scariest descent I’ve ever done for a mushroom.”  Moving on from the Atlas Mountains, Ramsay turns his attention to Fez, one of Morocco’s most historic cities, commonly known as the “culture and culinary capital.”  “Every bite is steeped in history,” Ramsay says while sampling medfouna, Moroccan stuffed bread, with local restaurateur Najat Kaanache.  While they eat, Kaanache explains to Ramsay the deep history of the Amazigh people and how their attachment to their land lends the native flavors to every dish. Amazigh “land is where the people still have the traditions and the way of cooking,” says Kaanache. Wanting to dive in deeper into Amazigh cuisine and tradition, Ramsay then visits an Amazigh village during their Yennayer (new year) celebration. While there, he enlists 9-year old local Fatima to be his “sous chef,” who then welcomes him into her grandmother’s home to learn even more.  The experience seemed to touch Ramsay, who finished off the episode by saying “I’ve been humbled by these people’s incredible hospitality. I’ve learned techniques that go back centuries, and been reminded that you don’t need a fancy kitchen to produce truly outstanding cuisine,” says Ramsay. The full episode will premiere on August 5 on the National Geographic channel.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has denied rumours that its President, Fouzi Lekjaa was suspended for one year from all football-related activities within the African Confederation of Football (CAF). In a press release last night, the FRMF denied all allegations of its President’s suspension. A number of news sources reported yesterday, July 9, that the CAF had handed Fouzi Lekjaa a one year suspension from football, following a complaint made by the Ethiopian Football Federation (EFE). The EFE claimed  that Lekjaa had physically assaulted Ethiopian referee Bamalek Tessema.  FRMF has described rumors of Lekjaa’s suspension as “false information,” adding that “the CAF discipline commission will be holding a meeting on the matter with M. Lekjaa in the upcoming days.” Tessema refereed the CAF Cup final between the Egyptian team Al Zamalek and Moroccan football RS Berkane on May 26.  The EFE filed a complaint against Lekjaa following the match, claiming that the FRMF president physically assaulted the referee during the medal ceremony. On June 5, the EFE released a statement claiming: “After the game, during the medal ceremony, the third deputy president of CAF, president of Morocco Football Association and honorable president of RS Berkane FC, MR Fawzy Lkeia ,[sic] beat n MS Bamalek Tessema with head butt with aggressive and forceful manner.” The EFE also accused other RS Berkane players of harassing the referee. “After players saw MR Fawzy Lekia [sic] in action they started to harass and kick him fortunately he was saved by securities.” After the match the FRMF addressed a letter to CAF, stating the game between the two sides was fraught with “bad interpretation and application of the rules.” FRMF  described the referee’s performance as “scandalous” and “shameful.”

Earlier this month, on July 3, Nicki Minaj had people raising their eyebrows when she announced she would be headlining the Jeddah World Festival in Saudi Arabia. Her performance was scheduled for July 18. Many of her fans, as well as human rights groups, questioned the morality of Nicki Minaj, who describes herself as an advocate for LGBTQ rights, performing in a country where the death penalty is still imposed for same-sex acts and women are heavily restricted. “Have you seen ‘queer ally’ Nicki Minaj is doing a concert for Saudi royals? Only 3 days ago she was making her pink dollar at pride, now she’s off getting her homophobe dollar!” one fan said on Twitter. However, after taking the backlash into consideration, Minaj has announced she will no longer be performing in Saudi Arabia. “After careful reflection, I have decided to no longer move forward with my scheduled concert at Jeddah World Fest,” the singer said in a statement. “While I want nothing more than to bring my show to fans in Saudi Arabia, after better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.” The cancellation follows the US-based Human Rights Foundation writing a 5-page letter to Minaj on Friday, July 5. The letter details the country’s human rights abuses and calls on Minaj to cancel the concert. They suggested Minaj “refuse the regime’s money,” and use her influence to demand the release of the detained women activists. The letter advised that Minaj bow out of the concert “as a symbol of solidarity with the ongoing suffering of the Saudi people”, given her “status as a global personality.” It seems Minaj took the letter to heart, and the Human Rights Foundation took to Twitter to thank her.  “THANK YOU @NICKIMINAJ for cancelling your #SaudiArabia concert and for supporting LGBTQ &amp; women’s rights. Millions of people around the world are inspired by your devotion to human rights and human dignity. We at @HRF salute you &amp; are grateful for your leadership,” the group said on Twitter. THANK YOU @NICKIMINAJ for cancelling your #SaudiArabia concert and for supporting LGBTQ &amp; women’s rights. Millions of people around the world 🌍 are inspired by your devotion to human rights and human dignity. We at @HRF salute you &amp; are grateful for your leadership #freeloujain — HRF (@HRF) July 9, 2019  While her decision to cancel has received praise from activists and human rights groups, it seems the backlash isn’t over for Minaj.  Wanting to start a conversation with her Saudi fans, Minaj took to Instagram to start a dialogue. “Saudi Arabia, I see some of your comment and want to respond directly to my fans. Voice your opinions here,” the post read.     A post shared by Barbie® (@nickiminaj) on Jul 9, 2019 at 12:28pm PDT  “Please don’t let us down, 11 thousand tickets were bought in only one hour please we want you there is a lot of fans from Saudi Arabia, literally I’m crying,” a distressed fan wrote.  Minaj, sticking to promise to respond directly, clapped back saying “can an openly gay person go to the concert without being arrested?” True or false? https://t.co/JtHTyeXevN — MEGATRON (@NICKIMINAJ) July 9, 2019  The comments were soon inundated by a dichotomy of opinions, with some Saudi fans saying that Minaj performing would have only helped solve the issues in the country by pushing boundaries, and others commending Minaj’s decision. “You canceling your performance will change NOTHING. What you can do is push boundaries and raise the bar for women in Saudi by headlining the festival and giving your Saudi fans a chance to see you perform,” one fan wrote in a comment with over 3700 likes. Minaj clapped back again, asking a question many others had been posing when she announced the performance: “and what would I wear?” Others Saudi fans argued that Minaj’s performance is part of reforms in the country to make life better for women, and that the “internet has a fake picture” of Saudi Arabia. “The women can go to the concert without a man and there a lot of LGBTQ people there! The internet has a fake picture of us! We love you,” the comment read. “I am a Saudi woman and can go anywhere when I want, I travel when I want, I have all my rights so I don’t need anyone to defend me. When I feel I can’t exercise my rights, I will defend myself, I don’t need anybody to do it,” one particularly upset user commented. “We are not weak, ok? I hope you read this because I want everyone to know that we don’t need you,” the user continued. However, many of her fans were understanding of Minaj’s decision. “I’m very much proud of you for taking a clear stance on how you feel and what you stand for, showing your support of women’s and LGBTQ+ rights,” said one fan, echoing many other comments.

Rabat – The new Africa-wide pharmaceutical regulation body was launched at the 20th annual  International Pharmaceutical Forum, held last week in Marrakech. The new regulating body, the Association of African Pharmaceutical Regulation Authorities (AANRP), aims to harmonize the regulation of health products in Africa. Its goal is to reinforce existing systems of regulation in order to promote the pharmaceutical industry across the continent. It also aims to reinforce the cooperation between states in relation to pharmaceutical policies, and the quality control of medication. According to research released in January by the European Union-funded ENACT project, substandard and fake medicines pose a “significant threat” to Africa. According to 2016 UN research, African states import 70% of their pharmaceutical products.  Only 37 out of 54 African states have some level of pharmaceutical production, meaning states spend their resources on procuring rather than creating the drugs. The ENACT report warns that as demand grows and new, legitimate firms enter the African production markets, so will counterfeiters. According to ENACT, “counterfeiters find Africa an easy target, because it has not developed the West’s armoury of responses to counterfeit pharmaceuticals.” The new AANRP body will work to tackle these counterfeiting issues. The Republic of Congo, Cameroon, and Niger will also be on the board of the organization alongside Morocco. Last week’s International Pharmaceutical Forum in Marrakech brought together more than 3000 doctors, pharmacists, researchers, distributors, and other pharmaceutical industry stakeholders from across Africa.

Rabat – Hassa bin Salman, the daughter of Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and half-sister of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman went on trial in absentia Tuesday, July 9, in Paris. The princess faces charges of kidnapping and complicity to violence after she allegedly ordered her bodyguard to beat a plumber at the Saudi’s royal apartment in Paris, France in 2016. The princess accused the plumber of taking photos and videos of her to sell. The workman denied her accusations, emphasizing that he was only taking pictures of the bathroom on his phone in order to remember where items were put before he started work. When the princess saw him, she suspected that he was taking photos of her in the mirror. The plumber, who is an Egyptian-born man,  testified that theprincess’ bodyguard punched and kicked him following Princess Hassa’s accusations. In his testimony, the victim also claims that the princess  threatened him. The worker further testified that the princess shouted: “Kill him, the dog, he doesn’t deserve to live.” The victim also claims that the princess said, “You’ll see how you speak to a princess, how you speak to the royal family.’ The incident dates back to September 2016. Since 2017, both the princess and her bodyguard were are under an international arrest issued by the French authorities. Only the bodyguard attended Tuesday’s trial, according to AFP. The bodyguard denied allegations of violence, emphasizing that he only overpowered the plumber and seized him after he heard the princess shouting for help. “I didn’t know what he was after,” said the bodyguard. Emmanuel Moyenne, Princess Hassa’s lawyer, told Reuters that the allegations against the victims contradict her principles. “The princess is a caring, humble, approachable, and cultured woman.”

The Director General of National Security announced, on July 9, the suspension of an Anfa District police Chief Inspector. The chief inspector’s suspension is the result of an investigation into the fatal shooting of two suspects.  The police inspector used his service weapon on July 7, during a police intervention. The weapon was used to fatally injure two suspects; a 35-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman. The Directorate-General of National Security (DGSN) announced in a statement that Casablanca’s Judicial Police Department had opened an in-depth investigation into the circumstances of the incident. The suspension comes following the investigation which proved that the inspector had committed serious professional and legal infractions during the intervention.  The inspector claims that the service weapon was used in self defence. Police protocol dictates that officers must fire a warning shot before aiming at the suspect’s limbs to impede escape. The statement concluded that the judicial police department will continue to undertake a thorough investigation into the case. The investigation will be carried out under the supervision of the public prosecutor’s office in order to clarify the circumstances of the incident. The Prefectural Police Department of Tetouan, in coordination with Casablanca’s judicial police, arrested the inspector on July 9 in the region of Cabo Negro near Tetouan. Six other individuals are also in custody, suspected of being directly complicit in the case or of providing false information to investigators. If found guilty, the inspector could face double-murder charges. Article 392 or the Moroccan penal code states that any person who intentionally takes the life of another “shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.”

Rabat – The negative certificate is a document delivered by the Moroccan Office for Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC), which certifies that a trade name is not already in use by another company, and can, therefore, be registered on the OMPIC commercial register. Obtaining a negative certificate is the first administrative step required to legally set up a business in Morocco. On July 3, OMPIC announced changes to the procedure for obtaining a negative certificate and registering a business name. Any applications from July 8 onwards, must be made using a new version of the negative certificate application forms. The old forms will no longer be valid. Under the new changes, a negative certificate is now valid for 90 days, as opposed to one year. Applicants must register their business name on the OMPIC commercial register within 90 days of the negative certificate being delivered.  According to OMPÏC, these changes are designed to “improve and simplify the procedures for creating a business.” OMPIC reminds applicants that there is an online platform to submit an application for a negative certificate. Last year, Morocco launched a strategy to facilitate the creation of businesses and to promote national and international investments in the country, by digitizing the business creation application process. One of the aims is to boost Morocco’s ranking on the World Bank ‘Ease of Doing Business’ list. On the 2019 World Bank list, Morocco was ranked 60th in the world, ahead of all other Maghreb region countries. According to the list, it is the second easiest “doing business” country in Africa, after Rwanda ranked at number 29. On the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ list, the World Bank gives each country an “ease of doing business score,” based on the country’s position in comparison to the best regulatory practice. Factors taken into account include the time it takes to set up a business, availability of credit, strength of the tax system, ease of trade across borders, and enforceability of contracts.

In the years following the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, Tunisia suffered a series of devastating attacks which threatened to destabilize the North African country. After a shooting at a resort killed 38 people in June of 2015, newly-elected president Beji Caid Essebsi declared a state of emergency which remains in effect today.   On July 5, President Essebsi declared that the state of emergency in Tunisia will again be extended, this time for an additional month. The announcement followed three suicide bombings in under a week. On June 27, two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a set of attacks that killed one police officer and injured eight others. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for both attacks.  Five days later, on July 2, Aymen Smiri, who allegedly planned the twin bombings, killed himself after being surrounded by police. Recent bombings have targeted security forces, while the most deadly attacks in 2015 were directed at tourists. The recent peace at resorts and other attractions has been a financial boon for Tunisia’s tourism industry. Tunisian Monitor Online reported that the country saw a 42.5% increase in tourist revenue in 2019. President Essebsi has repeatedly extended the state of emergency in Tunisia, which has now been in effect for four years. The order gives the Interior Ministry and security forces more power, while limiting certain freedoms such as the right to public assembly. The state of emergency also allows the monitoring of the press. The government also placed restrictions on dress following the most recent attacks.  Last Friday Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chadad’s office banned women from wearing the niqab or burqa in public institutions or government offices “for security reasons.” Witnesses reported Smiri was wearing the niqab during his pursuit by police last week. The Tunisian Ministry of Interior denied this claim.

Rabat – In the occupied West Bank, the long separation wall, imposingly ripples the horizon of a region ferociously split in two. Slicing through Palestinian communities, ravaging their everyday lives in a steady manner, the giant concrete barrier- twice the height of the Berlin Wall- bears the words: “The hands that build can also tear down.” Tuesday, July 9th, 2019 marks the 15thanniversary since the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations’ (UN) judiciary organ, issued an advisory ruling that deemed Israel‘s separation wall illegal under international law and called for it to be dismantled. The court issued its non-binding advisory opinion in 2004, stating that the wall’s construction must stop, and that Israel should pay reparations for any damage caused. The wall, which Israel began constructing in 2002, the threshold year of the second intifada, has been described by Israeli officials as a necessary security precaution against terrorism and the Palestinian community’s raids.  Although the ICJ acknowledged that Israel faced acts of violence against its civilians, it said that the Israeli government violated the global legal framework and should take down the wall.  Yet 15 years on, the wall continues to cut through Palestinian communities, taking over natural resources in the occupied West Bank, and annexing Palestinian land. Palestinians have decried the wall as an Israeli mechanism to gain control over Palestinian territory, as it is constructed deep within the West Bank, violating the 1967 boarders and the Green Line plan.  “Israel has continued to build and expand the separation wall and has acted as though the ICJ decision did not happen,” Ghassan Daghlas, a Palestinian official who monitors settlement activities in the northern West Bank, told Al Jazeera.  “This has resulted in the strangulation of the West Bank, and has affected the course of life for Palestinians,” he added. The estimated cost of the wall upon completion is $2.1 billion. The eight-meter high wall is toppled by barbed wires and electronic motion sensors. Buffer zones stretch between 30 to 100 meters wide. Daghlas said that Israel utterly disregarding the ICJ ruling shows that the country “considers itself above international law” and does not hesitate to show its “racist, apartheid” face globally. Critiques on the wall and the Israeli attitude towards Palestine At least 85% of the wall’s planned 712km-long route, which is twice as long as the Green Line, is built within Palestinian territory, severely impacting the Palestinians’ everyday ability to access services, such as schools, hospitals, their own land, as well as the rest of the Palestinian population. The majority of Palestinians have their villages and homes surrounded by the wall, settlements and settler-only roads, further worsening seclusion issues on the region. The Human Rights Watch director for Israel and Palestine, Omar Shakir told Al Jazeera that the separation wall has significantly affected the Palestinian daily life by separating thousands of Palestinians from each other and from crucial infrastructure and services. “The wall itself is part of the matrix of control and rights abuses that are part of the daily Palestinian experience,” Shakir said. Stop the Wall, a Palestinian grassroots advocacy campaign said that upon the wall’s completion, more than 78 Palestinian villages and communities would be isolated, translated to a total of 266,442 Palestinians.  At least 11,000 Palestinians live in designated “seam zones” which lie between the Green Line and the wall, completely isolated from the rest of the population. The life for these residents highly relies on obtaining residency permits from the Israeli civil administration. “Permits must be constantly renewed before they expire so the permit-holders can keep living in their own homes,” said the Israeli rights group Btselem, highlighting that the permits’ validity can range from a single day to a couple of years. The wall, along with hundreds of other Israeli checkpoints dispersed throughout the occupied West Bank, has not only burdened the Palestinian mobilization and everyday living, but also the Palestinian economy. “The World Bank has estimated in 2013 that restrictions of movement have cost the Palestinian economy $3.4 billion a year,” Shakir said.  “Ultimately, more concrete action is needed by the international community in response to the serious violations of international human rights laws that are part of the daily reality for Palestinians under occupation,” he added.  Protests against the wall The construction of the separation barrier caused several villages to react in the early 2000s, as they used unarmed popular demonstrations to protest against the Israeli annexation of their land. Budrus, Bilin and Nilin were among the villages which notoriously fought against the Israeli’s brutal response to their protests, including the firing of tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets to demonstrators.  Yet, in recent years, the protests have abated, and lost much of their previous momentum.  The level of repression by both the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority hinders Palestinians from engaging in activism organisations and protests concerning the separation wall. Today, the focus of the Palestinian vigor to protect their nation’s identity shifts elsewhere. In 2018, protests broke out following US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and relocate the US embassy there. “Every day we witness and live under crimes of colonization, not just with the separation wall but also with the incessant building of Israeli settlements,” Daghlas said. “We are defending our dignity, our homeland and the international law which we hope will be implemented soon,” he added.

Rabat – Mbarka Bouaida, an experienced politician, was elected president of the southeast region Guelmim-Oued Noun Friday, July 5. The election makes Bouaida  the first woman elected as a regional leader in the history of Morocco’s regional elections which began in 2015. Bouaida’s party, the National Rally of Independents (RNI), described her election as “historic.”   She now faces the issue of settling long-standing disputes between the region’s RNI party and Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) party, but said she is aware of the challenges and is committed to “starting a new era” in the region. Disagreements between the parties ultimately led to a suspension of the region’s council in May 2018. A special delegation has handled daily business since previous President Abderrahim Bouaida – Mbarka Bouaida’s cousin – resigned in June 2018. Beyond handling the region’s current political crisis, Bouaida has expressed her desire to improve job opportunities as well as to provide additional support to the region’s young people. Bouaida’s victory, in which she won 33 of the 39 total votes, didn’t come as a surprise considering her reputation for diplomacy and dedication to her region, according to the RNI party. In 1975 in the small town Laqssabi, Bouaida was born into a well-known and respected family in the region. Her relatives are involved in business, media, and politics and Bouaida herself has followed suit. Bouaida received her MBA from the University of Hull in England and gained her Master’s in Communication from the University of Toulouse, before jumping into her own political career. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2007. Since then, she has served as Vice-Chair of the Finance and Economic Affairs Committee (2008-2009) and chaired the Foreign Affairs, National Defense, and Islamic Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives in 2010. Additionally, she has co-chaired the Morocco-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee since it formed in May 2010 and was minister delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs under Morocco’s previous government. Bouaida, who was named “Young Global Leader” of the World Economic Forum 2012, also has international political ties. Outside of Morocco, Bouaida is affiliated with the EU and the UN and has been Vice-President of the International Parliamentary Forum for Democracy since 2011. Following her election as regional president, she has 60 days to leave her current position as Secretary of State to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, which she has held since 2017. Bouaida expressed thanks for the council’s confidence in her new position and acknowledged the efforts of all parties to work together to solve the region’s issues moving forward.

Rabat – The line between theological and nationalist sentiments has often become blurred throughout the ongoing Israel-Palestine crisis. However, recent comments calling into question the nationality of Jesus of Nazareth have stood out, sparking widespread controversy and debate. Over the weekend, on July 6, American political activist Linda Sarsour — a Muslim and outspoken supporter of Palestine— reignited debate over the nationality of Jesus by claiming that the religious figure was Palestinian. “Jesus was Palestinian of Nazareth and is described in the Quran as being brown copper skinned with wooly hair,” she tweeted on Saturday. The comment received subsequent backlash from hundreds of critics, many of whom accused Sarsour of making historically inaccurate and politically-driven claims. Despite the heavily targeted criticism against Sarsour, the activist’s argument is by no means new. Her comments echo those previously made by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “We celebrate the birth of Jesus, a Palestinian messenger of love, justice and peace, which has guided millions from the moment that his message came out from a small grotto in Bethlehem over 2,000 years ago,” Abbas said during a Christmas speech in 2014. The comments match a statement from earlier this year made by the Somali-American Representative Ilhan Omar. In April, Omar retweeted a New York Times op-ed claiming that “Jesus, born in Bethlehem, was most likely a Palestinian man with dark skin.” Though Sarsour’s comments attracted hundreds of critics, one of her more prominent detractors was Yair Netanyahu, a right-wing activist and the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Are you that stupid? On the cross above Jesus’ head was the sign ‘INRI’ – ‘Iesvs Nazarenvs Rex Ivdaeorvm,’” the young Netanyahu replied, “Which means in Latin – Jesus of Nazareth king of the Jews! The Bible say that Jesus was born and raised in Judea!” The prime minister’s son was joined by many disparagers who pointed out that Jesus is widely considered to have been Jewish; however, Sarsour argued that to be Jewish or Palestinian is not mutually exclusive. “Palestinian is a nationality not a religion,” Sarsour wrote. “Your point is not negated. Jews lived with Palestinians in peaceful co-existence before there was a state of Israel.” During the brief twitter war sparked by Sarsour’s comments, the activist turned to political discussion. She condemned the “military occupation” of Bethlehem, the scriptural birthplace of Jesus. “Why so upset by the truth. Jesus was born in Bethlehem aka بيت لحم in Arabic,” Sarsour tweeted. “Bethlehem is in Palestine. It’s currently militarily occupied by Israel and home to a predominately beautiful Palestinian Christian community. Yes, the birthplace of Jesus is under military occupation.” Although this instance was not the first time debate has erupted over this issue, many within the pro-Israel camp have seen the comments as an attempt to politicize history and erase Jewish ties to the Israeli territory. Despite this criticism, the Israeli side has certainly never hesitated to weaponize history as a tool for furthering its own political goals, especially through its efforts to conceal war crimes committed during the Nakba. Meanwhile, as both Israel and Palestine’s fervent commitment towards proving ties with Jesus of Nazareth fuels further conflict, the same prophet’s message of peace and universal brotherhood seemingly eludes them.

Rabat – A Supreme Court Judge ordered the arrest of Senator Djamel Ould Abbes in Algiers on Sunday, July 7, 2019.  The vice-president of Algeria’s senate was charged with the squandering of public funds, the forgery of official documents, and the signing of illegal deals. Ould Abbes, close friend and ally of former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, waived his parliamentary immunity in June 2019. The move came amid increasing pressure on Algeria’s ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) concerning corruption allegations. Ould Abbes’ government career began in 2012, coinciding with the start of the Bouteflika regime. In 2013, he became a member of the Upper House of the Algerian parliament; the Council of the Nation. The recently detained minister also served the general secretary of the ruling FLN from 2016 to 2018. Since the resignation of Bouteflika, the judiciary has launched a series of investigations into corruption, targeting state officials close to the former President. Ould Abbes is the latest in a growing list of Algerian high-ranking officials and prominent businessmen to be arrested for corruption.  Former prime ministers Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal, former commerce minister Amara Ben Younis rank among the arrests.  Further big names in the corruption clampdown include national security chief Abdelghani Hamel and two of his sons. In 2018, Algeria  also dismissed a series of top military officers for alleged corruption. Adalberto Agozino examined the political turmoil in Algeria’s military in his 2018 article for the Alternative News Agency of Argentia. The analyst interpreted the dismissal of the military chiefs as a means to reinforce Boutefika’s candidacy for a fifth term and make his campaign successful.  Ongoing protests in Algeria  Protests in the North African country first erupted in February 2019 over Bouteflika’s decision to run for a fifth consecutive term, despite having suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013.  Bouteflika eventually resigned in April 2019. However Algerian citizens continued the widespread protests, calling for a complete overhaul of the political system.  On June 2 2019, the Algerian Constitutional Council stated that the promised election, scheduled to take place on July 4, was to be postponed. This delay came after authorities rejected the candidacy of the only two, little known, potential runners.  The reasons behind the rejection have not been made public. Then, on Wednesday, July 3, Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah called for a national dialogue to improve the country’s election process, in which he promised the state and army would remain neutral. The National Forum for Dialogue agreed on the creation of an independent body to prepare the polls, composed of figures chosen by “the parties of dialogue with the exclusion of symbols of the former political regime.” “We agreed to have these presidential elections in order for our people to have their first democratically elected president in a transparent way,” said Ali Benflis, former Prime Minister. “[The polls] will grant a strong legitimacy to the new president in order that he categorically bring the change,” he added.  According to Abdelaziz Rahabi, a former minister who has supported the protesters, the initiative “seeks to put in place mechanisms to end the crisis and move, in a reasonable time frame, towards the organization of a presidential election.” However, on Saturday, July 6, 2019 opposition parties and activists convened in Algiers to call the rejection of the national dialogue and to demand for elections to take place in six months. The National Forum for Dialogue agreed on the creation of an independent body to prepare the polls, composed of figures chosen by “the parties of dialogue with the exclusion of symbols of the former political regime.” “We agreed to have these presidential elections in order for our people to have their first democratically elected president in a transparent way,” said Ali Benflis, former Prime Minister. “[The polls] will grant a strong legitimacy to the new president in order that he categorically bring the change,” he added.  According to Abdelaziz Rahabi, a former minister who has supported the protesters, the initiative “seeks to put in place mechanisms to end the crisis and move, in a reasonable time frame, towards the organization of a presidential election.” On Algeria’s national Independence Day, Friday July 5th, 2019  pro-democracy protesters took to the streets across Algeria, adding yet more pressure to the ruling authorities. “Yes, to a civilian state! No to a military dictatorship” read one sign, reinforcing the widespread call for accountability in reference to the military’s stance on the protests..  In June 2019, General Ahmed Gaid Salah said in a statement that protesters “hold grudges and animosity towards the army and its command” and are “undoubtedly enemies of Algeria,” further fueling tensions. Another sign read “No dialogue with traitors,” in response to interim president Bensalah’s appeal for a dialogue prior to the elections.  Protesters also chanted slogans against any elections organized by a “mafia gang.”

Rabat – This year, the Oscar’s Academy, one of the oldest and most respected Hollywood institutions, appointed 842 new members to its ranks. Half of the newly appointed members are women. Among them is Moroccan director Maryam Touzani, whose first feature film “Adam,” was showcased at the Cannes Film Festival this year. Of the 18 categories in the Academy, Touzani has been added to the “Screenwriters” category. As part of the role, she will be responsible for selecting the nominees and winners in the category for the upcoming Academy Awards. She is joining three other Moroccans already in the Academy, actor Saïd Taghmaoui, director Nabil Ayouch and producer Khadija Alami. Touzani’s film, “Adam,” spotlighted the controversial topic of unwed mothers in Morocco. The story was inspired by a pregnant woman who was going door-to-door asking for work in Touzani’s hometown of Tangier. “In a country like mine, it’s the biggest shame for a woman to have a child out of wedlock,” said Touzani. “She doesn’t want to disappoint her parents so she cannot tell the truth.” Touzani also explained her reasoning behind featuring taboo topics: “There is a facade that everything is all right on the outside even if people are tormented inside. It is good to let in some air and light, and people are relieved and happy things are being spoken about.”

Rabat – The African Confederation of Football (CAF) has  reportedly handed President of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation,Fouzi Lekjaa, a one year suspension from all football related activities within the CAF. The alleged suspension comes after his behavior during the second leg of the CAF Confederation Cup, when Moroccan football club RS Berkane lost to Egyptian side Al Zamalek on May 26. The Ethiopian Football Federation (EFE) filed a complaint against Lekjaa following the match, claiming that the FRMF President physically assaulted referee Bamalek Tessema. The Ethiopian referee arbitrated the CAF Cup final between Zamalek and RS Berkane (1-0). Neither CAF nor the FRMF have confirmed the rumors of Lekjaa’s suspension. Moroccan sports outlet Al Mountakhab reported that a South African member of the disciplinary committee of CAF is leading a “ hidden lobbying war” against Lekjaa. The news outlet added that the CAF member supports Lekjaa’s potential yea-long suspension. Al Mountakhab said that Ahmad Ahmad, President of CAF was not aware of the decision to suspend the FRMF president.  The sports platform also added that Ahmad has warned against such a move. On June 5, the EFE released a statement claiming: “After the game, during the medal ceremony, the third deputy president of CAF, president of Morocco Football Association and honorable president of RS Berkane FC, MR Fawzy Lkeia ,[sic] beat n MS Bamalek Tessema with head butt with aggressive and forceful manner.” The EFE also accused of RS Berkane  of harassing the referee. “After players saw MR Fawzy Lekia [sic] in action they started to harass and kick him fortunately he was saved by securities.” Following the game, Lekjaa strongly condemned the referee’s judgement during the match. FRMF  addressed a letter to CAF describing the referee’s performance as “scandalous” and “shameful.” According to FRMF, the game between the two sides was fraught with “bad interpretation and application of the rules.” In addition to controversially favoring the Egyptian side in the course of the game, the letter suggested that the referee “shamefully” ignored a rule that cost Berkane the penalty shootout. FRMF argued that the Ethiopian referee of the match “allowed a player who should have been sent off to continue to play and influence the outcome of the match.”

Rabat – Morocco’s security services have foiled more than 40,300 irregular migration attempts since January 2019. The Moroccan director of migration at the Ministry of Interior, Khalid Zerouali, said that the flow of irregular migrants persists despite concerted, ongoing efforts from both Morocco and Spain. Zerouali said that the number of the foiled irregular migration attempts represent a 25% increase from the same period of 2018. In an interview with Spanish news outlet El Pais, Zerouali explained that border control “has helped to ease the migratory pressure, but we must continue to work to strengthen this.” The official acknowledged that  Spanish-Moroccan cooperation to curb the flow of migrants has been fruitful. “It is true that on the Spanish side, we feel that the migrator pressure has decreased, but on our side, it continues to increase,” he said, commenting on Morocco’s successful operations to decrease the flow of migrants entering Spain. Zerouali said that Morocco is “fully assuming its responsibilities” in its territorial waters. He said that the debate “should focus on the fight against [human] traffickers, because they are the ones who put the lives of migrants in danger.” Zerouali acknowledged that Morocco is “under pressure,” explaining that as, Morocco increases pressure on the human traffickers, they continue to find new routes.  The networks “have become sophisticated. now candidates for illegal immigration are trying to leave from south Casablanca. There are also attempts to reach the Canary Islands” from the coast between Agadir and Dakhla, added the minister. Spanish Ministry of Interior reported that more than 10,475 migrants reached the Spanish coast at the end of June, representing a decrease of 27.4 % from the same period of 2018. The Moroccan government said that the Moroccan security services thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, compared to 88,761 of foiled attempts in 2018. Despite the pressure, both governments expressed satisfaction with the decrease of irregular migration attempts. Spokesperson of the government Mustapha El Khalfi said in May that the decrease  reflects the “great” effort of Morocco’s law enforcement forces against the issue of undocumented migration and the trafficking networks active in this area. The Minister added that the statistics “testify to the considerable efforts” made by Morocco to combat irregular migration networks, especially those active on the Morocco-Spain axis. In July, Spanish Ministry of Interior promised Morocco €26 million grant to support the country’s ongoing efforts to manage the flow of undocumented migrants into Europe.  Spain has been vocal in its support for Morocco within the European Union, emphasizing that the EU financial contribution to Morocco is not sufficient as the fight against irregular migration require more financial mobilization. The statistics on undocumented migration began to fall in February 2019.

Rabat – Yemen’s Houthi rebels requested on Monday, July 8, 2019 the full withdrawal of a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The request came after the UAE announced plans to reduce its armed forces in the war-ravaged country.  “We call on the aggressors to withdraw from Yemen, as the Republic of Yemen rejects aggression, siege, and air embargo,” tweeted Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthi rebels’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee. “Withdrawing from Yemen is the ideal decision that must be taken at this time,” he added.  The current conflict in Yemen erupted in 2014 when the Houthis allied with parties loyal to the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and seized most of the nation’s territory, including its capital, Sanaa.  The Houthi move aimed to mitigate the Saudi-UAE-led coalition’s control over the politically tarnished country.  Tensions in the volatile region further escalated in March 2015 when the Saudi-UAE-led coalition launched a vehement air campaign against the Houthi rebels. The coalition aimed at restoring the previously established and internationally acknowledged government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.  Since then, tens of thousands of civilians and rebel fighters have been brutally killed. As many as 85,000 children have starved to death due to the declining standard of living and the country’s stagnated socio economic infrastructure. A senior UAE official said on Monday, July 8, 2019 that the country will reduce its military presence in Yemen, moving from a “military-first” to a “peace-first” strategy. According to the unnamed UAE official, the Gulf state has already reduced its military presence in several areas, including the southern port of Aden and the western coast. The UAE official emphasized his country’s support for Saudi Arabia, its crucial ally in the region, saying discussions on troops’ movements had been coordinated for more than a year. “This is not really a last-minute decision,” the senior UAE official was quoted saying by news agencies. “This is part of the process within the coalition that’s been discussed extensively with our partners, the Saudis.” UAE’s troop withdrawal contrary to Saudi Arabia’s interests  Although the UAE official confirmed that the country’s decision to reduce its armed forces in Yemen was made in collaboration with Saudi Arabia, analysts say it contrasts with the Saudi strategy. Gamal Gasim; a political science professor at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, told Al Jazeera that the UAE’s redeployment was indeed contrary to Saudi Arabia’s strategy of crushing the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. “The UAE more likely intends to split Yemen into two countries of South and North where it will have influence and dominance over the southern part,” Gasim said. “Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is more interested in defeating the Houthis and ending Iranian influence.” Expressing similar views on the matter, Saeed Thabit, a Qatar-based Yemeni political analyst, questioned the veracity of the UAE official’s comments. “The UAE announcement appears to be disingenuous and doesn’t reflect a sincere desire to end the war in Yemen, partly because it was leaked in an anonymous fashion without an official announcement,” Thabit said. “The UAE troops still have a substantial presence in Yemen, and this development was made more to antagonize the Saudis who are facing more military pressure from the Houthis at their borders with Yemen,” he added. UAE’s announcement and the escalating US-Iranian tensions Yemeni journalist and human rights activist Tawakkol Karman told al Jazeera that the UAE was pressured by Iran into pulling out its armed forces from Yemen.  Karman supported that the Gulf state’s action was a strategic move to improve its image amid the increasing turbulence in the region and to avoid any Iranian threat. “[Another] reason was a serious warning from Iran to the UAE,” Karman explained. “If they remain in Yemen, then their luxurious, glassy towers will be targeted by any of Iran’s arms in the region.” Saudi Arabia has repeatedly accused Iran of supplying sophisticated weapons to the Houthis, a charge Tehran denies. The UAE announcement came after a standoff between the United States and Iran, which broke out in June 2019, when Iranian forces shot down a US drone following a series of tanker attacks Washington had blamed on Tehran. Diplomats have said the UAE prefers to have military forces and equipment on hand in case tensions between the US and Iran further escalate in the Gulf region. “Many people asked if this is also linked to the current rise of tensions with Iran; I would say fundamentally no,” the UAE official said. “But of course, we cannot be blind to the overall strategic picture.”

Rabat – The princess of Morocco Lalla Salma and her son, the successor of the throne Moulay Hassan, arrived on the island of Skiathos in Greece on Saturday afternoon for a holiday. Skiathos, a Greek island in the northwest Aegean Sea about 140km from Athens, is best known for its beaches and buzzing, youth-driven nightlife scene. The members of the royal family arrived on the island in a private jet at Skiathos airport and then headed to a luxury hotel in Koukounaries, the island’s main town. It’s not the first time Princess Lalla Salma has holidayed in Greece, having been spotted there multiple times over the years, either alone or with family. In 2012, Lalla Salma visited Ilia in Western Greece, after visiting port town Kyllini the year before. Making her love for Greece even more apparent, in 2017, she purchased a €3.8 million villa in Kea, a Greek island in the Aegean Sea’s Cyclades archipelago, known for its hilly countryside and quiet beaches. This seems to be the first time she’s taken her son Crown Prince Moulay Hassan along with her. The Crown Prince recently turned 16, on May 8 2019.

Rabat – The 12th Summit of Heads of State of the African Union (AU) took place in Niamey, the capital of Niger, on July 7.  During the summit, which was dedicated to the launch of the operational phase of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita addressed the dichotomy surrounding Polisario’s membership in the AU. Having signed the act establishing the AfCFTA, Bourita explained that Morocco’s signature and ratification of  the agreement must be seen as separate from its stance on the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Democratic Republic (SADR).  He stated that Morocco’s signature “cannot be interpreted as an acknowledgment of a situation, a fact, or an entity it does not recognize and threatens the country’s territorial integrity and national unity.” Historically, Morocco has rejected any mediation of the AU on the issue of Western Sahara, specifying that the file should be dealt with solely by the UN. At the AU’s 29th Summit in Addis Ababa, Bourita told the AU, “We are more in a United Nations type of discourse which finally respects international legitimacy.” “Morocco acts according to clear principles when it comes to differentiating between membership in an organization and the recognition of its members which Morocco may not recognize,” Bourita added in a veiled reference to Morocco’s reintegration in the AU in January 2017 despite Polisario’s leader joining the Union. A contradiction in terms  The minister then addressed the contradictory nature of Polisario’s membership of a trade zone, calling the situation an aberration. Bourita asked the assembled heads of state how “an entity that has no territory could belong to a free trade area.”  “If this entity is to trade from Tindouf, it will be considered internal trade in another country of the AU, which is Algeria,” he explained. “With what currency will this entity trade?” he continued, affirming that “if this trade will take place, it will be in Algerian currency.” According to Mr. Bourita, this state of affairs is all the more “aberrant” as the cornerstones of the AfCFTA are the Regional Economic Communities (RECs).  RECs are considered the building blocks of the African Union within the continental integration process. They represent regional groupings of African States each lead by a Head of State or Government on a rotational basis.   Currently the African Union recognizes 8 RECs from the 5 geographical regions of the continent. Among them the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) which includes Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. “Look among the members of the African Union, which is the entity that does not belong to any regional economic community and you will understand the aberration,” concluded Mr. Bourita. The newly ratified AfCFTA is a flagship project (among 14 projects) of AU’ s Agenda 2063 launched in 2013. The launch of the AfCFTA follows the coming into force of the trade area on May 30. As of today, July 08, 54 out of the 55 African Union Member States have signed the treaty establishing the AfCFTA  and 27 of them have ratified it. The AfCFTA aims to progressively reduce and eliminate customs duties and non-tariff barriers on goods. The goal is for 90% of products to have a zero duty across the continent.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Youth and Sports Rachid Talbi Alami has received a strong response from Moroccan international player Hakim Ziyech.  The football star took to social media to deny rumours of his retirement following the Atlas Lions’ exit from the Africa Cup of Nations 2019. On Monday, July 9, Alami said at a plenary session of the House of representatives that Ziyech may retire from international football in the wake of his missed penalty during the knockout game against the Benin Squirrels on Friday, July 5. Ziyech responded to Alami’s comments with an instagram post, firmly denying any intention of retiring.  Accompanying his post with a photo of Alami, Ziyech wrote:  “Next time if you want to come up with something then come up with something true and no lies.”  In another post, Ziyech said that lack of stories and rumors would push some people to create one. “Nowadays if they don’t have a story, they gon’ make one.” Alami claimed on Monday that Ziyech does not answer his phone calls, adding that the midfielder refused to work in “ these conditions.” التصريح ديال الوزير زياش وخى مجاوبش على 23 مكالمة و لكن قال ليهم راه مغديش يكمل في هاد الأجواء 🤔🤔@ProsMarocains pic.twitter.com/QPfLCX3Vql — Badr Zaimi (@ZaimiBadr) July 8, 2019  “Ziyech did not answer 23 phone calls, and he says he will not continue in these conditions and this atmosphere.” The claims came after the international player faced a backlash for missing the penalty during the Morocco-Benin match as part of the 16 round of CAN 2019. Some Moroccan football fans blamed Ziyech for the loss as he missed a penalty in the last minute of the match,  a situation that pushed the game to extra time and penalties. During the shootout, Benin scored 4 penalties to Morocco’s one. Other fans, however, expressed full support and solidarity with Ziyech, emphasizing that this is not the last CAN in Africa. Ziyech currently plays for Dutch football club Ajax Amsterdam. The 26-year old football player was Born in the Netherlands to Moroccan parents. The footballer made his debut for Morocco’s national team in October 2015 in a friendly match with Cote d’Ivoire. He also played for Morocco in the 2018 World Cup. Ziyech previously played for the Netherlands in the Under 19, Under 20, and Under 21 teams between 2012 and 2014. In April 2018, he clinched the title of the player of the year in his Dutch team after he led them to a major win against AZ Alkmaar.

Rabat – Moroccan sports channel Arriadia has announced the “imminent” resignation of Herve Renard, head coach of Morocco’s national football team. “Imminent resignation of Herve  Renard from his post,” Arriyadia posted on its Twitter account. The channel quoted a source close to the  international coach. Active on social media, Renard has not  yet confirmed his resignation. Démission imminente de @Herve_Renard_HR de son poste d’entraîneur de l’ @EnMaroc (source proche de l’entraîneur pour #Arryadia) #CAN2019 #Maroc pic.twitter.com/nPu21BHXIJ — Arryadia TV officiel (@arryadiatv) July 8, 2019  The coach joined the national football team in February 2016 and led the Atlas Lions to the FIFA World Cup in 2018. Since last year, rumors and speculation have run wild over the possibility that Renard might leave the Atlas Lions. Renard has a contract with the Moroccan team until February 2022. The rumored resignation comes after the defeat of Morocco against Benin during the 16 round of the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN) on Friday, July 5. Having gone into the 16 round with 9 points and three victories under their belts, the sudden exit of the Atlas Lions shocked Moroccan fans.  Prior to CAN, Head of Morocco’s Royal Football Federation Fouzi Lekjaa said that there is no “guarantee” that Renard will stay with the Moroccan team after the African tournament. Lekjaa said that Renard’s future depends on the results obtained in an official competition, suggesting that Morocco’s performance at CAN would have a definitive bearing on Renard’s Moroccan adventure.  The  FRMF chairman added that after each competition, both parties should take a moment’s pause “before moving forward.” French news outlet L’Equipe also reported in May that Renard would leave after the continental tournament. Since then, Renard has firmly shut down any rumors of his resignation. “Some people talk about my future in the media to sow trouble  in the Moroccan spirit and if it’s still a little too early to know what will be done, one this is certain,” Renard said in an instagram post.  Renard also denied rumors that he would transfer to another African team, “Out of respect for Morocco and all Moroccans I will not leave in any way for another African nation regardless of it. Those who claim so are wrong.” Renard, who is a French national, served as a coach of the national team since 2016. He previously coached Cote D’Ivoire and Zambia, winning Africa Cup of Nations with both teams.

Rabat – Romain Ghanem Paul Saïss is a 29-year-old Moroccan professional footballer who plays for the Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers and the Moroccan national team as a defender or a midfielder. Born to a Moroccan father and a French mother in the southeastern French city Bourg-de-Péage, Saïss began his journey to becoming an internationally recognized professional at a young age. Following the example of his father, Redouane Saïss; a former football player in the French amateur club of Espérance Hostunoise, he devoted himself to the sport, eventually joining the regional team AS Valencia. While training at the AS Valencia, Romain Saïss was discovered by Sébastien Regache who followed his journey for several months. Regache then recommended Saissto Jean-Noël Cabezas, the coach of the Clermont Foot reserve team; a French club that Saïss eventually joined in 2011. After his remarkable performances with the reserve team, Saïss joined training with the professional team in October 2011. In February 2012, he signed his first professional contract at the request of the team’s coach, Michel Der Zakarian, during a match against LB Chateauroux. In July 2013, he signed a contract with the French club Le Havre AC in Ligue 2; playing his first match with the team a month later. In January 2014, Saïss scored his first goal a league match against Metz in.  His performances of great skill and endurance led the team’s management to regularize him throughout the 2013-2014 season.  After spending two seasons with the team, Saïss decided to move on. He then committed to two seasons at the French club SCO Angers which was promoted in Ligue 1. He played his first game with the new team in August 2015 against Montpellier HSC where he contributed to the team’s 28th victory. In May 2016, Saïss played his last match wearing the colors of SCO Angers.  Having already made a name for himself in football, Saïss signed a four-year contract with British club Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 2016, under a $4 million transfer.  He played his first official match with the team in September 2016 against Newcastle United leading to a 0-2 win. Much appreciated by the team’s coach Nuno Espírito Santo, Saïss played every game with the first team. He scored his first goal in September 2017 against Burton Albion.  In 2018, Saïss and Wolverhampton won multiple victories, finishing first in the 2017-2018 season. The team was then promoted to the Premier League for the 2018-2019 season.  Saïss was eligible to play for both the Moroccan and French national teams due to his double nationality. He was approached by Morocco’s then-coach, Rachid Taoussi, in November 2012 to participate in a friendly match between Morocco and Togo. When Hervé Renard became the coach of the Atlas Lions, he put his faith on Saïss for the qualifying matches of the 2018 World Cup and the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) competition.  Since the beginning of 2017, the French coach has positioned Saïss in central defense alongside Medhi Benatia.   Under the Hervé Renard era, Saïss has become a well-known name, regularly cited in match reports. He was among the players pre-selected for the Atlas Lions in both the 2018 World Cup with Morocco and for the 2019 CAN.  Saïss played with the Atlas Lions in the 2019 CAN, marking an outstanding performance alongside his Moroccan team members, before their loss against Benin. At a press conference prior to the Atlas Lions’ final game, Sais said that the Atlas Lions should not look down on Benin.  “Benin, who qualified from a difficult group, were able to score two goals against Ghana and trouble Cameroon, the defending champions,” Saiss told reporters. “For all these reasons, we must be vigilant and not underestimate our opponent to claim to achieve a good result,” he added. Fans of the defender, disappointed with Lion’s exit from CAN, are eager to see what this promising player does next.

Regus, a leading supplier of workspaces around the world, has opened the doors to three new facilities across Morocco, part of the company’s ongoing plans to invest in African countries and shift its focus away from the European Union. The three new centers — located in three of Morocco’s largest cities: Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangier — are designed to provide the company’s current 2.5 million clients with greater access to networking opportunities with Moroccan companies.   The new centers will also provide workspaces for multinational companies with traveling employees and companies based entirely within Morocco. With over 3,200 locations in 120 countries, Regus has become globally recognized for its facilitation of networking, with the company facilitating meetings and collaborations between its millions of customers. In addition, the company provides partners — ranging from multinational corporations like Amazon and IBM, to local start-up companies — with access to “flexible workspaces” as well as a wide range of other services for businesses. Regus has conducted business in Morocco since 1997, with the company now operating out of 16 business centers and serving over 2000 local companies throughout the kingdom. “When it comes to Morocco, [Regus] considers it as a hub, as we are the nearest country to Europe, so we are launching a lot of innovation,” Yassine Jalil, Regus’s Area Manager for the Rabat area, told Morocco World News. “Morocco also has a lot of trade agreements with all African countries and Regus is present in 21 countries in Africa.” Regus already has extensive holdings in Morocco. The company currently operates more businesses in Morocco than almost any other African country, with the exception being South Africa. Since 2015, Regus has already more than doubled the number of offices it operates in the country, and has announced plans to further increase with at least 40 sites by 2023. “Our country manager has the aim to open and reach 40 centers by 2023,” Jalil told Morocco World News. “It’s ambitious but it’s definitely realistic.” As Regus continues with its plans to distance itself further from the European Union, Morocco has become the epicenter of the company’s plans for further expansion into Africa.

Rabat – Lixus is an ancient city on the banks of the Loukous River. First settled by the Phoenicians in the 12th century BC, it flourished under the Roman empire. The site is home to the only Roman amphitheater in Morocco and a large industrial complex where fish was preserved in salt. The city was destroyed during the Muslim conquest of Morocco in the late 7th century. The site was excavated and restored during the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Culture spent MAD 11.8 million, building a new visitor’s center and other tourism infrastructure. Under the new MAD 15 million (approximately $1.5 million) restoration program launched on July 6, MAD 6,75 million will go towards restoration and maintenance of the site. A further MAD 4,6 million will go towards improving infrastructure, while MAD 2,2 million will go towards archeological research and training, and MAD 1,05 million will go towards promotion. In a press release, the Minister stated that the program aims to promote the site locally and nationally, making it a hub for scientific research and tourism. The Ministry will also work towards the site being listed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The Ministry will also plans to launch a national pilot program to promote other archeological sites across the country. The project comes as part of a cultural and economic development strategy, adds the press release. Morocco boasts a variety of archeological sites, dotted across the country. These include dinosaur footprints and fossils, rock carvings, ancient Phoenician cities like Lixus, and the site of the Roman ruins of Volubilis, which was listed on the UNESCO register in 1997.

Ibtissam Bouharat, a Belgian – Moroccan international football player, has responded misogynistic comments made by Radio Mars’ host, Adil El Omari. In a video posted on her facebook page, the footballer challenges El Omari to a match.  Bouharat started her international career in 2005, playing with Standard de Liège. Over the course of her career she won both Belgian Championship and the Belgian Supercup. In 2016, she retired from professional football having won prestigious awards including African woman of the year: Female sportswoman (2013), and Best player of African descent in Belgium (2014). Reacting to Adil El Omari’s sexist comments during his July 4 radio show, Bouharat posted a video on her Facebook account. The video is a challenge to El Omari, and those present during his broadcast, to play a match against her female team. The ex-footballer, addressing the host, said  “I challenge you to play against my 100% female team and let us prove, on the field, that football is universal.”  To caption her video, Bouharat wrote, “women’s place to be is not only the kitchen; I strongly denounce your words.” Her comments were a direct response to the host’s remarks to a female listener, telling her to “take care of her kitchen, watch Choumicha’s shows (famous Moroccan chef), and leave the national team alone.”  The retired footballer expressed her surprise that such comments “can still be heard in 2019 on a sports radio,” and asserted that “football is a universal game and everyone has the right to express their opinion on the subject.” “I stopped playing 4 years ago now, but it is with pleasure that I resume service for the occasion,” she added. Bouharat added a forfeit to her challenge, saying that the losing team would have to cook a Choumicha recipe for the victors.

Rabat – The Moroccan Justice and Development Party (PJD) said in a statement, on Sunday, July 7, that the US peace plan, dubbed the “deal of the century,” is biased towards the ‘Zionist’ entity’s interests.  The party added that the deal opposes the legal framework of the global community. The party further expressed its concern over the recent developments on the Palestinian issue, addressing the attempts of multiple international actors to promote the so-called deal of the century. The Party explained their rejection of the plan, saying, “the deal constitutes a clear threat to the historical and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and prejudices the legal status of Jerusalem.” The US Israeli-Palestine peace plan aimed at injecting $50 billion of investments in the form of grants and subsidized loans into Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon. In June 2019, a delegation from the Moroccan Ministry of Finance participated in the US-sponsored “Peace to Prosperity” conference held in Bahrain, which discussed the economic aspects of the proposed Israel-Palestine peace plan.  Despite Morocco’s attendance at the Bahrain conference, the North African country’s government has stated that it remains staunchly in support of the “two-state solution” and is a crucial ally of the Palestinian people. Morocco has a strong record of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Following the US decision to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter to US President Donald Trump. The letter stated that “the city of al Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all.” Thousands of Moroccans protested in Rabat in the weeks before the conference, calling on the government to boycott the event and expressing their support for the Palestinian people. Those who support the US-sponsored ‘Deal of the Century’ claim that it could mean the end of the decades of turmoil caused by the complex Israel-Palestine question. However, the plan has been widely criticized for forcing Palestine to agree to unfair land concessions to Israel, in return for utopic economic investments and development projects.  Before the conference, Nabil Shaath, advisor to Palestinian State President Mahmoud Abbas, said, “We will inform Bahrain that we will not take part in such a conference.” said in May 2019 Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian State “We will not sell our country based on an economic project,” he added. So far, the unveiling of the White House peace plan has served only to render the peacemaking process even more fragile and intensify turbulence in the already volatile region.  The Moroccan Independence Party Al Istiqlal also issued a statement in June 2019, prior to the conference, to warn against “the serious” ramifications of the US peace plan.  The Party’s executive committee described the peace plan as another Sykes-Picot agreement, which would cause more division and strife across the Arab world.

Rabat – Nora Attal, one of the world’s most sought after models, proudly displayed her Moroccan origins by posing with her family in the July issue of Vogue Italia.  This marks her third Vogue feature, having already featured on the cover of British Vogue and Vogue Arabia’s September 2018 issue. In her family home in Larache, a town in northern Morocco, Attal posed with her parents, grandmother and brother and sister. The whole family was dressed in Chanel, which Attal models regularly. “Along with three generations of her family, 20-year-old Moroccan-British model Nora Attal returned to her native sun-bleached hometown of Larache, the laidback port city located on the north-western coast of Morocco,” Vogue Italia said. The shoot offers “an intimate glimpse into a little-seen familial side of Attal, in a setting that serves as a meeting point and crossroads for her family located in Morocco, Spain, and London.” Born in London to Moroccan parents, the young model is a rising star in the industry, having built an impressive resume since she was discovered by British fashion and documentary photographer Jamie Hawkesworth at her high school. She has become a favorite of designers such as Prada, Chanel, and Burberry, and walked at the world’s fashion weeks side by side with the likes of Gigi Hadid, Taylor Hill, and Stella Maxwell. Most recently, Alexander McQueen chose her as the face of its Women’s Spring/Summer 2019 campaign.

Rabat – On Thursday, July 4, while en route through the Strait of Gibraltar, the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 was set upon by a joint force of British marines and Gibraltarian authorities. Reportedly attempting to conceal its identity by flying a Panamanian flag, the Iranian ship was suspected to have been traveling to Syria, with a shipment of crude oil, when it was captured. During its voyage, the Iranian ship took several other measures to camouflage itself, such as turning off tracking signals and sailing along a much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope, instead of sailing directly through the Suez Canal. Despite these extensive measures to remain hidden, the British operation to seize the ship was successful. Iran was forced to admit to ownership of the vessel in order to condemn the ship’s seizure. Triggered by intelligence received from the US, the operation was launched by British authorities under the guise of enforcing European Union sanctions against importing crude oil into Syria. The operation comes in the midst of escalating tensions between Iran and the West — primarily, the US — adding coals to the fire of tensions already near boiling point. Since the Trump administration decided to pull out of the international agreement on Tehran’s nuclear development, the diplomatic gap between the US and Iran has severely widened. This has only been further exacerbated following recent attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, which the US has accused Iran of perpetrating.  Iran has retaliated by shooting down an American Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which invoked a heated response from the US President, who threatened to “obliterate” Iran. With conflict between the two countries growing ever-closer by the day, the seizure of the Iranian vessel has only contributed to growing hostilities between Tehran and the West. Although Europe has had sanctions on oil shipments to Syria since 2011, it had never acted upon these sanctions by seizing an oil tanker until Thursday. Furthermore, although the US has implemented sanctions against Iran, the European Union has not followed suit. However, authorities in Gibraltar have defended their actions by claiming that they were justified in their suspicions, as well as in their subsequent seizure of the vessel. “We have reason to believe that the Grace 1 was carrying its shipment of crude oil to the Banyas Refinery in Syria,” Gibraltar’s chief minister Fabian Picardo said in a statement. “That refinery is the property of an entity that is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria.” While the EU sanctions were intended as a means of weakening the Syrian regime to prevent the further “repression of [the] civilian population,” the UK’s enforcement of these sanctions has been seen by critics as a form of pandering to the US government. Critics have also pointed to the UK’s relaxed attitude on a number of other sanctions against Syria, especially when it comes to the arms trade.  Since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, the UK has granted a substantial number of arms export licenses to Syria, with the number sharply increasing in 2017 from 10 licenses to 114 licenses. As a result, critics have been wary of the UK’s intentions in seizing the Iranian ship, questioning whether the operation was launched to protect the Syrian people, or to support the US as it ups the ante with Iran. Iran has condemned the seizure as “illegal,” with Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, labeling the act as “a form of piracy.” Mousavi, argued that “the move indicated that the UK follows the hostile policies of the US, which is unacceptable for the Iranian nation and government.” Iran has since summoned the British ambassador to voice “its very strong objection to the illegal and unacceptable seizure” of the ship. It has also reportedly threatened to retaliate and seize a British oil tanker unless the Iranian ship is released. A day after the Iranian ship was captured, a senior commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard allegedly stressed that it was Iran’s “duty” to retaliate and seize a British oil tanker. The commander, Mohsen Rezai, reportedly wrote on Twitter: “If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the [Iranian] authorities duty to seize a British oil tanker.” “Islamic Iran in its 40-year history has never initiated hostilities in any battles but has also never hesitated in responding to bullies,” he added. Though no retaliatory actions have taken place as yet, the UK’s refusal to release the ship and its crew have severely damaged relations between the UK and Iran, amidst the ongoing escalation between the latter and the US. With the ship being seized off the coast of Gibraltar, Spanish officials have argued that British forces overextended their authority in a territory claimed by Spain. The waters off the coasts of Gibraltar have been a point of contention since the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982, with both the UK and Spain claiming authority of the disputed zone.  The law established that territorial waters reach up to 12 nautical miles from a nation’s coasts. As such, the treaty established, in theory, if not in practice, that the waters off of the coast of Gibraltar are under the authority of the United Kingdom. Despite this, Spain has refused to recognize any Gibraltarian sovereignty in these waters, citing the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which ceded the territory from Spain to the UK following the War of Spanish Succession. As a result, Spain has accused the UK of potentially violating its sovereignty during the course of the raid. “We are analyzing the circumstances and seeing how they affect our sovereignty,” said Josep Borrell, the acting Spanish foreign minister Prior to the operation which seized the ship, London reportedly informed Madrid that the supertanker would be detained “in the port of Gibraltar.” However, in reality, the seizure took place in the waters outside of the port, which is considered by Spain to be its own sovereign territory. Regardless, Spanish forces made no attempt to prevent the operation, which has been received by British sources as a symbol of support for the seizure of the supertanker. “Spain did not want to interfere because this was about upholding EU sanctions,” said a source from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Meanwhile, Spain’s argument with the UK over its sovereignty in Gibraltar could reopen old wounds between Spain and Morocco over sovereignty in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla on the northern coast of Morocco. While Spain continues to decry the British occupation of Gibraltar, it maintains its firm hand over the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, refusing to acknowledge any Moroccan legitimacy over the cities. The most prominent debate over the two cities in recent memory took place in 2007, after Spanish King Juan Carlos decided to visit Melilla in a move to show Madrid’s commitment towards maintaining its presence in the exclaves. In response, the then-Moroccan prime minister Abbas El Fassi reasserted the Moroccan claim over the territories. “We would like to remind everyone that the two cities form an integral part of Moroccan soil and their return to their homeland will be sought through direct negotiations with our neighbor Spain,”  said El Fassi. Morocco’s King Mohammad VI also joined in the dispute, temporarily recalling the kingdom’s ambassador to Madrid in protest over the Spanish monarch’s visit to the “occupied territories.” Though relations between the two countries have since stabilized, debate over the territories still persists, with both Spain and Morocco claiming legitimate and rightful ownership over Ceuta and Melilla.

Chadad’s office issued a circular in Tunis on Friday, stating the bans were made “for security reasons.” Under the ban, women will not be able to wear the niqab or burqa in public institutions or government offices.  The niqab is worn by some Muslim women as an interpretation of religious dress codes. It covers the face, revealing only the eyes. The burqa, another interpretation of religious modest dress, covers the entire face including the eyes. The ban comes at a time of heightened security in the country. Two suicide bombings shook Tunis on June 27. The attacks, claimed by the Islamic State and targeting Tunisian security forces, killed one policeman and injured several civilians. On July 3, the presumed mastermind of the attacks, Aymen Smiri, blew himself up in Tunis following a police chase. Witnesses said the suspect was wearing a niqab at the time, reported Al Jazeera. Although the newspaper adds that the Tunisian Ministry of Interior denied this claim. The ban on facial coverings raises questions of freedom of expression and religion. Under international law, any restrictions to these freedoms must be “demonstrably necessary and proportionate for that purpose.” For Jamel Msallem, the president of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, Tunisia’s ban on facial coverings in public institutions is justified.  “We are for the freedom to dress, but today with the current situation and the terrorist threats in Tunisia and across the region we find justifications for this decision,” Mr Msallem told the Agence Francaise de Presse (AFP). He asked the government to ensure the ban was only temporary and would be repealed when a “normal security situation returns in Tunisia.” A question of human rights However, Saloua Kennou, the president of the Association of Tunisian Women for Research and Development (AFTURD), hopes that the ban will be definitive. “We are completely against the niqab,” she told Morocco World News.  “It represents a real public danger. There have been a number of incidents carried out by people wearing the niqab.” “As feminist women, we are also against this type of clothing. The niqab hides women, makes them silhouettes, objects that need to be hidden. This has nothing to do with human rights. We hope the ban will be permanent, so that we can have a debate on this issue and change people’s mentalities on the question,” she added.  Many states across the world have introduced bans on facial coverings, claiming security concerns. Following the attacks in Sri Lanka’s capital, Colombo, that killed at least 250 church-goers and injured hundreds more, Sri Lanka’s president banned wearing any garment in public that “hinders identification”. For Amnesty International, the ban was problematic. “At a time when many Muslims in Sri Lanka fear a backlash, imposing a ban that effectively targets women wearing a face veil for religious reasons risks stigmatizing them.” said Amnesty International’s Deputy South Asia Director Dinushika Dissanayake. “They will be forced out of public spaces to stay at home and will be unable to work, study or access basic services. The ban violates their rights to non-discrimination, freedom of expression and religion,” she explained. “Women have a right to choose how they dress, whatever their beliefs. Forcing women to take off the face-veil is coercive and humiliating,” added Amnesty International representative.  Many other countries including Denmark, Belgium, Algeria, Chad, and Gabon have banned or restricted facial coverings in public places and public institutions.

Tanger-Med port security services, in coordination with Moroccan customs authorities, aborted the massive drug trafficking operation on July 7. According to a statement by the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), the security services found the record quantity of 27.3 tons of cannabis resin aboard three international cargo transport trucks registered in Morocco.  The traffickers had distributed the drugs between 16 containers in the trailers of the three trucks. The DGSN added that the operation resulted in the arrest of three drivers and three assistants. All of the suspects are Moroccan citizens and are aged between 31 and 50 years. The suspects were placed in custody pending an investigation by the prefectural police department. The investigation into the possible national and international ramifications of the case will be carried out under the supervision of the prosecutor’s office. The  arrests are part of the ongoing security operations conducted by the security services against international drug trafficking. Just last week, a similar operation, carried out on June 1, by Tanger-Med security services in close collaboration with the services of the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) resulted in the seizure of 568,000 ecstasy tablets concealed in a truck.

Rabat – Morocco’s Social Economic and Environmental Council (CESE) says that a concerted national strategy must be established to promote reading throughout life. The report, entitled “Promoting Reading, an Urgency and Necessity” recommends that national conferences be held to develop integrated and shared public policy that promotes reading. Additionally, CESE proposed that local authorities across Morocco set aside a budget to promote reading, as well as to promote the production and distribution of books by putting in place incentives to support the publishing sector. CESE said incentives such as prizes and grants to various categories for Moroccan authors must be established. CESE added that regular reading activities must be promoted in the school system, on top of writing a national reading week into the annual calendar. The Council also called for the development of a national network of local public libraries, as well as encouraging the private sector to invest in school libraries and cultural centers, and creating reading spaces in all places of worship. To ensure access to reading resources to those from all backgrounds, CESE recommends free online libraries be established. They also recommend a national initiative to promote startups involved in the creation of dedicated digital tools and applications, in order to engage more people to reading. These tools would take into account the particular needs of people with reading difficulties or special needs. In Morocco, illiteracy is still prevalent, with 32.2% of Morocco’s population older than 10 years of age being considered illiterate. Illiteracy affects women more than men. 42.1% of Moroccan women and 22.1% of men were recorded as illiterate in 2014. Rural populations are also more affected, with 57% of illiterate people coming from rural areas as opposed to the lower percentage of 43% from urban areas. Although literacy has seen a dramatic rise in recent years, with an increase of 12% between 2009 and 2015, there is still a long way to go. CESE’s report found that Moroccan society is still marked by inadequate reading levels. CESE believes this is caused by a combination of factors, including family environment and socio-economic background, which play an important role in the reading level of children. According to CESE, these factors also have a detrimental effect on the persistence of illiteracy and the lack of school and public libraries or other dedicated reading spaces. Adding to this, CESE says, is the lack of involvement of local authorities in promoting reading as well as low productivity of the publishing sector, the regression of bookstores, and a weakening of the book market. A survey conducted by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) from 2011-2012 and released in January of this year, analyzed how Moroccans spend their free time. The study found that Moroccans over the age of 15 only spend an average of 2 minutes a day reading. For children, the rate was even lower, with an average of just one minute a day. Instead, children devote 3 hours daily to watching television, accounting for 43.6 percent of their free time on average. Morocco’s National Agency Against Illiteracy (ANLCA), set up in 2013 to address the problem nationwide, has been making strides to reduce illiteracy. ANLCA has put in place a national strategy against illiteracy, aiming to reduce illiteracy rates to 10% by 2026, as well as supporting organizations across Morocco that work towards ensuring access to education. ANLCA runs workshops for teachers and provides training modules to support children and adults in achieving literacy, prioritizing actions for women, children, and people in rural areas. It has also created an app, “Alpha Nour,” to teach basic literacy, and in May, it launched the Center for Literacy Resources and Expertise (CREA), a virtual platform on which to share training modules. ANLCA’s goal is for 1,050,000 more people to achieve literacy every year.

Rabat –  “Do you prefer if I speak in English or bad French?” Metronomy front man Joseph Mount asked the Jazzablanca crowd on the fourth night of Jazzablanca, July 2-7. “Not French!” the assembled crowd of eager fans cried in response. “It’s the first time we’ve been to Casablanca. In fact, it’s the first time that a lot of us have been to this continent, and it’s quite special for us,” Mount told the audience. “I wish we were here for longer. But what I want to say is [that] so far, we love Morocco,” he went on, to cheers from the crowd. “And what I’d like to say as well is that, so far, we love the Moroccan food we’ve had. It’s also fair to say we love the people we’ve met so far,” strumming the early bars of their hit “Love Letters,” from their 2014 album of the same name.  Over its 20 year history, Metronomy’s international following has seen them play the hallowed stages of California’s Coachella and England’s Glastonbury. The band began its journey from the UK to international fame in 1999. Their 2006 debut, Pip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe) put the group on the map, followed in 2008 by their album Nights Out, which sold 40,000 copies in Europe alone. Metronomy’s set at Jazzablanca drew from the band’s impressive repertoire, including songs from albums released a decade ago, to hits released last month. The prolific ensemble, who have released 5 albums to date, also gave the audience a taste of upcoming album, Metronomy Forever. “This next song is about ice cream,” Mount said before launching into a performance of their disco ballad “Salted Caramel Ice Cream,” released on June 19, 2019. Metronomy also played some of their classic tracks including the punchy, percussive hit “Old Skool” from their 2016 album, Summer 08. The five-person band developed a playful interaction with the audience, trusting Mount, guitarist and lead vocals, to at times tease, and, at others, flatter the audience. “We want to come back. If you want us to come back one day, we’d love to,” crooned Mount from the stage. The group wrapped up their 1 hour 30 minute set with “The Look,” a hazy tune sung in falsetto from album The English Riviera, which came out in 2011. Having graced the stage at Jazzablanca, Metronomy will now continue their tour in Spain, France, Portugal, and Belgium.

Rabat – Hakim Ziyech failed his CAN in Egypt. He was absent in vital moments and lacked difference-making-inspiration to propel Morocco among Africa’s best at this year’s continental showpiece. But what he has done for Morocco in the past three years and the feeling, even as he slumbered in Egypt, that he was trying his utmost, means that he does not deserve the scorn of the hysteric chorus of naysayers thrashing him in news articles and on social media. This time, Moroccans were not prepared for another debacle at the Africa Cup of Nations. They thought they had the coach, the team, and the individual talents to avert the humiliating fate of early exit that has tainted generations of Atlas Lions since 1976, the only exception being in Tunisia in 2004, where Morocco lost in the final to the host country. As the Atlas Lions’ dramatic defeat by Benin started to sink in among fans, as millions of Moroccans powerlessly resigned to the prospect that they will spend another two years waiting, withstanding the anguish of a déjà-vu kind of fatality, it was clear that there would be consequences. But little could one predict that the groaning, the demands that things change, would reach the hysteria and character judgment they seem to have turned into over the past days. In online comments and news reports, some have—quite rightly—called for the Atlas Lions to apologize, to send out heartfelt messages of penitence to appease the rightful wrath of their fans. Sofiance Boufal, one of Morocco’s best performing players at the ongoing CAN, has responded to the cries of fans. “We are all very disappointed to leave CAN today, especially for the Moroccans,” the Celta Vigo striker recently said. “We beg your pardon. When I played, I tried to bring my maximum, and I think I did but here’s what I say: the penalties are a lottery, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but we’ll come back stronger, Insha’Allah!” But that is hardly the most strikingly concerning episode of the hysteria-fused post-CAN spectacle after Morocco’s unexpected, frustrating elimination. As fans struggle to make peace with yet another devastating defeat, to realize that, actually, this generations’ best shot at continental glory was squandered in a match against a “playable” underdog, angry fans have resorted to trashing Hakim Ziyech, the team’s star player who completely missed his Egyptian tournament. Elevated to the rank of “national hero” after a series of  scintillating performances that have contributed to making Morocco the much-fancied team it has become of late, the Ajax star is now being divested of all of the accolades and celebrations that had come his way. Some anguished fans are even questioning his commitment to Morocco, which apparently “is not really his country.” “All we need to do is fire the coach and let go of all the foreign players. We need locals with the hunger to fight for their country and win,” one fan commented on Facebook in reaction to the news that the Moroccan Royal Football Federation has called for an “urgent meeting” with the coach, the players, and the technical staff to discuss the future of the national team.
On social media, Ziyech-directed outrage came in different guises. Some were ridiculous; others were mildly resentful, obviously stemming from pain-stricken fans who may not have really meant what they had said of the Ajax forward; some criticisms hit a degree of common sense, asking that players, Ziyech the first, be “severely punished” for failing their professed mission for this particular tournament. As a whole, however, a recurring criticism, a point that has been raised in different tones and modes of suggestion, has been about whether Zieych is truly committed to Morocco. More still, the nay saying chorus touched a new nerve when suggestions flew that, after all, Morocco really does not need “European mercenaries” whose identification with the North African country is murky, tenuous, and fundamentally questionable. Moroccans of Ziyech’s type, the suggestion goes, do not give the best of themselves on the pitch because their heart has room for another country. In an unconscionably condemnatory, Zieych-bashing article, La Tribune’s envoy to Cairo used the much-decried rhetorical tropes of Europe’s rightwing circles to lambast Ziyech’s apparently non-committal style of play when representing Morocco’s national colors. The article pointed at Ziyech’s “poor,” wanting linguistic skills in French and Arabic, suggesting that he is “not sufficiently integrated” in Morocco; that he has not made the necessary efforts to be considered part of Morocco’s social fabric. “When you sign for a foreign club,” the La Tribune reporter wrote referring to Ziyech, “you make efforts to learn the local language. Why won’t you do the same for Morocco. I thought you liked the national jersey.” Granted: Ziyech had a poor tournament in Egypt. Given his class and technical prowess—the Guardian ranked him among “the players to watch” ahead of the ongoing CAN—Moroccans had distinctly high expectations for Ziyech. Instead, while the entire squad’s performance showed huge gaps between expectations and results, between promises and deliveries on the pitch, Ziyech was particularly underwhelming. In the outrageously demanding moments, he flickered. The late-minute penalty miss against Benin was an appalling, heartbreaking scene to bear for Moroccans. In Egypt, Ziyech looked like a liability, instead of the revered added value fans of football within and without Morocco had expected to see. But does that legitimate the impossibly vindictive bashing he now faces? Will the viscerally resentful comments about his apparently insufficient Moroccanness change anything? When Ziyech, who could have chosen to play for the Netherlands, where he was greatly adored before opting for Morocco, was asked why he unexpectedly chose Morocco over the country that had given him the opportunities and resources to be the talented footballer he now is, he suggested that he would be safe from identity-inspired bashing. In Morocco, he appeared to argue, no one would ever question his patriotism should things not go as planned, should he let fans down by failing to seize some crucial moments. “My head said the Netherlands, but my heart said Morocco,” he had answered. This should have never escaped the notice of those now questioning his love for Morocco. Not only because it whitewashes all the great things he has done while wearing the Moroccan jersey, but because it is utterly self-destructive for Morocco’s aspirations to count on its talented diaspora. No, this is not about blindly taking the side of defeat, of disappointment, of unfulfilled promises. Ziyech and his teammates could have done better; they had everything to shine, to make a lasting impact on continental football. But they failed, and they know it, and players should feel as pained and grief-stricken as their 35 million compatriots; or more. But what Moroccans should be speaking about is why what happened actually happened and where to go from there. Name-calling and character thrashing won’t help. Perhaps Moroccans should be talking about squandered goal scoring opportunities; about reshuffling the technical and coaching staff to instill a new esprit de corps in the team; about the need to have a certain quota of local players because they are more used to the insanely different kind of football played in African tournaments—physical and allowing extremely limited space. For now, though, the cacophony of resentful affirmations deepens the nation’s painful dilemma, instead of solving it. In such moments of national gravity—Morocco is unquestionably a football-crazed country—it is more useful that Moroccans ask the right questions than shun players they may—will, in fact—need in the future. Seen from the comfort of a TV screen or a stadium seat, Ziyech’s penalty miss boils down to his character—flippancy and lack of focus in key moments. Anyone could have scored that, rightfully angry fans have groaned. But on second thought, this is not the first time that excellent, passionately patriotic and focused players have squandered such opportunities. There have been suggestions that, anyway, Zieych and his teammates were a bunch of overrated lads. That Morocco seemed a good team only because the Moroccan media had exaggerated the exploits of the team and its coach, and placed Morocco where it does not belong in African football. While the suggestion stands some shallow scrutiny, it becomes inescapably laughable in the face of what happened in Russia at the latest World Cup as “small teams” humiliated big, established favorites. What about Madagascar topping its group and progressing to the round of 8? Or South Africa, which Morocco defeated in the group stage, beating a Mohammed Salah-led Egypt in spite of the exultant chants of more than 75,000 Egyptians cheering their team up? The truth is, football has evolved across the world, as it has in African countries not traditionally known for having good teams. What we need is a national moment of reckoning whereby Moroccans question their old footballing certainties and habits and think of how to put together a team and coaching staff to reinforce the strengths and resources already available. Failing to meet expectations should come with consequences, with draconian measures to avert a repeat. Punishment is the natural lot of those who let down the unfailing trust and support of millions of countrymen, but the punishment should not be so prodigious as to annihilate the possibility of redemption, and the hope of bouncing back.

Rabat – Sofiane Boufal, one of the two Atlas Lions players who missed the penalty that made all the difference in their game against Benin along with En-Nesyri, has released an apology to Moroccan fans. Benin snagged the win after a last-gasp penalty at the end of 120 minutes, which Morocco missed. Boufal, feeling the weight of his responsibility for the loss, has asked the Moroccan public for forgiveness. “We are all very disappointed to leave CAN today, especially for the Moroccans,” he started the statement by saying. “We beg your pardon. When I played, I tried to bring my maximum, and I think I did but here’s what I say: the penalties are a lottery, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but we’ll come back stronger, inch’allah!” The other members of the Atlas Lions expressed similar disappointment, as well as their coach, Herve Renard who went as far as saying he is ashamed. “It’s not the right time to talk about anything,” said Renard after the game. “The only thing I would like to say is thank you very much to all the fans who came to Egypt to support us. “I’m a bit ashamed in front of them, and especially about all the people who were supporting us since more than three years.” “You know in life, of course, some people are against you, but this is life. You just have to look forward and only remember the positive things.”

Rabat – Seven Moroccans have been counted among the dead from last week’s air strike against a migrant center in Tajoura, 11 km east of Tripoli, according to a statement from the Moroccan Consulate General in Tunis released on Saturday, July 6. A further 8 were injured and 3 more are missing, the statement added. Contacts with the Libyan authorities in Tripoli and the Libyan diplomatic mission in Rabat provided a cross-section of information and an initial preliminary assessment of the 18 Moroccans present in the center during the air strike, said the Consulate. “Given the volatility of the situation on the ground and the scarcity of definitive information, the situation is still unfolding,” it added. The Moroccan consulate in Libya said it had made contact with eight wounded to ensure their health and that the process of identifying of the dead is underway so they can be repatriated to Morocco and handed over to the families. It added that he is cooperating with the Libyan authorities to ensure those injured are evacuated from Libya as soon as possible. The devastating air raid, which the Peace and Security Council of the African Union (AU) has described as a “savage attack,” left more than 50 migrants dead, including children, and 130 more wounded. The UN recognized Government of National Accord in Tripoli blamed renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar and his forces for the attack. Hafter launched an offensive to take control of Tripoli in early April. However, Haftar’s self-declared Libyan National Army denied responsibility. Earlier this week, it had announced its intention to start bombing targets in Tripoli after “traditional means” of war had been exhausted. The AU Council has formed an investigation committee into the air raid, and the results of the investigation will be submitted to the council by September 30. The council also demanded that all those behind the attack be brought to justice without delay, urging Libyan authorities and other stakeholders to cooperate. The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) also called for an investigation, and the UN’s special envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salame, said the attack “could clearly constitute a war crime.”

By Madeleine Handaji Rabat – The first wedding doesn’t really count, I was 10 and performing a play at my grandparent’s 50th wedding anniversary party.  I walked up the aisle dressed in the only white clothes we could get our hands on to marry my 11-year-old sister in a fake moustache while my cousin performed the ceremony. At the time, I couldn’t imagine being married to anyone, let alone for 50 years.  My view on romance was very much based on fairy tales – brides wore crowns and sparkling dresses, and grooms rode horses, brandishing swords to come to the rescue of the beautiful, elegant princess. About 15 years later I met my husband. The first time I saw him was outside the police station in a rather grubby part of Casablanca. The owner of a school, he was to be my employer and was waiting to take me to start work.  When I began teaching at the school, life in Derb Sultan was far from the fairy tales of my childhood, but there was a handsome prince who swept me off my feet, despite having a motorbike instead of a horse.  A year later we had our first wedding in the UK. It was traditional and thoroughly English; the guests arrived in a red London Bus, I wore white, and the father-of-the-bride made a moving speech. The wedding took place in the British stately home turned boarding school, where I had been a pupil from age 9 to 18. My husband’s family came over from Morocco for the event and dubbed it ‘a royal wedding.’  However, my 10-year-old self was still not satisfied and I was thrilled to hear there must be another wedding; this time in Morocco. I knew nothing about Moroccan weddings before my own and was very happy to leave the details to my mother-in-law. However, I did make one demand. I wanted horses.  In the weeks before the wedding I visited the Negafa (women responsible for dressing and introducing the bride, as well as providing the accessories and some of the outfits in a traditional Moroccan wedding), chose my dresses, and tried to fend off questions from the British guests planning to attend the wedding – I knew about as much as they did. This said, I continued to make my horse requirements known.  Finally, the day came. My sister and I got up early, accompanied by the cousin who had performed my first wedding ceremony circa 1999. My sister had thoroughly researched Moroccan wedding makeup and, guided by youtube tutorials, had become almost professional. Hours of application later, I was hardly recognizable. In fact, my grandmother flatteringly told me “You don’t look like yourself. You look like a beautiful woman.” Used to travelling with Moroccans, I didn’t find the next bit surprising, but my sister was shocked as the three of us piled into my sister-in-law’s five seater car, already occupied by 2 adults and 3 children. With the windows wound down and music blasting, my sister-in-law beeped the horn continuously while her younger sister announced our presence with cries of celebration.  All the way to the wedding venue, people on the street waved.  We arrived at the venue, where I was immediately led to a bedroom. The two negafas were there waiting for me. Speaking very quickly in Darija, they whisked me onto a chair and before I knew it, I was in my first outfit of the day; the traditional green and gold ensemble with a golden crown, glittering earrings, and a veil of almost opaque gold. So I had been right, weddings, in Morocco at least, are things of fairy tales. Rather confused and a bit overwhelmed by the noise, the colours, and the two negafas, I was ready.  Somehow it was indicated to me that I should walk up the stairs and onto the roof terrace where the guests waited, some standing, some seated around elaborate white and glass tables.  Walking through the crowd, I don’t really remember seeing any faces and was mostly focused on not tripping over the hem of the intricate green and gold takchita (a Moroccan wedding ensemble made of more than one piece).  Standing in front of a resplendent, golden throne with my parents either side of me, I took in the colours and smiles of the guests gathered before me.  Next came the henna. I am told that all Moroccan weddings involve a henna ceremony, where the negafa paints beautiful decorations in henna on the hands and feet of the bride, some brides choose to have this on a separate day but most wear green, which is a royal colour and symbolizes fertility.  It was a very hot August day, nearly a year ago now, and I remember trying to itch my left eyebrow before remembering that I had wet henna on my fingers.  Fortunately, a very swift Negafa wiped off the henna smudge on my forehead before the red tinge became permanent! As my husband and his family processed through the gathered guests, wielding enormous tagine shaped dishes piled with gifts, I realised that the fairy tale weddings I had imagined as a child were not the stuff of legend, but a reality in Morocco.  The next stage of the wedding was the Ammariya (another traditional part of a Moroccan wedding, it is a golden sedan chair where the bride sits and is paraded for the guests).  Now wearing a purple takchita I had ordered from a French-Moroccan designer, I stepped into the golden cage and tried not to close my eyes as the traiteur’s team lifted it above their heads.  Sitting in the golden throne, wearing a crown, and waving down at the wedding guests, it was hard to not feel like a princess. My husband smiling up at me, certainly looked like Prince Charming. Over the course of the night I wore five dresses, increasingly elaborate jewellery, and had no end of make-up touches. This was definitely the wedding of a fairytale couple.  However, the part of the wedding I enjoyed most, was not sitting serenely in front of the assembled crowd, wearing a tiara and looking like a queen, but wearing a traditional Amazigh dress, riding a horse, and dancing. An Amazigh music group had travelled to Essaouira for our wedding from my husband’s Blad (the countryside region his family come from), and it was they who led the dancing.  The atmosphere was of pure joy, Moroccan and British guests together, dancing to the traditional Amazigh beats.  My husband’s grandmother flung her hands above her head and danced like a teenager, despite being a great-grandmother, while my own 90-year-old grandma enthusiastically joined the fray. This was the first moment of the whole wedding where I felt free and able to be myself. The music continued and the guests let the beat of the traditional music take over. In the middle of the group, I saw my husband’s smiling face and sparkling eyes, and it was in that moment that I realised true romance is not about a ‘royal wedding’ or a fairytale couple, it is built on the joy of sharing experiences and genuinely connecting with another person who allows you to be completely yourself.

Rabat – Morocco’s cafes don’t intend for patrons to take their coffee to-go but instead serve as a central space for leisurely socialization. While walking through any given Moroccan city, one frequently must weave through tables and chairs encroaching onto the sidewalk outside the numerous cafes lining each street.   Despite the abundance of cafes, there is little competition for business as patrons fill the seats of each establishment. While some cafe-goers appear deep in conversation with each other, others sit on their own, watching people and vehicles pass by.   A nearly full shot of espresso, Morocco’s cafe noir, or half-drank glass of nous-nous, Morocco’s cafe au lait, is not a good measurement of how much time has passed since these cafe-goers arrived, as it’s not uncommon to spend an hour or two sipping one drink.   “You can’t walk into a Moroccan cafe to order ‘to-go’ coffee…the cafe kind of rejects this idea,” said Said Graiouid, a professor of communication and cultural studies at the University Mohammed V-Agdal, in Rabat, who has previously conducted extensive research on cafe culture within Morocco.  Cafes are more than just a place to get your tea or coffee. They also serve as a space for people to gather and socialize. Graiouid emphasized the uniqueness of Moroccan cafes as a space where people move at a slower pace in an interview with Morocco World News on cafe culture.  He said Moroccan cafe patrons opt to enjoy their time, versus getting caught up in the hustle and bustle that characterizes most of the rest of society. Alongside globalization, there has been a universal shift towards a faster pace of life.  Today everyone is in a hurry, Graiouid said.  He offered an antidote to capture what he means, describing someone rushing through their morning, running out of the house, speeding through traffic – only to wind up at a cafe. “If you are an exterior observer of this behavior, you would imagine that this person is running to some very urgent matter that they need to attend to.   But then they would park their car and they would get to the cafe and then they would be there for three hours,” explained Graiouid. While most of society operates at one pace, the cafe operates at another. Cafe’s insistence on holding onto a slower pace means that one would have to look hard to find a cafe catering to patrons who want their caffeine ‘to-go,’ he added.   This trend offers a significant contrast from other parts of the world where the culture of coffee tends to fit into fast-paced life.  American coffee drinks are automatically packaged to-go.  Although some individuals choose to sip their coffee within the confines of the cafe while gathering with friends, it’s more likely that the cafe is used as an out-of-office workspace. Morocco is different.  Cafe-goers are encouraged to relax and enjoy their time – potentially for hours.   “Maybe this is also some degree of balance in the life of a Moroccan – a balance that social space creates,” Graiouid said.  “There are all these other activities that require a particular quickness and swiftness in operation, but there is also a space that requires more time and actually more reflection and meditation.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has arrested a Palestinian national residing in the city of Mohammedia (17 kilometers from Casablanca) suspected of trading with virtual currency, Bitcoin, for terrorist organizattions. In collaboration with the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), BCIJ arrested the suspect on June 27.  The arrest was part of DGSN efforts to combat terrorism and its resources, according to a Directorate statement on Saturday. DGSN’s statement added that the suspect has acquired considerable experience in electronic currency transactions through his own activity on several virtual trading platforms. The suspect successfully dealt with many clients through virtual trading platforms, which face fewer restrictions in many countries outside Morocco. DGSN added that the suspect was arrested on July 4, facing charges of “receiving money from the public and carrying out unauthorized transactions.’’ Moroccan authorities placed the Palestinian national in pre-trial detention.

Rabat – On the same day that Radio Mars announced Omar El Omari’s suspension, the host was live on air commenting on the Morocco-Benin match in the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019 knockout stage. Radio Mars issued a statement at 1pm on July 5, announcing El Omari’s three-day suspension, despite his official apology for misogynist comments. The announcement of his suspension came after a wave of complaints from listeners. Internet users were fast to their keyboards, asking whether the radio station knew that the controversial host has casually resumed work so soon after the announcement of his suspension. One Twitter user suggested that El Omari must hold a position of power at the radio station, writing; “either this guy is the main associate in this radio or he holds a sex tape on his boss. It is not acceptable to keep such a person on air.”  “It’s just not possible to allow this individual on air again, he has no tact, I do not think it reflects the image you (Radio Mars) want to convey,” added another user, directing his message to Hicham El Khlifi, CEO of Radio Mars. As yet, neither Radio Mars nor the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication (HACA) has commented on the case.

Rabar – On July 5, the Judicial Police in Casablanca arrested three individuals aged between 30 and 34 on suspicion of their involvement in an attempted Kidnapping, detention, and theft.  Upon their arrest, the suspects were in possession of significant amounts of national currency money from an unknown source. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) issued a statement in which it explained that the judicial police team was able to monitor two of the arrested individuals. The two suspects were planning to kidnap the third and take him to his house in Bournazel, ​​Casablanca in order to steal significant sums of money.  The police carried out a field operation in which they aborted the kidnapping and arrested the two suspects as they were abducting the victim. Search operations conducted by the police at the victim’s house enabled the seizure of a box containing more than MAD 2 million. Initial data indicate that the victim obtained the money through circulation of virtual currency, Bitcoin. One of the victim’s acquaintances living in Europe was responsible for the Bitcoin circulation operations, while he was responsible for collecting the money in Morocco. The police placed the three suspects under custody under the supervision of the Public Prosecution Office in order to determine the cases’ details, the source of the seized amounts of money, and the methods of their circulation and collection.

Rabat – The Spanish Press Agency EFE reports MAD 8 million ($836 000) will go towards the renovation of the Plaza de Toros, a bullfighting arena which currently stands empty, to turn it into a cultural center. The arena was built in 1950 and used as a bullfighting arena until the 1970s. It was then briefly used as a cultural and artistic center, before being abandoned.  The conception of the design for the renovation will be led by the City of Tangier, in partnership with the Technical University of Valencia. The regional government has also budgeted MAD 5 million ($523 000) towards the renovation of the Cervantes Theatre.  Built in 1913 by a wealthy Spanish merchant, the theatre was donated to Spain in 1928, when Tangier was still under the joint administration of France, Morocco, and the United Kingdom.  The theater was once considered one of the most prestigious theaters in North Africa, hosting artistic performances from all over the world. Over the years, due to management and funding issues, it fell into ruins, last used in 1993 for a photography exhibition.  Despite being on Moroccan soil, the Spanish government continued to own the theater until earlier this year. On February 8, Spain signed an agreement donating the building to the Moroccan government. The Plaza de Toros and the Cervantes Theatre are historical landmarks, and important reminders of Tangier’s diverse history. According to EFE, a call for offer for the management of each project will be made in September.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, attended the celebration of Rwanda’s 25th Liberation Day, on July 4.  The theme for this year’s celebration is “together we prosper.” Bourrita travelled to Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, to celebrate the anniversary of the end of the 100 day genocide of the Tutsi minority in 1994. This terrible episode in Rwanda’s recent history claimed the lives of more than one million people and forced many more to flee.    Morocco’s presence at the celebration represents the strong bond of friendship between the kingdom and the Rwandan people Several African heads of state, including the Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe, Hage Gottfried Geingob of Namibia; and Faustin-Archange Touadéra of the Central African Republic, joined the Moroccan minister at the celebrations. Bourrita’s attendance comes just months after Rwandan Minister for Foreign Affairs, Richard Sezibera’s visit to Morocco in March 2019. During his visit, the Rwandan minister chaired the first session of the Morocco-Rwanda High Joint Commission.  Sezibera and his Moroccan counterpart, Bourrita, also signed several agreements for ongoing cooperation, including a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in trade, aimed at encouraging trade between the two countries. The strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries was also bolstered by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in the area of environment and sustainable development.

Rabat – We have reiterated this fantasy whenever our football team has failed miserably to live up to expectations. The Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, a championship which we won only once 43 years ago, seems to give us the greatest cause for self-deception. I expect that our so-called “football-analysts’’ and journalists will again bring up ‘’our glorious past,’’ following the elimination of our team from the second round of this year’s tournament.  The shock elimination came in the wake of an astonishing loss to Benin, in a game most would have expected Morocco to easily win. What seems absurd is to talk about a ‘’glorious past’’ when, out of 13 tournaments held during the last 30 years, our team only reached the African Cup of Nations final once.  In 2004 we lost to Tunisia. For the rest, the Atlas Lions were either unable to break through the quarter-finals, were eliminated from the first round,or even failed to qualify for the championship in the first place. So, the question remains: what ‘’glorious past’’ are we talking about? Are we talking about historic participation in the World Cup? How does that count as a ‘’glorious’’ achievement? Our football is not as good as we have always thought, or claimed, let’s just face it. We can’t compare ourselves to countries like Egypt, Cameroon, Nigeria, or Ghana. That is the truth, pure and simple. Egypt won 7 Africa Cup of Nations titles and Cameroon won five. Both Nigeria and Cameroon won a football Olympic gold medal, an achievement truly worthy of being called ‘’glorious’’. The fact that we are a nation with one continental trophy refutes the claim that we have perpetuated, and continue to perpetuate.  Are these decades of failure an abnormality or the norm? It is true that the Moroccan team has boasted a rosta of talented players over the years.Mohamed Timoumi, Zaki Badou, and Mustapha Hadji proved this by winning the prestigious African Footballer of the Year. It might also be true that Morocco has been known for its ‘beautiful’ football. It is also true that our team gave great performances in some World Cup tournaments, as was the case in 1986, 1998 and 2018.   Maybe it is time to face the truth. It is time to acknowledge that we have never been great, and if we ever were, it was an exception and not the rule.  Maybe if we were to accept this fact, we could look at ourselves more modestly. We could start thinking about how to improve, to measure up against other African nations who truly can pride themselves on the greatness of their football at a continental level. Then, we could set realistic goals for ourselves. We could finally stop lurring ourselves that we are able to win the championship. We could plan to build up a team for the future, a team which would strive to do better with each tournament. Fans too must lower their expectations, instead of getting carried away every time by the false hope that we can win the title. One of the early steps that should be taken in this process, would be to turn to local talents in the Moroccan football league. We need to  stop relying on foreign-born players who, though they are bigger names and some of them play or played for major teams in Europe, have repeatedly failed to achieve tangible victories. Where were Oualid El Karti, Zakaria Hadraf, Abdelilah El Hafidi and Mohcine Iajour, among others when Herve Renard named the national squad for CAN 2019?  These players, who helped their teams, and Morocco, win the African Confederation of Football  (CAF) Champions League, the CAF Cup, and African Nations Championship (CHAN), were excluded from the team’s lineup. Our team is like a car bearing the label ‘’Made in Morocco.’’ The so-called Moroccan car is made up entirely of parts manufactured abroad. And, though the car seems perfectly assembled, it always ends up losing a race against competitors with the heart-felt drive to win.

Rabat – The ministry delegate in charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad and Migration Affairs (MCMREAM) signed a cooperation agreement with the National Agency for Land Conservation, Cadastre, and Cartography, (ANCFCC) on Monday, July 1. Minister in charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad, Abdelkrim Benatiq and the ANCFCC’s general director, Karim Tajmouati, signed the agreement at the ministry headquarters in Rabat. Through the agreement, which was initially launched on June 12, 2017, the ministry and the agency renew their partnership, for a two-year-term, to promote digitized services. The online services are designed to facilitate administrative procedures relating to property for Moroccans Residing Abroad (MRE). Following this new partnership, which is part of an ongoing plan to develop Morocco’s e-government services, the ministry and ANCFCC will launch a media campaign to further raise awareness for the ‘MOHAFADATI’ service.  MOHAFADATI allows real estate or land owners to remotely monitor the administration of their registered properties through an online platform.  Previously, MREs had to travel back to Morocco to address any administrative processes for their property, but the ministry hopes that with the new service administrative processes will become much easier. The platform also seeks to improve the quality of services provided for MREs.  MOHAFADATI also keeps MREs informed about any operation concerning their properties. They are notified via sms or email. In a reference to the “MOHAFADATI” platform, the Minister stressed that the renewal of the partnership agreement underlines the importance of the digitization project, which has helped to reach a greater number of MREs and facilitated access to ANCFCC services.  To benefit from MOHAFADATI services, owners must fill out a registration form and submit it to the nearest housing authority. The form is available on the ANCFCC website. ANCFCC director Tajmouati also noted that the partnership’s goal is to bring the administration closer to the citizens. The collaboration intends to “work hand in hand in the context of a proactive action towards our fellow citizens of the world, to answer questions related, in particular, to the registration of their property.” Tajmouati stressed that, over the past two years, a number of services have been designed and deployed, including the e-property certificate, the ‘MOHAFADATI’ platform, and the property registry services. He added that “the ANCFCC is resolutely committed to digitizing its businesses and services.” The MCMREAM and the ANCFCC have pledged to look after the MREs’ struggles regarding managing their properties. Throughout a period of two years, the ANCFCC has digitized its systems to ensure MREs can protect their properties from spoliation and fraud, thus, ending the era of traveling back to Morocco to acquire the property certificate, or to complete the process of land conservation.

Rabat – During his July 4 radio show “The Scientists of Mars,” the controversial host Adil El Omari, made sexist comments which have caused outrage on social networks. Radio Mars consequently issued a statement on July 5, announcing El Omari’s three-day suspension. Reading listeners’ messages on the topic of the Moroccan national football team, El Omari made misogynist comments in response to a message from a female listener who expressed her opinion on the Atlas Lions’ participation in the African Cup of Nations (CAN). The Radio Mars host addressed the listener, telling her that she’d better “take care of her cooking, watch Choumicha’ s shows (famous Moroccan cooking show) and leave the national team alone.”  Internet users, including journalists, supporters of football teams, and activists’ associations, instantly expressed their anger and disapproval of the host’s comments.  Fille Football Association stated, in a post on its Facebook page, “unfortunately, we are still witnessing sexist statements that reduce women to household chores, even worse, coming from a so-called journalist on a Moroccan sports’ radio show – the only one of its kind in Morocco.” The association expressed its disappointment that such comments came from “a journalist who is supposed to be a source of information and awareness, and is held by the respect of fundamental values, in particular, freedom of expression and equality.” They then directly addressed the host, inviting him “to learn about the latest advances in the women’s football sector, and the national and international enthusiasm sparked by this game, especially in this year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup.” The association also called upon Radio Mars, to act on the comments made by its host and to apologize to Moroccan women. Adil El Omari made an official apology on July 05, on Radio Mars. The host expressed that there was no intended malice behind his remarks. He then said, “if the Moroccan woman has deemed my remarks degrading, then I apologize to her.” Hicham El Khlifi, CEO of Radio Mars, qualified the misogynistic comments as “inadmissible and intolerable.” “They go against the editorial line of Radio Mars,” he said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Interior Ministry will receive €26 million from Spain to support the country’s ongoing efforts to manage the flow of undocument migrants into Europe. The grant comes as part of the €140 million promised by the European Commission in the 2019 budget for the “Support for the integral management of borders and migration in Morocco” project. Spanish outlet El Pais reports that the fund is also intended to boost Moroccan border security, in particular in the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The payment contract between Spain and Morocco is expected to be approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers on July 05. Morocco has already received €40 million for Spain as part of the European Commission’s grant. Upon the approval of the new agreement, Spain will transfer the additional €26 million. This most recent installment of the payments to Morocco will be used to purchase equipment including a fleet of vehicles to reinforce its border control. The fleet will include seven sets of vehicles comprised of four different SUV models, including ambulances, as well four truck models, including tankers and refrigerated vehicles. Increased surveillance of Moroccan borders has significantly reduced irregular entries into Spain during the first 5 months of 2019. The Spanish Ministry of Interior registered the arrival of 13,263 people between January and June 2019, showing a decrease of 23% from the same period in 2018. The statistics on migration began to fall in February 2019, coinciding with Spanish King Felipe VI’s visit to Morocco. During a brief meeting in Rabat, the Spanish monarch discussed the issue of irregular migration with King Mohamed VI. During the visit, both neighbouring countries agreed on the need for stronger border security to quell the flow of undocumented migrants travelling through Morocco and into Spain. Spain will also be taking steps to tackle the issue of irregular migration. The European commission granted Spain an emergency fund €5.3 million to support their border security efforts. The funds are intended to support national police in the management of four temporary migrant holding centers, in which authorities can detain newly arrived undocumented migrants for up to 72 hours pending identification. The fund is intended to improve the conditions of these facilities, called Temporary Migrant Help Centres (CATE), with the outsourcing of food services, health, cleaning, and translation. The fund will cover the purchase of clothing, blankets, towels and medicines.

Rabat – The Alliance of Moroccan Sahrawis in Europe for Development and Solidarity (ASMEDS) and the “White Dove” organisation have been holding a sit-in in Geneva since July 01.  The initiative called “Open Days on Polisario’s Crimes” took place on the sidelines of the 41st session of the Human Rights Council (June 24-July 12). It is part of a campaign to raise international awareness about the recruitment of child soldiers, especially in the Tindouf camps. The Alliance staged a similar sit-in in March 2019 during the previous Human Rights Council session in order to denounce “the forceful enlistment of children in the Tindouf camps, in violation of international law.” The sit-in organisers stated that they seek to “draw the public’s attention to human rights violations perpetrated by Polisario, especially against children who are snatched from their families for training on the use of firearms and explosives.” “Many children have died after handling explosive devices before being buried in anonymity, while survivors are usually enlisted in armies, guerrillas or terrorist groups,” read one of the protest banners. ASMEDS Secretary General, Ali Jeddou, explained that the sit-in aims to alert the international community to the massive human rights violations taking place in the Tindouf camps. Protesters urged the international community and international humanitarian organisations to urgently intervene in the case of families confined to the Tindouf camps. The camps are currently under the control of the Polisario Front which, according to the protesters, “violates the most basic human rights.” Mustapha Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, ex-Polisario member and former commanding officer in the Tindouf camps, has condemned Polisario’s actions over the years.  In one of his Facebook posts, Salma said that Sahrawis are no longer concerned by “independence” or “integrity”. He explains that Sahrawis simply want to live in “dignity and to have a future” for their children in a place “where they will not live [through] what their parents experienced.” He further explained in a statement to Morocco World News that “Polisario makes the obtention of official documents – such as the Sahrawi card which is needed for all services and work in the camps – contingent on a period of military training for Saharawis of all ages” Robert M. Holley, Director of  the Moroccan American Center for Policy, said in his publication “Cuba and the Polisario Front” (2005) that “each year between 350 and 500 young Sahrawi children between the ages of 9 and 11 are still being separated from their parents and sent to Cuba [for military training] for periods up to 15 years or more.” He went on to say that “classes in communist ideology remain mandatory for these children who get a steady diet of Cuban ideology and anti-American and anti-western propaganda as part of their ‘educational experience.’” But the Polisario has continuously dismissed these reports as “unfounded.” In 2008, Sidi Mohamed Omar, Polisario’s UK representative, told Child Soldiers International, “no Sahrawi in the Sahrawi refugee camps in south-west Algeria who is under the age of 18 years, receives any military training, or participates actively in situations of armed conflict.”

Rabat- This, then, is the end of Morocco’s much-reported footballing Renaissance. As Morocco shattered the doubts and reservations of skeptics, topping its group, the question, increasingly, became: Can Atlas Lions really make it happen this year? However, after yet another mind-shattering, frustrating early exit, everything changes for the Atlas Lions, changing the question to: all that for this? Or, more plainly, how much longer will Moroccans have to wait to go past the apparently oversized, lofty hopes of another continental glory? Morocco struggled hard here against Benin, and in the end the Atlas Lions’ superior class, courtesy of its higher number of difference-making, elite players proved helpless against a “playable” and unthreatening Beninese side. As Stéphane Sessegnon, the Benin captain, looked in disbelief, flabbergasted by the referee’s call for a penalty at the end of normal time, the Moroccan bench was tumultuously joyous, already taking delight in the prospect, yet again, of another winning last-minute goal. Hakim Ziyech, the Moroccan playmaker who had so far been underwhelming and unrecognizable in this tournament, stood to take the penalty, eyes fixed in the air, contemplating the gravity of the moment, of the historic responsibility which he was being handed. As the Ajax man positioned himself, carrying on his shoulders the exultant passion of millions of Moroccans, Moroccan fans at the Cairo stadium reacted as thunderously as they could. But Ziyech’s shot hit the woodwork instead, changing the direction of the premature celebration. Benin exulted, not believing that, in the course of seconds, the gods of football, who had seemed to have deserted them, had changed their mind in the end, keeping the Squirrels’ hopes alive. Football has a way of making plain one of the most axiomatic precepts of life, of living: Until the final whistle is blown, nothing is irreversibly lost, and anything is possible. The first half was a one-man show, with all the paraphernalia of humdrum and frustration that such one-sided displays entail. Unsure of how to unsettle a Moroccan squad that has been threatening in attack and vastly solid in defense, Benin spent the entire first half trying to find the confidence and rhythm that helped them force their way through the last-16. Even so, however, it is difficult to say that Morocco impressed as they sustained the 45-minute-long one man show, tirelessly looking for the final moment, the inspiration to make the show count. The Moroccan pressure was in full display in a quick succession of momentous actions in the 10th through to the 17th minute. Twice, Ziyech had a ball which, under the normal conditions that have made him the key man of this team, he could have played in a more charming way. But twice, the Ajax man missed his shots, the first going wide in the Cairo sky and the second on target but not enough to unsettle Saturnin Allagbe, the Benin keeper. And there were endless crosses, from Nabil Diyar and Achraf Hakimi, and Amrabat. And there were more shots from distance—all of this highlighting that while Morocco played well, kept possession, Benin’s bus was just impeccably parked, allowing no threatening intrusion in their defense. Meanwhile, for all its commanding composure when blocking Morocco’s endless attempts at goal, Benin lacked confidence and enterprise in the few minutes when they had possession. As the first half ticked away, there was a tremendous disparity between Benin’s dull but reassuring group games and its controlled, but wavering and uncertain, performance tonight—at least in the first half. Even if it was not entirely different from the first, the second half was relatively livelier, with Benin now intermittently trying to make something happen. Benin was sporadic in attacking; but when they came, mildly banking on a well-organized Moroccan defense, they now seemed to be imbued with a quality they showed no sign of in the previous minutes: belief. Slowly, they were starting to realize that perhaps, just perhaps, this could end up going their way. They played as one prays: not sure whether they would be granted what they asked for, but trying all the same, with the unrelenting religious zeal, an unfailing faith in the reality that God’s answer always comes when you least expect it. For those of us who had thought that this was an unbalanced confrontation, an encounter of foregone conclusion between a continental favorite that won all three of its matches and a plucky underdog that made its way here through sweat and blood—and a bit of luck, Morocco’s inefficiency in front of goal was starting to suggest that maybe another upset was possible here. There was fury, exhaustion, and unrestrained efforts. In some queer kind of way, however, this, ultimately, was yet another vindication of what skeptic Moroccans had been cautioning all along, unconvinced by the fuss over Morocco having all it takes to be champions this year. For all the fuss and the Renaissance-fused sense of “this time will be ours,” skeptics had pointed out, albeit inaudibly—victory can indeed make one blind to the most glaring of suggestions—that scoring three laborious, luck-soaked goals to make it to the next round was no harbinger of a certain Renaissance to  come. And so there had been calls for Moroccan players to upgrade their performance; to be more clinical in defining, game-killing moments; to be more present—to actually score, you know, at least one third of their many chances. With baffling banality, though, especially as Moise Adilehou stunned Morocco at the 53rd minute, Benin now taking the lead, the Moroccan Lions’ furious ball-passing fluency and tactical cohesion looked uncannily impotent, unable to break the spines of a now organized, unwaveringly disciplined Benin. But Morocco did, in the end, score the equalizing goal, soothing the growing frustration among their fans. En-Nesyri’s 75th minute goal, if anything, rejuvenated Morocco’s faith, convincing them that they could still make it. Then came the penalty, the one action that Hakim Ziyech is sure to dwell on for months; and also, of course, the moment that Moroccans will have in the back of their minds: a missed penalty that could have prolonged their continental aspirations. With Benin now reduced to 10 men after Khaled Adenon’s red car, the scope of Morocco’s coming victory grew even more incontestable. Having completely dominated before the red car, Morocco now simply had to keep the same momentum and force Benin into making mistakes. For the 30 minutes of extra-time, entirely played in the second half, each minute was pregnant with the suggestion, or the hope, or the apprehension, that the Lions’ winning goal was somehow coming, just around the corner. But that last-minute liberating moment never came here. In Tunisia 15 years ago, Morocco gave Benin a smacking, tearing them apart 4-0 and exhausting them in the process. But here, while it looked like Morocco would prevail, the Lions had to pour in every single drop of their energy, and strain every last inch of their attacking arsenal. Here, Benin was exhausted; but so was Morocco. The Squirrels wavered in crucial moments, the illustration being the defensive gaffe that led to Morocco’s equalizer. But so did Morocco, statically dominant but giving no encouraging signs as to the final victory. And at times, the Moroccan Lions looked like the antithesis par excellence of the born again squad they have often embodied under Renard. As Morocco goes through another excruciating, soul-searching moment after yet another spirit-crushing exit from the Africa Cup of Nations, it will be tempting to castigate the team, or to say that, anyway, they have never been much of an encouraging side. But this would miss the bulk of the point. Another theory, more compelling, is that the level of football has staggeringly improved across the continent over the years. Morocco was brilliant here, but liberation eluded them. Or perhaps Benin was just a well-disciplined side that gave Morocco’s world-class players no space to fully express their class. There are moments in football that cannot be pinned down to one single factor; they shun reductionist descriptions and require nuance, complexity. Sometimes, explanation does not help. So you have to let the moment sink in, feeling or not, living or not, the indescribable pain of always having to be that favorite who never even makes it to the semi-finals, much less win the whole thing. The Atlas Lions will have to wait for another continental crown; what is hard to tell, though, is what the fans will make of decades of sustained passion that always ends up in disappointment, and of unconditional support never really rewarded.

Rabat – Dieudonné M’bala M’bala leaving a Paris courthouse, following a previous court appearance on Feb. 4, 2015. A Criminal Court in Paris has sentenced incendiary comedian Dieudonné M’bala M’bala to two years in prison for tax evasion. The comedian was suspected of diverting over a million euros in revenue from his live shows.  In addition to serving time in prison, on Friday, July 5 the court ordered the 53-year-old to pay a fine of €200,000. Dieudonné’s business partner and his production company were also fined for related tax evasion.The comedian, his partner, and his lawyers were all absent during the trial. France 24 reported Dieudonné, who has a large fan base in low-income areas around major French cities, will likely fulfill his sentence through community service instead of prison time. This was not the first time the controversial comedian has been summoned to court. As early as 2006, Dieudonné was fined for defamatory comments, calling a prominent Jewish television presenter a “secret donor of the child-murdering Israeli army.”  Dieudonné has since been repeatedly convicted for using provocative and anti-semetic language. The infamous comedian has been accused of publicly supporting terrorism, and referred to Holocaust commemorations as “memorial pornography.” In addition to multiple defamation lawsuits, Dieudonné was also convicted of tax evasion in 2012. Morocco has cancelled several of Dieudonné’s scheduled appearances in the past. The comedian alleged his shows were cancelled due to pressure from what he described as “community organizations.” Defending his language, Dieudonné has said he has the right to free speech and claimed he was the victim of a “Zionist Lobby.”

Rabat – At its “Breakfast Series” conference in Casablanca today, July 5, Upline Courtage, shared insights into the private insurance options for small and medium sized businesses.  Upline Courtage is the insurance advisor for the Moroccan banking group Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP). Small and medium businesses play a key role in Morocco’s economy. According to the Moroccan Confederation for Very Small and Small to Medium Businesses (VSBs and SMBs), these companies make up 98% of Morocco’s economic fabric.  Millions of Moroccans are employed in VSBs and SMBs, making it essential for these companies to consider insurance options for employees, in case of illness or death, and in relation to retirement and maternity payments. Private insurance can also bridge gaps in public social security. A 2018 report by UNICEF describes Morocco’s social security as “fragmented when it comes to financing, services, conditions of obtention and administration.” The report adds the system is “characterized by its weak coverage.” Morocco has a pension system in place, but according to UNICEF, coverage is limited; “only 20% of people aged 60 and above receive a pension.” At the breakfast series, the director of Upline Courtage, Khalid Boussaid, noted that pension payments can be low. “Sometimes you can find yourself at 60 years old, with a slim pension. You can be on the brink of poverty,” he warned.  Ghezala Monsif, BCP’s Market Leader for Small and Medium Businesses highlighted that insurance for VSBs and SMBs is a “topical theme.” In Morocco, many companies need to find solutions for holding on to human resources, Monsif explained. “Social security is a non-financial solution for companies wanting to hold on to their flighty, unique, and qualified staff.”  “Companies must be proactive to respond to issues in the markets,” he added. The Director of Attamine Chaabi, an insurance product of BCP, then explained key offerings of the Attamine Chaabi scheme. Having private insurance options makes a firm more attractive to its employees with Brain drain remaining as a concern for Moroccan employers.  According to the Ministry for Education, more than 600 engineers leave each year to Morocco to pursue career opportunities abroad.  These Moroccans are immigrating in search of better salaries and job prospects meaning that local companies are facing the challenge of retaining their staff. Upline Courtage organizes a bi-annual breakfast series, exploring insurance issues of key importance to BCP’s clients.  Today was the third breakfast series run by Upline Courtage. The first event held in April 2018 touched on insurance options in the construction sector.  The second event, in February of this year, explained default risks.

Rabat – Students from Rabat’s National School of Mineral Industry have announced their ongoing development of a new solar-powered vehicle designed to be used by the team for solar racing competitions in the future. After receiving substantial support following their first two prototypes — the Fennec and Eleadora1 — the team began development on their newest model: the Eleadora2, designed to improve upon many of the weaknesses of the previous models. Backed by partners such as the BMCE Bank of Africa, Crouzet, and Nareva, the team has worked to improve upon their previous models after analyzing their performance in the Moroccan Solar Race Challenge and the Somabay Egyptian Solar Challenge in 2017. Now, after over a year of design and redesign, the team has announced that the Eleadora2 will be ready to participate and represent Morocco in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in Australia in October 2019. The global competition began in 1987 and, at its start, took place once every three years. However, at the turn of the century, it became a biennial competition, attracting participants from countries around the world to showcase their developments in solar energy-based transportation. With participating teams being primarily made up of university students and corporations, the objective of the competition has always been to promote the research and development of solar-powered vehicles. Throughout the years, the competition has attracted a wide range of countries for participation, ranging from Japan to Brazil. However, 2019 will be the first time in the competition’s 32-year history that Morocco will be represented by a team.

Rabat – Lebanese Designer Zuhair Murad is the latest designer of many to seek inspiration from Morocco, with his autumn-winter 2019-2020 collection. The new collection, which he has dubbed “Mirages and Oasis,” was unveiled on Wednesday, July 3, in Paris as part of Haute Couture Fashion Week. With a mix of ochre, violet, gold, beaded embroidery, glitter and colored sequins, masterful jackets and capes, the collection gives off a strong bohemian chic vibe reminiscent of Marrakech in the 1970s. The dresses, all adorned with elaborate patterns and topped off with thick belts at the waist, draw obvious inspiration from Moroccan kaftans. Speaking to Vogue backstage at Fashion Week, Murad explained that he was inspired by Morocco after attending a gala in Marrakech. “Marrakech is paradise, I fell in love,” he said. “Such a cosmopolitan city. There’s so much heritage and tradition there, but it also has a modern vibe. It’s like Beirut, but with a different style,” he told the iconic fashion magazine. Designers across the world have been looking to Morocco for inspiration this year. H&amp;M Home, a Swedish company with stores worldwide, also chose Moroccan style as the focus of its summer collection. The company cited “the Moroccan landscape and the architecture of Marrakech, with the natural tones of the desert and the colors of the city” as a “great sources of inspiration” for the collection. The Swedish brand’s promotional shots, taken in Morocco’s desert and a typical Moroccan riad, make the Moroccan influence abundantly clear. American streetwear brand, Kith, has also released a Morocco-inspired summer collection. The collection features Moroccan inspired zellige prints on shorts, shirts, pants, and hats, making it possible to wear the print head-to-toe.

Rabat – Rami Malek, an American actor of Egyptian descent, has revealed that he only agreed to play a James Bond villain if the character has no religious or ideological affiliations. In an interview published in the British paper the Daily Mirror, the Academy Award Winner said he was firm with director Cary Fukunaga that while he would accept the role of villain, he would not play a religious fundamentalist. “I told him, ‘We cannot identify him with any act of terrorism reflecting an ideology or religion,'” said the actor. “‘That’s not something I would entertain, so if that is why I am your choice then you can count me out.'” Fukunaga agreed, subsequently cast Malek in the as yet untitled 25th Bond film, which is currently shooting in the UK. Malek said after his conversation with Fukunaga, he realized that an ideological terrorist was “clearly not his vision,” the actor is quoted as saying. “He’s a very different kind of terrorist.” Instead, the role Malek will be playing is “a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.” Malek added he was truly playing “a great character” and that he was “very excited” to be cast in the film, due out in April 2020. “It’s another extremely clever script from the people who have figured out exactly what people want in those movies,” he continued. The film, simpled titled “Bond 25,” will also see British actor Daniel Craig return for the role of James Bond for the 5th time.

Rabat – Over 2,540 palm trees and 1,500 olive trees were consumed by a fire that stretched over 20 hectares of land in the Ziz oasis in the commune of Ratb. Despite the extensive damage, officials, aided by locals, had the flames under control on Thursday, July 4. Hot summer weather was said to be a factor in the fire. Despite the substantial damage to foliage, no human lives were lost in the fire. Civil Protection and the Royal Gendarmerie were able to bring the fire under complete control before the damage continued to spread. Local authorities and members of the population living in the area assisted in the efforts. The vast palmeraies are nourished by the Oued (River) Ziz river flowing through the Ziz valley en route to the Sahara desert. Recent heat waves in Morocco are thought to have created favorable conditions for the oasis fire. Although reports in recent years show forest fires have declined in Morocco due to mitigation efforts, the threat remains an issue. Authorities in the Errachidia province have developed an Action Plan for 2019 to help prevent fires in the region.

Rabat – Vivo Energy Maroc, the energy company, launched on June 27, a highway awareness campaign named #CodeWahed. The company, which distributes Shell gasoline and oil products as well as Butagaz liquefied Petroleum Gas throughout Morocco, launched the campaign in order to raise road safety awareness among Moroccan drivers. The hashtag campaign, launched at the beginning of June 2019 on social networks, urges Internet users to respect the road code by signing a “digital contract”. The National Committee for Traffic Accident (CNPAC) has also been involved in the campaign and has facilitated the promotion and broadcast of #CodeWahed on national television. In their press release, Vivo Energy Maroc, revealed that “the objective of #CodeWahed is in line with that of the authorities; to reduce the number of accidents by 50% by 2026 by improving road safety.” Hind Mejjati-Alami, Communications Director at Vivo Energy Morocco, stated that “the idea of #CodeWahed started with the observation that, unfortunately, there are almost as many road codes as there are drivers in Morocco.”  She further added, “our message is simple, there is one road code to be respected by everyone! The originality of our approach is that it promotes public awareness through a hashtag called #CodeWahed.” The #CodeWahed campaign has proven to be increasingly successful. More than 20 influencers and thousands of Internet users have supported and shared the hashtag.  The initiative reached approximately 10 million Internet users in only a few weeks. In collaboration with the CNPAC, Moroccan television channels are expected to broadcast the awareness message #CodeWahed during prime time.  This campaign is an unprecedented initiative as the summer holidays approach. Vivo Energy Morocco has honored its commitment to road safety awareness for over 15 years. The company adopted an extensive road safety program which allowed it to remain a pioneer and leader in road safety. Through its #CodeWahed campaign, Vivo Energy Maroc hopes to create a security and health prevention culture which involves shareholders, staff, subcontractors, associates, and the general public.

Rabat – Cheb Khaled, Algeria’s world-renowned and celebrated Rai-style singer, has sparked controversy for appearing to sympathize with the Moroccan Atlas Lions over his own country’s football team. The King of Rai, as the Algerian star is endearingly called by fans of the musical genre, unveiled his latest single in late June on the heels of the ongoing African Cup of Nations.  The single, titled “Morocco 4 Ever,” reads like a declaration of love to the Moroccan football team, in addition to highlighting Khaled’s attachment to Morocco, a country he often refers to as a “sister nation” to Algeria and whose people he has repeatedly called “brothers and sisters” of Algerians.  In the video of Morocco 4 ever, Khaled is seen draped in the Moroccan flag as the video background plays flashes of goals by the Moroccan football team.  Unsurprisingly, the gesture did not sit well with some Algerian nationalist circles.  In a short but excoriating article published on July 3, Algerian Arab-language news outlet Ennahar castigated the singer for heaping praise on the Moroccan national team rather than on his own country’s.  Since Algerian players are taking part in the same tournament (CAN) as the Moroccans, Ennahar’s article lashed out, Khalid “should have rather sung for your own country’s national team.”  Morocco and Algeria both topped their groups at the ongoing CAN tournament. They won all three of their group matches and made a winning impression on CAN watchers, many of whom now consider the two North African teams among the favorites to lift the continental trophy.  Morocco’s Atlas Lions are set to play against Benin a 5.p.m today in the tournament’s first round of 16 games, while Algeria prepares to take on Guinea on Sunday, July 7, at 8 p.m. Moroccan time. Khaled’s latest single is not without precedent.  The Algerian singer, whom King Mohammed VI granted Moroccan citizenship in 2013 for his fondness for Morocco and keen interest in social peace and stability among Maghreb countries, has a strong record of Morocco-friendly declarations.  In April of 2018, while praising Moroccans’ hospitality and easy-going nature, Khaled singularly cited Morocco’s support for Algerian independence as one of the many reasons he loves Morocco. “Moroccan blood poured for Algeria,” the Algerian star explained. He added, perhaps more significantly, “We are brothers, we have the same traditions and we share the same language.”

Rabat – The Municipal Administrative Police (PAC) force were officially deployed in Casablanca on Thursday, July 4th. After a 6 month pilot in 5 districts,  Mâarif, Sidi Belyout, Anfa, Sidi Othman and Moulay Rachid, the force has now rolled out across the entirety Casablanca. PAC will oversee several areas, the main ones being hygiene, public health and cleanliness, urban planning, and the occupation of the public domain. The goal of the force is reportedly to improve living conditions in Casablanca, modernize the administrative system, as well as to “positively influence the behavior of citizens and to reinforce compliance with legislation.” According to City Council President Abdelaziz El Omari, the administrative police will also play a role in controlling the execution of the waste management contracts signed with companies Averda and Derichebourg. For now, the number of agents on the PAC force will be 150, with 6 inspectors for the majority of the districts: 109 inspectors in total, including 20 women, 16 supervisors, 18 administrative agents, and 7 health workers. The inspectors will be equipped with 121 tablets with a mobile application installed to aid with control and supervision. PAC will also receive 52 cars for supervisors and inspectors, 3 motorcycles, 26 mobile phones, 23 desktops, and 6 laptops. Each inspector will also be allocated two uniforms and a business card.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), which is part of the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGSN), announced in a statement on July 5, the arrest of a 19-year-old from Beni Chiker in the province of Nador, suspected of affiliation with ISIS terrorist group. The individual was apprehended on an international search warrant. In an official statement, the BCIJ revealed that it had coordinated with the Spanish Civil Guard as part of its effort to monitor extremist individuals with terrorist projects/plans. The BCIJ explained that initial investigations confirmed the individual’s extremist ideology, his significant involvement in propaganda and promotion of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (ISIS), and his glorification of the group’s violent operations. The investigation, carried out in collaboration with Spanish authorities, showed that the suspect intended to learn how to manufacture explosives and search for firearms to be used in the execution of high-level terrorist operations in coordination with ISIS militants. The BCIJ added that this operation confirms the continuous terrorist threats carried out by ISIS supporters, who are implementing the constant calls of the group’s leader to execute terrorist operations worldwide. According to the statement, the suspect will be brought to justice immediately after the completion of the investigation conducted under the supervision of the Public Prosecution Office.

Rabat – Ahead of this Friday’s clash with Benin in the first knockout game of the 2019 CAN, Morocco’s Herve Renard is urging his team to rise to the challenge and keep their reputation as a serious contender for the continental crown.   Speaking at a pre-match press conference on July 4, Renard urged his squad to raise the quality and intensity of their performance, arguing that “another competition starts now.”  Renard said: “This is another competition that starts now.” He spoke of the knockout stage is being a long walk where access to the next stage passes through “flawless” performance in the previous. The imagery was an apt description.  At this stage, defeat comes with an immediate consequence, and there will be little room for decent or lukewarm performances. To advance in the tournament and hope to be counted among serious contenders, Renard stressed, the Atlas Lions will need to strain physically and mentally and meet the load of expectations from Moroccan fans.  “From now on,” the Moroccan explained, “we will need to start each match with a different attitude.” But, he emphasized, the overarching goal will remain unchanged: “To remain focused and concede the fewest mistakes possible.” Realizing such a goal, Renard went on to add, demands devotion,“ a flawless teamwork,” and an “unfailing commitment.”  Benin, Morocco’s challenger in Friday’s first round of 16 games, showed glimpses of defensive maturity and exemplary mentality.  The Squirrels, as the Beninese squad is nicknamed, progressed to the next stage after drawing all three of its group matches.  While such results speak of a team that struggles to score, the performances highlight a compact and disciplined team that plays with a keen awareness of its limitations.  Finding the crack that will make them crumble will be a tough challenge, Renard conceded. He said the Squirrels’ style of play shows “they are not here by accident.” Even as he acknowledged Benin’s tactical maturity, Renard seemed convinced that Morocco is the better side and should be able to win, barring any repeat of the usual sporting upsets.   Victory against Benin is “a must” if the Moroccan Lions “want to live up to their ambitions,” Renard concluded.

Rabat – Bank Al Maghrib (BAM), Morocco’s central bank, has opened investigations to determine the circumstances that led to the strange loss of MAD 1.2 million from a heavily guarded cash convoy. In a statement, BAM noted that the lost cash was taken from a cash-provision convoy. BAM regularly provides its services across Morocco with cash from the headquarters in Rabat. The process entails a road trip by a specially—and heavily—guarded BAM delegation. The convoy includes BAM workers accompanied by an important number of Royal Gendarmerie officers. The vehicles’ boots contain coffers of cash, with each coffer accommodating a thousand MAD 200 bank notes. In the case of this particular reported incident, the BAM convoy was charged with providing cash to the “northern axis,” BAM’s code name for Northern Morocco. Tetouan was the delegation’s final destination, with stops in Kenitra, Larache, and Tangier. The scam was discovered by authorities at the BAM agency in Tetouan. Once the convoy reached its final destination, BAM Tetouan agents noticed a slight difference in the weight of the cash bags. Having concluded that the coffers were less heavy than usual, they decided to open each box and manually count the amount of cash it contained. After counting, they discovered that 1.2 were missing from the original amount. The statement noted that BAM’s executive board and the Royal Gendarmerie are opening a joint investigation to “determine where responsibility lies” in this corruption scandal. The announcement emphasized that those responsible for the odd occurrence will be held accountable as soon as further light is shed in the whereabouts of the missing cash. It is also hoped, the announcement suggested, that the Tetouan episode might open the gates for investigations into similar cases that might have gone unnoticed in the past. The news comes as Morocco faces a rising tide of corruption in public administration. For all its recent political reforms, the country has not particularly done well on the corruption front. A major point of contention at the most recent national conference on taxation on May 4 was the deepening climate of mistrust in Morocco, especially between citizens and representatives of government institutions. A major main takeaway from the national conference on taxation was the need to reclaim the trust of citizens. One speaker at the national event pointed out that the “confidence pact” between Moroccan authorities and citizens has reached such a low level that most Moroccans tend to perceive government representatives as either ineffective or “potential cheaters.”

Rabat – In a letter addressed to its shareholders on July 1, the exploration company stated it has completed negotiations with the Moroccan National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) and has prepared the relevant contracts for the permit.  According to Europa Oil &amp; Gas, the final piece of administration required before the permit is issued is a bank guarantee. “We are working hard to complete this final round of documentation and once in place we will sign the agreements with ONHYM in Rabat,” the company revealed. The scope of the exploration permit has not yet been announced. It will cover the “Atlantic margin of Morocco,” a strip along Morocco’s coastline from Tangier in the country’s far north to Laguera, the southernmost point of Western Sahara in southern Morocco.  The company stated it would provide more information on the licence once it signs the agreement with ONHYM. Europa Oil &amp; Gas has until now only undertaken explorations in the UK and Ireland. It will be the company’s first venture in Morocco. A number of foreign companies are actively collecting data on drilling opportunities in Morocco.  This year, ONHYM has already signed three agreements with major foreign exploration companies including Chariot Oil and Gas (Morocco), Predator Gas Ventures, Qatar Petroleum and ENI. In 2018, according to ONHYM data, thirteen foreign partners invested MAD 1.41 billion in petroleum exploration in Morocco, and ONHYM invested MAD 31 million. Investors drilled seven new wells last year, including one offshore well.

Rabat – Morocco and USAID, a US international development and humanitarian organization, have been working collaboratively on development projects since the 1960s with a particular focus on youth employability, citizen participation in governance, and primary school education. Morocco’s government has created its own policies to counter these issues and USAID funding and programming is intended to support and expand upon the work the Moroccan government is already doing. Morocco is one of the US’s oldest allies in the MENA region and the US has been providing economic assistance to Moroccan development initiatives since the country achieved its independence in 1957.  After USAID was founded in 1961, it launched a series of projects in Morocco. Over time, partnerships between Morocco and USAID have increased access to credit for investors and entrepreneurs, as well as improved infrastructure throughout the country. Additionally, USAID has provided 20 years of assistance to Morocco’s water sector – improving water resource management in the Souss-Massa River Basin and building the Mohammed V and Mechra Homadi dams. The project “H2O Maghreb” continues improvements in this field today. USAID also has a 30-year partnership with Morocco’s Ministry of Health in family planning and has played a role in reducing maternal and infant mortality.  Most recently, Morocco and USAID signed a $94 million dollar agreement Wednesday, July 3, to finance a multi-faceted socio-economic development project that addresses topics ranging from improving local economic growth to supporting at-risk youth. During the meeting, the Moroccan Minister of Finance acknowledged his satisfaction with the quality of past USAID projects and the success of previous collaborations between Morocco and the US. Recent achievements have centered on youth education and employability. Notably, the Favorable Opportunities to Reinforce Self-Advancement for Today’s Youth (FORSATY) program aims to strengthen bonds between young people and their community to prevent youth delinquency in nine marginalized neighborhoods in Northern Morocco. FORSATY has reached approximately 22,000 at-risk youth, and 4,500 have been helped to find jobs or internships since 2013.   Additionally, over 100,000 youth have benefited from USAID Career Center services, including 33,000 who have received work-readiness training. In partnership with the Ministry of National Education, USAID established training for teachers and programming for young students learning to read.  The 2015 pilot program reached 12,000 students and 340 teachers. The program was implemented nationwide in 2017, with hopes of countering high illiteracy rates. USAID aims to simultaneously further American interests in markets and trade abroad while improving lives and promoting democratic values in over 100 countries abroad. The organizations’ underlying goal is for its partners to become self-reliant and able to develop on their own.

Rabat – A facility housing hundreds of migrants and asylum seekers, including women and children, was the site of a horrific attack the morning of Wednesday, July 3. At least 44 were killed and 130 injured, including several Moroccan citizens.  Opposition leader General Khalifa Haftar’s forces were blamed for the airstrike. Haftar countered the accusation, claiming Government of National Accord (GNA) forces were responsible.  The United Nations has said that the attack could constitute a war crime. Eric Goldstein of Human Rights Watch called the attack “a tragic but foreseeable consequence of fighting among heavily armed factions with scant regard for civilian lives, whether Libyan or foreign. Libya has been in an ongoing state of turmoil that escalated following the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.  Recently the country plunged into yet another civil war. Tripoli has turned into a battlefield as General Khalifa Haftar’s Libya National Army (LNA) fights to wrest control of the capitol from the UN-backed GNA. Located just east of Tripoli in the town of Tajoura, the detention center held over 600 migrants. Government-run detention centers in Libya house thousands of migrants.  This includes people hoping to travel onwards to their final destination, as well as individuals sent back to Libya after trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat.  The Consulate General of the Kingdom of Morocco in Tunis confirmed eighteen Moroccan citizens were living at the center in Tajoura at the time of the attack.  “Two Moroccans were gravely injured, and four others were slightly injured. All the injured have been admitted to hospital for treatment,” the Consulate said in a statement. Bodies are still being recovered from the site of the attack. Currently none of the victims identified were Moroccans. One of the injured was 26-year-old Moroccan Al-Mahdi Hafyan. He had been at the center for three months. Along with the other Moroccans injured, he was taken to a hospital.  Hafyan described the carnage at the center to AFP news agency, saying there were “bodies, blood and pieces of flesh everywhere.”  The Consulate General of the Kingdom of Morocco in Tunis will continue to report any new developments.

Rabat – Upon the declaration of the US independence on July 4, 1776 two of the first three states to acknowledge the country’s sovereignty and freedom were Muslim, zealously supporting America’s notion that freedom lies in being fearless.  Morocco was the first state to recognize the independence of the United States of America, signing the first Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship, under Morocco’s Sultan Muhammad III in December 1777. Friesland, one of the seven United Provinces of the Dutch Republic, was the next to recognize the American independence.  The Mysore State in India followed their example, being the third to praise liberty as a breath of life to all nations.  The actions of those states centuries ago are the proof that the 4th of July should not just come and go.  Americans must make it a remarkable day and a celebration; a great opportunity to further elevate the magnificence of national integration and appreciate the Muslim contribution to it— but, unfortunately, this is not the case today.  “I remember my supervisor at work made a comment about how Morocco was the first supporter of American independence; and that they had always been a really close ally to the US, but that is something not included in the things we are learning while we study the American history,” said Paige Duskie, a 20-year-old student from Huntsville, Alabama who is currently working for a Human Rights NGO in Rabat, told Morocco World News.  Muslims have been at the center of attention for years from a socio-political perspective.  A wide variety of events, including acts of terrorism and extreme violence, which severely concerned the global community, caused the United States to largely discriminate against Muslims.   Many Americans now associate them with acts of religious extremism, severely tarnishing their freedom and dignity; according to studies conducted on the US media content, as well as on Muslim attitudes towards the US. “And definitely with the current climate, the Muslim contribution to American independence is pushed to the side a bit more because there is a lot of apprehensions towards predominately Muslim countries in the US,” Duskie said. Today, the culture of fear is deeply ingrained in the American society and robustly feeds off the Muslim community’s freedom; one that the latter graciously offered to the US more than 240 years ago— now long forgotten.  “There are a lot of religious groups that supported the independence of America; we didn’t really learn about Muslims in our history classes at school,” sHaley Kolus, a 20-year-old student from Los Angeles, California who is spending her summer interning in Rabat, told MWN.  “But, still, a lot of people wouldn’t know that, and also wouldn’t care to know that because of the existing culture of fear and anxiety towards the Muslim community,” she explained.  As a religion, Islam encompasses and teaches the freedom of conscience and the virtues of justice and liberty.  There are Muslims, as well as people from other religions, who do not manage to live up to the ideals of their own faith, sadly causing the reverberation of constant fear and agony to become a substantial element of their religious identity. “The current climate in the US towards Muslims is really gross and sad,” Duskie said. “It is destroying those relations that we’ve had for a long time and an ally that has been supportive to us; but that’s just the way the world is working right now.”  After all, the 4thof July might not simply be about the dazzling fireworks, the fancy parades, and family gatherings.  Each and every single one of these celebrations might be an opportunity for every American to reflect; to ponder the manner Americans fought about what an “American” should mean— and the essence of this word certainly includes granting freedom to those who first conceded that liberty should dwell in the United States of America 243 years ago.  Because freedom is priceless; it is rather a taken than simply a given, something worth fighting for. But, the wholesome meaning of freedom is directly proportional to someone’s ability to question oneself, question one’s own faith, explore myths and prejudices about what’s seemingly foreign and, eventually, discover all the answers essential to being truly free.  Happy 4thof July!

Rabat – The Scottish rock group brought the Casablanca Hippodrome to its feet on the first night of the Jazzablanca Festival, lasting from July 2 -12. The band started the set – their first on the continent – with “Stand On The Horizon” from their 2013 album “Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action.” Although Alex Kapranos mostly exhorted the audience with phrases of French or in his native English, he also demonstrated that he had memorized some Darija before taking the stage. “Kulchi bekhir? Kulchi mezian?” Kapranos asked the crowd, delivering the customary Moroccan greeting like a slightly sheepish punchline, to cheers from the audience. However, Franz Ferdinand’s showmanship was far more physical than linguistic: Kapranos’ made periodic fan kicks at the microphone. During the rendition of 2004 hit “Take Me Out,” four of the five musicians moved center stage for synchronized jumps during the chorus. Franz Ferdinand’s eponymously titled 2004 debut album launched them onto the global music scene, one of a handful of rock bands to emerge from Great Britain in the early 2000s. Along with the Kaiser Chiefs and the Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand helped pioneer a dancefloor-friendly, slightly frenetic, punk-influenced variant of rock. The setlist telescoped in time, interspersing Grammy-nominated hits from the early 2000s with tracks from their most recent album, “Always Ascending,” released in February 2018. Audience members enthusiastically sang along to “Do You Want To,” a track from Franz Ferdinand’s 2005 album “You Could Have It So Much Better,” the group’s second album, which also topped the charts in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Performing for Casablanca, Franz Ferdinand alternated  hits from their early repertoire, such as “The Dark Of The Matinée,” “Jacqueline,” and “Michael,” with recent songs like “Ulysses” and “Lazy Boy.” Returning to the stage for the encore, Kapranos addressed the crowd with a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other, instructing everyone to “feel the love.” Leaving the stage at the end of the set, the musicians graciously paused for selfies and handshakes with fans gathering by the exit. Jazzablanca’s history roughly coincides with Franz Ferdinand’s timeline: the first festival was held in 2006. Now on its 14th edition, Jazzablanca boasts of presenting a wide range of artists representing an equally wide range of genres.  Homegrown ensemble Les Frères Souissi, branding themselves as Moroccan Jazz, will perform at this year’s festival as will the disco-funk legend Al McKay, the Grammy-winning guitarist of 1970s group Earth, Wind, and Fire.

Rabat – American rapper Nicki Minaj, known for her provocative lyrics and outfits, has people scratching their heads over her decision to perform in Saudi Arabia at the Jeddah World Festival on July 18. The confusion stems from people wondering how she will execute her usually racy performances in the notoriously conservative country. In reaction to the announcement, #NickiMinaj trended on Twitter. Nicki Minaj: PINK WIG THICK ASS GIVE EM WHIPLASH Conservative saudi audience: pic.twitter.com/QQ3azP2vXq — Amal (@Alamalexia) July 3, 2019  “Imagine waking up from a three-year coma and the first thing you hear is Nicki Minaj is opening a musical festival in Saudi Arabia, I’d honestly think I woke up in some parallel universe,” one user wrote. Another user jokingly questioned whether organizers knew just who they picked as a headliner – writing “No one in Saudi Arabia googled Nicki Minaj did they?” However, not all the commentary was so light-hearted. Some pointed out the double standard of having such a provocative singer perform in a country where women are still heavily restricted, particularly in terms of modesty. In a video posted on Twitter, one Saudi woman questioned why the authorities were inviting Minaj to perform while Saudi women are still required to wear the abaya – a long loose-fitting garment worn in public for modesty. “She’s going to go and shake her ass and all her songs are indecent and about sex and shaking ass,” she said. “And then you tell me to wear the abaya. What the hell?” the woman said. Some users doctored images to show Minaj wearing traditional Saudi dress, a huge juxtaposition from her usual concert attire, and wondered if that’s what she’ll wear during the performance. Many asked if she would be doing her signature twerking in an abaya. One user suggested that the choice to perform in Saudi Arabia, where the death penalty is still imposed for same-sex acts, shows Minaj has fickle values, going against her apparent support of the LGBT community for monetary gain. “Have you seen ‘queer ally’ Nicki Minaj is doing a concert for Saudi royals? Only 3 days ago she was making her pink dollar at pride, now she’s off getting her homophobe dollar!” the tweet read. You seen ‘queer ally’ Nicki minaj is doing a concert for Saudi royals?

Rabat – Despite slowed economic growth and a widening fiscal deficit, the central bank of Morocco — Bank al-Maghrib — has announced that the country’s macroeconomic conditions are likely to remain relatively stable. The bank has also declared that risks to these conditions remain at a “generally moderate” level overall. According to the bank, his year, national growth deteriorated to 3% and is expected to continue in its decline until reaching 2.8% in 2019. Afterwards, however, national growth is anticipated to recover and increase to 4% in 2020. Meanwhile, Bank al-Maghrib has reported that the country’s deficit has increased slightly to 3.7% and will likely reach 4.1% in 2019 before falling back down to 3.8% in 2020. The report also emphasized the resilience of Morocco’s banking and financial sectors, stating that the two have continued to maintain exceedingly profitable and stable, despite increasingly unstable conditions within the sectors. The insurance sector and stock markets have also seen noticeable improvement; however, the latter has only begun to stabilize following an exceptionally poor year in 2018. Given the volatility of international trade in the current climate, Bank al-Maghrib has also discussed a number of improvements to the country’s macroeconomic systems in order to ensure stability and growth in the future. After reviewing the financial sector’s implementation of recommendations from the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (GAFIMOAN), Bank al-Maghrib concluded that the international situation remains unfavorable amid rising tensions and market volatility. However, Bank al-Maghrib maintained that Morocco’s position in this international situation, as well as its position domestically, will remain relatively secure and stable for the foreseeable future.

Rabat – Representatives of the Hassan II Foundation for the Social Work of Former Soldiers and Veterans (OSAMAC) and the National Railways Office signed an agreement on Wednesday, July 3, to ensure cheaper access to train tickets for military veterans and their dependents. The partnership was signed in the presence of the Minister-Delegate for National Defense Abdeltif Loudyi as well as senior members of the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces. For the families of soldiers killed or wounded during service, the new agreement provides a 75% discount on train ticket prices at any station in Morocco. This includes both the soldiers’ spouses and children, up until the age of 21 or 26 if the child remains in full time education. Meanwhile, for retired servicemen, as well as their immediate families, the agreement will provide a 50% discount on train ticket prices.  The agreement also applies to the families of veterans who died after their military service has ended, as well as for veterans and retirees from the National Defense Administration (NAD). For both of these categories, discounts apply to both first- and second-class train tickets on any ONCF train. They also apply towards tickets for the “Al Boraq” high-speed train system running from Casablanca to Tangier. However, the flexibility of these discounts has its limits, with one exception being the Casablanca-Kenitra route, but only during peak operating hours.

Rabat – The Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Benchaaboun, and the director of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Brooke Sherman signed the agreement on July 3 in Rabat. At the signing, the director of USAID stated that the agreement marked “a new era” in the collaboration between the agency and Morocco. The latest donation is a substantial sum, more than four times the amount USAID granted for one of USAID’s most recent major projects “Career Centers.” USAID donated $24 million and assisted with developing the Career Centers program. The initiative, which assists Moroccans to transition from education to employment, was launched in 2015 and will run until 2020. Since 2001, USAID has donated close to $500 million to Morocco, to fund a large number of initiatives across a variety of sectors including education, employment, health ,and resource management. According to USAID figures, 97% of the funds go towards economic development projects, while 3% go towards military initiatives. The majority of USAID funding, the latest figures indicate $231 million, goes to education sector initiatives. The substantially larger $94 million granted by USAID yesterday will go towards a development program made of up three components, according to the press release by the Ministry. The first component involves an integrated local development program which will cover the economic growth and governance sectors in the regions of Marrakech-Safi and Beni Mellal-Khenifra. The second provides for the creation of public-private partnerships, which will include the launch of a virtual reality and augmented reality technology center at an as yet unnamed Moroccan university. The third component will support activities that reinforce community resilience, by strengthening the capacity of key institutions and civil society organizations in providing services to at-risk youth. The signing ceremony was attended by a number of US and Moroccan officials including the chargee d’affaires of the US embassy to Morocco, Jennifer Rasamimana, the State Secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mounia Boucetta, as well as representatives of the Ministry for the Interior, and the Ministry for National Education.

Rabat – Boeing has offered to pay $100 Million following a string of lawsuits from the families of the October 2018 and March 2019 crash victims; Press conferences and a number of other congressional hearings have also taken place during investigations into the cause of the two aeroplane crashes. The first 737 Max crash was the JT610 flight, owned by the Indonesian airline Lion Air, which went down in the Java Sea off Jakarta in October 29, 2018. A near identical aircraft, ET302 flight of Ethiopian Airlines, crashed on  March 10, 2019. The two incidents killed 346 people including international experts and members of government delegations who were heading for an international conference on the environment in Nairobi. Two Moroccans, travelling to Nairobi for the conference, were among the victims. The first, Ahmed Chehab worked for the Regional Directorate of Sustainable Development in the region of Drâa-Tafilalet. The second Moroccan victim was Hassan Essiyouti, a university professor at Hassan II University.  In a press release, Boeing described the proposed $100 Million as an “initial investment” over the years. It also revealed its intention to work with local governments and non-profit organizations to cover living expenses and boost economic growth in areas impacted by crashing planes. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s president and CEO, said in its press release that the company is “sorry for the tragic loss of lives in both of these accidents and these lives lost will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and minds for years to come.” “The families and loved ones of those on board have our deepest sympathies, and we hope this initial outreach can help bring them comfort,” he added. However, the lawyers of victims’ families dismissed Boeing’s initiative. Nomi Husain, the lawyer representing some of the  ET302 victims’ families, told the BBC’s transport correspondent that Boeing’s payment “doesn’t come anywhere close to compensating the families for what has been taken from them.” He further added that Boeing “put profit over safety to get their number-one selling plane to market.” Robert Clifford, who is legally representing 23 families, said to the BBC: “this type of offer so early in the litigation process is unprecedented. Because there is still so much to learn about what occurred, it also appears to be disingenuous.”

Rabat – The leader of the Netherlands’ far-right nationalist party PVV, Geert Wilders, is causing a stir again, as part of his “fewer Moroccans” appeal. The controversial politician took to Twitter to post a photo of a Moroccan flag in a pool, with the incendiary caption; “We want our pools back! Make them safe for women and children again.” He topped the post off by saying “Tackle the nuisance at last! #StopTerrorism,” implying that Moroccans are inherently terrorists. We willen onze zwembaden terug! Weer veilig voor onze vrouwen en dochters. Pak het overlastgevende tuig eindelijk eens keihard aan! Stop de #zwembadterreur !! pic.twitter.com/stByjgVZa9 — Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) July 2, 2019 The tweet received 361 retweets and over a 1000 likes. The responses to the tweet are mostly from his far-right followers expressing their agreement. “Stop this cancer population,” one user replied. “If the police don’t do it, we will do it ourselves. But then don’t complain if there’s a civil war because Dutch dads beat Muslims completely rotten,” another user said. Wilders has been making his disdain for Moroccans clear for years. In February 2017, he made headlines for calling Moroccans “scum” and said he wanted to make the Netherlands “ours again” during his election campaign. “The Moroccan scum in Holland … once again not all are scum … but there is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who make the streets unsafe, mostly young people … and that should change,” he told journalists. Wilders also said he would ban the Quran if he came to power, and is known for chanting “fewer Moroccans!” with his supporters during rallies. While he does have supporters for his extreme views, he has faced a substantial amount of backlash – and legal ramifications. In 2017, he was charged with inciting discrimination, although he received no fines or jail time with the conviction. However, just last month, he was charged with inciting discrimination again, and this time he has to pay €5,000 fine. The charge stems from comments he made during a political rally just before the elections in March 2014, when he again encouraged the crowd to chant “fewer Moroccans!”

Rabat – Born in Fez, in June 1997, Youssef En-Nesyri grew up dreaming of becoming a footballer. He was first introduced to the sport in the football club Maghreb AS, before joining Mohammed VI Football Academy and officially beginning his youth career. In 2015, at the age of only 18, En-Nesyri joined the Spanish football team Málaga CF for a $125,000 fee.  Nasser Larguet, head of the Mohammed VI Football Academy said at the time that, given En-Nesyri’s training and ability, the young footballer would be offered many opportunities like that in the future. “Clubs must understand that at age 18, it’s time to give these kids a chance,” said Larguet. “Out of 18 players of the 97-98 generation who have followed the curriculum of the Mohamed VI academy, 17 have signed a pro contract. Among our greatest players, we have (…) En-Nesyri.”  Assigned to the reserve team, Atlético Malagueño, En-Nesryi scored a goal in his first match against Guadix CF in April 2016 and continued to impress by scoring in the team’s next three games against CD Huétor Tájar, le River Melilla, and FC Vilafranca.  These performances that rendered him a full member of Málaga CF after the team management’s quest on promoting him. In July 2016, En-Nesyri was included by Juan de Ramos’, the team’s manager, in the pre-season squad, where he remarkably scored a double in a 4-0 friendly win against Algeciras CF.  In August of the same year, after having scored six goals during the pre-season, En-Nesyri agreed to a contract extension with the team until 2020. En-Nesyri scored his first professional goal on 21 September 2016, netting the winner in a 2–1 home victory against SD Eibar after coming on as a substitute for Brazilian footballer Charles Dias de Oliveira.  After his descended to the second division with the club of Málaga CF, En-Nesyri attracted the interest of the Spanish club CD Leganes, which competes in La Liga. In August 2018, En-Nesyri signed a five-year contract with CD Leganes in the main category, for $10 million, beating any previous record in the history of the Spanish team. His move to CD Leganes rendered En-Nesyri the most expensive footballer ever trained in Morocco.  In November 2018, Mauricio Pellegrino, the coach of CD Leganes, praised En-Nesyri for his talent, noting that he belongs to the team’s future. “We trust Youssef,” Pellegrino said. “He will be a striker for many years in La Liga. En-Nesyri offers different alternatives to Carrillo and Santos. He has talent and youth.” In February 2019, En-Nesyri scored a hat-trick in a game against Real Betis, becoming the first Leganes player to do so in La Liga. During the 2017-2018 La Liga season, En-Nesyri managed to contribute with four goals in 25 league appearances, although he suffered a serious injury. After representing Morocco at the under-20 football team, El-Nesyri was invited to the full squad by the Moroccan national team’s manager, Hervé Renard, in August 2016 for friendlies against Albania and São Tomé and Príncipe.  He made his debut against Albania nine days later, starting in a 0–0 draw at the Loro Boriçi Stadium in Shkodër.  En-Nesyri was included in the squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and scored against Spain in the group stages, after coming on as a late substitute. En-Nesyri is currently in Egypt with the Atlas Lions competing in the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN)2019. The team is now entering the knockout stage of the tournament with 9 points after having beaten Namibia, Ivory Coast, and South Africa. En-Nesyri marked an outstanding performance in the match against Ivory Coast in Cairo, scoring Morocco’s opener and securing the Atlas Lions victory with a 1-0.  A picture of him kneeling down in prayer after scoring the team’s only goal in Cairo went viral on Friday, June 28, 2019.

Rabat – Bouygues Immobilier Maroc announced that its departure is due to the lack of “visibility” on the real-estate market, reports Moroccan news source TelQuel. “Morocco’s real-estate market has become restricted. Because there is no market visibility, and because of the fact that the market is tight, Bouygues Immobilier has decided to leave Morocco,” said Ali Bencheqroun, the director of Bouygues Batiment International for Africa and the Middle East, Bouygues Immobilier’s parent company. Bouygues Immobilier will leave Morocco once it has completed its residential development project “Les Faubourgs D’Anfa,” in one of the wealthier suburbs of Casablanca. In March, Bouygues Immobilier lost its bid for the construction of the headquarters of the bank Credit Agricole Maroc. The 13,000 square meters, eight story building on the Anfa boulevard in Casablanca will, instead, be built by Moroccan construction company Yamed Construction. According to Bencheqroun, “there are no other real-estate market opportunities right now.” Bouygues Batiment International has two other subsidiaries in Morocco, Bymaro and Colas. According to Bencheqroun, these subsidiaries will continue to operate unaffected by the withdrawal of the parent company. Bouygues Immobilier Maroc was founded in 2014 and came to Morocco to fulfill the contract on the construction of the Faubourg D’Anfa project in Casablanca, a 400 residential apartment and commercial building development. In a press release at the time, Bouygues stated that “the implantation [of Bouygues Immobilier Maroc] is the foundation stone of a long-lasting presence in Morocco.” Bouygues Immobilier Morocco was unavailable for further comment on the reasons for its withdrawal from the country.

Rabat – The tower will have a hub height of 144 meters, the tallest on the African continent, and a rated power of 3.6 MW.  The press release by Nabrawind does not specify the proposed location of the tower but states installation will begin at the end of the year. Morocco is a leader in renewable energy infrastructure projects. The country has ambitious targets to bring national electricity production to 52% by 2030 and is well on track to reaching its 2020 goal of 42% renewable energy production. The deal for the Nabralift tower shows Morocco’s willingness to invest in state-of-the-art technologies. Nabralift is a new wind turbine technology, and the Moroccan contract is the first order of the design. Unlike other designs, the Nabralift tower can be installed without using large-size cranes, thanks to a new self-erecting system at the base of the tower pylon.  This lowers the need for special installation equipment costs and allows the tower to be installed on difficult terrain. The Nabralift design also has a lower-cost foundation. Other towers with a gravitational foundation can require 500 meters cubed of concrete and 60 tons of steel for installation into the ground. The Nabralift foundation only requires 80 meters cubed of concrete and 10 tons of steel. According to Nabrawind, this makes it “60% cheaper than the traditional [tower].” The current tallest wind turbine in Africa is in South Africa, a 115-meter tall tower installed by Siemens Gamesa. Under Morocco’s Integrated Wind Energy Project, the country aims to bring the installed capacity of wind farms to 2000MW by 2020.  Launched in 2010, the strategy has a total investment value of MAD 31.5 billion (approximately $3.2 billion).

Rabat – The controversy surrounding the case of Tariq Ramadan has reached new heights, as the rape allegations against the Reformist scholar have been called into question following an investigation by the Parisian Criminal Brigade (BC). Revealing inconsistencies in his accusers’ stories, the investigation has further complicated the already-divisive legal case by casting into doubt the truth behind the allegations against Ramadan. Ramadan was arrested by French authorities in February of 2018 following a series of rape accusations against him by three separate women. He was released several months later in November after paying 300,000 euros ($340,000) in bail and surrendering his passport to French authorities. Though the charges against Ramadan still persist, the academic continues to deny the allegations against him, condemning the accusations as “campaign of lies launched by [his] adversaries.” Ramadan has also filed lawsuits against his accusers, alleging that their claims amount to slander and defamation. Meanwhile, as Ramadan’s trial remains ongoing, inconsistent testimonies on both sides continue to make the case extremely controversial, both in Europe and around the Muslim world. Born in Geneva, Switzerland on August 26, 1962 to an Egyptian Muslim family, Ramadan’s childhood did not lack exposure to Islam and Islamic theory.  The grandson of Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al Banna, Ramadan’s upbringing was influenced by the traditionalist views of Sunni Islam espoused by his family. After receiving a Ph.D. in Arabic and Islamic studies from the University of Geneva, Ramadan was appointed to a professorship at the University of Notre Dame in the United States in 2004 before his visa was rescinded by the administration of George W. Bush.  Under the guise of the “ideological exclusion provision” of the USA PATRIOT Act, Ramadan’s visa to work at Notre Dame was revoked, thus prompting the scholar to resign from his position. Following a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, the US government was ordered to reassess and issue a decision on Ramadan’s visa application within 90 days. However, the government ultimately denied the application, accusing Ramadan of “providing material support to a terrorist organization.” Ramadan was again accused of sympathizing with terrorist organizations in 2007, when he successfully applied for a professorship at the University of Leiden, leading Dutch academics and politicians to condemn the scholar as a “radical Islamist” and a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.” The Swiss national also taught as a guest professor of Identity and Citizenship at Erasmus University in Rotterdam until August of 2009, when he was removed from his position due to controversy around a program he hosted on Iran’s Press TV. In September of 2009, Ramadan began working at the University of Oxford as the chair of Contemporary Islamic Studies; however, he has since taken a leave of absence due to his ongoing trial. Throughout his controversial career, Ramadan has maintained a strong presence in the European Muslim intellectual community, though he maintains a number of controversial and reactionary views, primarily attributed to his self-proclaimed position as a “reformist.” However, the worst controversy surrounding Ramadan has been due to recent allegations of rape and sexual violence made against him by several women in France and Switzerland. In 2016, the former Salafist and feminist activist Henda Ayari published her autobiography J’ai choisi d’être libre (I Chose to be Free), in which she described an alleged incident of sexual assault years before; however, in the book she did not name a perpetrator. A year later, in October of 2017, Ayari revealed on Facebook that her alleged attacker was Tariq Ramadan. In response, Ramadan denied the accusations and threatened to pursue a lawsuit against Ayari. Days later, a disabled French woman — referred to as “Christelle” — claimed that Ramadan assaulted and raped her in a hotel room in 2009.  Not long after, four Swiss women accused Ramadan of molesting and sexually assaulting them when they were children, with one victim claiming that Ramadan made sexual advances on her when she was only 14 years old. Ramadan was eventually detained by French authorities in February of 2018 and was shortly after charged with two counts of rape.  A third rape accusation emerged in March of 2018, when a third woman claimed that Ramadan raped her on numerous occassions in France, Belgium, and the UK. Shortly after, a fourth allegation against Ramadan surfaced when an American accused Ramadan of assaulting her in Washington D.C. in August of 2013. Ramadan subsequently admitted to having a sexual relationship with the third woman after the woman presented investigators with a dress stained with Ramadan’s semen. However, Ramadan has insisted that the relationship was entirely consensual. Ramadan has also admitted to extramarital affairs with four additional women, including Ayari and “Christelle.” As with the previously mentioned case, Ramadan has claimed that all of these affairs were entirely consensual. Meanwhile, as investigators attempt to unravel the truth behind the numerous accusations, contradicting stories and lies from all parties have severely complicated matters and made it difficult to determine Ramadan’s guilt or innocence. Initially following the accusations against him, Ramadan maintained that he had never had any sexual contact with his accusers, but after text messages between him and his accusers came to light, Ramadan was forced to admit that he did indeed have a sexual relationship with the two women. “Yes, I happened to have had extramarital affairs,” Ramadan said. “I had ups and downs, times where I was totally consistent with my principles and others where I was more fragile.” Common to the accusations against Ramadan are claims that his behavior was exceedingly violent, a claim which has been corroborated by outside sources after allegations came to light. Shortly following the first allegation, Bernard Godard, an advisor to the French government on Islamic Affairs, admitted that he was aware of Ramadan’s “violent and aggressive” sexuality. “That he had many mistresses, that he consulted sites, that girls were brought to the hotel at the end of his lectures, that he invited them to undress, that some resisted and that he could become violent and aggressive, yes, but I have never heard of rapes, I am stunned,” he told French magazine L’Obs. Records of text messages between Ramadan and “Christelle” also reveal that the scholar apologized to the woman for his “violence.” Ramadan’s initial alibi that he was on a plane at the time when his second accuser claimed the incident took place was dismantled shortly after his arrest. Early on during Ramadan’s trial, the scholar’s lawyers produced an airline ticket which showed that Ramadan allegedly landed in the French city of Lyon at 6:35p.m., undermining “Christelle’s” claim that he had raped her “in the afternoon.” However, Yassine Djemal, a member of the Union of Young Muslims, which organized the conference that Ramadan was in Lyon to attend, claimed that Ramadan’s flight had landed much earlier. “Mr Ramadan was scheduled to arrive in Lyon on October 9, 2009 at 11:15am. A colleague and I picked him up at the airport at around 11:35,” Djemal told AFP. Djemal continued, telling investigators that he also drove Ramadan to the Hilton hotel, which is where “Christelle” reported that the incident took place. Meanwhile, the account of his first accuser, Henda Ayari, has also changed numerous times throughout the course of the investigation. After changing both the date and location of the incident months after initially coming forward, Ayari’s testimony has been heavily scrutinized by both French authorities and Ramadan’s supporters. Additionally, a few months after Ayari changed her account of the incident, photographs surfaced which revealed that she was attending her younger brother’s wedding on the date when the incident allegedly took place. More recently, an investigation by the Paris Criminal Brigade (BC) has cast further doubt on Ramadan’s accusers, with the BC’s conclusions claiming that the allegations are far from reliable. The BC has emphasized a series of implausibilities and lies in the testimonies of both accusers. The BC has also highlighted a series of messages which indicated that any sexual relations which did take place were likely consensual. In one message to Ramadan, Ayari is reported to have written: “You know that I Loved it … I hope you have kept a good memory of me like me from you, even if it was short.” As a result, the BC has argued that the consent expressed in the message undermines the rest of Ayari’s allegations. In addition to these messages, Ayari reportedly sent sexually explicit messages to Ramadan for months after the alleged incident took place. Furthermore, transcripts of wiretaps on Ayari have revealed a conversation in which the accuser reportedly said that if her cell phone was stolen by Ramadan supporters, it would be “extremely compromising for her and for the record.” In a similar fashion, messages from “Christelle” have also surfaced which call into question the truth behind her testimonies, with one SMS reading: “If I did not like I would have left.” Though the message was sent two months before the alleged incident took place, the BC has argued that the message seems to have been sent “after the fact,” and that, as a result, it weakens the reliability of the complainant’s accusation. In 2015, Ramadan reportedly paid 27,000 euros ($33,000) to a Moroccan-Belgian woman, Majda Bernoussi, in order to keep her silent about their alleged five-year affair, which the woman described as “destructive,” condemning Ramadan as a “manipulator.” “Tariq Ramadan is an extremely unhealthy predator and manipulator,” Bernoussi said, “In real life, he is a real barbarian, both intellectually and physically.” For Bernoussi, Ramadan is a “pervert man who uses religion to manipulate and abuse women,” arguing that, when he is not in front of a camera, the Reformist scholar is far from pious. “His ethics, his morals, his faith, he reserves them to the camera. Out of the public eye, he is just the opposite… He believes in nothing and even less in God. He talks about God only when it comes to manipulating us, apart from that, it’s never mentioned and he does exactly what he wants,” she said. Meanwhile, after numerous allegations and lies on both sides, the truth is still far from reach and French authorities are struggling to differentiate between fact and fiction in the case. Though Ramadan has now been released as the investigation continues, many have criticized the French government’s mistreatment of the case, especially in relation to Ramadan’s treatment while being held in prison. During Ramadan’s imprisonment, there was widespread outcry over his treatment in the French Fleury-Mérogis prison, where he had been held in solitary confinement for several months. Central to the controversy of his imprisonment was whether or not Ramadan had received adequate medical treatment while detained. Since 2006, Ramadan has suffered from multiple sclerosis, with Ramadan’s lawyer claiming that he had not received adequate medical treatment for his affliction during his time in prison. Ramadan’s sympathizers have also argued that his treatment has not been treated as he would have been were he not an Arab, Muslim scholar, claiming that he has suffered from discrimination due to his heritage and religion.

Rabat – Immediately, observers feared American retaliation and ultimately the beginning of yet another unfortunate and deadly cycle of Middle Eastern violence which would create so much havoc in an already unstable region.   Further conflict would disrupt oil routes, pushing prices up and causing chaos in the Gulf region, as well as possibly in Israel if proxies got involved in the fighting. While the Americans argued that the drone was shot down while in international airspace, the Russians contradicted Trump’s administration by saying the downed US drone was in Iranian airspace as did the Iranians. Nick Paton Walsh argues, in an analysis for CNN, that the incident shows a war with Iran is not going to be an easy task or a basic “cakewalk:” “While America’s military is by no means threatened in the long term by Iran, instances like the downing of the drone show that Tehran can sometimes have an outsized effect with narrowly-focused efforts, and is an adversary certainly capable of keeping its opponents off balance. The US would win any conventional conflict in the short term, but should be wary that Iranian ingenuity (or deviousness, if you’re in Washington) will stop any conflict from being a “cakewalk.” Once the dust cleared, it turns out that the military capabilities of Iran are quite formidable and that it has the strength and the might to take on the US, Israel and their Arab allies. In this regard, Farnaz Fassihi and David D. Kikpatrick pointed out that IRGC exulted in the downing of the American drone with a feast and a prayer: “Seated on the floor of a villa in northeast Tehran around a tablecloth spread with platters of saffron chicken and rice with barberries, about 30 officials of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and guests gathered Thursday night for a prayerful celebration. “A special blessing for the commander who ordered the attack on the American drone and for the fighters who carried it out,” a preacher declared, as recalled by one of the guests present, who said a raucous chorus of “amen” arose from the room. Their success earlier that day at shooting down an unmanned American Global Hawk surveillance drone (list price $131 million) surprised even some leaders of the Revolutionary Guards. They had wondered themselves whether they could hit an American target so high in the sky, according to the guest.” Mere minutes before the American retaliatory strike, Trump called off the military operation on the grounds that it was not proportionate because it was going to lead to the death of 150 people when the Americans lost only an unmanned aircraft. One wonders, however, if Trump is putting world peace first instead of America, or has he taken such a hard and painful decision, for his pride and ego, with of other unrevealed motives? ….On Monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in International Waters. We were cocked &amp; loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not…. ….proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting &amp; more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD! Trump’s tweets on the retaliatory strike An American war with Iran, supported by Israel and the Gulf States, would probably weaken this country but not destroy it. Iran would rely on its strategic depth and on the Revolutionary Guards to sustain the regime, and an injured Iran would be deadly for the region, in the long run. Consequently, Israel and the Gulf States would have to live in fear of retaliation. Besides, a weakened Iran would, at all costs, want to develop a nuclear capability to defend itself in an adverse environment and nobody would be able to stop it, worse, its drive would look quite legitimate. An all-out war of the US on Iran would ultimately mean an all-out war of proxies; allies of America in the region. Hezbollah and Hamas would strike, with might, the Jewish State, creating untold chaos across the country. The Houthis would target Saudi Arabia successfully with missiles and drones, and they have proved recently that they can achieve that with much success. The Shiites of Iraq would strike Bahrain and Kuwait, if need be, and the whole region would be in total upheaval, the tremors of probably having a worldwide effect. So far Iran has not resorted to using a network of terrorism but in the case of an American aggression, supported Israel and Gulf allies, it would instruct its own sleeping organizations, worldwide, to step into action and undertake terrorist actions against American, Gulf, and Israeli interests. Worse, ISIS and Al-Qaeda would join the fray and cause as much trouble as possible and the whole world would become a war zone,  not only the Mideast. An American war on Iran would further push the latter to align itself with Russia and China, as well as other eastern countries who are unhappy with Trump’s world policies. This potential coalition could, in the future, found a front to counter America’s arrogance and expansionism. Calculating Trump would not want to commit America to another global war in the Middle East, which he could only win with thousands of troops on the ground.  Deploying troops and suffering high casualties during an election year is synonymous of political suicide.  This possible war would be a gift on a silver platter to the Democrats in the presidential elections, and Trump is clever enough not to offer them this golden opportunity to oust him. Having said that, one can say that Trump is not a sensible world leader, but a calculating president who does not want to venture into the wild in spite of the pressure of hawkish Bolton and Pompeo. Trump will continue increasing diplomatic and financial pressure through ineffectual sanctions on Iran in the hope of bringing the officials to the negotiating table.  However, it is more likely that this approach will lead to failure, as it did with North Korea, and surely the Democrats will use this in the upcoming elections of 2020 which might be a probable cause of Trump’s failure in his reelection bid. Undoubtedly, Iran is the winner of the present face off and the psychological effect of this will embolden the country to move forward in acquiring nuclear weapons in the next few years and, in the face of this, Trump will come out as a mere paper tiger.

Rabat – China’s concerns over the world knowing more about the ongoing plight of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region have led Beijing to take security measures which include secretly spying on tourists’ phones while in Xinjiang, a joint investigation by the Guardian and partners has established. In an article published on July 2, the British newspaper explains in excruciating detail how Beijing is going about surveilling foreigners who enter its Xinjiang region to significantly curb the risk of having information about the harsh treatment of the region’s Muslims reach the outside world. “Chinese border police are secretly installing surveillance apps on the phones of visitors and downloading personal information as part of the government’s intensive scrutiny of the remote Xinjiang region,” the Guardian wrote. It added that only foreign travelers who “attempt to enter the region from neighboring Kyrgyzstan” have so far been the target of what looks like a chilling instance of “Big Brother is watching you.”  At the security checkpoints at the border, Chinese border guards reportedly request that travelers hand in their phones. They then secretly install “an app that extracts emails, texts, and contacts, as well as information about the handset itself.”  While tourists have acknowledged that travel agencies had warned them of the existence of such an extra-security operation, they complain that they did not know its purpose, nor did border guards tell them the reasons their cell phones being screened. Travelers are left in the dark during the entire process. According to the Guardian, however, in-depth analysis of the type of contents the app looks for has established that Beijing is singularly interested in anything that may be remotely linked with China’s widely reported mistreatment of its Muslim minority.  Once installed on a phone, the surveillance app searches for contents Beijing deems “problematic.” The Guardian details that the “problematic” list includes “a variety of terms associated with Islamist extremism, including Inspire, the English-language magazine produced by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, and various weapons operation manuals.” Of significance to Chinese authorities is information relating to “fasting during Ramadan.”  While the app is said to be uninstalled at the border at the end of the tourists’ stay in Xinjiang, some travelers have said that the app remained on their phones. This has raised eye-brows about whether the spying continues beyond some tourists’ stay in the controversy-soaked region. Edin Omanovic of Privacy International, an international campaign group advocating for the inviolability of individual’s privacy, said the findings of the joint investigations were “highly alarming.”  He said the danger of having the app installed on one’s cell phone was even more acute “in a country where downloading the wrong app or news article could land you in a detention camp.” Omanovic added, “This is yet another example of why the surveillance regime in Xinjiang is one of the most unlawful, pervasive and draconian in the world.” Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch China, echoed similar concerns. What the world already knew that Uighurs are constantly subject to China’s pervasive surveillance system, Wang explained, “What you have found goes beyond that.” One unnamed traveler, who reportedly went through a series of security checks at the border with Kyrgyzstan, fumed at the measure. “I don’t like it. If they were doing it in my home country I would be aghast, but when you are traveling to China you know it might be like this,” the traveler said. While Beijing has not yet responded to the allegations, it is highly likely that when they do, it will be to scoff at the findings.  Previously, China dismissed the worldwide outcry about Uighurs’ predicament, saying that it was necessary to keep them in “re-education camps” to make them more accommodating of Chinese and Marxist values.  China has also defended its use of the surveillance app in the Xinjiang, arguing that the app has “improved security” in the region. Meanwhile, far beyond its borders, Beijing has faced similar complaints of secretly installing surveillance devices to spy on both governments and individuals.  While the US and other Western countries have accused Beijing of hacking into their sensitive databases, the most incriminating report to date came from Africa, a continent where China has largely prevailed on the US as a trade and investment partner.  In January 2018, France’s Le Monde newspaper reported that China, which helped build the current African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, had installed listening devices in offices and hacking materials on computers to have unlimited access to African leaders’ private discussions and agreements on the most burning issues facing the continent.  Although the report has been dismissed by both Beijing and AU operatives, the episode sounded an alarm bell on China’s real motives in its increasing focus on Africa. In a trollishly-headlined article, “Beijing’s Big Brother Tech Needs African Faces,” Foreign Policy later reported how China has won the unadulterated esteem of African dictators.  In addition to heaping the continent’s dictators with “no strings attached” financial aid, Beijing has deployed its state-of-the surveillance technology to help its most reliable African partners have iron fists as strong as that of Xi Jinping, China’s undisputed “chairman.” “But China doesn’t just want to dominate these markets,” Foreign Policy wrote, in reference to Beijing’s financial assertiveness in African countries. “It wants to use developing countries as a laboratory to improve its own surveillance technologies.”

Rabat – The current draft form of Article 6 of Law 45-13 states that the role of opticians is to “deliver[…] to the public optical products that are designed to correct or protect sight,” and “adapt[…] and adjust[…] optical products.” The Moroccan National Syndicate of Opticians (SPNOM) has rejected the new law, stating in a press release that the new legal provision severely limits the work of opticians, removing “all of [the profession’s] attributes that are recognized on an international scale.” Until now, opticians in Morocco have performed vision tests, also called refraction tests, to test the eyesight of their clients before prescribing glasses. Under the new law, only ophthalmologists will be allowed to perform these types of tests.  This means client wishing to test their vision would first have to make an appointment with an ophthalmologist to obtain a referral for appropriate optical products. SPNOM stated that the new law would “open doors to organizations that want to monopolize the sector,” and described the proposal as “a plot against the purchasing power of Moroccan citizens.” Hundreds of opticians marched in the streets of Rabat yesterday, the fourth protest in three weeks. Ophthalmologists and opticians have been at war on the matter since February. Ophthalmologists claim opticians should not have the right to perform vision tests. Ophthalmologists argue that refraction is a medical procedure, which therefore falls in their field of expertise, in accordance with law 131-13 on medical practice. Opticians argue that they have been practicing refraction tests under a King’s decree from 1954, and have the appropriate training to do so. The current draft of the law will significantly impact on opticians’ businesses. Another strike and protest are scheduled for July 10.

Rabat – Dubai’s Princess Haya has left her husband and traveled to Europe seeking asylum. Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, sister to the King of Jordan, is one of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s six wives. The Sheikh is the ruler of Dubai and one of the richest men in the world. While initial reports from UAE legal advisory firm Detained in Dubai stated that the princess fled Dubai in order to claim political asylum in Germany, the BBC reported on Wednesday, July 3, that Princess Haya has been spotted in London. She is said to be currently in hiding in £85 million residence in Kensington.  ”The reason for anyone who applies for political asylum, it’s usually because their lives are in danger, and they have suffered severe abuses and violations of their human rights,” Detained in Dubai CEO Radha Stirling told the Daily Beast. “We have received multiple reports regarding the story of Princess Haya from sources close to the governments in Jordan and the UAE, all of which indicate that she has sought political asylum in Germany,” Stirling added.  She explained that the reports have not yet been confirmed: “We cannot comment on the veracity of these reports, but such an event would clearly represent a powerful indictment against the UAE and against Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid personally, as well as have potentially dramatic repercussions on the relationships between the countries involved.” However, reports are now circulating that the Princess, who was educated in the UK at Badminton School for Girls and the University of Oxford, is, in fact, seeking asylum in the more familiar ground of London. UK media outlets report that the princess left Dubai with her two children, Sheikh Zayed, 7, and Sheikha Al Jalila, 11. Princess Haya’s flight comes after her step-daughter Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum attempted to escape Dubai in February 2018.  The Sheikh’s daughter managed to get as far as the Indian Ocean before she was apprehended by UAE authorities. She is now back in Dubai, according to statements from the royal family in December 2018. Princess Latifa explained the reasons behind her getaway in a YouTube video. In the video she accuses her family of detaining, restricting, and tormenting her.  Princess Latifa explained her fear for what was next and the outcome if she stayed in Dubai. She is the Sheikh’s second daughter to attempt fleeing Dubai. Sheikh Mohamed is the Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates. As a leader who regularly pens poems to celebrate significant events, he responded to his wife’s escape with an angry poem which he posted on his Instagram account.  The poem, entitled “You Lived and You Died,” accuses an unnamed subject..“You betrayer, you betrayed the most precious trust, and your game has been revealed. “Your days of lying are over and it doesn’t matter what we were and what you are.” “You no longer have any place with me/ Go to who you have been busy with!/ And let this be good for you; I don’t care if you live or you die.”

Rabat – An increase in occupational heat stress due to climate change is expected to have a significant impact on global productivity and economic losses, particularly in agriculture and construction, according to a study from the International Labor Organization (ILO). The study, entitled “Working on a Warmer Planet” examined the effect a global temperature rise of only 1.5 degrees Celsius will have on the world’s workforce. The ILO study warns the change will result in a loss of production that amounts to 80 million full-time jobs – or 2.2% of total working hours worldwide by 2030. ILO also estimated that it will cause a total loss of up to $2.4 trillion per year. “The impact of heat stress on labor productivity is a serious consequence of climate change,” said Catherine Saget, head of the research department at the ILO. “We can expect to see more inequalities between low and high-income countries, in addition to a deterioration in the working conditions of the most vulnerable,” warns the report. The study found that West Africa and South-East Asia will be hit hardest by the change. As for Morocco, the ILO says the lost working hours due to heat stress will amount to 0.39% in agriculture, 0.14% in industry, 0.39% in construction and 0.02% in the services sector. Overall, the report estimates that the percentage of lost working hours due to heat stress in the Moroccan economy will total 0.16%. The loss equals 19,000 full-time jobs in the entire Moroccan economy by 2030. Regarding North Africa as a whole, Morocco will be less affected than most of its counterparts, with Sudan losing 5.91% of lost work hours and 852 000 jobs, Egypt losing 0.42% and 134 000 jobs, and Algeria with a loss of 0.19% of working hours and 24,000 jobs.

Rabat – French club Olympique de Marseille has announced that it has begun disciplinary proceedings against French-Moroccan player Adil Rami, following a no show on Monday, July 1 for the first training session after the summer break. In a statement to Associated Press, the French club explained that “Rami, a member of the France squad that won the World Cup last year, will meet with club officials to discuss the matter.” The disciplinary proceedings come just as Rami is embroiled in a battle of words with his ex-girlfriend Pamela Anderson, who he began dating in 2017. The couple reportedly split in September 2018 before getting back together in March of this year and splitting up again recently. The American actress, known for her starring role in the 90s show Baywatch, publically accused Rami of abuse and infidelity on her Instagram page and official website. “The last 2 years of my life have been a big lie. I was scammed, led to believe we were in big love. I’m devastated to find out in the last few days that he was living a double life,” her Instagram post read. “He used to joke about other players who had girlfriends down the street in apartments close to their wives. He called those men monsters, but this is worse. He lied to all. How is it possible to control 2 women’s hearts and minds like this – and I’m sure there were others. He is a monster,” Anderson claimed. Rami, in turn, responded to deny the claims. In a lengthy message on his own Instagram account, the football player responded to the allegations. “I wish to tell you that these accusations of violence are completely false and I can’t let them run,” he wrote. According to Rami, the only reason he “kept silent” until now is that he “was shocked” by the allegations and worried he wouldn’t be able to “speak without every word being interpreted.’” “It’s one thing to lie to keep a good relationship with her ex and her children but lying about violence in order to hurt me that’s going too far and it’s unjust,” he claimed. He concluded by denying Anderson’s claims of violence. “Once again, I won’t allow these false accusations on me and my family to remain unanswered. All of this is too bad.” For their part, Olympique de Marseille insists the disciplinary actions have nothing to with the player’s “private problems.”

Rabat – The Morocco-Spain Economic Forum was held on Tuesday, July 2, 2019, in Casablanca. The forum was aimed at further strengthening investment relations between Morocco and Spain as well as encouraging partnership projects. “Morocco enjoys an extraordinary geo-strategic position thanks to its Mediterranean Atlantic coastline and its proximity to the European continent,” said Maria Reyes Maroto, the Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade, and Tourism, noting that Morocco has reinforced its infrastructure allowing the flow of investment and trade between the two continents.  The two-day event, bringing together 300 public administration representatives from both countries, intended to facilitate contacts between Moroccan and Spanish companies and to discuss joint investment opportunities in the automobile industry, renewable energy, agriculture, education, and tourism sectors. Spain has been Morocco’s leading trading partner since 2012, while it is the North African country’s third-largest investor, behind France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  The latest data released by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, indicates that Spain has maintained its position as Morocco’s first trading partner in the first quarter of 2019, both in terms of exports and imports. Spanish exports to Morocco exceeded €2 billion at the end of March 2019, a decrease of 1.28% compared to last year’s statistics. Spanish imports of Moroccan products rose to €1.8 billion in 2019, marking a 7.95% increase over one year. During the same period, Spain was also Morocco’s first customer, accounting for 41.1% of the country’s total EU imports, ahead of France (29.3 %), Italy (6.1%), Germany (6.1%) and the UK (4.7%). The Iberian neighbor is already the third largest foreign investor in Morocco, with a stock of FDI of nearly MAD 50 billion as of 2017, which is translated to more than 600 Spanish companies installed and more than 20,000 job positions created. “All this shows the commitment of Spanish companies and their desire to build a shared future with Morocco,” said the economic and commercial office of Spain. The Moroccan Minister of Tourism, Air Transport, Crafts and Social Economy, Mohamed Sajid, noted that Spain makes several investments abroad, constantly motivating Spanish economic actors to invest more in Morocco given the countries’ geographical proximity. Several Spanish companies operating in Morocco significantly contribute to the country’s economic development, with an investment figure reaching up to MAD 2.5 billion annually. In the automotive sector, Spain is present in all segments of the value chain, from the coating of vehicle interiors to the design of safety systems. 90% of the buses that circulate in Morocco are manufactured locally by Spanish companies. In the tourism field, Barcelo and Melia, two major Spanish hotel companies, opened several hotels in Morocco over the years and ran tourist resorts. In terms of renewable energy, Spain has invested in a wind turbine blade plant in Tangier and has contributed to the construction of Noor solar stations. According to Spanish Minister Maroto, the expansion of trade and infrastructure development in Morocco allowed the country to remarkably render itself a platform for continental companies, a gateway to Africa for Europe and a hub for air connections and freight flows. “It is a relationship based on complementarity between our two economies through two-way trade flows and high value-added sectors,” Maroto said, stressing that strengthening Morocco-Spain relations is not considered a one-way project. Morocco is also planning to strengthen its presence in the Spanish economy as an investor. The stock of Moroccan foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in this country totaled barely MAD  52 at the end of 2017. Given that Morocco is only the ninth supplier of Spain and has a trade balance deficit of nearly MAD 15 billion, it must boost its exports to Spain in the near future. According to the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) projections, trade flows between the two countries are expected to double to MAD 264 billion by 2025.

Rabat – In the midst of the recent growth in the airline industry, RAM has evolved to become known as a company which innovates in order to remain competitive in a highly challenging and high-risk market. RAM is, since 10 years ago, better governed than it was before. Its Board of Directors meets on a regular basis to make strategic decisions. In the airline industry, you need to be reactive and be able to make decisions, both tactical and strategic, intelligently fast. RAM is strongly present in West Africa and historically very active in Western Europe. The savvy mix between night flights in Africa and day flights in Europe, all around the hub of Casablanca, a model ushered in two decades ago and harnessed over time, gives the Moroccan national airline company significant competitiveness. In Africa, RAM is also a socially responsible corporate firm that helps with public and private local efforts to promote cultural and economic activities. The company’s decision not to cancel flights to destinations affected by the Ebola virus in August 2014 was highly appreciated in West Africa and all the over the Continent. The diversification of markets has seen a significant leap forward with the arrival of the Dreamliner (ordered 6 years ago), and flights to Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, Washington, Miami and Boston. Doha and South Asia are code-shared with Qatari Airlines, and China remains high on the agenda of long trans-continental flights. The Nairobi flight was carried out using a Boeing 737 that often makes stopovers in N’djamena but was canceled because the conditions were not too favorable. Nonetheless, East Africa remains an interesting market despite the dominance of Ethiopian Airlines, Kenya Airways, and Emirates. Registration and onboard services are increasingly improving, but much remains to be done in terms of communication, staff performance and customer satisfaction. The flights have recently known fewer delays than in the past but the company remains handicapped by the lack of planes available for use as replacements in case of technical problems. The company’s performance during the Hajj (pilgrimage) remains a non-profitable operation as the rate of occupancy never exceeds 50% (the planes return from Saudi Arabia empty at the beginning of the pilgrimage and leave Morocco empty to bring back the pilgrims at the end). However, RAM operates these flights out of concern for the spiritual well-being of its Moroccan customers. The latest report of the Moroccan Court of Auditors has noted the risks the Moroccan national airline company faces- namely the volatility of the tourism sector (exacerbated by the turbulent global security and geostrategic situation), and the accumulation of VAT refund arrears (of which MAD 1.5 billion was not paid back to the Company until 2018). The latter risk could have a negative impact on the financial health of RAM. RAM must and should keep its autonomy of action but it remains a public company that serves the interests of the Moroccan State and the Moroccan economy. It is, therefore, up to the government to set up the strategic guidelines with regard to diplomacy, the development of tourism and the best way to reach and serve remote and isolated areas. The 2010-2016 contract plan with the Government of Morocco included decisions that reduced the diversity of RAM resources (by encouraging it to sell its hotels) and curtailed its ability to train aircrew and other airline industry staff. The principle of cancellation of non-profitable flights should not have been applied to tourist destinations such as Poland (an emergent market with significant hospitality industry potential). The future strategy of RAM must take into consideration the threats and opportunities that exist in a context of fierce competition. The competitive advantage it has in West Africa is challenged by companies with significant resources such as Turkish Airlines, Air France, or Emirates, or by companies that display a staggering growth ambition like Air Algérie (willing to invest $ 25 billion to increase its aircraft fleet and its presence in Africa in particular.) The strategy of the Casablanca hub will see its limits when growth in West Africa reaches its apex. Meanwhile, a more dynamic model would be appropriate, focusing on tourist destinations such as Marrakech and Agadir, emerging destinations (such as Fez, Rabat, Tangiers, Nador / Oujda), in addition to the Casablanca hub (whose third terminal is expected to be built within a few years). Tourist destinations such as Marrakech and Agadir are served by low-cost carriers with lean management models based on an aggressive yield management method. The bases set up by RAM for tourist destinations (in Marrakech and Agadir in particular) remain less competitive especially when it comes to pricing. The RAM pricing policy must change using tax incentives that can be granted by the Government to allow the national company to have the same benefits as competing companies. Aggressive yield management methods should be adopted to fill up flights and promote emergent destinations. Consequently, RAM must have a significant improvement of quality in the future if it wishes to have the striking force to confidently enter the global market. Sixty or even a hundred planes are not sufficient for RAM to be able to take advantage of the One World network it is gearing up to join in 2020. A change of vision and business model is needed. RAM must have 300 planes by 2035 if it intends to have enough force to go and seek value wherever it exists all over the World. The leading airline markets are the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, and China. These markets are almost completely integrated but growth niches are possible for RAM, especially in destinations such as Chicago, Atlanta, and Houston in the USA in addition to Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong in China. However, the markets with high growth potential are in Latin America (Buenos Aires, Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Mexico City, Bogota, Lima, and Caracas) and Asia Pacific (Jakarta, Manila, Tokyo, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore). To reach these markets, RAM must significantly increase its fleet and acquire scores of long courier planes such as Boeing 777 and 787 or Airbus 380. Intelligent connections between these markets/destinations and the Maghreb, West Africa, the Middle East, Western Europe and even the East Coast of the USA are to be built through aggressive marketing strategies and proactive yield management tools. Destinations with average growth potential such as East Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East can be served by medium-haul aircraft from the same markets. Southern Africa, Central Asia, as well as Pakistan and India all require long-haul planes. The first destination can be supplied with passengers from Europe, North Africa, and America, while Central Asia, Pakistan and India could be served from Latin American, West Africa and the Maghreb. In the meantime, it is necessary to create four low-costs that will act as satellite companies equipped with ATRs, Embraers, and Boeing 737 planes to complement RAM on a local and regional levels and act as niche passenger feeders to its hubs. The first will ensure internal flights in partnership with the regions. The second low cost will fly to and from western Algeria, southern Spain, Corsica, Portugal and the Canary Islands. The third, which would be solely touristic, will target small and medium-sized markets such as Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Balkans, Romania, Bulgaria and hard-to-reach cities in Sardinia, Sicily, Cyprus, Eastern France, Galicia and the Basque Country, East Germany, Wales, Iceland, etc. The fourth type will be specialized in Hajj and Umrah operations. A large airline needs several low-cost companies to operate difficult flights and to serve isolated regions and destinations at prices that are suitable for passengers coming from these markets. To accommodate and route the 70 to 90 million passengers that this fleet will reach, Casablanca Airport must be equipped with a fourth giant terminal. Benslimane Airport needs to be expanded and upgraded as well to be able to harbor low cost, domestic flights, ATR, and Embraer planes. The Mohammed V Airport will be used to serve national airlines, regular flights, and large aircraft. A fast train and an expressway will connect the two airports. Obviously, the cost will determine the strength of the future RAM fleet, but a variety of mechanisms must be used to finance this strategic operation over a period of 15 years. The Government must buy the aircrafts and set up a state agency that will make them available for RAM at competitive prices. Leasing is also an option for part of the fleet. The bond market in addition to government-guaranteed debt are also options to consider in order to have a complete package of financial resources at the service of RAM to get equipped with the right aircraft necessary for its leap onto the global stage. Daring to dream for the future is imperative. Profitability is not limited to balance sheets and financial reports; on the contrary, the benefits are economic, diplomatic, political, and cultural. Overall profitability is the strategic objective; only then could RAM live up to its slogan of being the “wings” of Morocco in a world of change and unrest. With will, faith, and a clear vision, RAM can reach a world-class level. However, we have to start here and now; 2035 is tomorrow; we cannot afford to wait anymore. By Dr. Lahcen Haddad, former Minister of Tourism, current Member of Moroccan House of Representatives, and Member of the Moroccan Parliament Finance Committee.

Rabat – A statement from Morocco’s Directorate General of National Security (DGSN) has revealed that a shocking 13 people died in traffic accidents from June 24 to 30, with another 1,375 being injured. The DGSN said the accidents are mostly due to the inadvertence of drivers, the non-respect of priority, the inadvertence of the pedestrians, speeding, failure to respect the safety distance, change of direction without signal use. DGSN also listed the failure to comply with stops, unauthorized change of direction, drunk driving, traffic in the left lane, non-observance of traffic lights, defective overtaking and traffic in forbidden directions as reasons for the number of accidents. As well as traffic accidents, the DGSN also shed light on the number of infractions and fines given. Security services reportedly registered 46,250 infractions and submitted 12,124 to the Prosecutor General’s Office. A total of 34,126 fines were recovered, coming to a total of MAD 6,572,150. Additionally, 4,791 vehicles were impounded, and 157 vehicles were withdrawn from circulation.

Rabat – The prosecutor’s office in Marrakech has charged a snake charmer from Jemaa El Fna Square for fraud and breach and trust. The charge comes from the unnamed snake charmer attempting to charge a tourist €40 (MAD 450) for one photo with a snake around his neck. Feeling pressured to pay the fee, the tourist gave in before lodging a complaint with Marrakech’s tourist police. Police officers then immediately headed to the scene to arrest the alleged fraudster. Upon searching the snake charmer, they found the €40 taken from the tourist and then referred him to the prosecutor’s office. Tourists visiting Marrakech’s ancient Jemaa El Fna Square often complain of pushy snake charmers, who try to charge those who don’t know better exorbitant fees for photos. “Please beware of the snake charmers, we got sucked in and after 6 or 7 photos received a demand for MAD 300. I let my guard down this once and learned my lesson!” One travel forum user said. “Do not make eye contact with any performers in the square! They are mental!” Another comment read. “During our first hour in Marrakech, my husband stopped to look at the snakes, one ended up around my neck. Then they hassled us for a tip, even though they forced the snake around my neck.” “We had no dirhams on us as we only just arrived. They insisted we had to tip them for good luck, and wouldn’t leave us alone. I gave them £1 and still, he was not satisfied said he wanted paper English money,” the traveler complained. “I am not impressed with the tipping/begging culture going on. We are not made of money just because we are from the UK.” As well as discouraging tourists, the practice is also cruel to snakes. The snakes often have their fangs removed to prevent their natural instinct to bite, or even worse, sewn shut, according to animal rights group PETA. While the snake charming might seem magical, the “dance” these snakes perform is actually a reactive sway out of fear for the snake charmer’s movements—as a means of self-defense from “attack” from the pipe. Some countries, such as India, have taken action to ban the practice completely.

Rabat – Morocco’s Atlas Lions, sometimes lacking the style that has made them a revered opponent in African football, struggled to top their group. This has involved scoring two unlikely last-minute goals to trump a failure to exploit the cracks of the opposition in a more timely manner. So things have so far gone Morocco’s way in the ongoing Africa Cup of Nationals (CAN) tournament. The Atlas Lions topped their group, perhaps the tournament’s toughest, and conceded no goals in the process. But for all the perfect statistics and the morale-boosting presence in many aspects of their game, the Moroccan Lions have rarely been at their most engaging. And, as the competition reaches the knockout stage and intensity mounts, decent will no longer be enough. Or, to put in the ruthlessly blunt style of Herve Renard, the Moroccan coach, Morocco has shone but failed to do so with the touch of style and brilliance that has come to be expected of this world-class player-packed squad. On July 1, as Morocco emerged from a recital of ruthless efficacy against Ivory Coast, an opponent the Moroccan Lions overwhelmed and suffocated, expectations had been that South Africa would face a similar fate. That day, however, Morocco played as they did against Namibia in their first outing in this CAN–dominant and defensively mature, but largely clueless and inefficient in attacking. Renard, who had said before the South Africa game that the goal was to focus on topping their group, presumably to expect a more playable adversary for the next stage, may have been satisfied with the result. But the Frenchman was not happy. Renard felt, as he assessed his team’s performance after the game, that they had been wasteful and unthreatening in key moments, misfiring and unwisely using the attacking arsenal at their disposal. Or, was it that South Africa was actually a far more serious opponent than expected? That the Bafana Bafana’s sense of organization, especially their stifling presence in midfield, caught Moroccans utterly unguarded? The answer, as is often the case with a game where every match comes with its own realities, calls for perspective, nuance. But Renard, as he tentatively gauged what has been missing in the performance of a side carrying a burdensome task of making it work where generations have failed in over three decades, said that Morocco could have done–and must do–better with the kind of players the team boasts. “To be honest, I think we went home at half time. That is, we only played 45 minutes,” Renard commented on the match. Renard went on to say that the team must remain vigilant and focused in their upcoming matches. He noted that the best teams in Africa are playing in this competition, and Morocco needs to be at its best to win. Downplaying his team’s strengths is not unlike Renard. For all his unparalleled success at the CAN competition, the Frenchman is famous for thriving when his team is not taken seriously. He has generally seemed to delight in being an underdog that upsets, alter the order of things. But Morocco is not an underdog at this year’s CAN, which is perhaps why Renard seems to be intent on aligning results and appeal. This change in Renard’s typical attitude to games was most visible in his comments on what he said was a commanding display from the South Africans. Renard said, “Sometimes football just comes down to results, and I don’t think this team deserves only 3 points in the group stage.” He added, speaking of his lads, “The team did not play a great match against South Africa, but they realized the most important thing: the win.” Perhaps Renard’s caution will be more resonant now that the Moroccan players know who their opponents will be for the next stage. At 5 p.m (Moroccan time) on Friday, July 5, the Atlas Lions will confront Benin’s Squirrels. As with the game against South Africa, Morocco goes into that encounter as the overwhelming favorites. A slightly discomfiting consideration, however, is that Benin will most probably play against Morocco with the advantage of being an unruly, stubborn underdog. The Beninese Squirrels claimed 3 points in 3 games. While Benin obviously lacks everything that has made the name of Renard’s Morocco–creativity, pace, attacking bravura, and technical prowess–their three games, all of which they drew, suggest this is a squad that plays with an acute sense of what its strengths and weaknesses are. The 2-2 and 0-0 draws against, respectively, Ghana and Cameroon are particularly telling. Against two big names of African football, Benin put on the kind of display with which many underdogs have gotten the best of revered opposition. With a kind of Jose Mourinho-esque insistence on “simple football,” Benin has played an unadorned type of football: Defend in blocks and attack when you can or, as against Ghana, when necessary. Morocco, to repeat what has become Renard’s mantra, will have to be at its best to unlock an intransigeant and strong-willed Beninese side. More to the point: As far as Benin is concerned, the game against Morocco rings with the echo of “they have more to lose than us” mentality that has elicited the unlikeliest results from “playable” games. Morocco has history on its side, having spanked Benin 6-1 in a friendly and 4-0 in their latest CAN confrontation in 2004. When it comes to football, however, the past is almost never something to bank on. And so, as Benin hopes to upset the traditional order of things, Renard’s call carries singular resonance: The Atlas Lions will have “to deploy their very best” and breath more life into their rhythm in order to prolong their stay in Egypt.

Rabat – Following a pursuit on the evening of Tuesday, July 2, special forces surrounded the man they believe was responsible for a series of bombings in Tunisia’s capital city.  When police opened fire, the suspect, Aymen Smiri, detonated an explosive device on his belt, killing himself instantly.  The incident was the third attack in the capital city of Tunis in less than a week. “The terrorist Aymen Smiri was implicated in the twin suicide bombings on Thursday, and investigations proved that he was the mastermind of the operation,” Interior Ministry spokesman Sofiene Zaag told AFP. Witnesses said Smiri, reportedly in his early 20s, was wearing women’s clothing at the time of the attack.  Residents in the Intilaka area of Tunis reported hearing a large blast when Smiri detonated the device on his belt. Zaag described Smiri as “very active and very dangerous leader.” Last week, ISIS claimed responsibility for two separate suicide bombings in the capital on Thursday, June 27. One police officer was killed in the attacks and several civilians injured. Authorities said the bombers targeted police and security forces in both incidents. In 2015, Tunisia declared a long-running state of emergency after a series of deadly attacks that culminated in a mass shooting at a resort that killed 38 people. Since then, violent incidents in Tunisia’s capital have been rare. The years of calm were shattered in October of 2018 when a female suicide bomber blew herself up in the center of Tunis. Over a dozen people were injured in the explosion, including 10 police officers. Security forces remain on high alert following recent attacks, and as the country begins to gear up for national elections in October.

Rabat – At least 50 people are dead and 101 have been injured after an oil tank explosion in central Nigeria on Monday afternoon. The tank overturned when it swerved to avoid a pothole along the road in Ahumbe village in Benue State. Bystanders rushed to scoop up oil from the tank when it exploded, reports say.  The explosion was reportedly caused by an exhaust pipe from a passing bus scraping on the ground, causing sparks to fly. The incident occurred next to a number of shops, and at least one of them was completely gutted by the blaze. The death toll may continue to rise as many of those in hospital are in critical states, according to Nigerian officials. “From the look of things and considering their condition, many of them might not survive,” Aliyu Baba, the federal road safety commission sector commander for Benue state, told the AFP news agency. Petrol tanker and pipeline blasts are common in Nigeria, where despite the country’s multi-billion-dollar oil and gas industry, most people live in poverty.  As a result, fires and explosions often occur as people try to siphon fuel from pipelines.  Accidents involving fuel tankers on poorly-maintained roads, such as this one, are also common. In January, at least eight people were killed in Odukpani, in the southeastern state of Cross River when a similar incident occurred and people rushed to scoop up oil from an overturned tanker. The incident follows the death of 60 people last October due to a spill at an oil pipeline in the country’s southeast catching fire.

Rabat – On July 2, RAM Handling (national airline Royal Air Maroc’s Baggage handling subsidiary), the Moroccan Workers Union (UMT), RAM Syndicate, and the Syndicate for Ground Operating Staff signed an agreement to increase salaries by 15%. RAM also agreed to pay a range of work benefits and to ensure a general improvement of working conditions at the airport. The agreement, signed yesterday afternoon, will benefit 800 Baggage handlers and 324 other employees at Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport. Royal Air Maroc and its Baggage handling subcontractor, General Private Interim (GPI), have been butting heads since mid-April over contract terms, each accusing the other of not respecting its obligations. GPI accuses the airline of imposing additional work on Baggage handlers without fair remuneration. Baggage handlers went on strike multiple times demanding a pay rise to reflect what they felt was an increased workload. RAM accuses GPI of breaching its contract by intentionally slowing down its baggage handling services. This caused flight and baggage handling delays, most recently on June 21. Earlier in June, angry passengers bound for the US were left without their baggage for days. Angry at how RAM handled the lost baggage claims, passengers turned to Twitter to express their frustration, creating a live-stream of complaints about the airline’s service. RAM denied all responsibility for the delays, shifting blame onto GPI. But client-facing RAM’s reputation was at stake. GPI was not a signatory to yesterday’s agreement. GPI’s baggage handling contract with RAM Handling comes to an end in September, at which time RAM will make a new call for offers for the contract.

Rabat – A group of Moroccan inventors who study at the Moroccan School of Engineering (EMSI) participated in the Silicon Valley International Invention Exhibition on Sunday, June 30.  The International Federation of Inventors Association (FIAI) organized the exhibition at the Santa Clara Convention Center. The convention showcased 400 exhibitors from 25 countries  who presented nearly 600 inventions.  The Moroccan inventors won three silver medals and six awards for their three inventions, “SmarTraffic,” “Multiview-Screen,” and “Smarty Factory 4.0.” The first invention, “SmarTraffic,” is a decentralized radio signal and imaging system that can intelligently manage traffic in urban areas as well as identify and dynamically regulate traffic signs in the event of an accident. “Smarty Factory 4.0” is a multi-protocol, multi-interface communications device that enables data acquisition in the form of transducer frames with analog/digital inputs/outputs. The group’s third invention,“Multiview Screen,” is a multi-screen display that enables viewers to watch multiple programs on the same TV without using unique lenses or other equipment. It also allows multiple images to be viewed simultaneously from different angles.

Rabat – This year’s edition of Arab Next Top Model, an international competition with 53 contestants held in Beirut, saw Moroccan model Sofia Saidi take home the “Miss Arab” crown on the night of Saturday, June 29.  The young model, who was born in Rabat, began modeling three years ago in Casablanca and has since taken her career to an international level – from Beirut to Paris, where she is now based. Although she works hard on her modeling career, Saidi told Morocco World News that it is important to be well-rounded, so her education and career will always come first.  “For me having a good academic background is a must. We are in an ever-changing world, today everything is going so fast, so for me, modeling is a passion but I know for sure that I will not do this all my life. So I wanted to succeed in my academic career in conjunction with modeling,” she said. And succeed she has. After gaining a bachelor degree in international management, Saidi went on to obtain two master degrees from the Panthéon-Assas University Paris II, one in strategic organizational and technological evolutionism where she was the valedictorian, and the second in strategic management and entrepreneurship. “I was working as a project chief manager at PSA group in Paris when I was contacted by World Next Top Model to represent my beautiful country, Morocco,” she explained. “I jumped at the opportunity to represent Arabic beauty and to show the world that you can care about your appearance and beauty, as well as building a good academic background.” Although, Saidi admitted the balance is not always simple. “It wasn’t easy to prepare for the competition and juggle my studies, especially at the beginning. When I finished class and all my comrades were going home, and I had to go to photo shoots,” she said. “I was tired but when you are driven by a passion, it doesn’t matter. It’s like when you go to the gym after a difficult session, even though it’s hard you will never regret it.” And the hard work clearly paid off, with Saidi taking home the crown last night.  “This title means a lot to me. I’ve been for the competition for about a year. I started to go seriously to the gym to be in the best shape possible, as well as working on my speech to the Lebanese press.” “I also worked a lot to enhance my beauty in a natural way, and I had to practice my runway walk a lot. The competition wasn’t easy, but I made it now I can say I am Miss Arab World Next Top Model 2019.” The win will surely be a boost to her growing modeling career, which will continue to take her around the world. However, no matter how much she travels, she told MWN that Morocco will always remain close to her heart. “Morocco will always be a part of me, it will always be my country and the place I feel most relaxed.” “For me, Moroccan culture is above all about sharing an environment that is both oriental and western. This mix is ​​the wealth of this beautiful country,” she said when asked what being Moroccan means to her. “I’m lucky to be Moroccan because this nationality is one of the few that adapts to different environments and backgrounds easily, both linguistically and socially,” she continued. She also wanted to give a message to young Moroccan girls who dream big like her. “Pursue your dreams and to never listen to anyone who discourages you, because if you want something you can get if you work hard enough. “It won’t be easy. It wasn’t easy for me, and I had to struggle a lot to attain everything I wanted, and of course there will always be people who will tell you it is impossible and who will try to drag you down, but the best strategy is to ignore them and to live your life at its fullest.” “I used to live the life other people expected of me and until I realized I was unhappy, now I am doing what I really want, and I encourage other young girls to do the same,” she said. “Although it’s hard, my education and my background helped me a lot with dealing with the problems I encounter in the modeling industry, as well as in my everyday life, so it’s all worth it.“

Moroccan Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani arrived in Panama on Sunday, June 30, 2019, to attend the inauguration of the country’s newly elected President, Laurentino Cortizo. At Tocumen International Airport, located in Panama City, El Othmani was greeted by Panama’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luis Miguel Hincapié.  El Othmani used his official Twitter account to announce the purpose of his trip to the Central American country.  Posting a picture of him alongside the Panamanian official, the Moroccan PM put his visit in the context of Morocco’s efforts to win international support for its “major causes,” a reference to Morocco’s pro-active diplomacy on the Western Sahara question. “This participation reflects Morocco’s wish to deepen ties with Panama, to revive bilateral relations (…) and launch a formal political dialogue while ensuring that a strategic partnership is established in the service of both countries and their major causes,” El Othmani wrote on Twitter the day of his arrival.  El Othmani told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) on Monday that the Moroccan government will work on strengthening “ties with Panama,” as the country plays a substantial role in Central America’s affairs. On Saturday, June 29, 2019, the Polisario’s leader Brahim Ghali flew to Panama City. Upon his arrival, Ghali was received by representatives from the Panamanian National Authorities, according to reports by the Polisario Front’s news agency. While in Panama City, the leader of the separatist movement, who claims to be the sole representative of the Saharawis aimed at consolidating ties with the Central American country.  Ghali planned to hold meetings with multiple Panamanian officials and heads of state and government.  The tension between the Polisario Front and Morocco has been ongoing for four decades.  Although military confrontation has been largely contained, courtesy of a UN-brokered ceasefire agreement between the two sides, divergences have remained, and sometimes deepened, as to the future of the disputed territories.  While Rabat’s Autonomy Plan for the region to become an autonomous region of Morocco is widely accepted as the only practical solution, Polisario continues to insist on the holding of a referendum of self-determination with the option of independence being among the potential outcomes.  Panama was the first Latin American country to recognize self-styled Saharawis Arab Democratic Republic in 1978. It was also the first to host a Polisario Embassy in 1980. In 2013, the Panamanian government released a statement announcing the suspension of its recognition of the so-called SADR.   Two years later, the Central American country reinstated its recognition of the self-proclaimed SADR  and revived its relations with the Polisario Front. Meanwhile, Panama strove to strengthen its tie with Morocco. In the old, sometimes exceedingly defensive Moroccan Western Sahara diplomacy, Panama’s stance on the conflict would most certainly be considered a reason for not having normal diplomatic links with the Latin American country.  Rabat used to resort to the “empty chair policy” with diehard supporters of the separatist front. For the past five years, however, Morocco’s proactive approach to diplomacy has come with a special emphasis on advancing the Moroccan perspective in countries that have typically been more prone to support the Polisario’s “Sahrawi cause.”  Morocco’s return to the AU, which still recognizes SADR, as well as King Mohammed VI’s recent call for “frank dialogue” and diplomatic normalization with Algeria and South Africa, have been largely interpreted as ultimate signs of Morocco increasingly privileging diplomatic effectiveness and feasibility over sustaining ideological divergences. In 2015, Panama opened an embassy in Rabat, while one year later the Panamanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation chaired the opening ceremony of Morocco’s embassy in Panama City. Although Panama maintained relations with the Polisario throughout the years, it simultaneously managed to sustain a friendly attitude towards Morocco which continues up until today. Most importantly, perhaps, news of Morocco and Polisario attending the same event in Panama comes on the heel of epoch-making diplomatic overtures in Morocco’s increasingly robust diplomatic ties with a horde of Latin American countries.  In Moroccan diplomatic circles, Rabat’s perceived resolution to advance its narrative with traditionally pro-Polisario interlocutors means that the North African country now understands the value of engaging in previously uncharted territories.  As opposed to emptying the chair as that comforts each side in its position, Moroccan experts have argued, Morocco is taking its narrative to normally pro-SADR countries in the hope that they may pay attention.  Most recently, the policy has worked magic in Latin America, with Brazil, Colombia, Barbados, and the Dominican Republic all reconsidering their Western Sahara stance.  As El Othmani attended the presidential inauguration in Panama city, his hope, as Nasser Bourita’s had been prior to his recent tour in Latin America, seemed to be that Panama might one day join the cohort of Latin American nations depriving Polisario of their support.

Rabat – The Permanent Mission of Morocco to the United Nations (UN) organized an international seminar on “Territorial autonomy: means of political settlement of conflicts.” The seminar was held on Monday, July 1, at the United Nations headquarters in New York. With the participation of a number of world-renowned experts, researchers and academics, the meeting was an opportunity to discuss Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.  The seminar considered Morocco’s strategy as a means of conflict resolution by comparing it to other autonomous regions in the world. Morocco’s Autonomy Plan proposes that Western Sahara become an autonomous department of Morocco, part of the Moroccan territory but with devolved government.  The seminar was chaired by Marc Finaud, Senior Adviser at the Think Tank “Center for Security Policy in Geneva,” who spoke about the provisions and distinguishing aspects of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara. He also stressed that the Moroccan Autonomy Plan “has responded, since 2004, to the United Nations Security Council calls to the parties and States of the region to continue to cooperate fully with the United Nations in order to end the current impasse and move towards a political solution.” Finaud further pointed out that “this plan clearly offers a solution, which the Security Council has (…) regularly described as serious and credible, to a conflict that has been dragging on since 1975.” Additionally, Miguel González Perez, a professor at York University in Toronto, Canada, and a specialist in Latin America, spoke about the various systems of autonomy and methods of self-governance. Gonzalez Perez cited systems put in place in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Panama, enabling local indigenous peoples to manage their own lands, natural resources, economic development, and cultural rights. He said that the experience of self-governance of indigenous peoples in these countries can be a model to be followed by other regions with indigenous populations. Thomas Benedikter, President of the European Academy in Bolsano, Italy, and expert on the South Tyrol conflict between Italy and Austria stressed the need to respect four fundamental criteria to speak of a modern system of democratic autonomy.  The criteria include a rule of law, an effective democracy with free and fair elections at regional and national levels, the actual transfer of a significant number of legislative powers to the autonomous entity, and the equality of the fundamental political and civil rights of all citizens lawfully resident in the autonomous territory. “Today, after 43 years of conflict, the Moroccan Autonomy Plan could establish a modern system of territorial autonomy based on a democratic state built on the rule of law, as well as a certain degree of decentralization of power in the state in general,” he concluded. The seminar comes as more and more countries are standing in support of Morocco’s plan. Brazil and El Salvador have recently declared their support for Morocco’s territorial integrity, while a group of countries recently issued an official statement to the Human Rights Council in support of the Autonomy plan.

Rabat – The purpose of the campaign is to raise awareness of the risks of snake and scorpion bites during the summer season.  The campaign includes education campaigns for health professionals and the general population. The education campaigns cover bite responses, the improvement of care for victims, and the clarification of the role of the national commission against snake and scorpion bites, which was created in 2013. At the launch in Rabat, which took place at the National Center for Antivenom and Pharmacoviligiance (CAPM), the Minister of Health, Anass Doukkali, explained that approximately 30,000 scorpion bite victims and 350 snake bite victims are recorded every year by the center. He estimates the national strategy has helped decrease the fatality rate of bites from scorpions from 2.37% in 1999 to 0.18% in 2018, and of bites from snakes from 8.9% in 2011 to 1.7% in 2018. “The ambition is to reduce to 0 the number of deaths in Morocco, to improve the care offered by hospitals, and also to target the social and environmental factors that play a role in bites,” Doukkali explained. Morocco is home to a number of snakes potentially dangerous to humans, including the vipers and the North African Cobra. Two scorpions species are also potentially dangerous to humans.   At the press conference, the director of the CAPM, Rachida Soulaymani Bencheikh, emphasized the importance of collaborating with local bodies that have a role in preventing poisoning , including those which operate in the education and agriculture sectors. The Ministry for Health stated the campaign would involve training health professionals in how to respond to bites, standardizing the procedure for responding to incidents, the distribution of 600 anti-snake venom kits to hospitals and clinics, education campaigns in schools and rural zones on response tactics. The CAPM provides a 24/7 support telephone line for victims of bites, providing first point of call advice in the event of an incident.

Rabat – Ten representatives from the UK education system are visiting Morocco from July 1-4 to meet potential partners and investors with the goal of opening more British schools in Morocco. The visit is an opportunity to connect British and Moroccan educational experts, facilitated by the UK Department of International Trade (DIT). The delegation also hopes to assess the Moroccan education market. “I would like to see more British education here in Morocco: there is so much the British and Moroccan education systems can achieve together,” British Ambassador to Morocco, Thomas Reilly, said in a statement. “The visit this delegation of British educators offers is a magnificent chance to take that leap forward together.” This week’s meeting follows the April visit by the Morocco Trade and Investment Mission, a delegation made up largely of education-focused organizations from the UK. During the visit, the mission looked into educational – and business – opportunities within Morocco. In anticipation of the visit, Reilly said education is one of his priorities, and that the British education system has much to offer. This comes alongside news that the number of Moroccans studying at UK Universities has increased in recent years. “I am sure that the delegation visiting this week will find Morocco to be the open, welcoming and beautiful country I have grown to know over the past two years,” Reilly said. The UK/Morocco Education Agreement was recently finalized, allowing British private international schools to open in Morocco. UK Secretary of International Trade Liam Fox confirmed this during his visit to Morocco last month. The British International School will open in Marrakech this fall and Reilly hopes that this week’s visit will build ties between the nations leading to more schools being established in the future.

Rabat – Saturday, June 29, marked the final day of the 18th annual Mawazine festival. Maroc Cultures, the organizers of the festival, announced that this year was the most successful one yet – with a whopping 2,750,000 concert-goers coming to see the 200 artists who performed across the festival’s 6 stages. “This record attendance confirms the exceptional popularity of Mawazine and the international appeal of the festival,” Maroc Culture said in a statement. The all-time-high attendance also bumped Mawazine up from the second largest festival in the world to number 1 largest, according to reference site Statista, one of the world’s leading data providers. “This new record also highlights the relevance of the Mawazine model and the unique place occupied by the festival today: open to all, free, unifying and carrying values,” Maroc Cultures added. The festival ran from for nine days, from June 21 to June 29, and saw performances from some of the world’s biggest artists in an array of genres. The OLM stage was home to performances from some of the biggest names in hip-hop, such as Future, Migos, and Travis Scott, as well as reggaeton stars such as Maluma and Karol G. The two aforementioned stars saw the biggest turnout of the whole festival, with 200,000 people coming to sing along to their Latin hits. The immense crowd brought Maluma to tears, as he expressed his love for Morocco while wearing an Atlas Lions jersey and wrapping himself in the Moroccan flag. The other stages were also home to big performances and enthusiastic crowds, with disco group Sister Sledge performing their hit “We Are Family” at the Mohammed V National Theater. Maroc Cultures dubbed the song “the anthem of the 18th edition.” Hugely popular Lebanese group Mashrou Leila, known for defying stereotypes through their music and challenging conceptions of identity and gender, also performed at Mohammed V National Theater. Unsurprisingly, the show was completely sold out. In Salé, Moroccan artists Manal, Hamid El Kasri, Fnair, Abdellah Daoudi, Zina Daoudia, and Mustapha Bourgogne treated the eager audience to “unforgettable moments.” The Nahda stage saw performances from “the biggest names in oriental music,” such as Carole Samaha, Myriam Fares, Elissa, Najwa Karam, and Walid Toufic. Emirati singer Hussain Al Jassmi closed the festival with a high energy 2-hour performance. The Bourgreg was home to performances from all over the world with Mawazine’s Rhythms of the World Stage. Carribean group, Delgres, brought the smooth flow of blues as well as the hypnotic energy of rock and soul music, and all female group Les Amazones d’Afrique treated the crowd to a West African vibe with feminist undertones. 19-year-old French rapper of Congolese origin Koba LaD closed the festival at the Bourgreg stage. He also chose to wear the Atlas Lion’s jersey as a tribute to Morocco. Maroc Culture finished its statement by not only thanking its partners this year, Spotify and Facebook, the artists who came all the way to Morocco from across the globe, but “the public and festival-goers for their presence and the loyalty they have shown throughout the years.”

Rabat – There have been times when Morocco was miles above the standard they put on display against South Africa today. But this should not be a pretext to question what has rapidly become a major line of contention among followers of this Africa Cup of Nations: Morocco is a serious contender for this year’s continental showpiece. As South Africa seemed to outperform Morocco in some critical moments, with the Moroccan Lions struggling to sustain the agility and sense of purpose they exuded against Ivory Coast, it is sure that many questions will be asked of the Atlas Lions as they wait to discover who their opponents will be for the next round. Perhaps talks of so many missed opportunities; of impotence and insufficient application in front of goal; of the point of constantly passing the ball even in the few moments when a long-range strike looks like the better option; of sloppy final passes. In the end, though, and in fairness to Hervé Renard’s lads, not letting in a single goal in the course of three matches is nothing to be sniffed at. That, in fact, however measured, is an achievement. Most important, it suggests that this is not only a team that thrives in attacking; they can shift plans when circumstances dictate so, rotating between an intensive attacking gusto and a compact defensive backline to then hit the adversary with the pace and kinetic genius of the likes of Amrabat, Achraf Hakimi, and Mazraoui, for example. This is a team that can adjust, and that should be laudable, at least as far as Moroccan fans are concerned. Besides, Renard was blunt in the pre-match press conference: “We must win and maintain the good level of play developed since the start of CAN,” the Frenchman said. They may have won, but they were largely inferior to the team they were against Ivory Coast. But that will matter little anyway, especially after claiming 9 points out of 9 possible. Morocco was good at the start. For much of the first fifteen minutes, the Moroccan middle field won most of the game-defining duels. The passes were abundant and the quick succession between the backline and the front four was particularly mouth-watering. For those minutes when it looked like South Africa was in for a stinging defeat against a Moroccan side that succeeded in everything it tried, it would have not been unwarranted to foresee a 2, 3-0 final score line. Lest it be forgotten, the sublime 4th minute long-range pass to En-Nesyri was no offside, and that would have changed the entire complexion of the game had the referee not wrongly ruled it out. That pass, barely conceivable from the angle whence it came—which is perhaps why the referee decided it could not have been done without the receiver being off side—was another reminder of Morocco’s tactical maturity. But South Africa was not here to endure only. With three points in their pockets, the Bafana Bafana did come to make something of their CAN. If victory was implausible, they could at least land a draw sufficient enough to cross fingers and hope to be among the tournament’s four best  third-placed teams. And they fought, and there were even moments when they appeared slightly superior. In hindsight, after those exciting first 25 minutes or so, the first half was largely, for both squads, an exercise in finding the crack that never showed up. As in the first half, South Africa came back exceedingly lively for the first quarter of the second. For minutes, Morocco looked overwhelmed, relatively beleaguered and clueless. Passes were missed and, quite unbelievably, given his record in such situations, the unassailable Amrabat gave away balls and lost clashes. The Bafana were now growing more venturesome. Sensing the unease their confidence was causing in the Moroccan tactical disposition, they pushed and pushed, only to be blocked by what looked like an impenetrable Moroccan defensive fortress. In those minutes when the Bafana dictated the direction of the game, the Moroccan midfield was subsumed, rendered inexistent for at least 15 minutes. Nonetheless, for a squad that has made its name on its fretful attacking football, Morocco’s backline was solid, composed. And, as the Bafana struggled to make something meaningful of their short-lived moment of supremacy, there was a growing sense that, for all that it was worth, the Bafana’s few magic moments were but a temporary blip before Morocco stroke back and claimed what it had been desperately seeking: a victory to finally end a history of CAN confrontations that has mostly gone South Africa’s way. Now striking back, Morocco made a light alteration to the game. In the throes of the formidable work rate in South Africa’s midfield, the Atlas Lions decided to use their elite-filled flanks. Instead of Belhanda and Hakim Ziyach, the inspiration and most of the actions now came from Hakimi, Mazraoui, and—who else but him?—Amrabat. More than a liberation—because the tempo was now Morocco’s, Boussoufa’’s last-minute goal was a vindication, a validation that this was no confrontation between the late 1990s’ Bafana and Atlas Lions. For Renard, this is bound to be a hugely satisfying performance. Not an ideal performance, he stressed in the post-match press-conference, resorting to his usual “we could have done better” phrase, the ultimate Renard-esque match talk. But satisfaction does not necessarily come from shattering one’s opponent. Sometimes, nothing is more satisfying than claiming exactly what is required to attain one’s goal. They needed to finish as the leader of their group, to win all the 9 points. And to do it without conceding a single goal is all the more reassuring, especially for a team fighting to break free of three decades of sloppiness in moments that hurt the most. The spectacle was nowhere close to the mesmerizing performance against Ivory Coast; overall, though, it was—once again—enough to fill Moroccan hearts with the now flying belief, the audacious certainty that, yes, this year could be the year. To make history. To put behind three decades of dispiriting, underwhelming, and sometimes—as in 2012—soul-sapping exits from CAN.

Rabat – A major European maritime fleet, consisting of several warships, arrived on Monday, July 1, in Casablanca serving Europe’s naval maneuvering purposes with its African ally, the Royal Moroccan Navy (MNR). The newly arrived fleet under the European Maritime Force (EUROMARFOR), will participate in joint naval exercises with MNR, as announced by Far-Maroc, a website addressing defense issues nationally.  EUROMARFOR is a military maritime force founded in 1995 by four European countries: France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, to carry out naval, air and amphibious operations. Today the force executes variable missions including sea control, humanitarian and crisis response operations, as well as peace enforcement. It is expected that these maneuvers, called “Multi Cooperative Exercise”, are taking place early this week in Casablanca. The fleet’s arrival reflects the significance of military cooperation between Europe and Morocco, the continent’s crucial partner for maintaining peace and stability in the Middle Eastern volatile region. This is not the first time the Royal Moroccan Navy participates in a naval exercise of this kind. Earlier this year, MNR took a training trip to Europe, receiving coaching in Germany, the Netherlands, and France. The Special Forces Unit of the Royal Moroccan Navy is being trained by taking part in maneuvers with allied countries to promote and secure military cooperation.  Prior to Morocco’s navy Europe tour, the Moroccan-American “African Lion” joint exercises took place in the North African country between March and April 2019. The United States Command for Africa (AFRICOM) and Moroccan Royal Armed Foces FAR jointly organized African Lion 2019 to enhance cooperation and training exchange between militaries of multiple countries. In the annual exercise, military units from 15 countries participated including Canada, Spain, Portugal, the UK, Italy, Senegal, Tunisia, Mauritania, the US, Austria, and Morocco.

Rabat – Moroccan and Algerian football fans launched a joint campaign on social media called “Khawa Khawa” (Brothers). The campaign is meant to express brotherhood between the two countries and to encourage both national teams in the African Cup of Nations, currently being played in Egypt. Fans of both teams actively reacted to the campaign and attended matches to encourage and support the other team.  The last match was Algeria’s victory against Senegal on June 27, where fans from both Morocco and Algeria encouraged the Algerian national team in qualifying for the second round. Other campaigns were launched between the two communities, the latest of which was “Khawa Khawa, Mahrez is Moroccan and Benatia is Algerian”.  The campaign refers to the relations of heritage and marriage that bind the two populations. The mother of the Atlas Lions’ captain, Mehdi Benatia is Algerian, while the maternal grandmother of Mahrez, the star of Algeria’s Desert Warriors, is Moroccan. The campaign has been met with widespread positive reactions on social media, as users hailed the idea of ​​fostering love and brotherhood among the populations of the two neighboring countries. In recent years, Algeria supported Morocco’s candidacy for hosting World Cup 2026, while Morocco appointed Lakhdar Belloumi, the former star of the Algerian national team, ambassador to the Moroccan candidacy file.  While politics continues to divide the neighboring countries, football is encouraging common interests and fraternity.

Rabat – Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) announced Monday the inauguration of its School of Collective Intelligence (EIC), located within the campus of the city of Benguerir.  According to the university’s website, the EIC represents a means to handle the growing demand to create new organizational models, which are  “more inclusive and more relevant to today’s global challenges.” UM6P’s website further mentions that the EIC comes as an opportune solution to the fact that  “most systems of governance still function as hierarchies, pyramids, or “representative” institutions that are no longer trusted by those they represent.” These traditional systems are, according to the university, the cause behind the “the continuing unrest in our politics and economy.” Hicham El Habti, Secretary General of UM6P, said that the EIC aims to form a new generation of visionary professionals who will be able to assist organizations, whether public or private, to lead the transformational projects that are essential today.  He also voiced how he takes pride in the fact that this new achievement will be “from Morocco, and from the university’s campus in Benguerir.” The UM6P’s EIC is expected to offer students a Master’s degree in Collective Intelligence (IC), a Ph.D., with the opportunity to pursue postdoctoral research, an Executive Master’s degree, in addition to an entrepreneurship incubator.  The EIC intends to base its training on three axes, namely cognitive sciences, the design of organizational systems, facilitation as a discipline based on emotional intelligence and creation within the work groups.

Rabat – The campaign aims to raise awareness in Morocco of the importance of fighting against plastic pollution. Over 100 beaches will benefit from the program, the Foundation announced in a press release. The hashtag, shared by organizations like World Wide Nature Fund Morocco (WWF) and national television station 2M, is designed to  raise awareness for the campaign.  “63 local bodies (regions, prefectures, provinces) […], 27 economic partners and over 100 local associations will be mobilized over three months to raise awareness and educate summer holiday-goers, to supervise the quality of seawater and sand, to equip beaches, to ensure safety and to ensure rules and regulations are respected,” the Foundation added. The campaign will be launched in three phases. The first phase “All together for 10 less tons of plastic waste per beach,” will be carried out over the summer months. Each targeted beach will be paired with an organization that will be responsible for carrying out activities to promote clean beaches. The second phase of the campaign will advocate for beach-goers to spend an entire day at the beach without using any plastic bags.  The third phase will involve a campaign around World Clean Up Day, an annual international  waste collection day taking place on September 21. “[…] The Mohammed VI Foundation for the Protection of the Environment wants […] Moroccan citizens to become conscious of reducing the waste that is so detrimental to the environment, and to become conscious of the fact biodiversity depends in great part on them. Using less plastic, buying less products packaged in plastic, picking up your own rubbish, these are all simple acts that contribute to preserving the nature that we depend on,” adds the press release. Morocco’s beaches are an integral part of its local and international tourism strategy. Keeping beaches clean is a challenge the Foundation has been engaged in for over 20 years.  In a bid to reduce single-use plastic products, a culprit of ocean pollution, Morocco introduced a law in July 2016 banning the production, import, sale and distribution of plastic bags across the country. Morocco has taken steps to enforce this law.  According to Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi, between 2015 and 2018, Moroccan authorities recorded 4,389 offenses related to using plastic bags, seized 821 tons of prohibited plastic bags, and seized 107 tons of banned bags at border posts. The Moroccan courts made 757 judgments with fines of MAD 5 million, he added at a press briefing in January of this year, following an amendment to the enforcement provisions of the law.

Rabat – Morocco’s external public debt has dropped 1.4% compared to March 2018.  According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Morocco’s Treasury borrowed 44.9% of the total debt, public bodies borrowed 54.4%. The balance was borrowed by the banking sector and other public bodies. Nearly half of Morocco’s debt, 48.6%, comes from international institutions.These include the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Bilateral lending agreements make up 28% (of which 18.5% from European countries). 23.4% of the debt comes from banks. The figures mean the majority of Morocco’s public external debt comes from Government partnerships, rather than from financial investors. International lending plays an important part in Morocco’s development. This year the World Bank has lent millions towards education, digital transformation, and youth employment.  However, the loans have raised concern. The 2019 Global Firepower Index (GFP) found that Morocco owes $51,480,000,000 in external debt. In January, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami warned Morocco’s economy would continue to be weighed down by debt this year. “Debt is becoming heavier and we must try to increase national savings, ” he said.

When hip-hop megastars from all around the world come under one roof, you are guaranteed to see some great performances and Future, especially, made a lasting impression. Icon and American rapper, Future’s classic songs Mask off, March Madness, and Codeine Crazy’ lit the stage up with roars of excitement from the crowd. Feeding off the raw energy of Moroccan hip hop fans, Future and his onstage team of astonishing dancers left no dull moments. Future is renowned as an icon for choruses, and his passion for music. His fans at Mawazine and I had the privilege of hearing features with Drake’s ‘Jumpman’ and Lil Wayne’s ‘Love Me’. During the performance, he also name dropped the Weekend which threw the crowd into a frenzy, with fans stacking themselves on top of each other to show their love for the icon. Future responded with two back to back performances of ‘Mask off’. An American rapper, vocalist, lyricist, and record maker, he was brought up in Atlanta, Georgia, Wilburn and is a role model to many. Growing up, Future came from a rough part of Atlanta and made underground music. His background made a lot of people living in similar situations able to relate to him through his music.  The Icon took the world by storm, especially in 2015 when his album DS2 (Deluxe) was released. Whether walking to the bus stop or listening to music during track practice, teens all over the US heard Future’s hits like Beast Mode or Where Ya At.  I remember in high school, my best friend and I used to listen to March Madness, it was an addiction like our daily cup of coffee. The lyrics were so energetic and relatable it as though everyone you knew was listening to his songs. Getting to actually see this great artist that my peers and I listened to ever since we were teens was a chance of a lifetime. From the moment he stepped on stage to the moment he stepped off, I felt the energy and love I had for Future since I was a teen in high school. In the crowd, there was tangible electricity just from the vitality that Future was giving off. It was better than anything I could have imagined.  Not only that, but seeing the performance in Morocco, a place so far from home in the US, for the first time made the experience all the more amazing. Fans from all ages came to see Future’s concert which began at 7.30 pm. The diversity of people who came to the concert was amazing. The fact that everyone could come together to listen to music and have a great time was a beauty within itself.  There were children who were screaming, jumping, and enjoying themselves as well as middle-aged adults who were acting out and dancing and singing along. It felt very wholesome and I am so grateful for being a part of that.  I was able to meet new people and enjoy myself with complete strangers. It was also great to fully immerse myself in the concert and really enjoy the performance to its full extent. The crowd had such amazing energy and throughout this whole performance fans were yelling their hearts out to make sure Future felt the appreciation that Morocco had for him. I was truly blessed to have been at this performance and I am happy to share it with fellow fans in Morocco.

Rabat – The Ecocean initiative aims to reduce the quantity of plastic waste in Morocco’s oceans and improve waste management initiatives in the area of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima. The project will be carried out in phases over a three year period until 2020. It will involve a variety of stakeholders in the region, including public and private bodies that operate in environmental conservation and waste management. The three organizations behind the project have already launched a study that analyzes the region’s plastic waste situation, as well as social, environmental, and economic impacts of waste in the area. The study identified 32 key target locations where plastic waste enters the ocean. Plastic waste management is a broader regional concern. A 2019 report released by World Wide Nature Fund (WWF) finds 6.6 million tonnes of plastic waste is mismanaged yearly around the Mediterranean. It notes 247 billion pieces of plastic are estimated to be floating in the Mediterranean. Ecocean will target waste management, a practice which is integral to preventing plastic from finding its way into the oceans. The WWF report draws attention to Morocco’s waste dumping figures. The report finds an estimated 2.8 million tonnes of waste is openly dumped in uncontrolled sites around the Mediterranean every year.  While Egypt and Turkey are the two largest sources of open dumping by total volume, WWF identifies Morocco as “rank[ing] high when looking at the total waste openly dumped per capita.”

Rabat –   Award-winning Egyptian actor, Ezzat Abou Aouf, died this morning, Monday, June 1, in a hospital in Cairo. The iconic 71-year-old actor is said to have been suffering from heart and liver problems in recent years. He spent the last few weeks of his life in the ICU receiving treatment for the conditions. Abou Aouf had become a beloved icon in the Egyptian film industry, having starred in over 100 productions, either in film, television or theatre. The actor was born in 1948, and after gaining a bachelor’s degree in medicine, began a career as an obstetrician. However, he decided to leave the profession to follow his passion for creative arts. He then formed a band in the early 80s with his four sisters, Mona, Maha, Manal and Mervat, called 4M. As the band gained popularity, the film industry spotted Abou Aouf’s natural talent and easy charm and he began taking on-screen jobs in 1992. He starred in dozens of productions, such as “Hawanem Garden City” (Garden City Ladies), “Nisf Rabie Al Akhir” (The Other Half of Rabie), among others, before becoming the director of the Cairo International Film Festival for seven years, solidifying himself as a pioneer of Egyptian film. He also never lost his passion for music as his acting career took off, having developed soundtracks for many productions alongside acting. His funeral will take place on Monday, at the Sayeda Nafisa Mosque in Cairo shortly after noon prayers. He leaves behind two children, Kamal and Mariam Abou Aouf, the latter of which followed his footsteps into the film industry and is a director.

In a pre-match conference, Renard admitted that today’s game will be “very difficult.” “We must win and maintain the good level of play developed since the start of CAN,” Renard said. He acknowledged that the South African team also needs the win to”preserve their chances of going to the 16 round.” The head coach added that Morocco’s goal now is to finish first in the group to qualify and “aim for little afterwards. This will only happen through hard work and focus.” Renard added that he will make some changes on training due to the “importance and nature of the game.” “The two teams are totally different and each of them has their own style of play,” he said. The coach added that his squad will focus on the achievements they made during the first two matches against Cote d’Ivoire and Namibia. “We have to exploit them,” he said. Morocco’s team qualified for the second 16 round after an astonishing performance on Friday, June 28 against Ivory Coast.

Rabat – Medhi Benatia, the captain of Morocco’s Atlas Lions, has made watching CAN 2019 possible for a group of Moroccan Lions’ fans in the Douar Ait Baaziz village, in the Taza region, in northern Morocco. On June 28, Morocco’s national squad played against Ivory Coast in their second outing in Group D. The Taza boys, apparently due to the dire lack of resources in their neighborhood, had no TV from which they could watch the much-anticipated Group D clash between Morocco’s Lions and Ivory Coast’s elephants. But the lack of access to TV was not going to stand in the boys’ way, nor preclude them from watching their national team. So they put a smartphone on what looked like table, in front of, judging from the image,  at least a dozen of boys, watching the game as though from a big screen in one of those chic cafes across Morocco. The image, which was later shared online by fans who saluted the patriotism and hearty gesture of the group of boys, stirred a vociferous debate about solidarity on social media. Soccer 212, a widely followed Moroccan football-focused Twitter account, disseminated the images of the boys, calling for a fund-raising campaign to finance for a TV set with “all the necessary materials” so the boys could watch the remainder of CAN in much better conditions. Echoes of the Taza boys’ show of enthusiasm for the national squad subsequently reached some quarters of the national team. Medhi Benatia, the team’s captain, then decided to respond in kind, gifting the boys with a TV set. The gesture was just as eloquent as the Taza fan boys’ show of unconditional love for the national team. Soccer 212 later tweeted, “Yesterday our team decided to organize a ‘Letchi’ solidarity fund-raising to come in help to the Taza boys by buying them a TV set and all the accompanying materials so they can watch the matches of the national team under much better conditions, and no longer on a phone screen. God willing, and thanks to your show of solidarity, the message made the rounds on social media, especially on Twitter, and reached the ears of some members of the national team.” Soccer 212 went on to recount how one member of the national squad, Benatia, decided to “take the whole matter in his own hands.” The group announced that “it was very happy” to announce that it was “cancelling” its solidarity fund “because Benatia has decided to claim the entire responsibility.” For his part, the Atlas Lions captain explained that there was nothing grand about his gesture. Instead, he argued, it was a normal show of appreciation and love for the millions of Moroccans who unconditionally love and support their national team, bestowing on players the highest degree of appreciation and affection. “When you watch something like this,” the 32-year-old defender tweeted, referring to the widely shared image of the Taza boys watching the match against Ivory Coast, “one can only wish to give back, give away everything. This is for you my boys; we will do everything to make you happy.” The whole episode highlighted the outburst of solidarity and passion that can accompany football, especially in football-crazed Morocco where the sport has lifted hundreds out of the prevailing precariousness in remote areas and low-income neighborhoods in big cities. Morocco currently leads its group after winning the first two matches. The Lions will take on South Africa’s Bafana Bafana later today, at 5 p.m Moroccan time. Against Ivory Coast, Benatia and his teammates put on a thunderously impressive display which helped to put to rest the doubts that Moroccan fans had been entertaining about the team’s prospects, while also sending a raucous warning to potential rivals. A victory tonight against South Africans will seal the reputation that the Moroccan Lions earned themselves after their impressive game against the Ivoirians. But ultimate victory in this tournament, given the depth of quality available in the other squads competing for the ultimate continental glory, will call for sustaining—and even raising—the level Coach Herve Renards’ lads exuded against Ivory Coast.

Rabat – Yassir is yet another app designed to facilitate public transport in busy, major Moroccan cities. “It is an easy to use app, which will allow users to safely move from one point to another,” the director of Yassir, Rachid Moulay El Rhazi, told the official Moroccan news outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). On June 30, Yassir and the Democratic Transport Syndicate (SDT) signed an agreement in Casablanca. The new agreement allows taxi drivers to use the app, in accordance with transport laws applicable to the Casablanca-Settat region. “This agreement has been signed in the interest of defending the socio-economic rights of professional drivers, to ensure they benefit financially and socially from Yassir,” the vice-secretary of the SDT Samir Faraby stated. New apps have been disrupting Morocco’s taxi industry. Yassir competes with a number of taxi ordering apps already on the market including Heetch and Roby. “Heetch” was launched in Casablanca in 2018 and operates in Rabat and Marrakech. Another taxi ordering app Roby Taxi has been operating for three months in Marrakech and, since February, in Casablanca. Uber-like ride-sharing app Careem also operates in Morocco. Bought in March by Uber for approximately MAD 30 billion ($3.1 billion). According to the company’s estimates, Careem had 300,000 users in Morocco in 2018 The taxi industry has to respond quickly to the changing transport market.  In July last year the SDT signed an agreement with Careem, allowing taxi drivers to also use the app, which was originally only intended for private drivers.

Rabat – A fire broke out at the plastic tents used as a campsite by irregular migrants near Oulad Ziane bus station in Casablanca on Saturday, June 29. The fire has not resulted in any casualties, thanks to rapid intervention by local authorities and security security services, as well as members of the civil protection. The camps are used by sub-Saharan migrants, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Investigations are ongoing to determine the circumstances of the outbreak of the fire. The incident is not the first of its kind as fires have broken out in camps used by irregular migrants several times near the Oulad Ziane bus station. In December 2018, a fire previously broke out at the site of the irregular migrant camps near the Oulad Ziane bus station. A similar incident occurred in July, when a fire broke out during the evacuation of a group of undocumented sub-Saharan migrants from a property owned by the National Railway Office (ONCF) near Fez’ train station. Thousands of sub-Saharan migrants travel to Morocco every year. While some migrants use Morocco as a transit country, using perilous crossing to reach Europe, others choose Morocco as a destination to escape war or poor living conditions in their homelands. In 2018, Morocco’s Ministry of Interior said that 50,000 migrants’ status were regularized in Morocco in four years since 2014. The ministry said that the number accounts for about 85% of the overall applications from foreign nationals in Morocco. Faced by irregular migration issue, Morocco has adopted several strategies to combat the issue. Morocco’s government announced in May 2019 that Moroccan security services thwarted more than 30000 irregular migration attempts in 2019 compared to 88,761 of foiled attempts in 2018. The government said that the decrease in the number of irregular migration attempts reflects the “great” effort of Morocco’s law enforcement forces against the issue of undocumented migration and the trafficking networks active in this area.

Rabat – A report on crimes related to terrorism in Morocco shows that Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy is bearing fruit as the level of threat related to terror crimes has stabilized over the past two years. The report, released by the Moroccan Public Prosecutor’s Office, was accompanied by a second report on the execution of criminal policy. The second report shows that 337 suspects appeared before the General Prosecutor’s Office at the Rabat Court of Appeal in 2018 for their alleged involvement in terror crimes, compared to 358 in the previous year Quoting the report, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) said that 66% of the cases went to trial while only 14% did not. The report shows that 107 judicial proceedings, the highest number of cases, were carried out for inciting terrorism. Trials for extreme violence and manufacturing and possession of weapons were the second most prolific crime, with 19 trials apiece. The list of crimes also includes the financing acts of terrorism, with 18 judicial proceedings, and involvement in terror groups which resulted in 13 judicial cases. According to the report, “although Morocco has been the subject of terror threats like other countries, [the North African country] has managed to defeat the majority of terror plans aimed at causing serious harm to public order.” The report also recalled that Morocco has dismantled several terror cells throughout the year. In 2015, Morocco introduced the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), an agency which has significantly reinforced Morocco’s security policy. The role of the BCIJ, which is the main body in charge of fighting terrorism, is well recognized. Several reports have cited the agency’s achievements in counterterrorism and its international collaboration to fight the issue. The 2018 US Department report praised Morocco’s efforts, saying that the country has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.” The BCIJ works in collaboration with Morocco’s General Directorate for National Security (DGSN), while the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) works with BCIJ to conduct border inspections at airports. The report explained that Morocco’s record in countering terrorism was made possible thanks to the BCIJ as well as the National Criminal Police Brigade and the Royal Gendarmerie.
BCIJ has carried out several significant operations in the first six months of 2019, arresting a number of ISIS-linked terror suspects. The latest arrest was on June 25, when BCIJ dismantled a four-member terrorist cell in Al Haouz in the Marrakech-Safi region.
