Rabat – “This resolution paves the way for the next UN envoy to continue from where President Horst Kohler left off,” said Morocco’s UN representative after the UN Security Council’s meeting on Western Sahara. While “happy” with Resolution 2494, the latest UN Security Council resolution on the Western Sahara conflict, Omar Hilale said there is still some way to go for all parties to commit to a “constructive” and “responsible” settlement process. Adopted yesterday, the resolution renewed the UN peacekeeping mission for a year and urged all concerned parties in the territorial dispute to seriously engage in the political process. In his remarks, made at a press conference on the sideline of the Security Council meeting, Ambassador Hilale said “Morocco is satisfied” with what it sees as yet a further acknowledgement of its efforts towards sustainable and lasting peace in the disputed territory. “Resolution 2494 is more than a technical renewal of the MINURSO mandate,” he said. He went on to emphatically explain how, in “consecrating” the roundtable habit as part and parcel of the UN process in Western Sahara, the newly adopted resolution is an extension of the “new momentum” initiated under Horst Kohler, the UN Western Sahara envoy who resigned last May for health reasons after two years of effective mediation. Hilale was full of praise for Kohler’s two-year tenure as UN envoy. He emphasized that the German diplomat’s legacy must be upheld to preserve the “positive momentum”  that his “devotion” and “pragmatic” mediation inspired in the first place. The final resolution adopted during Kohler’s tenure has largely been interpreted as the resolution that unequivocally suggested self-determination is no longer a viable route for the Western Sahara political quagmire. Since 2007, when Morocco presented its Autonomy Proposal to the Security Council, the UN-led mediation for Western Sahara has predominantly advocated for a compromise-based route. However, it was Resolution 2468, the last one under Kohler, that mentioned a political solution based on “pragmatism,” “realism,” and “compromise” as the most practical way to end the decades-long deadlock in Western Sahara. It was also the first resolution to plainly refer to Algeria and Mauritania—until then described as “observer states”—as integral parties to the conflict, urging them to be more engaged in settlement negotiations. Hilale suggested any steps to be taken after Resolution 2494 should be a continuity of Kohler’s legacy. For him, such continuity would not only entail a total rupture from the “old” and “obsolete” insistence on self-determination, but also a principled commitment to the spirit of “pragmatism” and “compromise” now well-established in UN circles working on Western Sahara.

Rabat – Canada’s Bombardier reached a deal with US Spirit Aerosystems for its Belfast-Morocco facilities. Bombardier announced on Thursday, October 31, that it had agreed to sell its aerostructures to Aerosystems for more than $1 billion. Bombardier Chief Executive officer Alain Bellemare said that the “transaction represents another strategic milestone in the reshaping of our portfolio to focus on our strong business aircraft and rail franchises.” Bombardier announced the decision to sell its facilities in May.  Spirit AeroSystems Holdings will join other important aeronautics companies operating in Morocco, such as Boing, and Safran. It is one of the largest suppliers for Boeing aircraft. Spirit already has facilities in Tulsa, McAlester, Oklahoma, Kinston, North Carolina, Malaysia, and France. The company’s key products include, “fuselages, pylons, nacelles, and wing components,” Spirit Aero said. The US company also provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services. Morocco’s foreign exchange office announced in 2018 that the Moroccan aviation industry earned more than MAD 9.78 billion ($1 billion) in the first 11 months of 2017, compared to MAD 8.42 billion ($870 million) in 2016, an increase of 16%. The aeronautics industry is one of Morocco’s key economic pillars. Morocco relies on the industry to curb unemployment.  Several recent reports extolled the industry of aeronautics, including Oxford Business Group. The group forecasted a flourishing future for Morocco’s economy, thanks to aeronautics and the automotive sector.

Rabat – The Polisario Front has lashed out at the UN Security Council after the adoption of Resolution 2494 on October 30. The new resolution extended the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MINURSO in Western Sahara, for one year. The Polisario front issued a statement following the adoption of the resolution, claiming that the UN peace process is at “a critical juncture,” and threatening to reconsider “its engagement in the political process. The Polisario Front explicitly voiced frustration in the statement, claiming that the resolution lacks “concrete actions” and progress in the UN-led political process. The statement, shared by the news agency of the self-proclaimed SADR, stated that the resolution is “unacceptable return to ‘business as usual’ on Western Sahara and deals a serious blow to the political momentum.” In contrast to the Polisario front’s response to the adoption of Resolution 2494, several permanent member states of the UN Security council welcomed the resolution and cited the progress made under the guidance of former Personal Envoy Horst Kohler The council adopted the resolution with 13 votes against only 2 absentations from Russia and South Africa. The resolution calls on the parties to the conflict, including Algeria, a party that has consistently n distanced itself from the process, to cooperate with the UN in working towards finding a  mutually acceptable political solution for the conflict. For the Polisario Front, however,  the Security Council “missed another opportunity to prevent the UN peace process from collapsing.” The Polisario Front received warnings in both the Security Council and the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who called on the separatist group to adhere to its resolutions and ceasefire agreements. The Polisario Front, according to Guterres’ report, published on October 2, breached the military agreements by maintaining illegal facilities east of Morocco’s defense wall, known as the berm. Despite the Security Council’s repeated calls on the Polisario to abide by the provisions of its resolutions, the latter is adopting a tone of defiance ll0land threatening to withdraw from the political process entirely. The Polisario claims that the UN process is at breaking point, stating that the separatist front is “left with no option but to reconsider its engagement in the peace process as a whole.” Morocco’s permanent ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale, N welcomed the adoption of the new resolution and reiterated Morocco’s commitment to the UN-led process.  The Moroccan diplomat cited the “new momentum” brought to the process by Horst Kohler, the recently retired UN Western Sahara envoy, and expressed Morocco’s commitment to working with MINURSO and the incoming UN envoy to maintain this momentum.

Rabat – Having already abandoned exit and entry forms at Moroccan airports with a view to facilitating administrative processes, the Moroccan government has announced that life and residence will no longer be required as of 2020. The Moroccan Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit announced the move during post-parliament questions sessions on Tuesday, October 29. Laftit explained that the introduction of the new National Electronic Identity Card (CNIE) means that Moroccan citizens no longer need to provide life and residence certificates to complete official paperwork. Currently, life certificates are required for citizens applying for state pensions and for ID card application and renewal. The minister added that a new bill is ready and will be presented before the government and the parliament in the coming weeks.  The introduction of the new CNIE in 2020 is designed to facilitate administrative processes for Moroccan citizens. The new IDs will allow access to a digital system adopted by the various public and private stakeholders while modernizing the design format. The new format will take into account the historical and cultural specificities of Morocco, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) explained in a statement. With the new CNIE, citizens will be able to use identity and biometric data contained in the IDs to authenticate operations, facilitating access to public administration and private sector services, including public programs and health benefits. The new ID cards are lower in cost than previous cards and are guaranteed to all citizens, including minors. In contrast, the current cards are only offered to citizens 18 and up. In the case of minors, the ID cards will be available immediately after birth or at the age of schooling.

Rabat – The implicit meaning of the unanimity prevailing over the Security Council’s repeated push for a “compromise-based” and “pragmatic” solution means that self-determination and referendum have effectively been discarded as a way forward in Western Sahara. This assessment is the crux of Morocco’s UN ambassador Omar Hilale’s remarks at his press conference after the Security Council’s meeting on Western Sahara on October 30. The Security Council meeting culminated in the adoption of Resolution 2494, a move that Morocco applauded for its compromise and pragmatism-driven agenda for settlement in Western Sahara. “This resolution forcefully reaffirms the fundamental parameters of the political solution. It clearly states that the solution should be realistic, pragmatic, sustainable, and based on compromise. What does that mean in UN parlance? It means that the members of the UN Security Council have definitely buried the “old-fashioned”… and “obsolete” demands from before 2007,” when Morocco made its autonomy proposal. “Referendum is over; referendum is dead. The members [of the Security Council] have buried definitely referendum,” he later said while answering a question on Morocco and Polisario’s conflicting views on the concept of self-determination. Hilale explained that, in line with the latest developments in the issue, self-determination refers to self-expression and autonomous decision making, as guaranteed in regions like Laayoune and Dakhla. After the adoption of Resolution 2494, Polisario explicitly expressed its discontent with the new roadmap, threatening to withdraw from the soon-to-be scheduled round table negotiations. The separatist front wanted the MINURSO mandate to be extended for six months instead of a year; it saw in the one-year extension a case of Morocco “exerting pressure” on the Security Council. In response, Hilale said the Polisario Front’s response embodied the “psychology of people who have lost hope in their dreams.” He said the front, having dreamt for four decades, is finally waking up to the fact that its more than 40 years of “lies” and “selling wind and sand” will eventually catch up with them. “They have been lying for forty years that there will be independence. There will never be independence. The only solution is autonomy under the sovereignty of Morocco.  The resolutions of the Security Council are not talking about independence.”

Rabat  – Mohamed Abdennabaoui, President of the Prosecutor General’s Office spoke about the alarming number of child marriage in Morocco at the opening of a two-day conference on underage marriage on Tuesday, October 29 in Marrakech. Abdennabaoui announced that courts recorded 33,686 child marriage requests in 2018. Cited by Moroccan television channel, 2M  the prosecutor said that the number “raises questions about measures taken on these requests by the various judicial services, including public prosecutors offices.” He recalled that the Public Prosecutor’s Office has issued several circulars, including circular number 20 related to child marriage. The prosecutor said that the circulars called on judicial institutions to “not hesitate” in rejecting any requests for marriage that does not take into account the interests of the minor or minors involved. Abdennabaoui added that public prosecution office is conducting a study on the issue of underage marriage. The study will conduct an urgent investigation into the issue with the aim of fighting against it. The study also aims to address all means that circumvent the law to “legalize child marriage.” It will also address legal and judicial aspects raised in relation with sexual violence, forced marriage, domestic violence, and other issues linked to child marriage. Currently, child marriages can be legalized in Morocco if the family gets a waiver for the minor. The number of waiver requests for minors increased to 41,669 in 2015 compared to 38,331 in 2007, the Moroccan High Commission of Planning (HCP) said earlier this year. A study from organization “Droit &amp; Justice,” said that 30,000 female minors get married each year in Morocco. The organization revealed in January that of the 33,253 marriage contracts signed in 2009 and 35,152 in 2013 in Morocco, a total of 30,000 involved females under the age of eighteen. The study cited the influence of traditional customs as the main reason behind the increase of child marriage in Morocco.

Rabat – The father of Lindsay Lohan, Michael Lohan, has shut down rumors claiming that his daughter is conducting a romantic relationship with the controversial crown prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, the New York Post reported. Lohan’s father said that his daughter has a “platonic and respectful” relationship with bin Salman after tabloid reports suggested that they are dating. Reports also claimed that bin Salman “showered” the actress with gifts and a credit card. “They are just friends,” the actress’ father said. He added that Lindsay has a “lot of powerful friends in the Middle East, because she is huge out there.” Michael said that Lindsay and MBS met because of the work “she has been doing in the Middle East. She is working to help people in the region, particularly refugees.” The father of the celebrity regretted that nobody writes about “the good work Lindsay does in Syria, they just want to hear the bad stuff.” Michael also spoke about MBS’ link to the murder of  prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Michael Lohan’s said “none of that has been proven to be true.” He added that his daughter said that bin Salman is a good person. “She feels safe, she has good people around her, and she knows how to conduct herself,” he said. Lindsay Lohan is most popular for her role in the movie Mean Girls. Several powerful leaders have faced scandals due to their controversial relationships. Last month, the New York Times published exclusive information about a scandal linking former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri with a South African bikini model. The document said that the former gifted the model $16 million in 2013.

Rabat – Most of the permanent and non-permanent members at the UN Security Council expressed support for the renewal of the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, MINURSO. The council adopted Resolution 2494  following a vote on October 30. The resolution gained support from 13 members, with only two abstentions.  Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council and South Africa a non-permanent member both abstained from the vote.  Non-permanent members of the UN Security Council including Kuwait, the Dominican Republic, and Equatorial Guinea were among the countries to vocalize their support for Morocco’s efforts to cooperate with MINURSO and the UN-led political solution.  MINRUSO’s mission is to find a mutually acceptable and an agreed-upon solution for the Western Sahara conflict. The three non-member states also expressed their support for the Moroccan position on the conflict. Fawaz Bourisly,  Kuwaiti representative at the Security Council, welcomed the adoption of Resolution 2494. He said that the resolution “provides hope for a mutually acceptable solution,” emphasizing the importance of Morocco’s proposed initiative: the Autonomy Plan. The Kuwaiti diplomat stressed the need to “uphold [Morocco’s] sovereignty.” Remos Ondo Angue, a diplomat from Equatorial Guinea,  made clear his country’s support for the extension of the MINURSO mandate. The new resolution extended the mandate of the UN peacekeeping operation to one. The previous three extensions to the mandate have been for six month periods.  Angue also expressed hopes that the UN will appoint a new envoy  to replace Horst Kohler, and that the envoy “will be able to hold a third-round table meeting as soon as possible.” Kohler managed to convene all parties to the conflict, including Morocco, Algeria, Polisario, and Mauritania, at two round tables in Geneva in 2018 and 2019. The Equatorial Guinean diplomat also welcomed Morocco’s efforts to uphold human rights. For the Dominican Republic, the resolution is a balanced text that emphasizes  MINURSO’s important role. The representative of the Dominican Republic, Jose Manuel Trullols Yabra said that the resolution supports a “compromise-based solution.” He also expressed his country’s support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, describing the proposal as a “viable route towards a just and mutually acceptable solution.” Cote D’Ivoire also welcomed Morocco’s cooperation with the UN human rights procedures. Permanent Members of the Security Council  The vast majority of permanent members of the Security Council were also vocal in their support for the new resolution. The US Security Council representative, Michael Barkin, reiterated his country’s support for MINURSO. The diplomat, however, said that he “would have preferred a unified, consensus text,” commenting on the abstentions of Russia and South Africa in the vote to adopt the resolution. He argued that what is important now is that the political process continues without “delay.” “The mandate renewal does not mean a return to business as usual.  The process must move forward,” he stressed. France has long advocated for a one-year mandate for MINURSO and expressed satisfaction with the new resolution. French representative Nicolas de Rivière welcomed the return to a one‑year mandate for MINURSO, saying “it should be standard for peacekeeping.”   South Africa’s African Union agenda Despite the solid backing for the resolution, South Africa was not among the voices in support of the mandate renewal. The continental heavy-weight maintains that the conflict should be an issue for the African Union.   Though South Africa has voiced support for the widely-held belief that the UN-led process is the sole option in finding a resolution for the conflict, Pretoria has also expressed doubts about the balance of the resolution.  Jerry Matthews Matjila, Council president for October, spoke to the Council in his role as South African representative, maintaining that the resolution is  “not balanced and does not fully represent the perspective of African Union member states.” South Africa has long supported the  Polisario Front narrative as well its calls for an independent state, so veering off the path of neutrality and trust in the United Nation’s capacity as the only body able to lead the negotiations to a mutually acceptable solution. Matjila criticized the resolution’s language, suggesting that it favors of Morocco’s position and “undermines the principle of self-determination.” The South African diplomat voiced his frustration with the decision of the Council not to impose a mechanism to monitor human rights in Western Sahara and Tindouf, a move that South Africa strongly advocated for.

Rabat – The National Council for Human Rights (CNDH) has prepared a memorandum calling for a reform of the Moroccan penal code. With a focus on personal freedoms, the council are calling for the decriminalization of sex outside marriage. Currently the penal code punishes sex outside of wedlock with imprisonment for one month to one year. CNDH will present their document to the House of Representatives today, October 31, at 4 pm. According to the organization, the ongoing debate about individual freedoms and “the gravity of physical and verbal abuse that happen in both public and private spaces” have pushed the council to request changes to the penal code. The council affirms that their plea aims to achieve “a penal code that protects freedoms and takes into account the principles of legitimacy, necessity, and proportionality.” The memorandum addresses several chapters of the penal code; the non-prescription of acts of torture, the repression of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, the fight against forced disappearances, and the criminalization of incitement to violence, hate and discrimination. CNDH also announced their plans to hold future meetings with the concerned parties. The council expects the parliament to play its role in strengthening democracy. The members of parliament “are called today more than ever to be in line with the changes that Morocco knows and to support the building of a state of law where the law responds to the general will,” according to the organization. The debate over individual freedoms and a reform of Morocco’s penal code came into the spotlight after the arrest of journalist Hajar Raissouni. Police arrested Raissouni for illegal abortion, along with her fiance and medical team. Following the arrest a number of activists and organizations, including CNDH, took part in public protests. The protests criticized the Moroccan penal code and the criminalization of abortion and sex outside of wedlock. They also called for the journalists’ freedom. One month after Raissouni’s arrest, and after the numerous demonstrations, King Mohammed VI granted the journalist, and all defendants in the case, a royal pardon.

Washington DC – When local editorialists tackle social injustices or denounce corruption and the conduct of the ruling elite, authorities usually move in to either  “adopt” or bully the journalist. These tactics eventually silenced critics and those who questioned government policies. The latest independent editorialist to leave the media scene in Morocco is Aicha Akalay who was publishing director of TelQuel magazine until recently.  Ms. Akalay’s writings were widely circulated in the halls of power in Rabat and extensively read by national and international observers following political and social developments in the North African nation. Her departure is a big hit to efforts to preserve a pluralistic and editorially independent press in the Kingdom. Ms. Akalay’s exit form one of the most prestigious magazines in the country to work, allegedly, for a subsidiary of the OCP (the previously state-owned phosphate mining company and the kingdom’s economic engine) is a tough loss to journalistic integrity and media independence in Morocco. Aicha has superb analytical and writing skills that have been invaluable to a Moroccan media discourse poor in quality reporters, analysts and editorialists. Her departure would leave the Moroccan press corps with fewer independent and professional journalists. Ms. Akalay’s writings enriches the public debate on a wide range of social and political issues and more than often set the agenda for change. Her editorials held powerful governmental officials accountable and exposed political deficiencies and economic inadequacies. In fact,  her last article written for the prestigious and influential French daily Le Monde in which she criticized the slow progress of social and political reforms in Morocco is a perfect illustration of her sharp pen. In light of this professional move, some media observers are raising ethical questions about the role of Moroccan semi-governmental entities and individual financiers in “snatching” skilled professional journalists from publications with high editorial standards to work for their subsidiaries.  Furthermore, Ms. Akalay is neither the first nor the only example of such an arrangement. The case of Ali Amar, who was the most famous Moroccan journalist critic until he returned to Casablanca and started his online subscription-based news outlet Le desk,  is another example of such exercise. When Le Desk starts its journalistic journey as an independent news portal, many observers expected to read on the new site Amar’s in-depth study, invaluable research and harsh reporting of the same quality as his past work. However, early financial difficulty pushed the Pulse Media group that owns the site to seek outside financiers, which opened the door to the Moroccan multi-millionaire Ali Belhaj to invest in the venture. Unfortunately,  Le Desk that Ali Amar presented in 2015  as a medium prepared to tackle on investigative journalism in Morocco turned out to be just another online news site with meek editorials and docile reporting. It was extremely difficult for Mr. Amar to keep his site financially sustainable, which in turn compromised his editorial independence from the government, the private sector, and other special interests. It is true that no one forced either Akalay or Amar to leave previous positions. Indeed, it was a personal decision for both of them to move to a ‘greener pastures”. Nevertheless, the impact and the impression left in the aftermath of such departures impact the political and journalistic landscapes in Morocco. The actions to inject money and involve semi-official organisms to “steal”  capable troublesome journalist amount to a gutting of the few Moroccan magazines that are left with sharp and honest editorialists. It is a ruse to clamp down on dissent, and an obstacle to the development of a free media, governance reform and healthy democratic debate. Some in Morocco fear investigative journalism because it is a medium that plays a vanguard role in promoting accountability and fighting corruption.  Currently, outlets sympathetic to the government appear to have a near-monopoly on the news landscape in the Kingdom. Despite promises form the current government to create a favorable environment for media outlets of all political colors to thrive, several laws and regulations that restrict the growth of the press remain on the books making it hard for independent media to succeed. This latest trend will only make a bad situation worse.

Rabat – UNESCO has invited 66 cities to join its Creative Cities Network. The list included the Moroccan city of Essaouira, western Morocco, in the music category. UNESCO announced the list today, October 31, as part of the World Cities’ Day celebration. The Creative Cities Network is an organization bringing together cities from all over the world that base their development on creativity. The fields taken into consideration are music, crafts, and folk art. UNESCO also considers design, cinema, literature, digital arts, and gastronomy. The network has a total number of 246 member cities. UNESCO’s creative cities devote the center of their development strategies to culture. They also commit to sharing their best artistic and cultural practices. “All over the world, these cities, each in its way, make culture the pillar, not an accessory, of their strategy,” said UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay, in a press release from the UN-affiliated organization. “This favors political and social innovation and is particularly important for the young generations,” Azoulay added. UNESCO created the Creative Cities Network in 2004. Every year, the organization nominates new cities to join the network. In 2017, the city of Tetouan, northern Morocco, joined the network in the crafts and folk art category. Essaouira is one of the most highly frequented touristic cities in Morocco. It is located on Morocco’s Atlantic coast. The cities’ 18th-century seafront ramparts protect the medina, with old cannons lining the walls. Essaouira has beautiful ocean views, along with strong winds, making its beach a popular destination for surfers. The city is most well-known for its music festivals. The Gnaoua Festival and the Atlantic Andalusia Festival attract thousands of visitors to Essaouira every year.

Rabat – The opposition parties at the House of Representatives expressed doubts about the 2020 appropriation bill (PLF). The opposition parties stated that the bill is based on an outdated development model that  “contains numbers disconnected from reality.” The representatives made the comments during a parliamentary session yesterday, October 30. During the session, Mohamed Boudrar, member of the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM) estimated that the bill is a transitional project, solely “focused on controlling the budget deficit.” The bill is based on “an outdated development project,” Boudrar added. The member of parliament (MP) also recalled the results of the court of auditors’ 2018 report. The report revealed “shocking results concerning the lack of efficiency in public administrations’ management.” Boudrar also questioned the growth rate of 3.7% for Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP) predicted by the 2020 PLF. According to him, the annual growth rate wouldn’t exceed 3.2%, “in the best of cases.” Istiqlal Party representative Noureddine Moudiane also said that “the impact of the different budgets is in decline.” “The executives should adopt proactive programmes and emergency measures to improve the social situation and to have a positive impact on citizens’ lives,” he added. Moudiane called for holding Moroccan officials accountable for their decisions. It is necessary to take the court of auditors report into consideration to avoid “superficial economic and social solutions,” and for the 2020 PLF to not be a “simple reproduction of previous ones,” according to the MP. Aicha Lablak, representative of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS), insisted on the importance of a reform in the fiscal system to make it more equitable and avoid “any forms of legal tax evasion.” Lablak called for the elaboration of a strategy to make the national economy more dynamic. She also called for the adoption of annual action plans to reach results in the short term. The Moroccan government adopted the 2020 PLF on October 17. The bill targets a growth rate of 3.7% for the Moroccan GDP in 2020. Some of the major changes in this year’s bill were a slight increase of health and education budgets. The budgets for these crucial sectors increased by 30% compared to the 2019 bill.

Rabat – On Monday October 28, it was exactly three years since fishmonger Mohcine Fikri tragically died in a trash compactor in Al Hoceima, after trying to retrieve merchandise that had been confiscated by Moroccan police.  Last weekend, a protest took place in Paris in memory of Fikri, but also to draw attention to the situation in the Rif. Hundreds of protestors gathered to express their solidarity with the Hirak movement. The movement was sparked by Fikri’s death and took off under the leadership of Nasser Zefzafi, currently serving a 20 year prison sentence in Morocco.   Echoes of a Manifesto Working as an entrepreneur in Belgium, Nourdine Aouragh’s roots can be traced back to Ait Touzine, one of the largest tribes living between Nador and Al Hoceima. He told Morocco World News: “I came this weekend to express my solidarity with the Hirak movement and to pay my respects to the legacy of Fikri. I actually have a strong connection with the region, since my grandfather is from the Rif himself” But the protest in Paris did not only attract supporters such as Nourdine, but also more outspoken intellectuals. As a Dutch-Moroccan, Laila Ezzeroili is one of the signatories of the recently signed manifesto, calling for the right to give up the Moroccan nationality.  As one of the attendees of the protest, Ezzeroili witnessed how Moroccans of varying backgrounds gathered this weekend. “The solidarity with the Hirak movement was expressed by many protestors among the Moroccan diaspora. The flags of France, the United Kingdom, Norway, Spain, Catalonia and even a rainbow flag weaved into the Amazigh flag, were all present at the protest.” “The Hirak movement has created a newfound sense of citizenhood among Moroccans who are living in Europe. And with that a profound sense of gratitude for the freedom and democratic rights you can exercise,” Ezzeroili explained to MWN.  In addition to expressing solidarity, Ezzeroili claims Moroccans in Europe echoed the spirit of the manifesto. “Moroccans in Europe express they want to be free from the long arm of Rabat too.”  Not unlike Nourdine, Ezzeroili has an emotional connection with the Rif too. “I actually have family living in the Rif who are putting up with disastrous living conditions. The only difference there is between myself and my cousins, is that they were not born in Europe. That is how I can relate to them and stay connected with the people who are living in the Rif.” “I have no need for or interest in a relationship with the Moroccan state. However, the Moroccan nationality binds me to the state, not to the people,” Ezzeroili concluded. Outrage and condemnation  The protest in Paris led to widespread outrage and condemnation when protesters burned a Moroccan flag. The Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad (CCME) strongly condemned the action on Sunday by stating, “it was a serious violation of one of the symbols on national sovereignty and the dignity of Moroccans.”  As Secretary-General of the CCME, Abdellah Boussouf added, “The desecration of the national flag is a criminal act that has nothing to do with freedom of expression.” Politicians did not only take their outrage to social media, but collectively responded to the action by singing the national anthem in parliament on Monday. Salah El-Ouadie, as president of the political movement ‘Damir’ and member of the Civil Initiative for the Rif, stated that these people “burned their own skin with this flag,” as reported by media outlet Hespress.com. Not only did politicians express their outrage, but within academic circles professionals condemned the action as well. Political Scientist Omar Cherkaoui stated the action was “neither heroism nor victory. It is the culmination of futility and carelessness,” Barlamene reported on Monday.  And various organisations at home and abroad condemned the action as well. President of l’Association Grand Rif des Droits de l’homme, Said Chramti, took his anger to social media by releasing a video of himself. Chramti stated in the video that, ”we strongly condemn this action, carried out by a small group of separatists who burned and trampled the flag of Morocco on French soil,” as reported by media outlet HuffPost Maghreb.  The Brussels based organisation ‘MarBel’ denounced the action in Paris and stated that the action was “despicable and cowardly.” In addition, the French organisation l’Association des tribus sahraouies marocaines en Europe (ATSME) decried the action as “hideous”, according to Atlasinfo.fr.  Working as a freelance journalist, Yassin Akouh points out the action is not necessarily new however. “Back in 2015 the boxer Zakaria Moumni tore his Moroccan passport on French television, while talking about his book ‘L’Homme qui voulait parler au roi’ [The man who would like to speak to the king],” he explained to MWN. “And last year we saw how a group of young students protested the sudden decision of the Moroccan government to maintain Day Light Saving Time (DST) by trampling on the Moroccan flag,” Akouh concluded. Last year, Rabat was the stage for the Hirak march, after the controversial sentencing of 54 Hirak activists. In Paris too the protestors, hoped to draw more international attention to the living conditions in the Rif, reiterated their demands for the release of the condemned prisoners and for the Moroccan government to resolve the complex situation in the region.

Rabat – Ivanka Trump, daughter, and advisor to US President Donald Trump, will visit Morocco in November, a source familiar with the preparation of the visit told Morocco World News. During her visit, the advisor to the US President will promote the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, seeking to empower women. The visit comes just a few months after Ivanka published a post on her social media, extolling Morocco’s efforts to ensure equality between women and men in terms of inheritance law. In August, the US advisor praised the “Moroccan government for this important step towards the adoption of inheritance law amendments, and look forward to supporting their full implementation.” The message came weeks after the House of Representatives unanimously adopted three bills relation to communal agricultural land (sulaliyat). The bills take into account King Mohammed VI’s instructions, calling on the government to take measures to meet the demands of rights holders. The bills also concern the aspirations of rights holders, including women also known as sullaliat. The sullaliat women have been demanding for equality for rights for more than 10 years. Ivanka Trump’s visit  also comes after her husband Jared Kushner made two official visits to Morocco In May, Kushner met with King Mohammed VI and high ranking Moroccan officials. The meetings touched upon means to strengthen the bilateral partnership between Rabat and Washington and allowed for an exchange of views on regional issues. In recent months, exchanges of visits between US officials and their Moroccan counterparts have intensified, reflecting the commitment towards more cooperation between the two countries. Earlier this month, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita met with both US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kushner during the US-Morocco strategic dialogue. Several delegations from the US also arrived in Morocco as part of the countries’ determination to boost cooperation.

Rabat – The Criminal Chamber at Salé’s Court of Appeal upheld on Wednesday, October 31, the death sentence for the three main defendants in the Imlil murder case.  The court of the first instance sentenced the three men to death for the murder of two Scandinavian tourists in the town of Imlil (El Haouz Province) on July 18, 2019. Despite calls from the defense for psychiatric tests, the Court upheld the death sentences on Rachid Afatti, Younes Ouziad, and Abdessamad Eljoud.  The court additionally sentenced  Abderrahmane Khiyali’s life imprisonment pronounced in the first instance to the death sentence. The Court also upheld the prison terms ranging from 5 to 30 years for the other defendants and increased Abdesslam Idrissi’s jail term from 15 to 20 years. The case started in December 2018, when Moroccan police found the bodies of two Scandinavian women, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland, in Imlil, near Mount Toubkal. The charges against the defendants include the creation of a criminal organization, the preparation, and undertaking of terrorist acts, premeditated murder, possession of firearms, attempting to make illegal explosives, and threats to national security. The Moroccan police arrested 24 individuals implicated in the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists in Imlil in December 2018.

Rabat – A joint venture between the two firms would make them the 4th largest automaker in terms of sales behind Volkswagen, Renault-Nissan, and Toyota. International media sources reported the news on Wednesday, October 30. In the wake of the announcement, FCA shares in Milan increased to over 9% higher in morning trading. Meanwhile, PSA shares climbed more than 6% in Paris. If the joint-venture comes to light, the chairman of the board of directors of PSA, Carlos Tavares, would become managing director of the new entity. PSA-FCA board of directors would be chaired by FCA boss John Elkann, heir to the Agnelli dynasty. In 2018, PSA sold a total of 3.9 million vehicles, reaching a turnover of €74 billion. Fiat-Chrysler, on the other hand, sold 4.8 million vehicles for €110 billion. Commenting on the possible joint-venture, Patrick Michel, head of the FO trade union at PSA said that there are advantages to be gained from the joint-venture. “I remain dubious—but I do see a number of advantages … this would give PSA greater heft vis-a-vis giants such as Toyota or Volkswagen, and it would give Fiat access to technology allowing it to respect future CO2 emission limits,” said Michel. Between them, the automobile giants employ 400,000 people globally and would have a wide range of car brands being manufactured under one roof, including Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, and Vauxhall. Although discussions may be translated into actions, speculation is rife that the ongoing talks may be affected by political pressure from PSA shareholders, including the French government. The negotiations come four months after FCA attempted to unite with Renault, also part-owned by the French government. Discussions were affected by the French state. Analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said on Wednesday that political pressure from Paris could be an obstacle, given that the French government holds an approximately 12% stake in PSA. “It is hard not to see that this attempt by Fiat might well go the same way as the failed Renault attempt earlier this year,” wrote Hewson. “Business and government always make uncomfortable bedfellows.” Through the PSA-FCA merger, Peugeot-Citroen would consolidate its position in the US market and the same for FCA in the European market. FCA aims to jump into the electric car market and the production of self-driving cars and sees PSA’s expertise on the development of technologies as an advantage in the field.

Rabat – The United Nations Security Council has adopted Resolution  2494 renewing the mandate of UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, MINURSO, for one  year. The new resolution has not brought any major changes aside from lengthening the MINURSO mandate to twelve months as opposed to a six month mission.  Since April 2018, the council extended the mandate for only for six months at a time. Both Russia and South Africa abstained from the on the adoption of the new resolution.  Some members of the Security Council, including South Africa , argued that a shorter mandate would put pressure on the involved parties, Morocco, Algeria, the Polisario Front, and Mauritania, to enter into negotiations and assist the UN-led political process.  
 The Security Council, through its new resolution welcomes the momentum of both MINURSO and the United Nations Secretary General’s efforts to preserve peace in the region. Resolution 2494 repeats the same language as its recent resolutions on Western Sahara, calling on all parties to work with the UN to help find a mutual, realistic, pragmatic, and enduring political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. The text emphasized the need to  reach a practical political solution, based on compromise, suggesting that the UN will not accept any proposal that is against an agreed upon and consensual solution for the conflict. The language of the resolution is in line with Morocco’s position, who has been expressing determination to fully adhere to the UN-led political solution to find a mutually acceptable solution for the conflict The Security Council “welcomes” Morocco’s “serious and credible” efforts to reach a mutually agreed solution.  The text also refers to Algeria and Mauritania as parties to the conflict, echoing Morocco’s  calls that no solution can be reached without the involvement of Algeria and Mauritania as main parties. The new resolution mentions Algeria five times, three times in the preamble and twice  in operative paragraphs. The text also calls upon Morocco, Polisario, Algeria, and Mauritania to fully cooperate with each other to build trust and to strengthen their involvement in the political process to achieve progress.  It also reiterated that finding a political solution to the conflict requires strong commitment from all parties as a solution would contribute to creating stability and more security in the region. In outlining MINRUSO’s mission, the UN emphasizes “the importance of a renewed commitment by the parties to advancing the political process in preparation for further negotiations.” The Security Council also stressed that “realism  and spirit of compromise by the parties are essential to achieve progress in negotiations, and encourages the neighboring countries to make important, active contributions to this process.”
 The resolution stipulates that the Security Council’s ultimate goal and role in the process is to assist the United Nations and the parties to the conflict in reaching a long-lasting and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict.  By choosing not to institute a mechanism to monitor human rights in Western Sahara and Tindouf camps, the Council is implicitly reiterating their focus on finding a compromise-based solution through open dialogue between all parties.
 The resolution also calls upon all parties to cooperate with MINURSO, welcoming “,steps and initiatives taken by Morocco, and the role played by the National Council on Human Rights Commissions operating in Dakhla and Laayoune, and Morocco’s interaction with Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council.” Open defiance of MINRUSO The extension of the MINRUSO mandate comes just weeks after UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres released his annual report to the Security Council. In the report, Guterres underlined the obstacles facing MINURSO in the region, among them the Polisario Front’s refusal to adhere to MINURSO requests. Citing the Polisario’s “failure to comply with MINURSO,” Guterres outlines several violations by the Polisario east of the berm, or security wall.  Among other building violations, the Secretary General made particular mention of; “A logistics hub consisting of 10 new buildings located inside the restricted area near Bir Lahlou, which had already been declared a violation in 2017 and included in the list of long-standing violations in 2018, remained operational.” The report also cited the Polisario’s refusal to remove a security detachment in Tifariti. Such acts of open defiance are a serious threat to progress in the UN-led peace process. Further violations included; “The military post of Frente Polisario at ‘waypoint 6 … in the restricted area 16.6 east of Guerguerat, consisting of two tents, two to three vehicles and between two to six personnel  was again declared a violation in April, although it had been moved out of the buffer strip, it remained in the restricted area.” On top of the Polisario’s open defiance of the UN peacekeeping mission, Guterres warned that the seperatist group’s lack of communication with MINRUSO also serves as an obstacle to progress.  According to the report, the Polisario’s move to limit communication “impedes good communication and effective working relationships with the parties, and handicaps MINURSO in the implementation of its mandate.”  Guterres also expressed hopes in his report that all involved parties would engage in dialogue in “good faith” and continue to cooperate with the UN-led process. The Secretary General reported that he sees progress in the journey towards a solution to the conflict, adding that he sees a willingness to “overcome constraints” from the Moroccan side.  UN emissary Today’s vote took place despite the absence of a UN Personal Envoy to the UNSG after the resignation of the former emissary Horst Kohler in May. All parties to the conflict, including Morocco regretted the resignation of Kohler, who brought a glimmer of hope to the conflict.  In a groundbreaking move, Kohler managed to convene the parties to the conflict  ( Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and Polisario), at the same roundable twice in December 2018 and March 2019 in two separate roundtables in Geneva. The United Nations Secretary General, Guterres also expressed his regret at Kohler’s resignation. The Security Council also recalls MINRUSO’s role in “supporting the incoming envoy.”

Rabat – The Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research has announced that the first dialogue session with the syndicates representing contractual teachers will take place on Friday, November 1. The ministry made the announcement via a press release yesterday, October 29.

Demonstrators also called for the abolishment of fixed-term contracts, and the end of “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers. In 2016, the Moroccan government decided to start hiring teachers under annually renewable contacts.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with British oil and gas firm Sound Energy Limited on Tuesday, October 29. The MoU is related to the sale of natural gas from the Tendrara concession in Eastern Morocco, says a statement from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Environment. Sound Energy has a 25-year-exploitation-term in Tendrara, in Morocco’s Figuig Province. The company has been drilling for natural gas since September 6, 2018. Through the agreement, the two entities discussed the main conditions of Sound Energy’s contract for the sale of natural gas to ONEE for its power plants. The two parties are still negotiating a detailed gas sales agreement, but Sound Energy has said that there is already a binding agreement in place and that the ongoing talks will incorporate the MOU. Their aim is to reach a final agreement by the end of the year. “The agreement covers the first 0.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) per annum – approximately 48.4 million cubic feet per day (cf/d) – from Tendrara with payment for any production above this to be part of the final gas sales agreement,” said Sound Energy in a statement. Sound will also get a fixed price for a minimum annual volume of 0.3 bcm for each year (approximately 29 million standard cubic feet per day {MMscf/d}). In the first year, Sound Energy is projecting gross revenues of $84 million with the fixed price element designed to give more certainty when it comes to arranging the funding needed for the hook-up infrastructure. “Under the MOU the parties have agreed to use their reasonable endeavors to continue negotiations with a view to entering into a binding GSA, incorporating the key terms of the MOU and construed under Moroccan law, prior to the end of the calendar year 2019,” Sound Energy added. The MOU stipulates a 10-year initial term commencing on the date of signature of GSA, and automatically renewable for further periods of five years thereafter, unless terminated by one of the parties with one year’s notice.   The communiqué noted that ONEE is the reference operator in the field of planning and development of electricity. ONEE aims to diversify the sources of electricity production as part of the national electricity mix, making it possible to increase the integration capacity of renewable energy. On August 17, 2018, Sound Energy and the Head of Government signed the Tendrara operating concession.

Rabat – CTM, a popular transportation company in Morocco, has denied reports of a recent move by the company to prevent “undocumented Africans” from travelling onboard its buses to a number of destinations across Morocco. “Following instructions from authorities+, it is strictly forbidden to sell CTM tickets to Africans who have no Moroccan residency permit,” read a statement that made the rounds yesterday on social media.  The statement, allegedly issued by CTM, appeared to put all “Africans” living in Morocco in the same prejudiced basket of Europe-hungry migrants.  The alleged CTM statement emphatically noted that customer service agents had been told to prevent “this category of travelers,” referring to “Africans,” from boarding buses traveling to Northern and Southern Morocco, two regions known for their proximity to Europe. In an “official” statement on its Facebook, however, CTM strongly denied having anything to do with the reported ban on sub-Saharan travelers. “CTM denies these facts and declares that the notice is not a CTM document, nor did we issue any note or statement of that type,” the company said of the controversial note. In North Africa, where there is a longstanding legacy of anti-Black racism, Morocco has long been perceived as a much friendlier and welcoming place for sub-Saharans.  That perception especially increased with Morocco’s King Mohammed VI making it plain time and again that Morocco is “proud” of its African roots. While speaking on the occasion of Morocco’s return to the African Union in January 2017, for example, the Moroccan monarch referred to Africa as “home.”  Morocco and pan-Africanism For a certain period of time, Morocco’s Africa-embracing move was not only rhetorical, as many sub-Saharans, including some undocumented migrants actually seeking to reach Europe, lauded Moroccan hospitality.  “Moroccans are better racists,” one undocumented migrant told MWN last year. The migrant, who was comparing his “unlivable” life in Algeria to his half-decent treatment in Morocco, was evidently making the point that Morocco’s reputation as an exception in North Africa was true to some extent. But things have gotten a bit blurrier in the past months, with reports of police crackdown on sub-Saharans—documented or not—in cities like Tangier and Tetouan. More still, Morocco’s recent move to impose e-Visas on Malian, Guinean, and Congolese travelers to Morocco, has not been well received by nationals of those three countries, who until then did not need a visa to travel to Morocco. A number of rights advocacy groups have since lambasted the country for a perceived change of attitudes towards undocumented sub-Saharan migrants. The country has forcibly maintained its “pan-Africanist” and human-oriented migration policy, notably saying that it is not the “EU’s policeman.”  But questions persist. Are Moroccans really different from other North African countries in how they treat ‘black Africans’? Is the country’s professed pan-Africanism slightly overblown by both Moroccan and some sub-Saharan political leaders, in glaring disregard for growing reports of sub-Saharan mistreatment?  As if to answer the resurging question about a well-established but subtle Moroccan racism, CTM’s denial of its alleged racist notice suggested that, as far as the company is concerned, color and race have no bearing on its policies. The statement is emphatic on the company’s “ethics” of treating all “our customers” with respect. “We insist that our values and ethics go against any type of discrimination. For the 100 years of our existence, our travelers, regardless of their origins, have always been at the center of our attention.” CTM did not immediately respond to MWN’s request for comments.

Rabat – The third quarterly Morocco Job Market Survey of 2019 reports optimism among Moroccans regarding the current and future state of the job market. The report is based on the Michael Page Job Confidence Index, a quarterly barometer that measures the perception of candidates about their job situation and the labor market.  The data is for the index is gleaned from voluntary Moroccan candidates who applied for a job or submitted their resume to Michael Page Morocco, which has an office in Casablanca. Of the 338 candidates, 96% are Moroccans while the remainder are expats living in Morocco.  The Casablanca office sources the best talent from local, regional, or international markets for mid to senior level management positions. The positions are all for organizations based in Morocco. A pattern of optimism According to the survey, 74% of the participants hold managerial or director level positions.  Meanwhile, 56% of respondents are optimistic about the current job market situation in Morocco, and 70% believe it will improve in the next six months.  Michael Page reports that 80% of respondents predict that they will develop their skills in the next 12 months, and 74% expect a promotion.  Two-thirds of respondents are confident that they can find a new job in less than three months. 40%, however, have been looking for a job for six months already.  Salary is the main factor in motivating people to look for a new job, according to the survey. People tend to seek out new jobs in their current industry or sector.  Other key aspects of job satisfaction are related to participants’ level of responsibility and job security.  Those looking for jobs often consult recruitment firms, professional networking platforms, personal networks, job boards, and company career websites.  A drop in the bucket Michael Page is one of the world’s leading professional recruitment agencies. The agency conducts operations in the Americas, UK, Continental Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. The company specializes in placing candidates in permanent, contractual, temporary, and interim positions with clients around the world.  The Michael Page office in Casablanca collects data about perceptions of Morocco’s job market and publishes the results every fiscal quarter.  The quarterly job market survey does not claim to represent the perceptions of the majority of Moroccans. The Michael Page Job Confidence Index accounts for only a small sample of 326 Moroccans and 12 expats, most of whom hold managerial, executive, or directorial positions.  Unemployment persists throughout Morocco and the surrounding region and has been stagnant since 2014.  In July 2019, Morocco’s High Commission for Planning reported a 10% unemployment rate in the first fiscal quarter of 2019.

Rabat – The complicated procedure Moroccans face to obtain the visa Schengen has led to the signing of an international petition, reported Arabic speaking newspaper Al Massae on October 29.  Signatories Sent the petition to the Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs. Nacer Bourita, France’s ambassador to Morocco Helene Le Gal, and the Spanish ambassador to Morocco, Ricardo Diez Rodriguez, demanding an immediate intervention to end the frustrating situation. According to the petition, Moroccans applying for Schengen zone visas are often forced to wait over three months to retrieve their passports. The petition also complains about centers repeatedly postponing appointments and the amount of paperwork involved in the applications. All applicants, from, university professors, executives, or journalists, to professional sportsmen, or officials experience the same issues while trying to obtain a visa. Through the petition, the signatories are asking Bourita and the two ambassadors to intervene in order to speed up the visa issuance procedure and put an end to the delays and cancellations.  Signatories are also unhappy with waiting in long queues in front of consulates and service providers without being able to file the applications.  The malfunctioning system is particularly problematic for Moroccans traveling for health, education, or business purposes.  Former Moroccan secretary of state Mounia Boucetta has already responded to questions about the problem in parliament. Boucetta blamed Moroccan applicants for the issues, saying that that the high flow of people submitting applications and their lack of respect for security measures is the root of the problem.

Rabat – Moroccan police aborted an irregular migration attempt on Tuesday, October 30. The operation led to the arrest of 23 would-be migrants on the shore of the Bouregreg river in Rabat. The arrest was in collaboration with the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The migrants were all of Moroccan nationality, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). Police arrested two suspects on suspicion of organizing the migration attempt. Five other suspects are believed to have acted as intermediaries with migrants. During the operation, police seized a zodiac, three cars, a scooter, and a large knife.  Security services suspected that the migrants used the equipment for human trafficking. The DGSN staff put the suspects in custody for further investigation. Morocco has been intensifying its efforts to combat irregular migration in recent years, with several countries applauding its approach. Earlier in October,  the European Commission issued a report, indicating that Morocco’s efforts helped reduce migrant arrivals in Spain by half. The mission said that Morocco’s approach prevented thousands of departures by land and the rescue of dozens of other migrants “who were returned to Moroccan territory”. Morocco’s government has said that security services aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019.

Rabat – Christopher Ross, the US diplomat and former UN envoy for Western Sahara, has strongly denied any links with the Polisario Front. In the eight years Ross held the envoy position, he repeatedly stirred controversies in Morocco for appearing to lobby for separatism in Western Sahara.  Instead, the American diplomat says he was a “strictly neutral mediator” who wanted to pave the way for “genuine negotiations,” only failing to do so because neither Morocco nor the separatist front would relent on their legitimacy claims over the disputed territory. In an emailed statement to Morocco World News following reports that he and a group of students from Princeton University are visiting the Tindouf camps and set to meet with Polisario leader Brahim Ghali, Ross said the reports “misrepresented” the context and purpose of the visit. ‘I am NOT a lobbyist’ Citing pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara, which reported on the visit as an implicit validation of Polisario claims, MWN’s piece suggested that the news—especially the meeting with the Polisario leader and other senior separatist officials—was proof of Ross’s longtime affinity for Algeria and Polisario.  Ross rejected that reading, however, explaining that his only role during the visit was to use his Algerian connections—being well-connected in Algeria after serving there as US ambassador—to facilitate the research trip of a group of Princeton graduate students studying Western Sahara. “I am NOT a lobbyist, and I had nothing to do with the organization of the visit. A class of graduate students from Princeton University is studying western Sahara as a case study of a frozen conflict,” he explained.  “Half of the group is visiting Algeria and the Sahrawi refugee camps, and the other half is visiting Rabat and Laayoune. Princeton University asked me to accompany the group going to Algeria to facilitate introductions and ensure their wellbeing. The students managed their own agenda and their own meetings.  I was present but was not an active participant.” While serving as the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara between 2009-2017, Ross found himself at odds with Morocco, which consistently perceived him as a pro-Polisario voice, and therefore unreliable broker for the Western Sahara conflict.  In 2013, the suspicion gained particular traction in Rabat and in Morocco-friendly circles at the UN after a US-drafted MINURSO resolution included a human rights monitoring clause in the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara.  Morocco quickly responded, seeing the move as implicitly legitimating one prevailing separatist claim that the Moroccan regime is the main culprit of human rights violations in the disputed regions. Rabat expressed its concerns with the Security Council, urging the UN body to steer clear of a biased framing in its reports and resolutions on the conflict. A ‘strictly neutral mediator’ With Ross serving at the time as UN envoy, therefore the international community’s main contact point in Western Sahara, the logical conclusion for Rabat was that the US-drafted document was essentially engineered by Ross. That episode, coupled with the existing perception in Rabat that Ross was more a Polisario sympathizer than a reliable mediator, led Rabat to subsequently declare Ross persona non grata.  In Ross’s telling, however, the Moroccan government was unnecessarily hard on him.  One point stands out in Ross’s rather muscular denial of his alleged association with Polisario in the Western Sahara standstill: He wants his legacy as UN envoy for Western Sahara to be cleared from the “pro-Polisario lobbyist” label.   “Morocco’s problem with me was NOT that I was allegedly pro-Algerian or pro-Polisario, despite what its government claims.  It was that I was not pro-Moroccan.  And for Moroccans, if you’re not with them, you must be against them. This was simply not true.” Most importantly still, Ross told MWN that he had nothing remotely to do with the inclusion of the human rights monitoring clause in the MINURSO mandate.  “The initiative to add human rights to the MINURSO mandate in 2013 was introduced by a senior US official and came as a complete surprise to me.  I was not consulted or forewarned,” he wrote. The past months have been marked by a resurgence of hope in the UN-led political process in Western Sahara. In just two years, Horst Kohler, the UN envoy who was appointed after Ross resigned in 2017, is largely believed to have revitalized the UN mediation in Western Sahara.  Kohler resigned in May of this year citing health reasons. Months after his resignation, however, UN diplomats continue to invoke his legacy, which they insist constitutes a “new momentum” after decades of failed attempts to bring all the conflicting parties to the same table While Kohler’s unprecedented success may implicitly vindicate Rabat’s point that, after all, Ross’s partiality may have prevented him from being as effective as Kohler, the American is adamant that he did deploy his best efforts to bring the parties to a common ground. The only reason he failed to do that, he emphasized, was the conflicting parties’ “rigid” positions on what they believe is the way out of the decades-long stalemate.  “As a mediator, I was strictly neutral. I did not to lobby for autonomy or for a referendum.  I lobbied for genuine negotiations. Because of the rigidity of both parties, these never occurred — and have not occurred to this day.”

Rabat – Members of the UN Security Council will convene today, October 30, to vote on a new resolution that extends the mandate of the UN peacekeeping operation, known as MINURSO, in Western Sahara. The Security Council will extend the MINURSO mandate for 12 months instead of six months, a source close to the negotiations told Morocco World News. The current six-month mandate in the region is set to expire tomorrow, October 31. The vote comes six months after the council adopted Resolution 2468. Since April 2018 the council has renewed the mandate three times for six month periods.  The resolution, according to MWN’s source, will also disregard Polisario’s attempts to extend the mandate of MINURSO to human rights monitoring in the region. The decision of the council crowns Morocco’s efforts to abort any maneuvers from Polisario, seeking to undermine Morocco’s position. The US, in its capacity as a penholder, shared the draft resolution to the Group of Friends of Western Sahara on October 23. The group includes five members: France, Russia, Spain, the UK, and the US. Aside from the year-long extension to MINURSO’s mandate, the resolution includes no significant changes. Extending the mission The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, Morocco, and some members of the Group of Friends, including France, have been advocating for an increase from the six month mandate to a one year mission. The US, however, raised concerns about the huge budgets being allocated to UN peacekeeping missions that, according to the Trump administration, have made no tangible progress.  John Bolton, who US President Donald Trump recently fired as a national security advisor, strongly advocated for an end to “money-wasting” peacekeeping missions, targeting MINURSO in particular. For Bolton, the mission failed to carry out its mission: a referendum. The former senior US official also pushed the Trump administration to support shortening the mandate of MINURSO, “frustrated” that the mission had not found a solution to the 44 year-long conflict. Members of the Security Council also expressed some concerns over developments in the Tindouf camps. Lack of freedom of expression and lack of rights of assembly were among the issues raised. Another serious matter for the Security Council was the lack of a personal envoy in the wake of UN Personal Envoy Horst Kohler’s resignation. A glimmer of hope Kohler was key to the progress achieved in the region. The former envoy managed to convene all parties to the conflict, including Morocco, Algeria, the Polisario and Mauritania, to two roundtables in December 2018 and March of this year. His resignation in May prompted concerns among the parties who feared it would lead to stagnation in negotiations. Some members of the council, who received the draft resolution on October 24, cited the lack of an emissary as well as the decision to extend the mandate for 12 months as causes for concern. They suggested that a longer mandate would ease pressure on parties to work towards a political solution to the conflict. The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, along with Kohler, believes that there is still a glimmer of hope, despite the reluctance of both the Polisario Front and its supporter Algeria to enter into negotiations. The Algerian-backed separatist group has rejected Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, a proposal submitted to the Security Council in 2007 as a political solution to the conflict, and refuses to consider any option other than “complete independence.” Morocco’s proposal takes into account the demands of Sahrawis, granting them the right to benefit from the natural resources of the region and full autonomy through devolved government, while making sure they remain connected to their historical motherland. The vote also comes as Morocco continues to gain international support for its position from an increasing number of nations.  The UK recently extolled Morocco’s efforts in the UN-led political process. Thomas Reilly, the UK ambassador to Morocco, spoke in favor of the Moroccan proposal of the autonomy plan, welcoming the “serious and credible efforts of Morocco to find a solution to the conflict.”  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE also expressed their support for Morocco’s position at the UN’s Fourth Committee held earlier this month.

Rabat – Morocco ranked 28th out of 140 countries in terms of safety and security for tourists. The World Economic Forum, an NGO with a membership of more than 1,000 multinational companies, published the rankings as part of their latest report about tourism competitiveness. In terms of safety and security, Morocco came ahead of a number of popular tourist destinations, such as Germany (41st), the United Kingdom (45th), and France (51st). According to the report, Finland, Iceland, and Oman are the safest countries in the world for tourists. While Morocco ranked highly in terms of safety and security, it only came 66th in the overall rankings of travel and tourism competitiveness. Spain ranked first, followed by France, Germany, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In addition to safety and security, the report took into consideration 13 other criteria, including infrastructure, business environment, and travel and tourism policies. Morocco’s ranking varied depending on the criteria. Morocco is among the top 50 countries globally for business environment (38th), prioritization of travel and tourism (26th), price competitiveness (46th), environmental sustainability (44th), and cultural resources (47th). However, Morocco ranked poorly in terms of health and hygiene (97th), human resources and labor market (99th), international openness (80th), and tourist service infrastructure (78th). In the Middle East and North Africa region, Morocco came top in terms of travel and tourism prioritization (26th globally), and in natural resources (63rd). The report also recognized Morocco as the country that has improved the most in the region in terms of business environment (38th globally) and air transport infrastructure (58th). Although Morocco has made progress as a tourism market, its global rank in tourism competitiveness did not improve. The previous report, published in 2017, put Morocco in the 65th rank overall, one rank higher than this year’s index. Tourism is one of the main pillars of the Moroccan economy. In 2018, tourism contributed MAD 70 billion to Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP). The number of tourists entering Morocco annually is also on the rise. Around 11.35 million tourists visited Morocco in 2018, a 10% increase from 2016.

Rabat – The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi became public on Sunday, October 27, 2019. But his death does not signal that the world is anywhere close to the end of violent extremism, both among secularists in the West and among Islamists in the East. On Monday, a Pentagon official confirmed that US forces buried al-Baghdadi’s body at sea after the US military raid on the Islamic State leader’s hideout in Syria. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not give further details on the burial, which is reminiscent of that of Osama Bin Laden in 2011. The leader of al-Qaeda died when an elite US military unit attacked his hideout in Pakistan. The US chose burial at sea to prevent a possible tomb from becoming a place of pilgrimage. Baghdadi’s body was treated appropriately, in accordance with military procedure and the laws of war. The chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff of the US military, General Mark Milley, said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., “The disposal of his remains has been done, is complete and was handled appropriately.” The ISIS leader, who has spread terror over an immense territory straddling Iraq and Syria, has been the subject of a hunt for several years. Washington received information about his presence in a house in the Idlib region in northwestern Syria, “where he lived steadily,” General Milley said. According to the highest ranking American military official, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph blew up an explosive belt he was carrying when he was cornered in a tunnel with three of his children. US forces then confirmed his identity through DNA. The Russian defense ministry has, however, asked for proof that the US military operation in Syria actually killed al-Baghdadi. The US announced his death with great fanfare, but Russia remains skeptical. In fact, Moscow has said it has no reliable information on an “umpteenth death” of the head of the Islamic State. A ministry spokesman pointed out contradictory details from the different parties involved. “There is no convincing evidence that the Americans carried out such an operation in an area in Syria that is not under their control,” the spokesman added. “Moreover, no airstrikes have been recorded in the Idlib area in recent days.” The ministry said that the death of the leader of the Islamic State does not matter since the terrorist militias were dismantled in Syria in early 2018. “The statement of the Americans has no influence on the situation in Syria. Any danger is not averted because of the presence in the region of many terrorists, ” pointed out the Russian ministry. French and Turkish reactions to the death followed Russia’s, without questioning, this time, the veracity of the information. In France, President Emmanuel Macron spoke of a “blow” against Daesh, “but this is only one step, the fight continues with our partners in the international coalition for the terrorist organization to be definitively defeated, which is our priority in the Levant,” he wrote on Twitter. At the same time, the French minister of the interior called for vigilance against possible acts of revenge. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed on Sunday the death of the leader of the Islamic State, which he described as a “turning point” in the war on terror. “The death of the Daesh leader marks a turning point in our joint fight against terrorism,” Erdogan tweeted. The liquidation of the historic leader of ISIS is a great success for Donald Trump, but it is not certain that it will have a decisive impact on the course of the war on terrorism. Donald Trump was able to triumph Sunday like his predecessor Barack Obama informing his compatriots of the death of Osama bin Laden under the shells of an American commando in Pakistan in 2011. He can expect a revival of popularity at a key moment in the intensification of the presidential campaign, at the end of which he expects to be re-elected next year. Such a military operation is, indeed, extremely popular. It flatters its authors, the armed forces and the American intelligence services, and, beyond them, the United States, in general, because it emphasizes the pugnacity and efficacy of the country. It appears simultaneously as a victory of justice. “Justice is done,” said Donald Trump after the raid, repeating the sentiment of Barack Obama eight years ago. Admittedly, it is not the civilized justice of the courts, but there is probably no other possible justice in an ongoing war. This kind of liquidation, also, draws its popularity from the hope that it can weaken or even defeat terrorism, but history teaches everyone that this is rarely the case. The example of Osama bin Laden is eloquent, in this respect. His organization, al-Qaeda, was cornered by the US invasion of its Afghan sanctuary, but his terrorist organization did not suffer much from this in the years that followed. It even strengthened al-Qaeda in several theaters of operations like Yemen and Syria. “France is in danger of ‘Muslimophobic McCarthism,’” stated, quite rightly, the Islamic religion expert Rachid Benzine in an op-ed in le Monde on October 9, 2019. He fears that the succession of attacks on Islam is establishing a climate of hatred towards Muslims in France, in the long run. The mosque of the city of Bayonne presented by French politicians as “peaceful” with a Muslim community fully “integrated,” was the target of a shooting on Monday, October 28, 2019, causing two serious injuries among its Muslim congregants. The assailant, Claude Sinke, was a former candidate of the National Front. The Journal du Dimanche released poll results on October 27 that reveal the mistrust of the majority of French about the compatibility of Islam with their society, as well as their concerns about the future of secularism. These are only some of the consequences of an incredible surge of hateful speech, for weeks, by some key political leaders and the media. While Muslims increasingly face discrimination, the question of banning the wearing of the veil in public space continues to occupy the public debate. Stigma and its corollary, anti-Muslim racism, have become a national French sport. The fight against communitarianism or “separatism” is the subject of a worrying consensus, while it is, in fact, a fight against an illusion. The vast majority of Muslims in France want to live their beliefs peacefully and in no way require an adaptation of French norms and customs to Islam. The principle of secularism, or “laicite,” was not conceived and developed as a weapon of war against creeds and culture, but unfortunately it is now widely used for political gain and cultural stigmatization. Of course, there is still a long way to go to reform the organization of Islam in France, especially in its representative institutions, but the French ought not to reject everything in block, as does the far right Doxa. Despite al-Baghdadi’s death, extremism is alive, both in the West and the East.

Rabat – The Moroccan national football team’s new coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, is due to  announce his list of players for the Atlas Lions’ upcoming games. The list will include 14 players from Morocco’s local football league “Botola,” according to newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. The  players on the coach’s squad list will participate in a training period, before Morocco’s games against Mauritania, on November 15, and Burundi, on November 19, for the 2021 African Cup of Nations (CAN) Qualifiers. Reports say that the majority of local players on Halilhodzic’s list are from Casablanca’s teams, Wydad and Raja. The list is said to include six players from Wydad Casablanca (Achraf Dari, Mohamed Nahiri, Yahya Jabrane, Badii Ouk, Ismail El Haddad, and Oualid El Karti), and four players from Raja Casablanca (Anas Zniti, Badr Benoun, Hamid Ahaddad, and Omar Boutayeb). The Bosnian coach’s rumored decision to summon such a large number of local players comes only a few weeks after his controversial statements criticizing them. During a press conference, Halilhodzic said that “the difference between players from Morocco’s Botola players and players from European teams is obvious.” “If we compare Achraf Hakimi, for example, to local players, it feels like Hakimi plays football while others are playing something different,” he added. A few days after the statement, Moroccan local players proved that the Bosnian’s words are not true, through an impressive win 3-0 against Algeria when the team qualified for the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN) – the CAN equivalent for teams made entirely of local players. The exceptional number of local players isn’t the only novelty in Halilhodzic’s list. According to the same source, the Atlas Lions’ coach will also call up strikers Abderrazak Hamdallah and Youssef El Arabi. Hamdalllah hasn’t played with the national squad since his controversial departure from the Atlas Lions’ training camp days before the start of CAN 2019, despite his impressive performances with his Saudi club Al-Nassr. El Arabi’s last game with the Moroccan team dates back to January 2017 for the CAN. He hasn’t been summoned to play for Morocco since then. However, the striker is having a great start to the season with his Greek club Olympiakos. El Arabi scored seven goals in 13 appearances this season. As the upcoming fixtures are the first official games for the Atlas Lions under Halilhodzic, the coach is facing a lot of pressure from the public to build a strong team, capable of being one of the best in Africa.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Industry, Trade, Green Economy and Digital, Moulay Hafid Elalamy inaugurated two aircraft-part production plants on Tuesday, October 29 in Nouaceur, Casablanca. One of the production plants is a new addition to the Moroccan study and manufacture of aeronautical tools (EFOA) – group “We are”, at Casablanca’s Aeropole. The second plant belongs to Tacaero Morocco (group Tecalemit Aerospace), located in the Midparc Casablanca Free Zone. Covering an area of ​​2,350 m², the EFOA production site required an investment of MAD 50 million. The plant will manufacture basic boiler parts and aeronautical subassemblies with the creation of 55 direct jobs. The creation of this site, strengthening the production capacity of the Moroccan aviation industry, follows the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding between the National Airport Authority (ONDA) and EFOA. The signature took place at the “Marrakech Air Show”, on October 24, 2018. Meanwhile, Tacaero Morocco is specialized in manufacturing pipe fittings and making cable ramps. Through this new site, Tecalemit Aerospace aims to better support its customers and to conquer new markets, thanks to the proximity created with players such as Boeing and Bombardier. In Morocco, Tacaero has a turnover of MAD 12.84 million in 2019 and invests MAD 14 Million in machinery. “These two plants are very specific and sophisticated in the fields of precision parts manufacturing in the aerospace, surface treatment, and paint industries, which are highly sought-after sectors around the world,” Elalamy said in the inauguration ceremonies. The Minister noted that the aeronautical sector is developing, pointing out that the sector provided 17,000 new jobs since the launch of the Industrial Acceleration Plan in 2014. Noting that the turnover (CA) export has an average annual improvement of more than 20%, Elalamy said that this sector should bolster the Moroccan industry. The Moroccan aviation industry accounts for 140 companies. The aviation sector turnover stood at MAD 17 billion, with an integration rate of 34%, and a growth of more than 20% per year.

Rabat – The 12th annual Fez Festival of Sufi Culture took place from October 19 to 26, 2019. The festival’s program rolled out to locations throughout the ancient city of Fez, Morocco’s spiritual capital.   Every year, the festival’s director Faouzi Skali approaches the event with the hopes of spreading a positive image of Islam through Sufism.  Skali sees the festival as a way to “consolidate the positioning of Morocco in the intercultural dialogue by throwing a bridge between East and West.” With the theme “Sufi culture, a spiritual humanism for our time,” Skali’s goal for this year’s festival was to create a space in which people can come to understand the significance of Sufi culture and revive the legacy of Sufism in Moroccan civilization.  “Somehow people lost this connection, this spirit of Sufism,” Skali told Morocco World News. “Fez is really a city of Sufism, but people are not always aware of that.” While Skali has also directed the popular annual Fez Festival of World Sacred Music, which began in 1994, he decided to take his work a step further and explore the legacy of Sufism in the spirit of Fez. In 2007, the Fez Festival of Sufi Culture was born.    Skali believes that Sufism is a necessary part of a much-needed spiritual revival in Morocco, and that Sufi culture has the capacity for innovation and creativity.  “I want people to share, discover, and understand what the Sufi culture could give us in our time.” The core values of Sufism: Love, unity, and inclusivity Sufism is the mystical branch of Islam. Like all Muslims, Sufis strive to emulate the Prophet Muhammad and believe that God is the source of all knowledge. Unlike certain branches of Islam and other religions, however, Sufism does not prioritize doctrine or a system of beliefs.  Rather, Sufism is a way of life in which a deeper identity is discovered and lived, according to Kabir Helminski, author of “Living Presence: A Sufi Way to Mindfulness &amp; the Essential Self.” Sufis aim to discover a deeper identity beyond that of the superficial personality. This deeper identity has superior abilities of awareness, action, creativity, and love.  Because Sufis focus on looking into one’s inner self, they are compelled to respect the dignity and integrity of others. Based on this principle, Sufis tend to be liberal and open-minded.  Sufism is perhaps the most inclusive of all religions, as Sufis believe that everyone can find God regardless of their religion, class, or ethnic identity. God is not confined to one religion or place; rather, God lives in the heart of everyone.  “If Sufism recognizes one central truth, it is the unity of being, that we are not separate from the Divine,” says Helminski, a leader of the Mevlevi Order of Sufis.  “Sufism is about realizing the current of love that runs through human life, the unity behind forms.” Open to the public, but restricted to the privileged While Sufism appeals to the masses and strives for inclusivity, the Fez Festival of Sufi Culture ultimately fell short of upholding the core values of Sufism.  The festival, while marketed as open to the public, in effect, hand picked its attendees with an exclusive access system. Only those who had enough time, money, and resources—or a personal invite—could attend the events. An all-access pass to every event of the weeklong festival was MAD 1000, a steep cost for the average Moroccan who earns between MAD 3000 and 4000 a month. Those interested in attending certain intellectual roundtables or musical performances could have purchased individual event tickets rather than the full package.  A ticket to the opening ceremony cost MAD 300, and the closing ceremony was the same price. The rest of the musical performances were free to the public.  Attending the poetic and musical recitals cost MAD 100 per performance. Entry to the roundtable discussions cost MAD 50 per conference, and a full access pass to all of the conferences was set at MAD 300.  In addition, the roundtables and recitals were held in the morning and afternoon, during regular working hours. This effectively limited attendance to retirees or the financially sound and excluded the average Moroccan. The annual festival is conducted under the patronage of King Mohammed VI and in partnership with the Ministry of Culture. With sponsors like BMCE Bank of Africa and phosphate giant OCP, attendees might expect subsidized tickets to promote local participation.  Location matters Due to poor weather conditions, the festival’s organizers relocated the musical performances to the Jemat al Fez municipal building. The building is in the middle of a quiet, developing neighborhood far from the Fez medina. Attendees who were not staying in one of the festival’s upscale hotel partners had to arrange their own transportation.   The events in this building were therefore less accessible to the public than they would have been in the more central location of Jnan Sbil Park, a short walk from the medina. As one of Fez’s most popular gathering spots, the park setting also offers a backdrop of Moroccan culture. Despite the less than desirable location, each of the musical performances still attracted a formidable audience—but a privileged audience, nonetheless.  The intellectually stimulating roundtable discussions also relocated.  The roundtables were originally scheduled at the Bou Inania Madrasa, one of Morocco’s most important Islamic historical sites. However, due to rainy weather, the roundtables took place at Riad Dar Batha, owned by the French Institute in Fez. This change in location may have served to shift the perception of some conference attendees.  The Bou Inania Madrasa would have reminded the roundables’ participants of the achievements of Islamic culture. The intellectual talks, however, were marked by a prevalence of French culture, despite being part of a Moroccan festival celebrating Sufi culture.  The panel members discussed Sufism exclusively in French, in front of a Francophone audience, in a traditional Moroccan building owned by the French Institute. The French Institute in Morocco is an organization established by France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promote French culture in the Kingdom. The French-owned Moroccan riad was the site of an argument over the hijab between a Moroccan Muslim woman and a French woman, just two days into the festival. The Francophone woman told the hijabi Moroccan to remove her headscarf before posing a question to the panel.  Had the roundtable been held at the world-renowned Islamic architectural feat of Bou Inania Madrasa, a building that still functions as a prayer space for Muslims, the hijab debate would have been even more ironic.  A rational but ironic system of exclusion Although Skali intended to spread the values of Sufism with the annual Fez Festival of Sufi Culture, the festival fell short.  The steep entry fees and linguistic limitations ultimately excluded all but an elite class of invitees, contradicting the principles of inclusivity, unity, and cohesion within Sufi traditions.  Perhaps this system of exclusion was intentional, given Skali’s goals of promoting a positive image of Islam and “throwing a bridge between East and West.”  The local population of Fez, which has a rich history of Sufism, already appears to have a positive image of Islam.  Westerners, on the other hand, perhaps need added exposure to Sufism.  Sufism represents a more liberal and open-minded branch of Islam, which has been branded a religion of violence and intolerance by right-wing political parties and media sources throughout Europe and North America. In this sense, it is completely reasonable for the festival organizers to prioritize the attendance of Europeans and North Americans, along with upper-class and highly-educated Moroccans—particularly those residing abroad.  If Skali’s ultimate goal was to encourage the re-integration of Sufism into Fez culture, the festival would be branded a failure, given the absence of local participation.  However, while he did mention wanting to make the legacy of Sufism in Fez more known, his intended audience for this knowledge may very well have been elites.  Furthermore, space was limited at Riad Dar Batha where the roundtables were held, and would have been just as restricted at Bou Inania Madrasa.  Without entry fees, those who were personally invited to the festival may not have found seats. The concerts, in contrast, were free of charge and would have been open to regular passersby in Jnan Sbil Park, had it not been for the rain prompting a location change. Perhaps the festival’s organizers could have decided on a larger, more public location for the intellectual roundtables, as well.  While it is easy to rationalize the festival’s exclusivity as a strategic decision, one key issue still remains: Exclusion of this nature directly opposes the principles of Sufism.  The sheer irony of restricting a celebration of Sufi culture in Morocco’s spiritual capital to a class of well-resourced, Francophone elites is irrefutable—whether it was done intentionally or not.

Rabat – Irish low-cost airline Ryanair officially inaugurated its Brussels-Essaouira flight on Tuesday, october 29. The flight arrived at the international airport of Essaouira with 188 passengers on board. The new route aims to strengthen air connectivity to the windy city, Essaouira, one of the most popular cities in Morocco for both local and international tourists, especially surfers. Ryanair will serve the flight between the two destinations twice a week on Tuesdays and Saturdays. President of Essaouira’s Provincial Council for Tourism Redwane Khanne told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) at the inauguration ceremony that the flight will help the company increase the “flow of tourists to Essaouira in terms of overnight stays and arrivals.” Commonly known as Mogador, Essaouira is also one of the cities that attracts visitors during the new year holiday. Khanne said that last year during the new year that all of Essaouira’s hotels were full. “The city of Essaouira is well known orryanair for its calmness, security and simplicity and friendliness of its natives,” he added. The coastal city attracts thousands of tourists every summer as it coincides with the International Gnaoua Festival. The city is also home to Jewish heritage as Jewish pilgrims gather annually to celebrate the Hiloula of Rabbi Haim Pinto. UNESCO added the medina of Essaouira to its World Heritage list in 2001 Several other  airlines serve flights to Essaouira, including EasyJet, Transavia France,  and Royal Air Maroc.

Rabat – Morocco and Indonesia have expressed their commitment to furthering their bilateral relationship and “excellent friendship.” Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, who headed an “important Moroccan delegation” on a working visit to Jakarta, met on Monday, October 28, with the Indonesian vice-president Maaruf Amin, and the speaker of the Indonesian House of Representatives, Puan Maharani. In both meetings, the two governments highlighted their “excellent relations” but pledged to further solidify cooperation on a range of issues, including education and culture, according to Morocco’s state-run news outlet MAP reported. As the Moroccan delegation’s visit comes after the annual inter-ministerial summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held last week in Baku, Azerbaijan, officials from both countries spoke of common convictions and shared interests. On the religious front, Bourita said Morocco is poised to work in concert with Indonesia to promote a tolerant, moderate, and difference-accommodating interpretation of Islam, both countries’ dominant religion. He also spoke about the need to nurture the socio-cultural ties between the two nations, revealing that Morocco projects to increase the number of scholarships and study grants to Indonesians interested in pursuing their education in Moroccan universities and other learning institutions. In response, the two Indonesian officials also expressed satisfaction with the “excellent” partnership their country shares with Morocco. They congratulated the North African country on its recent political reforms, particularly emphasizing the changes made under King Mohammed VI. Vice-President Amin said Morocco will remain a “privileged partner” for Indonesia in Africa and the Muslim world. Next year will mark the 60th anniversary of the Morocco-Indonesia bilateral relations.  The two countries formalized their bilateral relationship in 1960 on the occasion of a visit to Morocco by President Sukarno, Indonesia’s first president and a pioneering figure in the Afro-Asian Non-aligned and anti-colonial movements. Maharani, who is a granddaughter of President Sukarno, said she was especially “proud” that a street in Rabat—Rue Soekarno, inaugurated in 1960—bears her grandfather’s name.  She said she is looking forward to celebrating the 60th anniversary of the bilateral relations between the two countries and is ready to work with Morocco to bring the two nations much closer.

Rabat – Four years after his resignation as the UN personal envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross will accompany a group of students to the Tindouf camps in Algeria, to meet with the leadership of the Polisario Front later this week. The former US ambassador to Algeria, joining students from the University of Princeton in New Jersey will meet with the Polisario Front leader Ibrahim Ghali on October 31.  The students’ visit, beginning on October 30, coincides with the UN Security Council’s vote on whether, and for how long, to extend the mission of the UN peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara has shared a printed agenda of the visit, released by Polisario “officials.” While half of the students are visiting Algeria, the other half of the student group is visiting Rabat and Laayoune. Ross held the post of the UN Secretary-General’s personal envoy from 2009 to 2015. His tenure was marked by a lack of progress, despite holding several informal meetings between officials from Morocco and representatives of the Polisario Front.  Unlike Horst Kohler, who recently resigned as UN envoy after spearheading what has unanimously been lauded as “a new momentum” in the UN-led process in Western Sahara, Ross’s perceived failure to remain impartial led to a standstill in negotiations.  Was Ross pro-Polisario? While the role of UN envoy calls for neutrality and tact, from the beginning of Ross’s appointment in 2009, Morocco saw the new envoy as having a bias towards the Algerian agenda, and, therefore, that of the Polisario Front.  Ross, who served as US ambassador to Algeria from 1988-1991, lacked the “objectivity” and “neutrality” needed in observations and recommendations to the UN, in the view of the Moroccan government.  Based on its perception of Ross’s pro-Polisario inclination, Morocco suspected the American diplomat was using his position as UN envoy to effectively lobby against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Suspicions of bias gained further momentum in 2013 in Rabat after Washington’s proposal to extend the mission of the UN peacekeeping operation, known as MINURSO, included a clause on human rights monitoring in Western Sahara and the Tindouf camps.  The implicit suggestion that Morocco caused alleged human rights abuses, drew an immediate response from Rabat. Morocco responded to the lack of neutrality by calling on the Security Council to maintain an impartial position on the conflict. Rabat urged the Security Council to seriously consider monitoring that could stagnate the UN-led political process.  Another impediment to progress was that Ross repeatedly insisted on meeting Moroccan officials in the province of Laayoune in Western Sahara during his tenure, a move that  Morocco categorically rejected. Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Salah Eddine Mezouar responded by saying that although Morocco respects the UN envoy, the government would not hold its tongue if Ross were to act beyond his mission. “We explained to him and he understands,” Mezouar said at the time. A deliberate gap in the agenda Ross’s upcoming three-day visit to Tindouf will not include any meetings with Sahrawis living in the camps, according to the self-proclaimed SADR’s agenda.  Ross, along with the students, will meet with several “officials” from the camps. The students are set to hear from the Polisario “minister of defense” as well as NGOs in the camps. According to the agenda, the students will also meet with MINURSO members. Ross’s presence in the students’ meeting with Ghali will take place on the second day of his visit.  However, the published agenda makes no mention of talks with the Sahrawi populations, widely reported to be living in inhumane conditions in the camps. A recent report from the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, shone a light on the living conditions within the camps. The UN official drew particular attention to the prevalence of malnutrition and disease among the population. The lack of interaction between the students and the Sahrawi population could be a deliberate gap in the SADR agenda.  The Polisario leadership’s hiding of the living conditions in the camps from the students plays into their carefully crafted image as “protectors” of the Sahrawis, rather than those responsible for the alleged abuses and inhumane conditions prevalent within the camps. Manipulating the narrative Earlier this month, a former founding member of Polisario, Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, spoke out about the Polisario Front’s violations during the guerilla war in Western Sahara in the 1970s. He narrated his experiences of the Polisario’s forced kidnappings of Sahrawis from their homes in Western Sahara to the Tindouf camps.  It was not only inhabitants of the territory who fell victim to the Polisario’s forced relocations. The separatist front also kidnapped hundreds of Moroccan officials and military officers, describing them as “prisoners of war” or POWs. Thousands of testimonies highlighted the struggle of the Moroccans kidnapped by the Polisario during the guerilla war. In his 2009 book “Allah’s Garden,” former Peace Corps member Thomas Hollowell, through first-hand testimonies, depicted gruesome scenes from the conflict and the struggle of Moroccan prisoners. Hollowell narrated the story of Azeddine Benmansour, a young, recently-graduated medical doctor who was held for more than 20 years as a POW in a camp run by the Polisario Front. Benmansour witnessed the killing of wounded Moroccan soldiers and narrated  the pain and everyday challenges of the Moroccan survivors at the mercy of the Polisario. Benmansour also spoke to Hollowell about the Polisario Front’s tactics when trying to hide the human rights violations from international NGOs visiting the POW camp.  The doctor said that the Polisario forced prisoners to shower and gave them clean clothes to appear in good shape in front of the cameras. They would also allow them, for the sake of the cameras, to play football as propaganda for the Polisario.  However, the POW prisoner emphasized, behind the separatist front’s sympathy-grabbing narratives, there lurks a gulf of oppression, distress, and silencing.

Rabat – Head of the Moroccan Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiam said that Morocco will not convict wives of Moroccan ISIS fighters. Khiam said, on Monday, October 28, that there are nearly 280 Moroccan women, wives of ISIS-linked fighters, in conflict zones across Syria. He added that the women are mothers to 391 minors who are currently being held hostage in conflict zones in Syria. The BCIJ chief explained that the women did not go to Syria to engage in armed conflict. “They simply accompanied their husbands.” He vowed that Morocco’s justice system will not convict them. Khiam echoed statements he made earlier this year, emphasizing that women who did not intend to leave Morocco to join jihadi movements will not be prosecuted on return to Morocco. However, the wives of ISIS fighters and their children are subject to special measures in line with Morocco’s reconciliation program for reintegration into society. Convicts also receive measures in line with the reconciliation program or “moussalaha.” Speaking to the press, spokesman of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) Boubker Sabik said that more than 740 Moroccan ISIS fighters have died in combat, including 657 in Syria. He added that the rest of the fighters were killed in conflict zones in Iraq. Sabik noted that 1,659 Moroccan fighters were active in the Syrian-Iraqi conflict zones. “The number of returnees from conflict zones reached 260 people.” The defendants faced charges after BCIJ investigations. Terror suspects receive sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in prison. The statements from both top security officials come after the BCIJ dismantled a seven-member cell in Ouazzane, northern Morocco, Chefchaouen, and Casablanca on Friday, October 25. The cell was plotting attacks against sensitive places in Morocco to undermine its security, stability and to spread fear among citizens, the head of the BCIJ said. Morocco has carried out several other crackdowns against terror cells throughout the year.

Rabat – Lebanon’s Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation on Tuesday, October 29. Beirut’s National News Agency (NNA) reported that Hariri arrived in the Baabda Palace to meet with Lebanese President Michel Aoun where he submitted his government’s resignation. The news agency added that Hariri left the presidential palace without “delivering any statement.” The decision comes after nearly two weeks of widespread protests across Lebanon, calling for radical change in response to economic mismanagement and corruption. Hariri announced that he had reached a “dead end” in a televised speech. Quoted by Al Jazeera, the prime minister said that it “has become necessary for us to make a great shock to fix the crisis.” The Saudi born 49-year old businessman served as the Prime Minister of Lebanon from 2016 to 2019. He also held the position between 2009 and 2011. Hariri entered politics following the murder of his father Rafiq Hariri in February 2005. Prior to his tenure as prime minister, Hariri became head of his father’s construction company SAUDI Oger. Observers criticized Hariri for his lack of experience in politics after he took office as prime minister. Al Jazeera stipulated in 2017  that despite criticism, Hariri “remains one of the most important figures in Lebanese politics and is very likely to continue playing a role after his resignation.” Hariri was at the center of a recent scandal when an exclusive document obtained by the New York Times said that the former prime minister gifted a South African model £16 million when they were dating back in 2013. Hariri, however, was not in the office at the time3. Despite the story dating back to 2013, Hariri faced strong criticism due to the economic woes and the political climate in Lebanon.

Rabat – The second annual Pan-African Reggae Festival will take place from November 1 to 3 in Sale, Rabat’s sister city across the Bou Regreg river.  The traveling music festival first arrived in Temara, a suburb of Rabat, last year. Each year, the festival moves to a new city to introduce different Moroccan and African cultures.   The Pan-African Reggae Festival is an initiative of the Ben O Bin Intercultural Association.  Ben O Bin is an intercultural collective of artists and social activists from sub-Saharan Africa and Morocco. The association promotes African interculturality in Morocco and strives to enhance cultural co-heritage.   The reggae festival aims to unite the different peoples, cultures, and music from the African continent—the cradle of humanity—and create synergies between them, according to the festival’s official Facebook page. The festival promotes reggae as “positive music for the emancipation of peoples and openness to the whole world.”  Admission is free for all activities. The Hay Salam Youth House and the headquarters of Réseau marocain de l’économie sociale et solidaire (REMESS) in Sidi Moussa will serve as venues this year.  Events will occur Friday through Sunday at various times.  Reggae’s African rhythms Although reggae originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s, the cultural and musical tradition has a much longer history. According to the African Reggae Fest of Barcelona, reggae is a fusion of African rhythms and the music of African slaves in the Carribean and North America.  Between 1662 and 1807 the Transatlantic Slave Trade focribly brought millions of West Africans to British colonies in the Caribbean to work on plantations as slaves. The majority of Jamaicans are descendents of enslaved Africans. Reggae music began in Jamaica as a creative avenue for social commentary, and many reggae artists have produced songs reflecting on slavery and colonialism in the Caribbean.  Bob Marley’s “Slave Driver” is an example:  Today they say that we are free Only to be chained in poverty Ev’ry time I hear a crack of the whip My blood runs cold I remember on the slave ship How they brutalised our very souls.  Reggae as a vehicle for Pan-Africanism Reggae has the means to unite people under Pan-African ideals, according to the organizers of the Pan-African Reggae Festival.  Pan-Africanism is a movement which intends to strengthen bonds of solidarity among all people of African descent, regardless of whether or not they have lived in or even visited Africa.  The movement emerged alongside calls for the liberation of African colonies at the end of World War I. Bob Marley  was a proud ambassador of pan-African ideology, having been influenced by the doctrine of fellow Jamaican Marcus Mosiah Garvey, Jr.  Garvey, who died in 1940, was posthumously named Jamaica’s first National Hero in 1969. The political activist, publisher, journalist, and orator promoted a doctrine of racial pride and African unity. “Reggae is a manifestation of a Pan-African Aesthetic that articulates a message of Pan African liberation and redemption,” says Amoaba Gooden, author of an academic paper entitled “The Pan-African Aesthetic in Reggae Music.” In the late 1970s, reggae music was a strong proponent of pan-Africanism. The Pan-African Reggae Festival hopes to revive this spirit of African unity and brotherhood this weekend with its concerts in Salé.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has published statistics on fraud and scam cases recorded in the recent years. Fake employment and migration offers are the main scams that Moroccans fall victim to. The statistics appeared in the monthly “Achorta” (Police) magazine of October. In 2018, DGSN recorded 2,285 cases of scam or fraud that led to the arrest of 3,136 suspects. So far this year, police recorded 1,397 similar cases and the cases led to 982 arrests. Around 47% of the recorded cases concerned fake migration opportunities, while 18% were fake job offers. Additionally, online scams represented 9% of the cases. The directorate also reported that the number of scam and fraud cases increased by 25% between 2015 and 2018. The magazine stated that there are numerous types of fraud in Morocco. Fake advertisements, invalid cheques, and lotteries are among the most common scams. People who commit these criminal acts usually contact their victims either directly,  by phone, email, or on websites designed specifically to retrieve sensitive information from the victims. The DGSN also cited a scam, known as “Samawi,” as one of the most frequent scams. Arnaque à la samaoui ! Ça vous dit quelque chose! Méfiez-vous des fqihs qui arrivent de nulle part devant votre porte ! Ne vous laissez pas berner !!! pic.twitter.com/2K8NDb4AIj — DGSN MAROC (@DGSN_MAROC) October 28, 2019 “Samawi” scammers target victims with superstitious beliefs. They present themselves as saints with supernatural powers, and convince their victims to give them all their valuables. The victims, usually left in a state of hypnosis and confusion, do not realize that they have been scammed until the culprits have already disappeared. According to the magazine, losses caused by scam and fraud all over the world are estimated at trillions of dollars every year. The majority of these acts target individuals rather than organizations, and leave their victims facing severe consequences such as depression. Finally, the DGSN assured that they have teams trained to investigate and deal with scam cases, along with technological tools that can help arresting the suspects.

Rabat – The African Development Bank (BAD) has announced in a press release the appointment of a group of 8 renowned experts to the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism (ABM) Board of directors.  Moroccan Fatima Zahra Taibi is among the appointees. Taibi is a senior adviser to the partnership between the Technical University of Denmark and the UN Environment’s Climate Change Strategy and Energy Programme, known as the UNEP DTU Partnership. The ABM is a new initiative designed to help identify and target public and private sector finance to fund projects that help minimize the negative effects of climate change The ABM Board is assisted by an interim secretariat in the AfDB’s Climate Change and Green Growth Department, led by Anthony Nyong. “We have with us some of the brightest minds in the world of climate change, having gained considerable experience in different fields, and with different stakeholder groups for ABM. Their mission, noble and innovative, is to convince the world that adaptation measures, as well as mitigation measures, have value and must be rewarded,” said Anthony Nyong. The BAD pointed out that the mechanism will help developing countries meet the climate change adaptation needs and priorities set out in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), intended to reduce greenhouse emissions under the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement came into force in 2016 as an international initiative aiming to combat climate change. In the pilot phase, the BAD specified that it will, along with its partners, seek funds to carry out multiple small-scale resilience projects to test the mechanism in the field. The pilot phase is needed to test the deliverables of the project. The ABM concept was developed by the BAD with the support of Climate Investment Funds, in collaboration with the governments of Uganda and Côte d’Ivoire, as well as various stakeholders. ABM is potentially applicable in all countries.

Rabat – A Moroccan team composed of four high school students took part in the 2019 FIRST Global Challenge in Dubai. The event took place in the Emirati city between October 24 and October 27. FIRST Global Challenge is a yearly international robotics challenge where high school students from around the world meet and compete using their robots. The Moroccan team was composed of three girls, Intissar, Yasmine, and Nour, and one boy, Ismail, all aged between 16 and 17 years old. The team members study in different high schools in Rabat and Casablanca, but they are all members of ADJI club, a group of young Moroccan inventors.  It is the second time that the Moroccan team has taken part in the event. Last year, the same members represented Morocco at the challenge in Mexico City. This year’s challenge, called “Ocean Opportunities,” invited the participants to invent robots that can effectively collect and dispose of trash in beaches. More than 1500 participants, from 191 different countries participated in the challenge.  The Moroccan team created a robot that can move on unstable surfaces, such as beach sands. The robot was also able to carry 15 to 20 waste items, such as candy wrapping, soda cans, and plastic boxes. Finally, the Moroccan invention could lift the items up to 70 cm high, and dispose of them in a trash bin. The winning team of this year’s competition was “Team Hope.” It comprised five Syrian refugee teenagers who want to overcome the challenges they have faced and help to make the world a better place through robotics and artificial intelligence. The participating teams qualified for the challenge after a series of local events throughout the year. The organizers of the competition also granted funds for the teams to buy the necessary electronics for their inventions. FIRST Global Challenge started as a yearly regional event in the United States and Canada in 1989. However, since 2017, the event has become global, with teams from more than 190 countries participating. The 2017 challenge took place in Washington DC and the second competition was organized in Mexico City. This year is the first time that the event has taken place outside of the Americas.

Rabat – David Beckham, one of the world’s top football stars, is set to attend the gala in honor of the 44th anniversary of the Green March in Laayoune in Morocco’s southern provinces. The annual Green March celebration commemorates the 1975 movement when 350,000 unarmed Moroccans marched into the Sahara. The march protested the Spanish occupation of Western Sahara during the rule of King Hassan II. “We have to do one thing, dear people, and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara,” King Hassan II said in his call-to-action on October 16, 1975. The Green March on November 6, 1975, demonstrated Morocco’s commitment to its territorial integrity. The Spanish occupation of Western Sahara ended a week later on November 14 under the Madrid Accords.  Every year since the 1975 march, the city of Laayoune has hosted a celebration of Western Sahara’s “Moroccanness,” to quote King Mohammed VI in his speech last year ahead of the Green March’s 43rd anniversary. Part of this annual celebration is a football match at the El Sheikh Stadium in Ghazghef, Laayoune.  Beckham will participate in the gala game along with a number of Moroccan and international football stars, such as the Argentine legend Diego Maradona and the recently retired Brazilian star Ronaldinho. The Green March anniversary football match serves as a celebration of the momentous protest against Spanish imperialism while promoting Morocco as a football destination.  This story has been updated.

Rabat – The administration council of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) has elected Mohamed Bachiri as acting president. The election took place at the CGEM headquarters, in Casablanca on October 28. Bachiri is the General Manager of Somaca, a Moroccan car manufacturing company owned by French Renault. He previously served as the president of sectoral dynamics committee within CGEM. The election of an acting president comes after the resignation of CGEM’s former president, Salaheddine Mezouar. Mezouar stepped down from the presidency after his controversial statements about Algeria drew criticism. Speaking at the 12th annual World Policy Conference (WCP) in Marrakech, on October 12, Mezouar expressed support for the Hirak (protest) movement in Algeria, emphasizing that such political protests “bring hope” to the region. On October 13, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Mezouar’s statement as “irresponsible.” Mezouar presented his resignation from chairing CGEM on the same day. CGEM’s administration council also decided to elect the next president during a general assembly on January 22, 2020. The new president will chair the confederation for the next three years. The council will accept applications for the position from October 31 to December 13. On December 16, the council will announce its initial shortlist. The election of Bachiri as acting president did not meet any objections. Bachiri said that he is “very honored for being designated for this responsibility” and that he is “aware of its importance.”

Rabat – Moroccan policemen and customs at the  Guerguerat crossing point, south of the city of Dakhla have thwarted a drug trafficking attempt.  The smugglers were attempting to traffick 936 kilograms of cannabis resin concealed in an international transport truck. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN)  said that police arrested the driver and his assistant, both Moroccan nationals on Monday, October 28. The security services discovered concealed drugs during a search operation through an x-ray. Police also opened an invest The truck was on its way to an African country, preliminary investigation finds. Police are continuing the investigation to determine the circumstances of the case and to arrest possible accomplices involved in the foiled attempt. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to abort any drug trafficking attempt across Morocco and its borders. Police and customs operating at the Guerguerat crossing point foiled several smuggling attempts recently.  The latest operation was conducted on October 14 when police thwarted an attempt to smuggle five tons and 996 kilograms of cannabis resin in the region.  Back in April, Moroccan police, in coordination with customs officers in Guerguerat at the Mauritanian border, seized 11 tons and 940 kilograms of cannabis on a truck bound for “an African country.” Morocco is intensifying its efforts against drug trafficking network. In September,  the national police announced that security services seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15. Moroccan customs also shared statistics on drug seizures during the month of October. Customs announced that its services seized a total of 8,342 kilograms of cannabis resin the portS of Casablanca and Tangier Med since October 11. The customs office also said that in May its staff seized 19.2 tons of cannabis resin in 2018, 14.7 tons less than the amount of cannabis resin seized in 2017 ( 33.7 tons).

Rabat – At the 12th MEDays forum due to take place from November 13-16 in Tangier, pan-Africanism and Morocco’s pointedly Africa-focused diplomacy will be at the heart of debates. A slight alteration from last year’s MEDays’ topic, “In the Age of Disruption: Finding the New Paradigms,” this year’s is set to discuss “The Global Distrust Crisis: Facing Subversion and Uncertainties.” Brahim Fassi-Fihri, the founder of Amadeus Institute, the think tank that annually organizes the event, recently shared the event’s illustrious guest list with Moroccan newspaper le 360, highlighting the place of Africa at the heart of the now iconic gathering. Senegalese President Macky Sall and Sierra Leone’s Julius Maada Bio will be this year’s special guests, Fihri told the Moroccan newspaper. Alongside the two West African presidents will be more than thirty ministers from across the world; but mostly from Africa. Both the event’s thematic direction and the list of “illustrious” attendees speak to what has become the most visible characteristic of the Moroccan diplomacy in the past two or three years: an emphatic focus on Africa. Although Amadeus Institute is not affiliated with the Moroccan government, the bulk of its activities as one of  the North African country’s leading think tanks—be it in conferences, think pieces, or political analyses and policy recommendations—have mostly centered on the meaning of Morocco’s return to the African Union. Most telling still, the institute’s founder has been cited among the most indispensable proponents Morocco’s bid to join the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It is therefore no coincidence that the Morocco-ECOWAS complex romance, which said to be facing “significant political hurdles” in the form of Nigeria’s reluctance to relinquish part of its regional hegemony to Morocco, was the flagship topic of last year’s MeDays event. At one of last year’s many panels on the issue, there was thunderous agreement that Morocco’s membership will change the regional body for the better. Panelists spoke about the irrefutable Africanness of Morocco, pointing to it’s the centuries-long links with countries like Senegal, Mali, and Ghana, home to thee of the oldest, pre-colonial empires in the region. In more contemporary parlance, pan-Africanist arguments, the panelists pointed to Morocco’s “historical role” in African struggle for independence in the 1960s and 1970s—and beyond. “It is a question of continental unity,” Moussa Mara, former Prime Minister of Mali, said of what he saw as the primary meaning of Morocco’s ECOWAS membership. The sentiment was an understandable echo of the current emphasis, in most AU events and working papers, on increasing intra-African exchanges. Another panelist, more detail-minded, spoke to the heart of the significance of Morocco in ECOWAS. “If Morocco joins ECOWAS, the body will immediately become the world’s 15th economy in terms of GDP. And according to my own estimations, ECOWAS will be among the world’s leading ten economies by 2030,” said Mubarak Lo, former foreign minister of Senegal and visiting lecturer of African affairs at the Rabat International University. But even as the consensus around Morocco’s added value to the West African club could not be more heartily expressed, the bid is still faced with a delay of deliberation. This understandably stems from Nigeria’s opposition but also from an unarticulated feeling that, contrary to political leaders in the region, the wider society in West Africa is not quite ready for a Moroccan membership. In a series of events organized in 2018 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and Accra, Ghana, in prelude to  last year’s MEDays talks, Amadeus Institute reached the conclusion that the bid still “needs time and a broader social dialogue.” Meanwhile, as it patiently waits—few endeavors require patience and long term calculations than diplomacy—Morocco has made it consistently plain that its Africa-oriented diplomacy is not driven by economic interests alone. At heart, goes the deep-seated arguments made on numerous occasions by the Moroccan government—or most high-ranking Moroccan officials, for that matter—Africa, Africanness, and Pan-Africanism are part and parcel of Moroccan history and culture. From “African vocation” to “pan-African responsibility,” it is not uncommon, while attending a conference in Morocco, government-sponsored or not, to hear hearty pronouncements about Morocco’s congenital Africanness. But Nigeria’s reluctance and the reported popular Western African opposition to Rabat’s West African proclivities are not the only blocking stone standing in the way of Morocco’s unapologetic plea for its inherent Africanness. As should be expected, the territorial dispute in Western Sahara continues to be an extremely divisive topic in some African quarters. Last summer, a number of African countries, following in the steps of South Africa, whose ruling party, the African National Congress, has no qualms about its disapproval of Morocco’s Western Sahara claims, dashed the North African country’s hopes of organizing the 2026 FIFA World Cup. For some weeks or months after that devastating defeat for Morocco 2026, the decision of some African countries to vote for the North American World Cup bid poured some cold water on the pan-Africanism-inspired fervor of those who thought that the whole of Africa would vote for Morocco’s bid. Invoking the anti-colonization tenets of the African Union, South Africa has traditionally ridiculed Morocco’s claims to pan-Africanism by presenting Western Sahara as “the last colony in Africa.” There have most recently been promising signs of a certain diplomatic rapprochement between Rabat and Pretoria. This has mostly been possible because of Morocco’s discernible shift towards a type of “proactive diplomacy” whereby it seeks to more assertively engage countries that have still not embraced the increasingly established sentiment in UN diplomatic circles that self-determination and independence are not the way forward for Western Sahara. Meanwhile, Morocco does not appear to have lofty goals about convincing South Africa in an exceptionally short period of time. This will take delicate, laborious diplomacy, which is perhaps why Morocco appointed one its most accomplished diplomats in the ambassadorial seat in Pretoria. In the short and medium terms, however, Rabat understandably wants to convince Pretoria that it is just as devoutly African and pan-Africanist as other African, mostly sub-Saharan African, countries. There is “no South African monopoly on pan-Africanism,” Fihri, the Amadeus Institute founder, told Morocco World News last May. “Morocco does not have to prove its Africanness. Morocco’s Africanness is not only institutional. Morocco’s African identity is part of its everyday life experience. It is rooted in our history.” This is perhaps what Youssef Amrani, the Moroccan ambassador to South Africa, meant when, recently speaking to a number of South African journalists and think tanks, he spoke of Morocco as seeking to advance its “African vision” for an increased and more results-driven intra-African cooperation on some of the continent’s most burning issues. Amrani was perceptibly more diplomatic than Fihri in his presentation of Morocco’s heightened focus on Africa in recent years. But the two shared the same underlying premise: that Morocco is essentially African; and that it is only natural that the North African country be interested in Africa, or frames its diplomacy with the purpose of promoting African causes on the global scene. At present, the debate, if it can be called that, is being globally framed in favor of Morocco, as shown in the AU’s move to wholeheartedly adhere to the UN-led process in Western Sahara or, more strikingly still, the assessment by a South-African newspaper that “Morocco is the face of modern Africa.” If anything, however, the debate is not one to be settled in, say, five years. How long the final denouement will take will depend on whether African countries, especially bellwethers like Morocco, South Africa, Nigeria, to cite only these three, will place pragmatism and workable policies above any ideology-inspired animus they may harbor about one another.

Rabat – Head of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ)  Abdelhak El Khiam has said that the counterterrorism bureau is currently identifying a foreigner involved in an ISIS-linked terrorist cell. The BCIJ dismantled the cell on Friday, October 25 in Casablanca, Ouazzane, and Chefchaouen. El Khiam spoke about the BCIJ recent operation in a press conference on Monday, October 28. The bureau director said that the foreign national, possibly a Syrian citizen, is an emissary sent by ISIS to the cell leader. He added that the emissary, “who was accompanied by two other individuals, assured the cell’s leader, in a meeting in the region of Ouezzane, of the readiness of ISIS to provide him with the logistics necessary to undertake terrorist acts in Morocco, especially in Casablanca.” El Khiam said that the terror cell plotted attacks aiming to turn Morocco into a “bloodbath.” The security chief explained that the suspects planned to target sensitive sites to undermine the safety and security of the country. BCIJ recently located a terrorist hideout in the province of Ouazzane in northern Morocco. Members of the recently dismantled terror cell were planning to use the remote region to lie low after carrying out terror attacks in several regions across Morocco. The cell was also preparing to release a video following the attacks to spread fear across the kingdom. The mastermind of the cell attempted to join the IS in the Sahel region in 2016. “It did not work,” Khiam said. He added that the cell’s leader was in contact with ISIS on Facebook and Instagram. According to the Khiam, the mastermind began his terror plots in Morocco after failing to reach ISIS in the Sahel.

Rabat – In typically diplomatic comments after the signing of an “Association Agreement” between Rabat and London last Saturday, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Nasser Bourita, said that the UK and Morocco are “historical partners” poised to nurture and maintain their “strategic” friendship, in spite of the sometimes challenging changes both countries witnessed in recent years. The UK-Morocco relations “have gone through different stages in their history but they have always been continuous, constant and based on friendship and mutual respect,” Bourita told dozens of reporters in London minutes after the signing of a bilateral deal seeking “continuity” between the two nations after the UK effectively leaves the European Union. The signing of the “Association Agreement,” Bourita stressed, is a testimony to the evolution and “the positive development” of the partnership between the two nations in various sectors. “This positive development in bilateral relations stems from the Royal Vision, which consists of strengthening Morocco’s relations with historic partners, while opening up to new partners, both from and outside the European Union,” he explained. According to the Moroccan official, some of the persisting challenges facing both countries on the domestic front, as well as their “shared visions” and goals on a wide range of global challenges—security and migration, among others—makes it particularly necessary to preserve and nourish the 800-year-old friendship between the two monarchies. Bilateral trade between the UK and Morocco currently stands at MAD 18.3 billion, Bourita revealed. Morocco is the 7th destination of UK exports, and the two countries are working to further solidify that discernibly growing relationship. As far as Morocco is concerned, he elaborated, the “continuity” deal is part of King Mohammed VI’s “royal vision” and push for the “diversification of partnerships.” But Bourita—or the Moroccan government, which he represents—is not alone in having great expectations about the prospects of the UK-Morocco friendship. Nor, too, was the Moroccan official alone in speaking this positively about the deal the two countries stuck on Saturday in London, or their centuries-old partnership. In similar remarks after the signing of the agreement on Saturday, Thomas Reilly, the UK ambassador to Morocco, went even further than acknowledging the significance for the UK to maintain strong bilateral ties with Morocco even after Brexit finally comes into force. In addition to lauding the potential of the relationship with Morocco, Reilly made what is set to be seen as positive and warm comments on a topic of utmost importance to Moroccan diplomacy: the territorial dispute in Western Sahara. On the Western Sahara question, the British diplomat stressed, the UK is strongly committed to the UN-moderated political process. He said the UK believes that the way forward in the diplomatic standstill is a compromise-based and politically negotiated settlement, which is a large part of Morocco’s Western Sahara agenda since the country put together its Autonomy Proposal in 2007. More still, however, Ambassador Reilly also spoke “approvingly” about Morocco’s autonomy proposal, as well as the North African country’s “efforts” in the disputed regions. He called Morocco’s proposal, echoing a visibly prevailing sentiment in UN diplomatic circles, a “serious” and “credible” route towards a sustainable settlement in Western Sahara.

Rabat – Controversial Moroccan musician Saad Lamjarred is at the center of a copyright claim after the video streaming giant YouTube removed the music video for his new song “Salam” on Monday, October 28.     A post shared by saadlamjarred (@saadlamjarred1) on Oct 18, 2019 at 10:03am PDT  Lamjarred launched the video for “Salam” on Sunday, October 20. Three days later, Moroccan artist Hicham Telmoudi accused Lamjarred of plagiarism.  Today, after accumulating millions of views, the video was taken down by Telmoudi’s official copyright claim. Telmoudi, from Marrakech, is a famous Amazigh violinist.   Telmoudi has stated that a part from his 2015 song “Agwal souss” was used in Lamjarred’s “Salam” without his approval.   “At the end of [Lamjarred’s “Salam” music video], it is mentioned that the song was inspired by the Amazigh musical heritage, but it is not a heritage work, since it is my own song, where I also collaborated with Ahwach artists,” Telmoudi said in a statement to French-langauge news outlet Le360. Lamjarred credited Fnaire Mohcine Tizaf, a member of an Ahidous group, for inspiring “Salam.” Ahidous refers to an Amazigh (Berber) dance and musical expression.  Tizaf has not yet commented on the matter. The video’s director, Abderrafia El Abdioui, referred to the issue as “temporary” in a statement to Arabic-language outlet Febrayer. This is not the first time Lamjarred has been accused of plagiarism. Just last month, Lebanese singer Joe Raad claimed that Lamjarred copied his style with the music video for “Lmaallem.”

Essaouira – The Lonely Planet recently listed Morocco among the top 10 most beautiful countries in the world. The beauty of Ouarzazate, Ifrane, the Atlas Mountains, and the architecture of cities like Fez and Marrakech is undeniable, but behind the awe-inspiring, mesmerising facade of beauty lurks the ugly side of Morocco.  To be clear, I love Morocco, and it is beautiful, but, over the past three years, I have had to learn to embrace the not-so-beautiful side. This morning, for example, as I sat sipping my first coffee of the day at a picturesque cafe in the countryside outside Essaouira, from the roof terrace I gazed over miles of open space, of Argan trees, goats, and sheep roaming free in the morning sun. Then, an old man wearing a traditional jellaba rode past on a donkey. Idyllic, stereotypical Morocco, you might be thinking.   On the contrary, I know the man. His brown jellaba is dirty and patched, and he is thin and fragile. He rides past every morning and every night on a tour of the region’s bins. His dinner this evening will be someone else’s trash.  This is just one example of the social disparity and poverty I see daily in Morocco. However it still upsets me to hear tourists’ comments and read reports saying that Moroccans see tourists as “walking wallets,” or worse.  One comment about Morocco on a World Nomads article was really shocking. “Before going I asked many people about it and most told me of the beauty of Morocco. Maybe I am missing something here, but I really had a hard time getting past the overwhelming poverty, smell, scam artists and just plain gross.” It got worse, and, as someone who has chosen Morocco as my home, I actually felt rather offended by the next sentence. “Morocco is not really all that beautiful considering with every step you see starving kittens, abused donkeys, abused women &amp; children and the stink of human/animal waste.” I take issue with much of this comment, but it is simply not true to say that tourists witness these horrific scenes with “every step.” There are, of course, places in Morocco that are unsavory but, frankly, that is just insulting. Meanwhile, Michael Russnow, a former US Senate aide, wrote an article for the Huffington Post suggesting that “if more people boycotted such countries and strongly affected the billions of dollars that tourism brings in, perhaps the governments would do something to eradicate the misery that has caused so many of its citizens to behave no better than animals.” I must admit that that particular article was an eye-opener for me—I had no idea that people could be so callous. The citizens who “behave no better than animals” are, in fact, a deeply human, dignified, and prideful people who, despite their financial struggles, represent a rich and extraordinary culture. Furthermore, the idea that “boycotting” poor countries would inspire governments to address the social disparities just seems ridiculous to me.  Morocco, for example, already has government targets and development programs in place, and every year the levels of poverty do decrease, but it is not going to happen over night. In 2018, the World Bank described the improvement of living standards in Morocco since 2001 as “visible,” with monetary poverty and vulnerability falling “to 4.8 and 12.5% respectively.” However, there is still a long way to go. When the colonial powers left countries like Morocco, they left them in a mess, and, after all, one would not make a meal without doing the washing up afterwards.  Now, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but this is mine: Morocco is beautiful, despite the shocking levels of poverty. And, choosing to turn away from, or even, “boycott” the social disparity is not going to make it go away, just like hiding under the covers does not make Mondays disappear.  The facts speak for themselves; Morocco’s GDP per capita for 2019 is only 27% of the world’s average, at $3,357.40. Meanwhile, according to the Borgen Project, 4 million Moroccans are living under the poverty line and according to the World Bank, 45.1% of Moroccans say that they struggle to make ends meet.  So, when tourists “on a budget” complain about that extra dirham, I would remind them that the very fact that they are able to buy a plane ticket and own a passport places them in a different financial universe from the average Moroccan.  Yes, it is annoying knowing full well that you are paying “tourist prices.” And, yes, holidays are supposed to be about escapism. But as tourists we need to stop hiding under the duvet. Morocco, and other countries like it, cannot resolve all of their social problems just because we want a relaxing, stress-free holiday. However, the revenue going into the country from our holiday may well help. In 2016, Morocco’s tourist industry brought in MAD 57.8 billion to the national economy, and in 2018 that figure rose to MAD 73.15 billion. By following the advice of our friend the former US Senate aide and boycotting Morocco, we would be doing its people more harm than good.  If the economic arguments have not convinced you to get out from under the covers and look both sides of Morocco in the eye, maybe this will. When we fall in love with a person, we fall in love with every aspect of them because we need to know and understand the “ugly side” to know the person. My husband, like Morocco, is very beautiful. He has almond-shaped, amber eyes with long dark lashes that our son has inherited. He has a magnetic smile and an easy laugh. However, he also snores, hates responding to WhatsApp messages, and insists that he does not like carrots. That second set of facts does not cancel out the first. On the contrary, the imperfections of a person are what makes them unique and, in some cases, more beautiful. Poverty, social disparities, and injustice are not beautiful, but they are part of a beautiful and fascinating country and society. When you visit Morocco, do not look away from them because they will help you to understand Morocco and its people as a whole.  And besides, I don’t think tourists come to Morocco to see soulless monuments and trees; they come because of the rich and ancient history of the Moroccan people. They come to witness a unique culture, with its beautiful and ugly sides, that is constantly evolving and developing. Now, if you still want to look away, consider this: If it were you struggling to feed your family, would you like tourists to ignore you, embarrassed and offended by your presence in your own country, or allow you the dignity of being an equal in their eyes?

Rabat – Readers have been criticizing the Washington Post for a headline describing the leader of ISIS, Abubakr Al Baghdadi, as an “austere religious scholar.”  The headline was part of an article on Sunday, October 27, about President Donald Trump’s announcement that Al Baghdadi died in a US special forces operation. Readers found the “religious leader” description inappropriate. The newspaper quickly responded by changing its headline and recanting the previous one. Kristine Coratti Kelly, the Post’s vice president of communications, tweeted that the headline “never should have read that way.” Regarding our al-Baghdadi obituary, the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly. — Kristine Coratti Kelly (@kriscoratti) October 27, 2019  “Religious scholar” was the Post’s second version of its headline. The original headline called Al Baghdadi the “terrorist-in-chief.” The headline later described the ISIS caliph as an “extremist leader.” Twitter users had some fun with the faux pas, writing their own inventive obituaries for infamous dictators and killers under the hashtag #WaPoDeathNotices. Adolf Hitler, dedicated art enthusiast, animal rights activist, and talented orator, dies at 56.#WaPoDeathNotices — Lauren Chen (@TheLaurenChen) October 28, 2019  “Pol Pot, national leader and one of history’s most effective opponents of urban overcrowding, dies at 72,” tweeted one user in reference to the Cambodian dictator who left over 1 million dead. Another commemorated Caesar’s death: “Gaius Julius Caesar, 56, noted author and Egyptologist, dies surrounded by his friends.” One Twitter user even wrote an obituary for the devil: “Satan, unorthodox faith leader known for pushing back against famous wine maker Jesus, dies at 14 billion.” Among the Post’s critics was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said the coverage was “appalling and sick.” President Trump’s son, Eric Trump, called the newspaper “a disgrace.”  The @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Refers to Baghdadi as a: “austere religious scholar” who “maintained a canny pragmatism” “Acquaintances would remember him as a shy, nearsighted youth who liked soccer but preferred to spend his free time at the local mosque” @JeffBezos pic.twitter.com/MW1Ikfl8eZ — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) October 28, 2019  Al Baghdadi died in Syria when he set off a suicide bomb during a raid by US special forces early Sunday morning, October 27.

Rabat – French police have arrested a gunman after he opened fire near a mosque in Bayonne, southwest France. Police arrested the gunman near his home after the incident. A statement from the Pyrenees Atlantiques prefecture reports the gunman injured at least two people aged 74 and 78. The two victims are seriously wounded. Police reportedly seized a gas cylinder in from the suspect’s car. The incident took place in front of the mosque at about 2:30 p.m local time on Monday, October 28. Reports said that the suspect was in his 80s and that the gunman also tried to throw an “incendiary device at the building.” The attack comes amid rising concerns over Islamophobia in France.  The Hijab or Muslim veil is a hot topic in France after far-right politicians from the National Party openly attacked a Muslim woman in a meeting on October  14 for wearing the hijab. The issue urged French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene, drawing criticism from both opposition and Muslims. Macron said on October 24 that the wearing of hijab in public spaces is not his business. “However, in public services, at school and while educating children, the headscarf issue is my business. That is what secularism is about,” he added. Muslims represent 8% of the French population estimated at 65.10 million this year. France is also one of the European countries with the highest levels of Islamophobia. The Organization against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) has said that Islamophobic attacks increased by 52%  in 2018 compared with 2017.

Rabat – US magazine Forbes tasked Ovation Travel Group’s agents with the preparation an “exclusive list” of top 2020 destinations. The list included one of Morocco’s popular destinations: Marrakech known as the red city  for its red washed buildings. Forbes invites tourists who are “active and adventurous” to explore the red city. The destination is also attractive to tourists interested to explore different cultural experiences, Forbes added. Quoting travel advisor at Ovation Travel Group Susan Ganis, Forbes said that the  Moroccan popular city offers “one-of-a-kind experiences such as a candlelit dinner in the middle of the desert replete with camel rides, belly dancers and fire eaters.” The travel agency also advised its clients not to miss a “private visit to Yves Saint Laurent’s home and the Majorelle Gardens.” Marrakech is one of the popular cities in Morocco that record a continuous increase of tourists annually. Morocco’s Tourism Observatory said in September that 7.544 million tourists visited Morocco by the end of July 2019. The statistics show that  that the “two tourist destinations of Marrakech and Agadir generated 57% of hotel nights in the first seven months of 2019.” Several renowned international publications have  featured Morocco and its tourism assets as key pillars of the country’s economy.  Last week, the travel guide publisher Lonely Planet listed Morocco among the top  ten destinations for 2020. “Morocco is having a moment, with time-honoured attractions complemented by sustainable-yet-stylish lodging, restaurants serving up seasonal produce and coastal wellness retreats mixing up yoga and surfing,” Lonely Planet wrote. The travel guide publisher listed Marrakech as one of the destinations that tourists should visit when in Morocco in 2020. In addition to the Lonely Planet, Flight Network also named Marrakech one for the top 50 beautiful cities in the world. “You’ll feel like you’ve been transported into a movie while you walk through the Old City, and then feel transported back to today when stepping into the New City,” Flight Network states.

Rabat – A fight between two groups that police suspect are drug traffickers led to a face off with police early on Sunday, October 27, in Laayoune in southern Morocco. The fight escalated and a house was set on fire, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement. The suspects also destroyed a third party’s property before police intervened and got the situation under control. Two suspects fired on police with “heavy caliber weapons,” DGSN stated. Moroccan police fired a warning shot at the suspects as they tried to escape in a vehicle. Police fired four warning shots in total. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the incident led to the arrest of five suspects, all in their early to mid-20s. One of the suspects is a repeat offender. After conducting a search, police also seized, according to MAP, “two vehicles, two knives, a shotgun bullet, two hoods, and two foreign license plates.” Judicial investigators now have access to the five suspects, who are in custody, for further investigation. DGSN earlier announced four arrests in Laayoune on suspicion of drug trafficking. The arrests happened Saturday, the day before the fight broke out between two alleged drug trafficking groups. In neither case did the DGSN report any seizures of drugs, but in both instances, police seized knives and license plates. During the incident on Saturday, Moroccan police also confiscated 1,000 liters of gasoline and 760 kilograms of counterfeit tobacco. Last month, customs at Laayoune set on fire hundreds of boxes of contraband cigarettes, 1,480 liters of brandy, and a few dozen kilograms of cannabis resin and “kif” cannabis.

Rabat – French President Emmanuel Macron is at the center of a controversy after his comments on the Muslim veil, or hijab, as it is known in Islam. On Thursday, October 24, the French president told  reporters that the wearing of hijabs in public spaces is not his “business.” “However, in public services, at school and while educating children, the headscarf issue is my business. That is what secularism is about,” he added. The French president continued that in some neighborhoods in France, “some people use the headscarf as a symbol to break one’s connection with the republic.” Macron’s comments came two weeks after French far-right politician Julien Odoul requested that a veiled woman remove her hijab at a plenary meeting of the Regional Council of Burgundy-Franche-Comte on Friday, October 11. The Muslim woman was accompanying her son at a school activity for children to explore the mission of the “democratic assembly.” The attack on the Muslim woman prompted discussions on the wearing of hijabs in public spaces. Macron’s statement received drew criticism from both Muslims and parties against the hijab in public spaces. France has a rapidly growing Muslim population. World Population Review said that the population in France is estimated to be 65.10 million in 2019. Muslims represent 8% of the population or six million. France is also one of the European countries with the highest levels of Islamophobia. The Organization against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) announced that Islamophobic attacks increased by 52%  in 2018 compared with 2017.  Recently, the deputy editor of French newspaper Le Figaro Yves Thread said on national television that he hates Islam religion. “If I see a Muslim woman on the same bus as I am, I’ll leave the bus,” he said during debate show  “Le Grand Soir” (the Big Evening) broadcast on LCI on October 14,

Rabat – Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) has released a note underlining the dire living conditions of women in rural Morocco. The explanatory note, which HCP released to commemorate the International Day of Rural Women on October 15, provides data and statistics about rural women’s socio-economic situation, as well as the constraints holding back social development in rural regions. The female population of Morocco’s rural areas is currently estimated at 6.5 million. Women represent almost half of the rural population (49.2%) and have significant human potential, as 59.4% of them are of working-age (15-59 years), while 29.6% are under 15. Only 11% of the demographic is over 60 years old. Meanwhile, the life expectancy at birth for rural women stands at 75.3 years compared to 79.6 years for urban women and 78.2 years for women on a national average. The population of women in rural areas of childbearing age (15-49 years) stands at 3.3 million, compared to 6.2 million women in urban areas. The HCP note also released information on antenatal care and medical treatment. The rate of rural women who received specialized antenatal care is 79.6%, compared to 95.6% of urban women, and 88.5% at the national level.  The statistics showed 73.7% of childbirth in rural areas were in health facilities, compared to 96% in urban areas. According to the HCP statistics, only 70.3% use contraceptives, against 71.1% of urban women. The maternal mortality rate in rural areas is more than twice the rate in Morocco’s urban areas, with 111.1 per 100,000 rural women losing their lives in labor compared to 44.6 in urban areas. While a fundamental right in Moroccan Law, access to education remains more of a concept than a reality for the rural female population. The rate of pre-school enrollment for rural girls stood at 25.4% in 2019. Meanwhile, 53.9% of their counterparts in urban areas attend pre-school.   At the primary school level, the rate jumped to 101.55% in 2017-2018, compared to 96.2% for urban girls, 98.5% for girls at the national level, and 102.54% for rural boys. At the high school level (11-14 years old), their rate decreases notably to 39.73%, compared with 80.15% for urban girls, 62.62% for girls nationwide and 40.46% for rural boys. The rate at the college level (14-18 years old) was, however, as low as 12.48% against 57.39% for urban girls, 38.1% for girls at the national level, and 19% for rural boys. According to the HCP note, the gap in the attendance rates stems from a high level of high school and college dropouts in rural areas, especially amongst female students.  Alarmingly, 6.9% of girls in rural areas drop out of primary school.  Although rural women represent an important human capital for the country’s development, they are still vulnerable to many obstacles. These include extremely limited access to education and a very high school dropout rate, HCP pointed out. At the college level, the school dropout rate of rural girls stood at 16.8%, compared to 4.8% for urban girls and 8% for girls nationwide. In 2014, HCP pointed out that illiteracy is more common among rural women, with a rate of 60%, against 31% for urban women. Despite the discrepancies in the living conditions of urban and rural women, in terms of employment, the rural population comes out op top. The employment rate for women in rural areas is higher than that of urban women, estimated at 28.7% and 13.8% respectively. In general, however, opportunities in rural settings are limited to a few sectors. Rural women are widely active in agriculture, forestry, and fishing (35.4%), and handicrafts (22%). Despite the level of job opportunities, the rural women’s unemployment rate scored low 3.1%, compared to 25% for urban women. HCP explained that the low valuation of women’s activity in rural areas is due to several factors. The first factor is that the majority of women’s jobs are unskilled.  Agriculture represents 93.6% of rural jobs however, 90% of jobs do not require degree-level qualifications. Meanwhile, women in urban areas work mainly in the “services” sector (70.4%), where most activities require a university or vocational degree. A second and related factor is that 32% of active rural women in employment have no degree, compared to 9.6% in urban areas, while only 13.6% of rural women report an average level of education. Lastly, 60.3% of employed rural women are homemakers, and their employment is generally unpaid, as nearly 70.5% of them do not receive any compensation for their work.

Rabat – The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) located on Sunday, October 27 a region in the province of Ouazzane in northern Morocco. Members of the recently dismantled terror cell were planning to hide at the site after carrying out terror attacks in several regions of Morocco. The region is located on the heights of Brichka, a rural area in the province of Ouazzane. The BCIJ staff took three suspects to the site as part of the ongoing investigation.  The BCIJ dismantled a seven-member cell on Friday, October 27 in different regions. The security forces arrested some suspects in Dar Bouazza, a coastal town in the Casablanca-Settat region,  in addition to other suspects in Ouazzane, and Chefchaouen. The suspects were plotting attacks in both Casablanca and Ouazzane a few days ahead of their arrest.  The mastermind of the dismantled ISIS-linked cell as well as two members recorded two videos to pledge allegiance to the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In the footage they threaten to commit terror operations in Morocco and to proclaim a “province affiliated the terrorist organization under the name the “Daech Wilaya in the Islamic Maghreb,” 2M reported. The dismantling of the terror cell comes a few days after US President Donald Trump announced the death of the ISIS leader al Baghdadi in a US-led raid in Idlib, Syria. Trump said that DNA tests confirmed that the man who died in a tunnel on Saturday, October 26 was al Baghdadi.  The US president said that the ISIS leader spent his last moments in fear and frustration. On Sunday, October 27, spokesman of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), Boubker Sabik, said that the cell was preparing to release a video after their plotted attacks in several sensitive places across Morocco to spread fear. Sabik, who spoke to 2M last night, commented on the location chosen by the cell to hide after the attacks. He said that the cell chooses the location “because it is known for its rough terrain that are difficult to access.” “On the other hand, [ the region was selected] due to  living conditions that are available because of its proximity to a valley,” he added. The DGSN’s spokesperson emphasized that the region is difficult to identify using geo-coordinates. Morocco’s security forces, including the BCIJ, have a good reputation at the international level. The 2018 Country Reports on Terrorism by the US Department of State emphasized that Morocco has a “comprehensive counterterrorism strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation.”

Rabat – Moroccan athlete Othmane El Goumri finished first at the 2019 Dublin Marathon with a record time of 2:08:05. The competition took place yesterday, October 27, in the Irish capital. El Goumri’s performance was the fastest the annual event has seen since its launch in 1980. The previous record holder was the Kenyan runner Geoffrey Ndungu, who won the race twice in 2011 and 2012. His 2011 finish in 2:08:33 was the event’s record until this year. The Moroccan runner outpaced Irish athlete Stephen Scullion, finishing ahead of him by less than four seconds. More than 22,500 athletes from 50 different countries participated in this year’s Dublin marathon. This achievement isn’t El Goumri’s first. Born in 1992, the long-distance runner represented Morocco in two outdoor athletics world championships and one indoor world championship. In 2013, El Goumri won the marathon at the Francophone Games in Nice, France. He also finished second in the Mediterranean Games in Mersin, Turkey, and third in the Islamic Solidarity Games in Palembang, Indonesia. In 2016, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) sanctioned El Goumri for irregularities in his biological passport, an electronic document presenting the results of anti-drug tests. Following the incident, the Moroccan Royal Athletics Federation (FRMA) suspended the runner from competing for two years. This year, as his suspension ended, El Goumri participated in several marathons in Morocco. He finished second in Rabat marathon, in April, and in Marrakech marathon, in September.

The festival, directed by Moroccan anthropologist Faouzi Skali, took place from October 19 to 26. While the evening performances were scheduled to take place at Fez’s iconic Jnan Sbil park, most of the concerts were held in a municipal building far from the medina due to heavy rain.  The festival’s opening ceremony featured the world premiere of “creation artistique Al Shushtari Prince des troubadours” by Moroccan artist Mostafa Amri, under the creative direction of Carole Latifa Ameer.

Carole Latifa Ameer, the festival’s artistic director, appeared especially moved by this performance as she swayed to the rhythm in her front-and-center seat.  Monday’s music featured the Tariqa Sharqawiya ensemble. This brotherhood originated in southern Morocco and dates back to the 2nd second century.  Tuesday, October 21 presented audience members with a refreshing change of scenery. In contrast to the traditional white robes worn by previous groups, five performers in the Tariqa Rissouniya ensemble donned blue robes.  The color choice was a tribute to the signature blue of Chefchaouen, the group’s hometown.  Tariqa Rissouniya specializes in Andalusian music. After three nights of group performances, Wednesday featured a concert by Moroccan Sufi singer Azzeddine Alaoui-Addach, followed by poetry and music from the city of Fez.  Tariqa Sqalliya and Tariqa Halvetiya performed on Thursday night.  The Tariqa Halvetiya group is of the Khalwati Sufi brotherhood, which originated in western Afghanistan more than 500 years ago. The Khalwati order is now popular in Turkey, where it is known as Halveti.  Friday night featured music by the Moroccan Sufi music group Ibn Arabi. The concert’s attendees were delighted to see to the group’s founder, Ahmed Lakhlii, in the performance. Sufism: Promoting a positive image of Islam The festival’s closing ceremony took place on Saturday, October 26 under the creative direction of Carole Latifa Ameer.  Music by Moroccan singer Fatima-Zohra Qortobi and Iraninan singer Farzaneh Joorabchi delighted the audience.  Turkish singer Ferhat Oguz Korc performed alongside whirling dervishes. The Sufi dervishes with their tall hats and flowing skirts are perhaps the most iconic symbols of Sufism.  The ceremony featured narrations by Moroccan actress Amal Ayouch, Iranian translator Leili Anvar, Syrian poet Khaled Roumo, and French theologian Theophile de Wallensbourg. Every year, the festival’s director Fouazi Skali publicizes the event as a way to spread a positive image of Islam and “consolidate the positioning of Morocco in the intercultural dialogue by throwing a bridge between East and West.” As with previous years, the Sufi music performances by various ensembles and solo artists were certainly the highlight of the 12th annual Fez Festival of Sufi Culture.

 Rabat – CineAtlas, a multi-screen entertainment company, is set to open new movie theaters in the Moroccan cities of Tangier and El Jadida. The Tangier multiplex is expected to open in the third quarter of 2020, while the El Jadida theater  will open in the second quarter of next year. Ouvertures CINEATLAS Tanger et El jadida Bonne nouvelle pour nos amis de Tanger et d’El Jadida, CINEATLAS y déploie son concept de salles de cinéma PREMIUM – ouvertures en 2020 Posted by Cineatlas on Friday, 25 October 2019 The announcement of the new openings comes one year after CineAtlas started operating in Morocco. The company renovated the old Colisee cinema in Rabat, and opened its doors for visitors in August 2018. The new CineAtlas in El Jadida will have three screens and will be located on El Jadida’s beach, near McDonald’s restaurant. The company plans to  build the new movie venue on a 1,100 square meters plot. In Tangier, CineAtlas will renovate the old Mauritania cinema. The renovated establishment will offer five different screens, an outdoor restaurant, and a cafe with entertainment space. Tangier’s CineAtlas will have three floors, each of them covering over 1,000 square meters. The director of CineAtlas, Pierre-Francois Bernet, told the press that “the programming will be more or less the same as the one in Rabat, with both national and international movies, but it will also adapt to the public of each city.” CineAtlas’ expansion in Morocco is in its infancy. According to Bernet, the business is planning to open more venues in the future in Casablanca, Kenitra, Larache, Meknes, Agadir, and Laayoune. CineAtlas Rabat has recorded more than 190,000 visits since its opening. The number exceeded the initial expectations of the director, estimated at 160,000 visits. Bernet also expressed that CineAtlas are not afraid of competition from Megarama that is opening new cinemas across the country. “There are so few cinemas in Morocco. It gives us time before we start to feel any competition,” said the director. The director told Morocco World News that before the 1980s, Morocco was one of the most vibrant markets in terms of movie theaters. The kingdom’s 300 cinemas were notable for their large capacities (800 to 1500 seats on average). Out of the 300 cinemas that were operating in Morocco in the 1980s, only 30 are still functioning. “Unfortunately, Moroccan business operators have not been able to take the step to modernize their movie theaters the way Western operators did between 1990 and 2000,” said Bernet, citing the example of the failure to introduce complexes and multiplexes. The Frenchman added that he was fortunate to have been encouraged by Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM)’s staff of film professionals and producers to start his CineAtlas project. The entrepreneur noted that Morocco is a country “on the lookout for opportunities to seize,” concluding it is “a country that has business in the blood.”

Rabat – The Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad (CCME) has issued a statement condemning the burning of a Moroccan flag during a march in Paris over the weekend. The council said the act was “cowardly,” “childish,” and “barbaric.” Protesters marched in Paris on Saturday, October 26, to mark three years since the death of Mohcine Fikri. The fishmonger’s death ignited the Hirak Rif protests across Morocco’s northern Rif region in 2016 and 2017. Some protesters, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), burned the Moroccan flag. Others marched carrying flags representing the Amazigh (Berber) people, the Rif region, and even the Catalan flag. “The desecration of the national flag is a criminal act that has nothing to do with freedom of expression,” stated CCME Secretary-General Abdellah Boussouf on Sunday. Saturday’s protest saw some calling for independence for the Rif region, waving flags of the republic established by Moroccan hero Mohamed Ben Abdelkrim El Khattabi. El Khattabi briefly liberated some of the Rif region from Spain at the Battle of Anoual in the 1920s. The German Maghreb-Post outlet noted that the crowd in Paris was a “manageable” size. A smaller protest also occurred in Fez.  One outlet reported Polisario supporters also joined the Paris protest. Mohcine Fikri died in a garbage truck in the northern city of Al Hoceima when he tried to retrieve fish that police had confiscated. Someone activated the truck’s crushing mechanism, killing Fikri. Fikri’s work in the informal sector and his death became a symbol of the Rif region’s economic and social marginalization. Protests rocked the Rif region from late 2016 into 2017, ultimately leading to the arrest of dozens of protest leaders. In June 2018, a Moroccan court handed down prison sentences for over 50 Hirak Rif activists. Along with three others, leader Nasser Zefzafi received a 20-year prison sentence. Earlier this month, Zefzafi had called for the protest in Paris on Saturday. National and international organizations have called the release of Zefzafi and the other Hirak Rif activists. While some activists received royal pardons, the leaders remain in prison. Morocco’s Penal Code allows for the prosecution of those burning a Moroccan flag. If convicted of showing “contempt of the emblem and symbols of the kingdom,” individuals can face six months to three years in prison.

The operation is part of Morocco’s strategy to fight drug trafficking across Morocco. Last month, Moroccan customs destroyed massive amounts of smuggled drugs. Customs in the city of Laayoune incinerated 1,942 kilograms of cannabis resin and other illegal drugs. The incinerated drugs included 471 packets of contraband cigarettes, 7 kilograms of cannabis resin, 37 kilograms of “kif” ( a type of cannabis). During the operation, authorities also destroyed 731 grams f cocaine, 25.73 kilograms of snuff, in addition to 11,285 psychotropic tablets. This destruction and incineration operation is part of sanitation campaigns carried out by the security services and local authorities to combat all forms of smuggling.

Rabat – The Royal Institute for Strategic Studies has released its latest report, classing countries by reputation. The report ranked Morocco 35th in the world with a score of  58.8 out of 100, placing the North African country among the countries with the most positive reputations. “The reputation of Morocco among the G8 [Group of eight] countries’ citizens experienced a slight improvement in 2019 and scored 58.8 points (out of 100) in the Country RepTrak Pulse I indicator.” The Group of Eight countries refers to highly industrialized countries, such as Russia, Canada, Japan, Italy, the UK, France, and the US. The report shows that the pulse indicator takes into account several criteria to come up with a final finding, including the admiration, esteem, confidence, and good impression that G8 citizens have for other countries. Morocco’s score rose up by 0.7 points compared to the 2018 results, the executive summary of the report said. “If we consider that the global average for countries measured by G8  is 59.8 points, we can observe that Morocco is in line with the average reputation within the study, at the same 35th position as last year,” .” Morocco maintains good diplomatic ties and trade activities with each country in the G8. The Office of the US States Trade Representative shared statistics about trade activities between Rabat and Washington, stipulating that Morocco is the US’ 64th “largest trading partner with $4.5billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2018.” The office indicates that exports reached £2.9 billion, while goods imports totaled £1.6 billion. Morocco’s weakness Despite being a politically stable country, several internal crises lost points for Morocco, including the education system. “Morocco’s weaknesses, when compared to the average of the countries analyzed, are related to the attributes that measure the education system, the knowledge of its brands and companies and the technological capacity of the country.” Recent statistics from the High Commission for Planning (HCP) show low numbers of girls enrolled at schools in Morocco’s rural areas. The statistics indicate that the pre-school enrolment rate for girls in rural areas stood at 25.4% in 2019, against 53.9% for urban girls. The drop-out rate among rural girls is 6.9% for primary school compared to 4.7 % for city dwellers. Internal reputation The report also pointed out other issues, such as internal reputation crises in Morocco. The report said that “globally, citizen’s perception of their own country (internal perception) is more positive than the external one. But Morocco is following another trend.” The report said that the difference between internal and external reputation is only 1.5 points in 2019 against 8.8 in 2018. “[It is] mostly because of the decline in internal reputation,” the report finds. The report believes that for Moroccans, a good country is where you can find “welcoming people, being a beautiful country  and being a safe place.” In addition to the G8,  the report also evaluated  17 other countries’ perception about Morocco. The ranking cited Mexico as an example. “Mexico also appreciates Morocco, giving the country a more moderate score (60.4 Pulse points).” The report listed Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, and New Zealand as the top five countries with the “best reputation.”

Rabat – During a roundtable discussion at the 12th annual Fez Festival of Sufi Culture on Tuesday, October 22, a French-speaking audience member ordered another attendee to remove her hijab before posing a question to the panel. Before a shocked panel of scholars, headed by the festival’s director Faouzi Skali, a predominantly French audience looked on as the Moroccan woman defended her right to wear the hijab.   Nearly every day of the Sufi festival, Skali held roundtable discussions at Riad Dar Batha, a cultural center owned by the French Institute in Fez.  Tuesday’s roundtable theme was “the practice of non-violence on a daily basis.” After the panel’s speakers concluded their points, Skali invited the audience to come forward with questions and comments.  A woman wearing a hijab held the microphone. She was poised to ask the panel a question when another woman in the audience interrupted her. In French, the woman told her to remove her hijab before speaking. While the nationality and ethnic origins of the woman are unknown, her accent suggested to other audience members that she lives in France.  Unsurprisingly, chaos ensued.  “You don’t have the right to tell me what to wear,” the Moroccan woman exclaimed in French, as other audience members began to stir.  “We’re in a Muslim country,” she continued. “Even if we weren’t in a Muslim country, it’s my right to wear the hijab.” As the argument between the two women heated up, the Muslim woman rose to her feet—not in an act of aggression, but to make her presence known and her voice heard above the clamoring audience.  Skali, who seemed to know the Muslim woman personally, asked her to calm down so the panel could address the issue in a diplomatic manner.  The Muslim woman excused herself to Skali in Darija (Moroccan dialect), but returned her focus to the French woman: “This is an Islamic festival, and you’re telling me to remove the hijab?”  A case of ironic elitism Attendees at a festival of Islamic culture in a Muslim country may have been surprised to hear such comments on the hijab.  While Sufi culture has a focus on individuality and introspection, the attack on the Muslim woman’s personal choice was, at the very least, anachronistic.  It’s unlikely that the French woman left Riad Dar Batha that morning with a refreshed view of the hijab. The Muslim woman, on the other hand, left Riad Dar Batha carrying the weight of a publicized, personal attack.  This case of ironic elitism at the Fez Festival of Sufi Culture highlighted the disconnect between its organizers’ agenda and the outlook of some of its attendees.  A history of discrimination This instance of a French woman making discriminatory remarks against a hijabi Moroccan during a scholarly discussion of non-violence in daily life is perhaps linked to the rise of Islamophobia in France. France is becoming a hotbed for Islamophobia, according to a number of media sources, social analysts, academics, and activists. In addition to discriminatory laws enacted under the cloak of secularist ideology, there is a growing prevalence of anti-Muslim sentiment among French political parties, and hate crimes against Muslims.  Despite France’s strong political and economic ties with Morocco and other Muslim countries, the discriminatory legacy of colonialism has carried on into the modern age, especially as France now faces an unprecedented number of Muslim refugees and migrants. France prides itself on its cornerstone secular ideology, or “laicite:” the strict separation of religion and state. This prohibits all religious symbols—including those found in clothing and accessories—in public schools. The recent history of French mobilization against the hijab began in 1989 when three Muslim girls were suspended from school for refusing to remove their heardscarves during class.  Fifteen years later, French parliament passed a law in 2004 barring Muslim students from attending classes while wearing the hijab.  In 2010, former president Nicolas Sarkozy banned the full-face veil from all public spaces in France.  “Anti-burkini decrees” infiltrated public debate during the summer of 2016 as French mayors worked to prohibit Muslim women from wearing swimsuits that covered their bodies completely.  Each of these controversies stem from the narrative that “the hijab is an oppressive tool used by Muslim men to hide and silence Muslim women,” says Al Jazeera contributor Rokhaya Diallo.  Most recently, a member of France’s National Rally asked a Muslim woman to remove her hijab at a plenary meeting of the Regional Council of Burgundy-Franche-Comte on October 11. The woman was accompanying her son on a school trip.  French public figures responded by calling upon president Emmanuel Macron to denounce Islamophobia in France, in an open letter published on October 16 in the French newspaper Le Monde. The incident at the roundtable on Tuesday is eerily similar to that which took place at the plenary meeting, but with a crucial difference in context.  While derogatory remarks towards Muslims are unfortunately commonplace in France, it is startling to see Islamophobia rearing its ugly head at an Islamic festival in a Muslim country.

Rabat – When approaching development projects in Morocco, or simply building a business, a good understanding of Moroccan socio-economics is necessary. In any of Morocco’s cities, it is evident that people in the same place belong to different socio-economic structures: the “old economy,” the “new economy,” and the in-between “unstructured economy.” Failing to understand the dynamics of each one and how they interact will likely lead to the failure of a social or economic project, such as those with the goal of lowering poverty or violence. A few decades ago, most Moroccans belonged to the old economy. Characterized by a large family structure, houses hold extended families, and most of the rooms are shared. The majority of people’s food is produced locally and cooked at home. People use traditional medicine when they get sick, and pregnant women rely on a midwife, called the “kabla,” to deliver their babies at home. However, with a lack of modern medicine, some people die from childbirth or illnesses that are easily treatable. In the old economy, people are financially backed by their families, and in case of major need, they collect money from the village members who give depending on their financial ability. Life in the countryside is also hard physical work and requires long hours. People who might want to pursue an “intellectual” career do not have the opportunity. While there were many good things about traditional life, some people are drawn towards life in the city, in the “new economy.” In the new economy, families are smaller. People rely less on their children when they get old, and almost every working person gets insurance and retirement plans. The family structure does not support parents or siblings financially. In Morocco, people in the new economy have enough resources to get visas to Europe, the US, and Canada. Usually, the parents are educated, and they can interact with the international economy. They have access to goods and services at international prices, like restaurants, clothing brands, home appliances, and mobile phones. They can basically get the same goods as a middle-class person living in Europe or the US. In between these two stable, structured economies is where many Moroccans live today. Many of them are the second or third generation of those who have emigrated from small villages to live in big cities. But they have not yet integrated into the new economy. This migration has created a culture that is unstable in which people are lost and confused. Old people from the rural areas, or “learoubiya,” know this very well. In some cases, people lack the security of their families and communities, and yet they have no insurance or retirement plans. Some have to support their parents or siblings, yet they lack access to insurance, retirement, and all the social benefits the new economy provides. The struggle of this generation is illustrated by a conversation my father had with an older man. My father was a principal for a grade school in a remote village near Guercif, a city in northern Morocco halfway between Fez and the Algerian border, and sought to encourage education. Once, he was talking to an old man about the benefits of school and how important it is to send children to school. The old man replied that they were afraid that sending their children to school would leave them with no future. He explained that the children who went to school would soon have to move to a big city to continue their high school. In some cases, children have to move out at an earlier age to continue their grade school studies because of a lack of schools near home. The parents must pay the full cost, and often children have to live with other older children in shared apartments. Parents have very little money to pay for their children’s rent, food, and books. In some cases, children are by themselves with no adult supervision to monitor and help them solve their problems. Most of these children return to their villages without finishing their studies, yet they do not know how to work their lands. Older people describe them as “wearing a shirt with a pen and slick-backed hair and unable to work the land.” If these students stay in the city, the most they can earn is around MAD 2,000 ($208) per month, without a formal work contract or insurance. If they go back to their villages, they are basically useless since they no longer know how to live like their parents. It is at that point when people lose their old values but have not transitioned all the way to enjoy a modern way of living. The jump from one way of living to another has left many people doubting their parent’s values and not fully understanding the values of the new social structure they are entering. It is common in Morocco to hear older people complaining about the younger generations and how the children have lost respect, manners, and seriousness. Imagine a young man whose parents have emigrated from a small village to a big city. With all the cultural baggage they have, most likely he will have a large family, at least four siblings, and probably a stay-at-home mother who feels she is losing control of her children as they grow. Since most of the parents in this situation are illiterate, they cannot help their children with their homework. One mother like this told me that her child did not want her to go to his school because he is embarrassed by how she talks and dresses. Children no longer see their parents and traditional values as an example to follow. Parents cannot help their children compete in the new world. Mothers are illiterate and cannot communicate with their children’s teachers, and fathers are working hard and serving others for a mediocre salary of MAD 1,500 MAD ($156) per month that does not allow the family to make it to the end of the month. Most of these children drop out of school before high school. Imagine a young man walking into a brand store where one pair of shoes could cost as much as half of his monthly salary. Imagine him passing by a restaurant where lunch could cost two days’ salary. He needs to work four months to buy an iPhone. All these things would not be appealing to his parents who grew up in farms and villages. They have no desire for a smart phone and no habit of eating out. They comment on how the pair of shoes or the phone is overpriced. But how does the teenager view this? An iPhone, designer shoes, and eating out is appealing to a young person. People in the unstructured economy cannot afford what the new economy is offering: Access to a functioning labor market, insurance, and retirement. But they also do not enjoy the space, simple life, large family, and community support their parents had. Young people lose faith in society and try to earn a living their way, and poverty, bribery, delinquency, and unemployment become a culture. Health insurance and retirement are products that most Moroccans cannot afford. I found out how impractical they can be in a conversation with Jalal, a 28-year-old man. I was trying to convince Jalal how important insurance is and how having insurance could save him from poverty in case he gets sick. He was quiet for a few seconds, and then he explained that in his case it does not make any sense to spend a third of his MAD 2,000 ($208) monthly salary to buy insurance. Rent and food come first. Then he explained that it is more likely his 60-year-old mother will get sick than himself. So he determined to save the insurance money because he can spend it on better uses. Jalal’s activity does not meet the modern economy’s criteria in which activities are registered and taxed, people are insured and have retirement accounts. His work is viewed as marginal, temporary, and in a sector that will be absorbed by the formal economy over the years. Economists label this kind of activity as “informal,” and it is seen as a temporary phenomenon that will disappear over the years. However, decades have passed since this term was defined in the 1950s, and it is clearly not a temporary condition in Morocco. Jalal’s work meets his needs; it pays for his food, rent, and his mother’s medical bills. Jobs like Jalal’s are a natural evolution of a society that is in transition from a traditional to a modern economy. Because the unstructured economy involves a large part of the Moroccan population, the country needs policies that give it the structure it lacks. Public services have to be re-designed around the needs and abilities of these Moroccans. Morocco’s old and new economies are both stable structures with defined values. But the unstructured economy requires public policies that focus on information, healthcare, and retirement management to improve these people’s lives.

Rabat – The Ministry of Education, Vocational Training, and Higher Education has denied having approved a textbook featuring a map of Morocco without its southern provinces in Western Sahara. In a statement it issued on Saturday, October 26, the ministry, referencing reports by a number of online news outlets that it had approved a French language textbook which depicted a Western Sahara-less Morocco map, firmly denied the reports.  The ministry “denied that the book entitled ‘Je lis avec Mona’ (I read with Mona),published by a French publishing house, is on the list of approved textbooks.” The ministry added that it will take “necessary steps” against the parties concerned. For Morocco,  its territorial integrity, which includes the recognition of its historical and legal claims over its southern provinces,  is “a red Line.”  Earlier this week, Omar hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative at the UN, reiterated the “Moroccanness of Western Sahara,” pointing out  that Western Sahara is part and parcel of Morocco’s sovereignty.  Over the years, the Moroccan government has continuously condemned any move that question Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara. In December 2018, Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) tweeted a divided Moroccan map.  The FRMF contacted the UAFA to warn it against the move. The AUFA subsequently deleted the truncated map, stating that it was an “unintentional mistake.”

Rabat – US President Donald Trump has confirmed the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US-led military operation in Syria on October 26. Trump said that Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest after special forces arrested him at the end of a tunnel. Trump made his statement on Baghdadi’s death today morning, confirming earlier reports that the notorious terrorist leader died following a US-led military raid in eastern Syria. Trump considers al-Baghdadi’s killing as both a personal victory–“wiping out ISIS” had been among his campaign promises–and an important step in the global fight against terrorism. The US president said that al-Baghdadi died after he was running into a dead-end tunnel in Idlib in Syria “whimpering, crying and screaming all the way.” Three of al-Baghdadi’s young children were also killed during the suicide detonation. A BBC report has also confirmed the death of the ISIS leader.  The blast “mutilated Baghdadi’s body but DNa tests confirmed his identity,” said the report. Speaking with pride, Trump described al-Baghdadi as a “thug.” “The thug who tried so had to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.”

Rabat – A senior US military source said that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is believed to have been killed in a US-led military raid in northwest Syria on Saturday, October 26. Senior US defense official and another source with knowledge on the case told CNN that al-Baghdadi “detonated a suicide vest” during the US military raid in Idlib, Syria. The final confirmation is pending DNA test to confirm the news.. US President Donald Trump is expected to make a statement on the matter later today.  The White House said that Trump will make a “major statement” at 9:00 p.m. local time. Special operations commandos conducted the raid. The CIA helped in detecting the location of the ISIS leader. Iraqi forces also helped in providing “important information,” Major General Tahseen al-Khafaji told CNN. Reports on the death of al-Baghdadi multiplied in the past two years. In each instance, however, ISIS would ridicule the news by releasing a new video message featuring al-Baghdadi.  In the video recordings, Al-Baghdadiusually  appeared sitting cross-legged on the ground next to an assault rifle. In his latest video in July, the ISIS leader,  who was the subject of an international manhunt for years, announced the end of the battle for Baghouz, a town in eastern Syria which was home to the terrorist group’s last stronghold in the region.

Rabat – The British ambassador to Morocco, Thomas Reilly, has renewed his country’s commitment to the UN-moderated political process in Western Sahara, echoing the prevailing consensus around the necessity of a compromise-based resolution.  Speaking on  Saturday, OCtober 26, in a brief interview with Moroccan television channel 2M,   the British diplomat said that his country supports a “just, pragmatic, sustainable,  mutually acceptable and compromise-based” political solution to the territorial dispute.  The UK, he argued, “understands very well the importance and the centrality” of the  Western Sahara conflict for Morocco. Referring to the ongoing political process to broker a lasting settlement  in the longstanding conflict, he said the United Nations must play an exclusive role in the political efforts, he said. “It’s up to the United Nations to find a solution and we have to find the solution through the United Nations,” Reilly said. This emphasizes the exclusivity of the UN as the only body as the only legitimate–and  responsible–entity to help find a mutually acceptable solution for the conflict. London is  part of the permanent members of the Security Council, which is set to vote on a new resolution on the conflict on October 30. The resolution is set to extend the mandate of the peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, commonly known as MINURSO.  The mandate of the mission will expire on October 31. Reilly also spoke favorably of Morocco’s settlement proposal for the decades-long dispute. He said that the UK“welcomes the serious and credible efforts of Morocco to find a solution to the conflict.” Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, which was submitted to the UN in 2007, has been described by most members of the Security Council, notably France and the US,  as a “serious and credible” political solution to the conflict. Meanwhile, that sentiment was echoed at the latest UN General assembly, with a growing number of UN member states saluting Morocco’s “serious and pragmatic” settlement proposal.  This, coupled with Morocco’s development strategy for its southern provinces, has buttressed the prevailing notion that Morocco’s proposal is the surest and most feasible way out of the diplomatic stalemate in Western Sahara. For the first time in decades of negotiations, the former UN envoy for Western Sahara, the German Horst Kohler, succeeded in convincing Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Polisario Front to sit at the same negotiating table in December 2018 and March 2019 in Geneva. Reilly hinted at the momentum built under Kohler, stressing that the conflicting parties in Western Sahara should “redouble their efforts” to find a mutually acceptable solution. He said  that his country welcomed the progress made through the two Geneva round tables.  The ambassador’s remarks come  in the aftermath of a “continuity agreement” between Rabat and London to preserve the “strategic relations” between the two countries despite Brexit.  The agreement, signed yesterday in London, “guarantees the continuity of our relations after Brexit,” according to Ambassador Reilly.

Rabat – Former Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune wants to run in the next Algerian presidential election. The former minister submitted his presidential bid on October 26 along with nine other candidates. The candidates submitted their applications to the National Independent Authority for the Elections, the Algerian news agency APS reported. Deposed Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika sacked Tebboune in 2017, only three months after he was appointed. Bouteflika sacked Tebboune for his alleged public criticism of the Algerian presidency. In addition to Tebboune, several other former Algerian officials also seek a place at the Mouradia Palace, the main presidential palace in Algeria. Former prime minister and chairman of the Talaie El Houriat party Ali Benflis and former Cmture Minister and Secretary General of National Democratic Rally (RND) Azzedine Mihoubi are also among the candidates. Saturday midnight was the deadline for the submission of candidacy bids. Algerian authorities announced that the presidential polls will open on December 12 to elect a new president after the forced resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who ruled the country for after four consecutive five-year mandates.  Protests swept Algeria since February, with protesters calling for a radical change. Algerian citizens are not satisfied with the decision of some prominent faces of the Bouteflika regime to run for president.  An essential part of the ongoing demonstrations is a desire to inspire a radical rupture from the Bouteflika establishment.  The protesters, young students or unemployed graduates in their majority, have consistently called for an effective generational change in politics. Most recently,  they have also threatened boycotting the election.  Amid widespread perception that the surviving faces of the Bouteflika years are keen on paving the way for a facade of change, demonstrators have called on the interim to resign. On Friday, October 25, thousands of Algerians flooded the streets to reiterate their rejection to the army-backed December election. Despite the threats from the army to arrest protesters, Algerians are determined to continue to defend their rights for reforms before election.

Rabat – Police in Beni Mathar, 80 kilometers south of Oujda in Eastern Morocco, have arrested a French national subject to an arrest warrant from  Interpol. A statement from the General Directorate of National  Security (DGSN) said that the police arrested the suspect on October 22.  The French national was a subject to international arrest warrant for his involvement in an “intentional murder” he is believed to have commited in France on May 28. The  Frenchman had been living in Morocco illegally at the moment of his arrest, according to the DGSN statement. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation pending extradition procedure. The police notified French police of the arrest. Morocco’s security strategy is based on cooperation to fight against cross-border crimes. France and Morocco share regular partnership in different fields, including the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism. This is not the first time that Morocco has assisted its international partners as part of its membership in the Interpol. In April, the police in the Moroccan coastal city of Essaouira arrested another French national for links to an international drug trafficking ring. He had been the subject of an international arrest warrant from French authorities since 2017. Last week, police also arrested a French national for practicing plastic surgeries illegally in Morocco. The Interpol has an office in Rabat. Morocco has been a member of Interpol since June 17, 1957.

Rabat – This delicious and wholesome soup is a traditional part of Morocco’s Ramadan iftar (breakfast). It is full of protein and has a comforting, homely taste that fills you up immediately after a day of fasting. However, it is also the perfect way to start the day throughout the year, particularly in cold or rainy weather. As with most traditional recipes, methods for making Harira vary from region to region and from family to family. In south-eastern Morocco, the soup is made with vegetables instead of legumes like Kale and fava beans as a base.  Some people prefer to add a beaten egg at the last step of cooking harira, and others like to squeeze some lemon juice to their harira bowl. In my family, we serve the soup with hard-boiled eggs chopped up.  This recipe is one of the staples for any Moroccan cook, so take notes!  First of all, you will need: 200-grams of red meat, cut into small cubes ½ cup of chickpeas, soaked overnight 3 tablespoon of lentils, washed and drained ¼ cup of cilantro, finely chopped¼ cup of parsley, finely chopped 2 celery sticks with a few leaves, finely chopped 4 tomatoes, boiled for 10minutes 1 onion, finely chopped 1 tablespoon of ghee or butter 50-grams of broken vermicelli 2 tablespoon of tomato paste 1 teaspoon of turmeric 1 teaspoon of salt ½ teaspoon of black pepper ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground ginger A pinch of saffron threads 2 tablespoon of oil 200-grams of flour 2 and half liters of water This recipe has three important steps, let’s get going with the first stage: Heat a pressure cooker on medium heat, add oil, meat ghee, and onion. Stir and let cook for five minutes. Now, ddd spices, chickpeas, lentils, cilantro and half of parsley, and 1 and ½ liters of water then cover the pot and cook for 40 minutes, or until the meat and chickpeas are tender. Ready for step two? Using a food processor, chop the boiled tomatoes and sift it to remove all the seeds. Meanwhile, after 40 minutes, uncover the pot and check if the meat and chickpeas are tender.  Add the rest of water, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and the other half of parsley and stir well. Put the pot back on the stove and simmer for 5 minutes. Finally: Mix the flour with 2 cups of water using a whipper or a blender. Add the mixture while stirring constantly so the flour does not stick to the bottom, the soup should now begin to thicken.  Let the harira cook for another 10 minutes then add the vermicelli. Keep stirring while cooking for another 20 minutes. Taste the harira soup and add salt if needed. Now you’re ready to serve your soup. It tastes best accompanied by dates and some sweet Moroccan chebakia.  Enjoy!

Rabat – Morocco and the UK have signed an “Association Agreement” to ensure that the two countries maintain their relationships unscathed when the UK leaves the EU. The agreement was signed earlier today in London by Morocco’s Nasser Bourita and Andrew Murrison, the British State Minister for International Development and the Middle East. It stipulates that Brexit will not affect the “strategic relations” between Rabat and London signed under the broad umbrella of EU-Morocco relations. In a tweet following the signature, Thomas Reilly, the British ambassador to Rabat, expressed satisfaction with the deal. “We have signed a bilateral agreement between Morocco and the UK which guarantees the continuity of our relations after Brexit,” the ambassador said. Trade between Morocco and the UK reached £1.5 billion in 2018, making the North African country the 7th destination for UK exports. The new agreement, which entails a free-trade clause similar to the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between Morocco and the EU, seeks to further consolidate the commercial relationship between the two countries and see bilateral trade volumes surpass the current figures. In a political declaration accompanying the agreement, both countries pledged to preserve the “strategic relationship” binding them by preserving the political, economic, judicial, and territorial benefits as defined in the texts of the EU-Morocco relationship. The agreement means Moroccan and British products are guaranteed free access to each other’s markets. As far as Morocco is concerned, however, the deal’s most significant aspect may be that it entails the resources in its southern provinces. The deal is set to come into force the day after the UN effectively leaves the EU.

Rabat – Moroccan special agents arrested a 7th ISIS-linked suspect in Tamaris II, a beach town near Casablanca, in what is so far the country’s most far-reaching counter-terrorism operations. The arrest took place on the evening of Friday, October 25. Searches are still ongoing to arrest other suspects or accomplices in the affair, authorities have indicated. The news came after the arrest of six individuals in large-scale counter-terrorism carried out raids simultaneously in three different locations: two in the Casablanca area and one in the Ouazzane province. The raids took place in the early morning hours of Friday, October 25. By noon of the same day, the news made the rounds in national papers, social media, as well as a handful of international publications. Over the years, Morocco has gained worldwide recognition for its effective, almost irreproachable security architecture. The country is often deservingly labeled as an oasis of stability in a troubled region. But even for a country with Morocco’s pedigree on counter-terrorism, Friday’s raids caught the attention of many for the rapidity of Moroccan Special Forces in responding to the threat posed by the ISIS-linked cell. Two of the suspects had rented an apartment in Chefchaouen on October 24 and planned to strike on the following day, only to be stopped by BCIJ officers early in the morning. Morocco’s 2M TV reported that the suspects had “an impressive arsenal” of knives, shotguns, and explosive materials when authorities arrested them. Investigations continue to shed further light in the case, according to a statement from the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (DGST). In another declaration, the ministry of interior, while reassuring citizens about the country’s preparedness to preempt terrorist plots, acknowledged that this cell was unlike any other ISIS-linked cell Moroccan agents have dismantled in the past months and years. The activities of the cell were on a “very advanced” scale, the ministry said, detailing that the cell was not only planning to “strike a number of sensitive sites throughout the country.” In addition to carrying out terrorist plots in extremely sensitive areas across the country, the cell’s ultimate plan was to find itself a safe haven in the mountainous areas in Northern Morocco, where its members sought to establish an “ISIS-governed willayah.” Meanwhile, a DGST statement issued earlier today has denied a number of rumors circulating about the sites that the terrorists planned to attack. In the aftermath of the arrests, a number of reports indicated that the cell wanted to duplicate ISIS-inspired attacks recently witnessed in Sahel countries by mostly targeting foreign interests, such as foreign schools or hotels. DGST says the allegations are “false,” “unfounded,” and appear to have been made to instill fear among citizens. The statement stressed that special agents are tracking down the origins of the allegations, as well as any other “rumors” seeking to spread panic and fear.

Rabat – Tangier police seized more than nine tons of cannabis resin while arresting five individuals on suspicion of international drug trafficking on Friday, October 25.  Police believe the suspects are linked to a psychotropic drug trafficking network in addition to the trafficking of cannabis resin.  A statement from the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN) said that police carried out the security operation on a farm in Doua Daidaat in the Gueznaia region, about 20 kilometers south of Tangier.   In addition to the platelets of cannabis resin, police also seized three inflatable boats and two wireless communication devices. The search operation led to the seizure of array of marine navigation equipment including torches, a compass, and 20 barrels of fuel.  Police discovered eight large trailers with cavities build for trafficking large quantities of drugs at the farm, along with four cars, falsified license plates, and weapons. The defendants are in police custody, according to the DGSN statement.  Police are working to uncover the suspects’ links to national and international drug trafficking, and to determine the land and sea routes they used in trafficking. Police also aim to identify the suspects’ links to money laundering crimes.

Rabat – Since the moment my father introduced me to a computer, almost 20 years ago, I have loved playing video games. I used to spend long hours with my back hunched over the screen, immersed in my favorite games. The more I played, the more I wanted to play. My naive child’s mind dreamed of a life where people could play video games for a living. No longer a naive dream Fast-forward to 2019, the video game industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, netting more revenue than the music and movie industries combined. Gaming, or the act of playing video games, has turned from being the favorite pastime of introverted adolescents into a social activity that connects people from different backgrounds all over the world. Almost a third of the world’s population plays video games, and, in 2019, people all over the world are paid to play them.  The exponential growth of the gaming industry gave birth to the sub industry of Esports. Esports, also known as Electronic Sports, are the practice of video games in competitive settings, and on different scales. Many countries, including the United States, already consider Esports players as professional athletes. ‘Stop wasting your time’ Older generations in Morocco have, for a long time, perceived playing video games as an exclusive activity for children and a waste of time. If an adult is playing video games, it is seen negatively. Taking into consideration the disparities between the older generations, who were mainly exposed to local television, and younger ones, who are mainly exposed to international media, the negative undertone that a large part of Moroccan society attributes to gaming is completely understandable and to be expected. However, this perception is starting to change little by little. With the emergence of mobile gaming and video games that appeal to different demographics, more people are getting into this type of entertainment. Video games are becoming more accessible to the inexperienced public, and therefore more acceptable within Moroccan society. League of Legends or Fortnite? According to Inwi, a Moroccan telecommunication company, there are more than one million active gamers in Morocco, and around four million people who play video games from time to time. The community of Moroccan gamers is divided into a number of subcommunities, depending on the players’ favorite games. The list of the most played games in Morocco, and in the world, since video games follow global trends, include League of Legends (LoL), Fortnite, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), among other titles. Players usually join Facebook groups or Discord servers (a chat application used mainly by gamers) in order to meet others who share the same passion. The number of online influencers in the gaming field is also on the rise in Morocco, especially after fiber optic internet became available in the major Moroccan cities. A number of Moroccan gamers decided to share their passion with an audience, either through making videos on Youtube, or through live-streaming their gameplay sessions on gaming platforms such as Twitch. The increase in the number of Moroccan gamers gave rise to a new type of businesses in recent years: gaming centers. These new businesses offer an environment where Moroccans passionate about video games can meet and play together. The centers also provide high-end gaming material to enhance their clients’ experience even further. One of the most successful businesses so far in this domain is Moroccan Gaming Evolution, a company that opened two gaming centers in Rabat and Casablanca. The Casablanca center is the largest in Africa. Its facilities include a gaming space with more than 120 high-performance computers, a relaxation room, a restaurant, and a gaming material store. Tech giants muscle in The increasing numbers of video game fans in Morocco has attracted new actors who have shown increasing interest in this fast-growing industry. Small gaming events and competitions that used to be organized by individuals or small associations are now becoming larger and more professionally organized. Some of the biggest actors to penetrate the gaming scene are Inwi and Orange. The two telecommunication companies operating in Morocco have started sponsoring and organizing gaming events and competitions. The biggest event to this date is the Africa Gaming Fest, organized by Inwi. The event took place on December 16, 2018 in Casablanca. More than 9,000 people, from across North Africa, attended the event. The program included video game tournaments with a $15,000 cash prize, cosplay contests, and musical shows, among other activities that attracted a varied public. During the event, Brahim Amdouy, content manager at Inwi, told the press that the telecommunications company wanted to support gaming in Morocco because “it represents an important pillar of the younger generations’ culture”. Inwi’s involvement in the Moroccan video game industry does not only concern organizing events and competitions, but also financially supporting video game developers. “Inwi helped developing a number of mobile games that are 100% Moroccan, such as Ronda, Tomobile Racing, and Ghoul,” added the company’s spokesperson. An expensive habit While more actors and sponsors are getting involved in the Moroccan gaming scene, Moroccan gamers are still facing a number of obstacles that hinder both their individual gaming experience and the development of the gaming culture in Morocco as a whole. The major issue the Moroccan gaming community faces is purely financial. Gaming consoles, high-performance computers, gaming gear (mice, keyboards, headsets, etc.), and video games, are all sold for exorbitant prices. Gaming hardware in Morocco can cost as much as five or six times the prices of the same material in Europe. “MAD 5,000 for a console, MAD 600 per game, and more than MAD 10,000 to get a good gaming computer. Hardware prices are exorbitant in comparison to Moroccans’ average income,” Salim “MagicVDK” Ghazzal, a Moroccan gaming influencer and organizer, told Morocco World News. The reasons behind these excessive prices include the unavailability of official suppliers. Most of hardware sellers buy their products from Europe and bring them back to Morocco. The import taxes imposed by the Moroccan customs administration inflate the prices. Another important problem facing video game fans in Morocco is the lack of structure, as there is no organization that currently represents the voices of this fast-growing Moroccan community. Gamers unite Younes “Sazan” Lesfer, a Moroccan engineer who worked at and founded a number of gaming organizations in Morocco, told MWN that the key to the development of Moroccan gaming lies within the community itself. “The key is associative movement. If there are enough gaming associations in Morocco, they could possibly unite to form a federation. That is when the gaming industry can really flourish, because a federation will force the government and other entities to officially recognize this industry and invest in it.” The recognition of this industry by the Moroccan government would also attract video game companies to invest in the Moroccan market, which would significantly reduce the prices of video games and gaming material. Another important step, according to Sazan, would be the programming of regular events: “This will help instate a competitive environment for Moroccan gamers, allowing them to invest more in this activity as it will be more rewarding.” Gaming and Esports are still fairly new concepts within Moroccan society. However, audiences are getting wider by the day, and soon enough, they could turn from a niche into a mainstream market. While this domain’s potential is huge, it is for Moroccans, gamers and non-gamers, to decide on how it will turn out. Teenagers in bedrooms across Morocco are driving the change, but while I remember being introduced to a computer, the new generation of gamers have grown up with technology that is developing faster than our society.  Will Morocco follow the steps of developed countries that turned a niche market into a major revenue source? Or will it miss on the opportunity and regret it when it’s too late? Only time will tell.

Rabat- Mohcine Jazouli, Morocco’s Delegate Minister for African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates, has renewed Morocco’s commitment to global security and stability, insisting on the country’s national integrity. Jazouli’s comments came as he represented Morocco at the 18th Inter-ministerial Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, which kicked off yesterday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Founded in the heat of the East-West tensions during the Cold War, the Non-Aligned movement sought to preserve the independence and autonomy of newly independent African and Asian countries, promising neutrality amid tensions, especially in terms of policy orientations. Decades after the end of the Cold War, the group, now counting 125 member states and 25 observer states, still continues to hold on to those neutrality and independence principles. According to Jazouli, Morocco’s Non-Aligned membership, as well as its participation in the movement’s summit, dovetails with its usual commitment to preserving shared interests and standing together when facing common challenges.  “This summit is a new opportunity to underline the relevance of the principles of Non Alignment and the importance of a collective introspection work so that these principles are adapted to a multipolar world and to the multidimensional challenges that require innovative approaches in order to provide collective responses,” argued Jazouli. This year’s summit is themed after the iconic Bandung Conference in 1955, where 29 newly independent African and Asian countries met to lay the ground for what has now become South-South cooperation. The Bandung Conference that later paved the way for the creation of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, pledged to promote economic, political, and cultural cooperation among “Third World” countries, in a bid to establish a new and reliable alternative to the dominant bi-polar vision of the time. As one of the foremost pioneers of South-South cooperation today, Morocco is more committed than ever  to a multipolar world in which countries are free to cooperate or choose the alternative that best fits their ambitions or goals, stressed the Moroccan official. For Jazouli, while many things have  changed considerably since the creation of the Non-Aligned Movement, there remains the same urgency and need for working out credible and effective alternatives to face the challenges of today’s geopolitical complexities, ranging from security, migration, to economic growth, among many others. The Baku summit, he elaborated, is an “opportunity” for nonaligned countries to “exchange their views and approaches on issues of common interest and to reaffirm their commitment to the 10 principles of Bandung, including respect for territorial integrity and national sovereignty.”

Rabat – In the wake of this year’s World Mental Health Day organizations around the world are launching new initiatives, in a bid to further promote the importance of mental health. In Morocco, the Danish residency opened its doors to welcome the Moroccan Ministry of Health, representatives of medical science and several stakeholders.  Raising awareness Solely dedicated to the treatment of brain diseases, Lundbeck is a Danish pharmaceutical company active in the MEA-region, spanning from Morocco to South-Africa and from Sudan to Iran. Managing Director Henrik Agerbaek-Larsen spoke to Morocco World News about the role of Lundbeck in bolstering treatment for mental health issues. “Over 700 million people suffer from brain diseases globally, 50% of them do not receive their proper medication.” Said Agerbaek-Larsen. “Of course, there are some countries where the discrepancy between the availability of medicines and patients who are in need of them is higher. But, on a global scale we see an enormous number of people who have to bear up with their mental health issues, while not receiving their medication,” the director explained.  Ethical implications As a pharmaceutical company with a global revenue of MAD 24 billion, Lundbeck operates on free-market terms with a noticeable foothold in the MEA-region.  Selling medicines means taking ethical implications into consideration. “Ideally speaking it would be preferable if people did not have to buy medicines in order to have a worthwhile life. But that is not realistic,” Agerbaek-Larsen explained the pragmatic side of pharmaceuticals. “We are living in a world where mental health issues are affecting many people, with half of them not receiving medication.” He emphasized that “There remains a lot to be done.”  “At the end of the day, Lundbeck is a company that operates on market terms and we have a business to run. Investing in new medicines requires a research and development period lasting up to ten years. Profits are therefore essential to ensure long-term investments, required for the development of cutting-edge medicines.” Taboo According to Agerbaek-Larsen, one of the major reasons why people are not able to receive their medication is because mental health is a taboo subject that people find difficult to discuss. “You have come a long way when you are sitting at a dinner table with family and friends and say ‘I’m seeing a psychiatrist’, or ‘I am taking antidepressants.’ Having that conversation is still difficult in many parts of the world.” When looking at Morocco, Agerbaek-Larsen thinks not only a change of mindset is necessary to make mental health a topic fit for the dinner table, but raising awareness is just as important. “What you have to realize is that many people in Morocco simply do not know of mental health problems for which you can receive treatment.” “Diseases such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson, Schizophrenia and Tourette Syndrome are often unknown. But by discussing the prevalence of these diseases and their symptoms, people are better able to understand the importance of mental health and the notion of seeking treatment,” Agerbaek-Larsen concluded.  Reaching out As Danish ambassador to Morocco, Nikolaj Harris echoes this opinion. “Twenty years ago we did not have the same debates concerning mental health as we do nowadays. Mental health problems were lumped together into one big group and treated much less diligently. In the West, this debate has been developing for the last years, and in Morocco that debate is slowly starting to take off as well.” But, as Harris stresses, talking about mental health is difficult. “As frustrating as it may be, it can be quite difficult to reach out to someone who is suffering from mental health issues. Mental health issues are insidious and have devastating long term effects on people and society as a whole. We are talking about crippling anxiety, burnouts but also self-inflicted malnutrition and suicide attempts.” Djinns A doctor in the medical field, El Ammouri Adil has firsthand experience of Morocco’s shortcomings in the field of mental health. “The demand for psychiatrists in Morocco is enormous. What you have to realize is that there are only about 400 psychiatrists working in Morocco, on a population of 34 million,” according to Adil. The need for more psychiatrists is evident. Only last year the Ministry of Health published figures, indicating 26% percent of the Moroccan population suffer from depression. “There are many reasons why people suffer from depression, it is passed down hereditary, the personal experience of the patient, using drugs,” Adil explained. But, as Adil elaborates, the biggest problem in Morocco is the taboo revolving around mental health. The overwhelming majority of Moroccans simply don’t consider mental health issues to be genuine illness. “The situation is exacerbated by the stigma you are branded with. You see, it is not uncommon for Moroccans to regard mental health issues born out of a lack of character. People, especially in rural areas, believe Djinns [demons] are inside of you, on account of you having done something evil. That is among else why mental health issues in Morocco are taboo, they ultimately relate to you as a person,” Adil concluded.

Rabat –  The Moroccan Court of Appeal in Casablanca has increased the sentence of Moroccan journalist Taoufik Bouachrine from 12 years to 15 years in prison. The judge gave his final verdict on the appeal request late on Friday, October 25. In November 2018, the court handed Bouachrine a sentence of 12 years in prison. Police arrested him in February 2018 on charges of human trafficking, rape, and sexual assault against several female journalists working at his newspaper. In addition to increasing his sentence, the court also ruled that the financial compensation he must pay to the victims should be increased. The court ordered Bouachrine to pay compensation in the amount  MAD 800,000 to one of his “victims.” Other victims will receive compensation ranging from MAD 150,000 and MAD 500,000. Bouachrine will also pay a fine of MAD 300,000 to the state. As part of the arrest operation  in February, Moroccan police allegedly seized 50 tapes depicting sexual acts as evidence of the alleged crimes attributed to Bouachrine.  Boucharine has denied all charges against him, suggesting that his arrest was politically motivated.

Rabat – Africa’s survey warehouser Afrobarometer has listed Moroccan females amongAfrican women who still “lag” behind men when it comes to financial decision making. The survey, published on October 22, shows that women in Morocco have particularly “weak voices” in financial decision making. There is a 38-point gap compared to men, Afrobarometer reported. Burkina Faso and Sudan have close point gaps similar to Morocco. There is a 39 point gap in Burkina Faso and 35 points for Sudan. Morocco, however, has a smaller gap in “average asset ownership” than other countries, such as Benin (27%), Mali (24%), and Burkina Faso (23 %). There is an 11% gap in average asset ownership in Morocco, the survey said. The survey takes into account 34 African countries, stating that African women “lag behind men in ownership of assets and are sustainably less to have decision making power over household resources.” The survey is part of a Pan Africa Profile project that the website will release based on a “special gender equality survey module” which will be carried out in partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.  On average of the 34 surveyed African countries, women are “significantly less likely than men” to own assets such as “mobile phones (an 11-percentage-point gap compared to men), a radio (18 points), a television (7 points), a bank account (10 points), a car or motorcycle (16 points), and a computer (6 points).” Meanwhile, more than half of male respondents say they are solely responsible for taking financial decisions, compared to 38% of women. Although “40% of women and 38% of men say they decide jointly with their spouse or other family members,” the numbers of women taking charge of household finances remain low. The Africa-wide survey showed wide disparities between decision-making rights in the home, with a large proportion of women across the 34 countries surveyed feeling out of control in terms of household spending.  As many as  “one in five women (22%) have no role in deciding how their money will be used.”  This statistic represents more than twice the number of men (9%) who have no role at all in the allocation of their own, or household,  funds. Last year, the National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH) said that women headed 18 % of Moroccan households in 2017 compared to 15 % in 2017. A higher percentage of households in urban areas are headed by Moroccan women than in rural areas, ONDH added. The report indicated that Urban female-headed households rose from 19%in 2012 to 21% in 2017, compared to a rise to 11% from 10% in rural areas.

Rabat – The date palm industry in Morocco generates MAD 2 billion ($207 million), the Ministry of Agriculture announced. The ministry gave the statement on the occasion of the International Date Fair, also called the Guetna Festival, in Erfoud, an oasis town in eastern Morocco, reported state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Dates play a central role in the economic activity of oases. Revenue from dates make up 60% of agricultural income at oases, the ministry noted. More than 2 million people work in the date industry in Morocco. As one of the largest producers of dates in Morocco, Erfoud is an appropriate host for the Moroccan date festival. The fair includes camel racing and evening fashion shows. The Ministry of Agriculture began an aggressive program to increase Morocco’s date palms in 2009 as part of Morocco’s Green Plan. By the end of 2019, the ministry says, it will have exceeded its goal of planting 3 million date palms by 2020. In 2017, Morocco produced 112,000 tons of dates. At the same time, Morocco imports vast quantities of dates and is the world’s largest importer of Tunisian dates. But Morocco is also an exporter. The popular majhool date, “the king of dates,” originates from Morocco but is now grown as far abroad as California and South Africa. Israel is the world’s largest producer of majhool dates, many of which grow on the Israeli settlements in the West Bank. As well as an important economic industry, dates have great cultural importance in Morocco. During Ramadan, Muslims break the fast by eating several dates. Dates are also a symbol of luck and fertility.

Rabat – EU-funded project ODYSSEA will hold its 3rd general assembly in Tangier, Morocco from October 29-31. The assembly will mark the launch of its first “fully operational sea observatory” in North Africa.  The glider will be stationed at Al Hoceima, said a press release from the European Commission. in Al Hoceima, said a press release from the European Commission. The observatory is the second underwater glide from ODYSSEA after the one developed in Greece, according to the press release. ALSEAMAR developed the “SeaExplorer underwater” glider in partnership with ODYSSEA. The glider, according to the press release, is a “powerful autonomous sensing platform designed to collect water column data with wide Spatio-temporal coverage.” Both the Greek project and the new project in Morocco are developed in the context of the ODYSSEA Project. They are carrying “three sets of cutting-edge sensor payloads, designed to optimize the monitoring capacity of observatories’ networks.” The project seeks to enable ODYSSEA to provide information and data from the southern Mediterranean. The project also aims to facilitateODYSSEA in the development of“valuable services for local communities and the Blue Economy sector.” ODYSSEA will use its glider in Morocco for “documenting and mapping sea mammal populations, sonar ping echo, maritime traffic, health and conditions of marine habitats, and human noise.” The glider will be also carrying out basing “Environmental Protection Engineering (EPE) studies.” ODYSSEA’s project partner Association for Integrated Resources Management (AGIR) will host the launch of the project. AGIR’s  president Houssine Nibani said that his association is “very excited to host this meeting as the first North African observatory is becoming fully operational collecting onsite data from the ODYSSEA Platform.” He added that the platform will help to “close the gap between the Northern and Southern Mediterranean shore.”

Rabat – Morocco’s flag-carrier airline, Royal Air Maroc (RAM), has announced plans to buy more freight planes for transporting cargo. RAM’s vice president of cargo, Salim Quouninich, told Cargo Facts that RAM will acquire the freight planes over the coming years. Quouninich said there is “strong growth potential” in increasing RAM’s cargo services as e-commerce expands worldwide. RAM has the opportunity to deliver products from the US and Europe to Africa. Cargo Facts notes that RAM’s one freight plane delivers cargo that its passenger planes are then able to carry in smaller quantities to its many destinations. RAM’s widebody cargo plane will be able to deliver shipments to more and more places as the company opens up more widebody passenger flights. “By combining our freighter operations to those of our widebody aircraft, we establish freight corridors connecting the Americas, Europe and the Middle East to West Africa,” said Quouninich. This winter, RAM’s widebody freighter will take and make deliveries between Casablanca and eight international cities: Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt, Abidjan, Niamey, Lagos, Bamako, and Douala. RAM may also transition some of its older passenger planes into cargo planes in order to meet growing freight demand. Cargo Facts explained that RAM has two each of Boeing 737-800s and 737-700s that are over 20 years old and two Boeing 767-300s that are nearly 18 years old. Royal Air Maroc has a fleet of 59 planes and is Africa’s largest unaffiliated airline. That will change next year when RAM will join the oneworld alliance of airlines. RAM operates dozens of flights within Africa and to Europe, as well as six flights to Asia, four to North America, and two to South America. In 2019, the company added flights to Miami, Vienna, Abuja, and Amman to its list.

Rabat – The regional heritage conservationist of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, Larbi Mesbahi, has announced the allocation of more than MAD 12 million to the restoration of the historic site of Kelaat Arbaa Taourirt, in the province of Al Hoceima.haùmz The launch of the site’s renovation program came in response to calls from local residents as well as cultural actors and members of civil society within the province.  Mesbahi told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the project is part of the development program “Al Hoceima Manarat Al Moutawassit.” “The restoration and renovation of this historic site began in June and will continue until March 2020, to enable Kelaat Arbaa Taourirt to play its social role, while contributing to the development of the region,” he added. The renovation of the historic site aims to bring back to life a building that has played different roles it has in the administrative, cultural, and social fields. Mesbahi indicated that several parts of the historic monument collapsed while others are cracked or damaged. The site will undergo renovations in line with methods of an intervention designed for the restoration of heritage sites. After the completion of the restoration, the ministry of culture and heritage plans to make the site a top tourist and cultural destination. The ministry also aims for the site to promote rural tourism and fulfill the potential of the Arbaa Taourirt region in this field. The Kelaa, which is an Arabic word for “a castle”, was built in a strategic location in the 1940s by the Spanish protectorate. It is located, 40 kilometers south of Al Hoceima.  The castle served, in times of war, as a multi-service office, grouping together an administrative annex, a prison, a court, and a dispensary, as well as grain warehouses and animal stables. Known as Fousina, a distortion for the Spanish word ‘la Oficina’ which means the office in English, the castle, painted entirely in red, was badly damaged when an earthquake hit the Al Hoceima province in 2004.

Rabat – French authorities have stripped a 20-year old French-Moroccan national of his French citizenship.  A French court sentenced 20-year old Faycal Ait Messaoud to four years in prison in March 2018 for attempting to travel to Syria only a few days after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015. AFP quoted a judge, who said he gave Ait Messaoud a lighter sentence than the sentences given to the three other people who also attempted to reach Syria after the attacks. The judge cited his  “very young age at the time of the events” as justification for the lighter sentence. The French Ministry of Interior said that it had stripped  16 people of French nationality since 2002 due to terrorism charges, including five in 2015. French authorities have the right to deprive people of citizenship if they are dual nationals for specific reasons including treason and terrorism  This is not the first time that France has stripped a defendant of Moroccan origin of French nationality. In June, French authorities stripped another Moroccan-French national of his French nationality for conspiring to join terrorists in Afghanistan. The dual national was sentenced to five years in prison in 2014. In February 2016, the English speaking magazine the  Economist reported that France has “undertaken a raft of counter-terrorism measures” after the November 2017 attacks in Paris. The website also said that many French citizens deplored French decision to strip dual citizens of French citizenship. “Many French citizens with dual citizenship from North African countries sense that they—not Franco-Germans or Franco-Americans, say—are the only dual citizens that lawmakers really have in mind,” said the Economist.

Residents around Ben Guerir, a city 70 kilometers north of Marrakech, may spot a small truck outfitted with a library making a tour of schools and settlements in the coming days. The mobile library, also called the Caravan Reading Bridge, is conducting reading workshops and providing schools with an interactive reading program, reported state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The mobile library began operating in Ben Guerir on Wednesday, October 23, as a part of the National Initiative for Human Development’s (INDH) multi-year development plan to increase human capital in Morocco through education. The truck’s presentation was also part of the official launch of a national awareness campaign about early childhood education from October 21 to November 4. Project managers expect the mobile library “to ‘democratize’ access to extracurricular activities that make reading more attractive,” as reported in MAP. Sponsored by the Social Work Association (ABOS), the mobile library gets its funding from the INDH. Equipment for the mobile library project cost MAD 85,500 ($8,900). The figure does not include the cost of management and maintaining the vehicle. The project began November 2018 and has served approximately 3,000 people in a year. Other aims of the mobile library include combating high school dropout rates and preventing delinquency and deviant behavior. Volunteers of ABOS said they want students to be inspired by the Caravan Reading Bridge to create “cultural museums in schools” and to start school clubs, such as book clubs or cultural clubs. ABOS anticipates adding a multimedia library to the caravan with audio, video, and digital media. In addition to the truck, the association hopes to start “small libraries installed on eco-friendly bicycles” and libraries in schools, according to MAP. Morocco has space for improvement in reading and literacy. The literacy rate in Morocco is 74% among people aged 15 and older, according to UNESCO’s 2018 figures. In 2016, Morocco ranked 58th in literacy among 58 countries. However, UNESCO’s 2018 data shows that literacy rates are significantly higher among young people (98%) than among seniors (34%). The Caravan Reading Bridge is also part of “My city reads” (Madinati takraa), a project to promote culture in the Rhamna province surrounding Ben Guerir. INDH partnered with the Institute for Research in Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN) to create the mobile library. The project is part of INDH’s third phase of development activities, launched in September 2018.

Rabat – The president of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Morocco (CFCIM), Philippe-Edern Klein, openly invited investors to assess the potential business climate in the southern Moroccan city of Dakhla in Western Sahara. Edern Klein remarked on the city of Dakhla human resources during the Morocco-France Business Forum, which took place from October 23-24 in Dakhla. “The choice of Dakhla to welcome the Morocco-France Business Forum after Casablanca, Paris, and Laayoune is for us a natural choice because we are convinced of the potential represented by southern regions, whose growth rate is one of the most dynamic of the kingdom.” Speaking at the opening of the fourth annual forum on October 24, president of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab Region Yanja El Khattat said that the region is a source of “sustainable investment opportunities.” El Khattat spoke about the launch of the new development model to promote and enhance the business climate in southern provinces, with a budget of MAD 77 billion between 2015-2021. The budget covers approximately 650 projects. He reiterated that the wealth created in the region will benefit mainly the people of the region. The president of the region also drew attention to the development of a roadmap that seeks to integrate people of the region into the implemented projects through job creation as well as empowerment programs for women in the region. The forum’s location in the region of Dakhla Oued Eddahab provides opportunities for local investors as it convenes French business experts to explore the potential of the region. The region is considered as a bridge between Morocco and other African countries. The city will soon connect Morocco with its African allies through the Dakhla Atlantic port. Construction on the port will take 7 years to complete. On September 5, the Government Council adopted a decree to establish a committee to oversee the construction of the port for a budget of MAD 1 billion. The ultimate goal of the projects is to enhance the investment potential of Morocco’s southern provinces as rich regions to attract local and international investors. Last year, Edern Kelin made similar remarks during his participation at the Morocco-France Business Forum in Laayoune.  During the previous forum, he extolled the rapid transformation of the Laayoune Sakia el Hamra region in recent years, describing it as an “ideal hub” for business and investment in Africa.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled two ISIS-linked terror cells in Dar Bouazza near Casablanca and Chefchaouenon on Friday, October 25. The first operation took place in Dar Bouazza, a coastal town in the Casablanca-Settat region. The BCIJ seized weapons including knives, ammunition, and materials used to manufacture explosives. The security services also confiscated ISIS flags during the operation. BCIJ arrested two suspects aged 26 and 27 during the same operation, according to Moroccan television channel 2M. The second operation took place in an informal township called “douar Bouabid” in Dar Bouazza. During the operation, the BCIJ staff arrested a third suspect aged 20 years. The BCIJ arrested two more ISIS-linked suspects in Chefchaouen on Friday, October 25. The two suspects have links to ISIS. #Terrorisme

Morocco’s BCIJ dismantled dozens of cells throughout the year. The latest operation took place on September 5, when the BCIJ members dismantled a 5 member terrorist cell linked to ISIS in Nador and Berkan, two cities in Eastern Morocco. Morocco’s BCIJ conducted several similar operations as part of Morocco’s strategy to counter terrorism, dubbed successful by many international partners including the US. Morocco introduced the BCIJ in 2015 to monitor security threats across the country. The BCIJ also assist foreign security agencies to combat terrorism. Last year, the US Department of State report on  Country Reports on Terrorism said that Morocco assisted the Spanish investigation following the August 2018 attacks in Barcelona.

Rabat – The border crossing between Morocco and Mauritania at El Guerguerat remains impassable for exporters since Thursday, October 17. Tents and blockades set up by a group of pro-Polisario Sahrawis are currently blocking the passage of Moroccan merchandise to sub-Saharan Africa. According to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the protesters are denouncing what they view as ‘excessive’ customs fees. The group, presumed to be operating at the behest of the Polisario, claim that the Moroccan customs officials broke their promise to hold a meeting with them in Dakhla to find a solution to their problems, the Moroccan newspaper reported. Meanwhile, Pro-Polisario media Futuro Sahara claimed that one of the blockade’s organizers reached out to the Polisario Front’ military for help.  According to the same source,  the Polisario Front leadership has not officially approved the blockade. The news outlet emphasized that the group is calling for the release of Sahrawis detainees from Gdim Izik prison and an end to the looting of natural resources. The Polisario Front has claimed, on a number of occasions, that Morocco is looting Western Sahara’s natural resources. In March 2018, the leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali, addressed a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, calling on him to put pressure on the European Union to suspend agreements signed with Morocco, including fisheries agreements. “I urge you to call on the European Union and its member states to abandon their ongoing negotiations on trade and fisheries agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco in case [those agreements] include Western Sahara,” said the separatist leader. Several countries along with international business experts, however, continue to support Morocco’s development projects in the region. Last year, Philippe-Edern Klein, chairman of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Morocco (CFCIM) extolled the rapid transformation of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region in southern Morocco. The Frenchman went so far as to call the region an “ideal hub” for business and investment ventures in Africa. Morocco has also laid the ground for massive development projects in the region with a budget of more than $7 billion. In September,  the Government Council adopted Decree 2.19.737 to establish a committee to oversee the construction of the Dakhla Atlantic port. Morocco pledged a budget of MAD 10 billion for the project. The north African country set up development plans to enhance the investment potential of the region.  The development projects are in line with King Mohammed VI’s vision to enable the local population to benefit from the region’s assets and resources. In a speech on the 39th anniversary of Morocco’s Green March in 2014, King Mohammed VI said,  “ Since we recovered the Sahara, for every single dirham of revenue from the Sahara, the state invests 7 dirhams there, as part of the solidarity between the regions and between the sons and daughters of the region.” Morocco’s investments have largely transformed the region and financially benefited locals.  In its reports on the situation of Western Sahara, the United Nations has mentioned Morocco’s considerable investments in the region. Earlier this month, the UN’s Guterres published his latest report, in which he underscored that Morocco’s investment in the region, particularly in Laayoune continues. In paragraph 16 of the report, the UNSG said that “Morocco maintains that such investments directly benefit the people of Western Sahara and are implemented  in consultation with them.” In the meantime, however, pro-Polisario organizations have repeatedly spoken in support of the separatist front’s campaign to mobilize the international community against Morocco’s sovereignty over the region. The El Guerguerat border crossing is a key route for Moroccan fruit and vegetable producers exporting to sub-Saharan Africa. The continued protests are already having a negative impact. According to Al Massae newspaper, the Association of Citrus Conditioners of Morocco (ASCAM) issued a statement saying that disruptions will seriously impact farmers and packing plants. The statement adds that the sub-Saharan markets will not receive any produce. ASCAM sounded the alarm by calling on the relevant authorities to intervene to restore order to the border crossing.  The decaying situation at the Morocco-Mauritania border is under the watch of the UN peacekeeping force in the region, known as Minurso. No action has been taken to date.  In his annual report to the Security Council, Guterres recalled that the Guerguerat crossing border was already a source of tension. Guterres called on Minurso to closely monitor the situation and allow UN military observers to conduct daily patrols in the area.  “As I have detailed in this report, I am concerned about the recent incidents in El Guerguerat. The increasing commercial traffic across the buffer strip and the growing civilian activities to impede it are creating tensions in that sensitive area,” said Guterres in paragraph 83 of his report. He specified that “regular civil and commercial traffic not to be obstructed” and calls for “both sides to refrain from any deliberate actions at Guerguerat, or anywhere else in the buffer strip.”

Rabat – Bachir Edkhil, a former founding member of the Polisario and an outspoken critic of the separatist front’s “obsolete claims” to the Western Sahara conflict, has said that the separatists want to prolong they conflict to “capitalize” on the suffering of Tindouf refugees. Speaking on Tuesday, October 22, in a panel at the Democratic Initiatives Institute in Panama City, Edkhil highlighted the “hypocrisy” of the Polisario Front’s claims of being the sole legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people. Instead, he said, “for the past four decades, Polisario leaders have enriched themselves” off the plight of distressed Tindouf refugees. A central narrative in pro-Polisario circles is that Morocco is the primary culprit for the diplomatic standstill in the Western Sahara dispute.  According to Edkhil, however, the separatist front “obsolete” and “self-serving” insistence on self-determination is the main reason for both the prolongation of the territorial dispute and the dire conditions in Tindouf. He argued, referring to an increasingly dominant notion in the international community, that Morocco has been “serious” and “reliable” in its latest efforts to broker a sustainable settlement. Despite Morocco’s efforts towards compromise, however, he noted, the Polisario leadership has been categorical in its “obsolete” and “unrealistic” demands for a referendum on self-determination.. The reason for Polisario’s position, he argued, is to play the victim card and paint Morocco in a bad light in the international community in order to gain the sympathy of international humanitarian organizations. In addition to pointing to the separatist front’s well documented mismanagement and embezzlement of the humanitarian aid to Tindouf refugees, the former Polisario member called the front out on “war crimes” and other “serious offenses,” including kidnappings and forced displacement. He concluded by calling on the separatists to review their strident opposition to the Moroccan autonomy proposal, arguing that it is the only way to secure peace, stability, and economic prosperity in the disputed regions.

Rabat – Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN Omar Hilale reiterated his country’s unwavering committment tothe Palestinian cause on Wednesday, October 23 in Baku, Azerbaijan. Hilale recalled Morocco’s unchanging position during a ministerial preparatory meeting for the 18th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Moroccan ambassador said that Morocco, under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, is clear in its “full support to the brotherly Palestinian people in defending their just cause and recovering their legitimate rights to establish an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capitals.” The Moroccan position is in line with the relevant UN Resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, as well as the two State solution recognized by the international community, added Hilale. The diplomat said that Morocco categorically rejects all “unilateral measures and decisions aimed at changing the legal, historical, spiritual and demographicé status of East Jerusalem.” Hilale also reaffirmed Morocco’s firm position on the need to preserve the holy city of Jerusalem as a heritage site for humanity, a “place where the three monotheistic religions meet and coexist.” For Morocco, Jerusalem, also known as Al-Quds, is a red line. The country rejects any compromise on this point. In December 2017, King Mohammed VI sent a message to US President Donald Trump to express “deep concern” over the US move to relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all,” said King Mohammed VI in his letter. Morocco is also among the countries to reject the US Peace Plan, also known as the “Deal of the Century.” In September, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani renewed Morocco’s vow to stand with the people of Palestine. The politician expressed the position of  King Mohammed VI and Morocco, stating their “clear position that all attempts to undermine the status of Jerusalem are unacceptable.” He added that the King and the country officially “expressed rejection for the deal of the century once and for all.”

Rabat – Omar Hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative to the UN, has reiterated the increasingly popular notion that Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan is the most credible and pragmatic solution to the decades-long territorial dispute in Western Sahara. Hilale made the comments on Wednesday, October 23, as he headed a Moroccan delegation at a preparatory inter-ministerial meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, in prelude of the 18th summit of the Non-aligned Movement. Created in 1961 in Belgrade to affirm the neutrality of newly independent Asian and African countries in the hegemonic war between the Eastern and Western blocs during the cold war, the Non-aligned Movement also sought to uphold the autonomy of developing countries in their policy choices and actions on the international stage. Today, decades after the end of the cold war, the movement still counts 125 member states and 25 observer states, all committed to preserving “the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of non-aligned countries.” Referring to those non-aligned principles of protecting the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of all member states, Hilale said at the Baku meeting that the Western Sahara issue is an “artificial conflict” initiated to destabilize Morocco and challenge its territorial integrity. He explained how Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, which calls for a compromise-based and politically negotiated resolution, is more reflective of the non-aligned movement’s preference for peaceful crisis management. “The realization of our common aspirations rests on the mobilization of constructive efforts from within different parts of our movement to contribute to finding peaceful solutions to regional and international conflicts, in strict respect of the movement’s constant principles,” Hilale said. Hilale’s comments come days ahead of the planned UN talks on the peacekeeping efforts in the disputed region. The latest developments in the UN-led political process in Western Sahara point to an increasing Morocco-friendly momentum. Referring to the support and positive comments Morocco’s Autonomy Plan has received from the majority of the international community, Hilale said that the growing consensus is a further indication that Morocco’s proposal is the “only solution” to the longstanding conflict. Despite persisting doubts over the UN’s ability to maintain the momentum achieved under Horst Kohler, the Moroccan official expressed hope about the prospects of the UN-moderated process. He warned, however, that any failure to uphold the spirit of Resolution 2468, the latest UN resolution calling for pragmatism and compromise as the foundations of a lasting settlement in Western Sahara, would jeopardize the significant diplomatic overtures made in the past months.

Rabat – Days after presenting his credential letter to South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, Morocco’s ambassador to South Africa, Youssef Amrani, faced the South African press earlier this week to “present Morocco’s new development model,” as well as its commitment to pan-African ideals. At the event, attended by a dozen of South African media outlets and think tanks, Ambassador Amrani spoke at length about Morocco’s new development model as well as the North African country’s Africa-focused diplomacy and “visible efforts” towards continental peace and stability. “Morocco’s new model was gradually built thanks to the leadership of King Mohammed VI,” began Ambassador Amrani. The new model, he elaborated, emphasizes the need for “strong institutions,” a “clear vision,” as well as a holistic approach focused on the integration of human factors in all development avenues. But also crucial in the new road Morocco has embarked on in recent months is the centrality of the African continent, stressed the Moroccan official. On that front, he touched on the many roles Rabat has played at the continental level in the immediate aftermath of its readmission to the African Union. He particularly noted the importance of Morocco-South Africa relations for the entire continent. Strong cooperation and friendship between two of the continent’s leading nations can trickle down to other venues in the AU-sponsored initiatives for increased intra-African integration. “South Africa and Morocco have a lot to learn from each other, especially in sectors where our two countries have achieved internationally acknowledged expertise levels,” he said. The appointment of Amrani late last year rekindled hopes of a rapprochement between South Africa and Morocco. With the two countries’ pointed disagreement over the Western Sahara question, the sense was that Morocco needed a representative of Amrani’s caliber—one of Morocco’s most senior diplomats—to engineer a prospective rapprochement between the two nations. Having played an important role in materializing the diplomatic gains Morocco has been making of late in Latin America, where he served for decades as Ambassador, Amrani is expected to deliver similar results in the usually tense Pretoria-Rabat relations. In presenting Morocco’s “African vision” to South Africa media organizations, Amrani said he would focus on “people-to-people” approach to not only strengthen bilateral cooperation between the two countries, but also lay the groundwork for facilitating resumption of harmonious relations between the two countries in a wide-range of activities, not necessarily related to public diplomacy and politics. Amrani’s task, however, is set to be particularly challenging, not least given the heavy involvement of South Africa’s ruling party in the Polisario Front’s self-determination claims in Western Sahara. Meanwhile, over the years, a number of expert opinions, including reports from South African think tanks, have made the point that the abiding hostility between the two countries could infringe the AU’s push towards increased “intra-African coherence.”

Rabat – Lawyers representing the main perpetrators of the murder of two Scandinavian tourists in Imlil, near Marrakech, called for psychiatric tests on the defendants. The lawyers argued for the new tests during a hearing session at Sale’s appeal court yesterday, October 24. During the session, the legal defense team put forward the argument that the defendants must be “abnormal and schizophrenic,” because “committing these hateful acts can’t be done by normal people.” The defense called on the court to annul the initial sentence, pending  tests to ensure that the defendants are in good mental health. Meanwhile, the representatives of the public prosecutor called on the court to uphold the death sentence. In July 2019, the first instance court of Sale condemned 24 individuals involved in the murder case to sentences ranging from five years in prison to capital punishment. The three main perpetrators face the death penalty, while the fourth faces life imprisonment. During the most recent hearing, the prosecution also argued for the fourth defendant, initially sentenced to life imprisonment, to have his sentence changed to the death penalty. The charges against the defendants included the creation of a criminal organization, the preparation and undertaking of terrorist acts, premeditated murder, possession of firearms, attempting to make illegal explosives, and threats to national security. The case started in December 2018, when Moroccan police found the bodies of two Scandinavian women, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland, in Imlil, near Mount Toubkal. Both victims had been beheaded. While 24 suspects are implicated in the case, four faced the most severe charges for their direct involvement in carrying out the murders. The victims’ families received sympathy from Moroccan citizens, who protested the murder in front of Norwegian and Danish embassies last year in a show of solidarity.

Rabat – Lockheed Martin sees a brilliant future for its F-16 jets thanks to high demands for its jets from some countries, including Morocco. Aviation website Flight Global quoted a statement from the executive vice-president and chief financial  officer at Lockheed Martin  Kenneth Possenriede, who expressed satisfaction with clients from across the world, citing Morocco as an example. “In our plan, we see countries like Morocco and other countries out in the Far East that in aggregate could grow our backlog by another 60 aircraft,” he said. He added that Lockheed Martin sees a “great future for F-16.” Lockheed is a US global aerospace, defense, and security company with worldwide interests. Flight Global recalled that the US State Department approved in March the possible sale of 25 new  “production F-16 Block 72 aircraft and F-16V upgrades for Morocco.” Throughout the year, the US State Department announced several requests from Morocco to purchase military equipment worth $250.4 million. The request also includes Morocco’s demand to sustain its F-16fleet, which will consist of spares, training, and logistics support. “The continuation of sustainment for their F-16 fleet will strengthen the cooperation with the United States and other regional allies,” the State of Departement said. The statement emphasized that the potential deal’s main contractor will be Lockheed Martin. This is not the country’s  first military purchase request. Morocco had made an additional F-16 preservation request to the US in March 2019, seeking to upgrade its existing fleet. Recently, the Moroccan government has been focusing on upgrading its military equipment. This can be seen through Morocco’s 2020 finance bill, which will account for an increase in the country’s national defense budget The budget is set to increase by 30% in 2020, from MAD 35.155 billion to MAD 45.438 billion.

Rabat – The International Football Associations Federation (FIFA) published today, October 24, their October rankings for national squads. The Moroccan national team ranked 42nd globally, down from 39th in September. NEW #FIFARANKING 🇧🇪🔝 Belgium stay No1
🇽🇰💪 Kosovo reach best ever Ranking
🇳🇮🇸🇸 Nicaragua, South Sudan make big leapshttps://t.co/4WYcHU8sFz — FIFA.com (@FIFAcom) October 24, 2019 The Atlas Lions fell three positions in the rankings following their weak performances in their most recent games. Out of four friendly games, the national squad only won one game (1-0 against Niger). The Moroccan team drew in two friendlies (1-1 against Burkina Faso and Libya), and lost 2-3 against Gabon. Despite the drop in the global rankings, the Atlas Lions remain 5th in Africa, behind Senegal (20th globally), Tunisia (29th), Nigeria (35th), and Algeria (38th). On the global scale, FIFA’s top 3 included of Belgium, France, and Brazil. Since the last African Cup of Nations (CAN), where the Atlas Lions were eliminated by Benin in the round of 16, the national squad’s performance didn’t meet Moroccans’ expectations. The retirement of many pillars of the national team is one of the reasons behind the visible weakness of the squad. The former Atlas Lions’ captain, Mehdi Benatia, is among the most remarkable names to announce their international retirement, leaving a void in the national squad’s defense. Vahid Halilhodzic, the new Atlas Lions’ coach, after almost three months on the head of the national team, hasn’t yet found a way to fill this void. In fact, in four games played at home, the Moroccan defense conceded five goals. In statements to the press, Halilhodzic explained that the squad needs more time to become competitive, and that he is still looking for new, promising players to replace the retired ones. The Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has set reaching CAN 2021’s semi-finals, qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, and winning the 2023 CAN as objectives for the Bosnian coach. As Halilhodzic’s squad will play their first official game in November, against Mauritania, for the 2021 CAN Qualifiers, it is yet to be seen if the coach will be able to build a team that is strong enough to achieve all of these objectives.

Rabat – The Moroccan Association for Family Planning (AMPF), in collaboration with Mohammed V University in Rabat, is set to host an international conference on sex education and reproductive health in Africa. The conference will take place in Rabat’s Faculty of Education Sciences (FSE) between October 30 and October 31. The event aims to shed light on the importance of sex education as a research topic, through scientific debates on the matter. The conference also aims to give young students and civil society a platform to share their ideas and suggestions on how sex education can be improved in Morocco, and in Africa more widely. The conference will also provide an opportunity to review the African Union’s (AU) Maputo Plan of Action 2016-2030. The Maputo plan, which Ministers of Health of the AU first adopted in 2006, aims to put a continental policy framework for sexual and reproductive health and rights. The reviewed plan of 2016-2030 was approved by heads of states at the 2016 AU assembly in Kigali, Rwanda. The updated version reinforces the objective of universal access to sex and reproductive health services in Africa. It also aims to help achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially those of good-health and well being, and gender equality. Since Morocco returned to the AU in 2017, it is also concerned by the Maputo action plan and needs to work on improving access to sex education and health. Sex education is not yet implemented in Moroccan school programs and a large number of Moroccan society still considers talking about sex taboo. The conference will discuss some of these issues, and aims to provide suggestions for Moroccan, and African, policy-makers.

Rabat  – Moroccan company Mya Energy  inked a deal with Russian state development cooperation VEB on Wednesday, October 23. The deal concerns the construction of a €2 billion oil refinery in the North African country. Morocco’s participation in the 2019 Russian-African summit has already reaped fruits.  A high-level delegation of senior officials and business operators flew to Sochi, Russia to take part in the event, including Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. Moroccan state owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported on October 23 that the VEB and the recently formed Moroccan company signed the deal to build a petrochemical complex in northern Morocco. The estimated initial refining capacity is 100,000 barrels per day. The company will aim for a target of 200,000 barrels per day after the initial phase. MAP cited a statement from the Moroccan company, saying  that the development and implementation of the project will be carried out by the Moroccan company in partnership with several Russian actors in the field of energy.  The Russian actors in the field will provide their Moroccan counterparts with expertise, technology, and equipment. For Mya Energy, the refinery facility will open doors for direct and indirect job opportunities to help reduce unemployment. “This project is expected to create several thousand direct and indirect jobs, especially in the northern region of the kingdom.” The location of the refinery also plays a strategic role as it seeks to take advantage of the port facilities of Nador West Med With this project, Morocco seeks to achieve  domestic oil production as it has been importing most of its energy needs after the shutdown of its sole refinery SAMIR since 2015. The refinery closed down due to unpaid heavy debt. According to OEC, Morocco’s top imports are “refined petroleum ($3.13B)(…) and Petroleum Gas ($1.27 B).” General director of the Mya Energy firm Youssef El Alaoui signed the deal along with the president of the Russian development cooperation, Daniil Algulyan, and the vice president of the Russian Center for Export Nikita Gusakov.

Washington DC – Rabat’s strategies and programs remain irrelevant, out-of-touch, shortsighted and condescending. Mindful of the weight of the diaspora’s hard currency remittances  on the national economy, the Moroccan government undertook major public campaigns and created several governmental and semi-governmental organizations to engage the MREs. However, these mobilization strategies never addressed the real needs and immediate demands of the more than 5 million Moroccans living abroad. Last summer during the peak of Moroccan immigrants’  seasonal visits to the old country, national media outlets were awash with horror stories of MRE’s losing properties to scammer and tales of investors squandering their life savings in bogus business deals. These accounts of mistreatments and exploitations continue to have major negative impacts on the diaspora’s decisions to invest, buy property and stay involved in the national dialogue in Morocco. In fact, the gulf between the diaspora and the Moroccan government is widening.  While the number of MREs’ complaints about fraud, embezzlements, scams and  property misappropriations have increased, the official responses have remained meek and apathetic. Many MREs feel that their compatriots view them as cash dispensing machines who should send money without having a voice about how these billions of dollars should be spent. Furthermore, some Moroccan immigrants feel like moving targets for local scammers and swindlers who view MREs as naïve, gullible and “rich” enough to afford losing money. This distorted view of MREs force would be investors to contribute to the development of the overall national economy, especially toward local capital and production in the small villages and poor regions that the government have long ignored, and ultimately help in boosting job creations and living standards. The lack of political transparency, judicial independence and policy enforcement is pushing more and more Moroccans living abroad to forgo on investing in the home country’s real estate and business opportunities. It is safe to say that the mistrust between MREs and government officials is real and broadening. The diaspora’s displeasure and irritation with local businesses’ greed and officials’ indifference have reached the Moroccan tourism industry also. The lack of price control and the decline in quality of tourist establishments during the summer season drove more MREs this year to shun Morocco for other vacation distinctions costing the local economy millions of dollars and euros in lost revenue. On the political front, efforts to mobilize the Moroccan diaspora have been a tricky endeavor for Rabat. There is that need to utilize this large block of voters in countries like France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands to lobby on the one hand and there is the fear of uniting a diverse group of citizens who may call for dramatic democratic reforms in the Kingdom and turn to a strong opposition front on the other. This dilemma coupled with a lack of transparency and mistrust in official organizations and bureaucrats in charge of MRE, including diplomats in some embassies and consulates, impede the national strategy to enhance the involvement of the Moroccans living abroad. Recent mobilization strategies flopped to gather momentum as Rabat keeps cherry picking its own representatives among the community abroad. In fact, skilled Moroccans who could lobby their host countries and advance Moroccan political and economic positions around influence world capitals tend to stay away from politics because of the amateurism and indifference of officials put in charge of MRE affairs. While the remittances will continue pouring into the country and supporting goods and services, their impact on the overall economic activities will remain limited. Indeed, attracting major direct investments and highly educated professionals back to the old country for long-term work and investment will remain elusive until the Moroccan government makes real and genuine adjustments to its actors and approaches. Rabat major efforts to entice its diaspora to contribute to the development of Morocco will not succeed without the involvement of duly chosen MRES and the true engagement of the political and administrative players toward creating a fair, open and transparent system that would benefit the Kingdom as well as its citizens around the globe.

Rabat – Moroccan officials inaugurated the first village in Morocco and Africa to be fully powered by solar energy on October 12. The village “Id Mjahdi” is located near Essaouira, around 190km to the west of Marrakech. The Moroccan ministry of energy, and Essaouira’s local authorities worked with the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), Moroccan NGO Cluster Solaire, and French businesses Intermarche and Le Petit Olivier, among other partners to complete the pilot project.

All of the village’s power comes from 32 photovoltaic solar panels, generating 8.32Kwh of electricity. The power station powers around 20 homes, the village houses more than 50 people. The solar power station also powers water heaters and ovens inside the houses, as well as the street lights. The electricity network has a battery, storing electricity for use outside daylight hours. The town facilities include a public hammam, a water tower, an argan workshop providing jobs for the local population, and an educational center. The educational center is equipped with two classrooms, a sports field, and a playground. It will provide education for children aged between four and six, as well as basic literacy for adults in the village. Fatima-Zahra El Khalifa, general director of Cluster Solaire, a partner organization of the project, said during the inauguration ceremony that “women of the village expressed their feelings towards the project in touching words: we went from darkness to light because of solar energy.” Morocco’s former minister of education and member of the Essaouira-Mogador Association, Rachid Belmokhtar, said that “projects like these reduce social disparities, and introduce comfort and modernity to small villages.” He added that this project is a pilot and could be replicated in various regions of Morocco, as part of the Kingdom’s aims to invest more in sustainable development and renewable energy.

Rabat – Spanish news outlet El Faro de Ceuta has published another video documenting the risks taken by some Moroccan irregular migrants attempting to reach Europe. “Young Moroccans do not fear the sea. They undertake journeys in any way, without considering the risks,” the news outlet reported. The video posted by the Spanish news outlet  on October 21 shows a fishing boat unloading young irregular migrants from a small boat this weekend. This is not the first video to document such an incident. In September, El Faro de Ceuta published a video of several Moroccan teenagers trying to reach Spain on inflatable boats. In the video, one of the young men said, “we are leaving for Spain. Everyone wants to go to Spain.” Despite efforts to ease the pressure of irregular migration, the issue of undocumented immigration continues to be a source of concern for both Morocco and Spain. The Spanish acting government, however, is satisfied with Morocco’s efforts in dismantling irregular migration attempts. El Pais reported on October 17 that Spain managed to reduce undocumented migration by half. The Spanish media said  that 24,159 people arrived in Spain this year. The decrease in the number of arrivals  marks the first serious decline in irregular immigration by land and sea since, the Spanish report added.

Rabat – Moroccan ground-based air traffic controllers have announced that they will reduce the pace of work at Moroccan airports as part of a partial strike for 15 days, starting October 30.  Air traffic controllers took the decision collectively after an extraordinary general assembly held on October 19 at the Airports National Syndicate (CDT). In a statement posted on the CDT Facebook page, controllers expressed their dissatisfaction with the Moroccan Airport Authority (ONDA) and called for the reform of office policy. The CDT added that ONDA’s administrative decisions are irresponsible and have no impact on the workings of Moroccan airports or the working conditions of the CDT members. To put pressure on ONDA, the CDT workers will restrict the number of airplanes by allowing the takeoff and landing of only one airplane every 30 minutes into Moroccan airports. CDT’s decision will cause huge disruption at Moroccan airports with at least 10 aircraft joining Moroccan airspace every five minutes. The partial strike may cause delays of up to 10 hours.   If their demands are not met before the end of the 15 days partial strike, air traffic controllers will call a national strike but will, however, continue to provide their services to state airplanes, medical aircraft, aircraft in an emergency, and national military aircraft. Meanwhile, the pace of work will be reduced to a minimum in protest against the “contempt of air traffic controllers within ONDA” In the statement, controllers condemned the unfavorable work conditions. They cited that they are understaffed and work in more severe and dangerous conditions than other employees. Air traffic controllers are demanding the right to partnership and a voice in the process of changing ONDA’s economic model. They are also calling for the integration of all premiums in calculating retirement pensions and the increase of the license premium. Also part of their demands is the regularization of air traffic controllers who have suffered a reduction of wages due to incapacity, transfer, or any other reason, and the involvement of the national union of the National Airports Office (SNONDA) as a social partner in all current and future projects initiated by ONDA. In case of non-compliance to CDT’s demands, Moroccan airports may experience a full shutdown of air traffic services.

 Rabat – Moroccan non-profit organization “Mawadah,” concerned by social and family development, published an online petition against “pornographic liberties,” on Saturday, October 19. More than 5,000 Moroccans have already signed the digital document. The organization entitled the petition “Statement About the Demands of Individual Freedoms.” The document contained five paragraphs, each expressing an opinion concerning the ongoing debate about individual freedoms in Morocco. مؤسسة مودة للتنمية الأسرية تطلق حملة:
{مغاربة ضد الحريات الإباحية} وفيما يلي البيان المؤسس للحملة: بسم الله الرحمن… Posted by ‎مؤسسة مودة للتنمية الأسرية‎ on Saturday, 19 October 2019 In the first paragraph, the NGO express their belief in individual freedoms as a human right, and that they are very open to participate in a debate with anyone with a different opinion. However, according to them, Islam is the core of Moroccan identity, and all Moroccans should abide by it. Then, the organization assure that basing the legal system on Islamic laws is more than enough to ensure justice and human rights for Moroccans. According to “Mawadah,” there is no need to import “foreign systems” and try to apply them in Morocco, because these “imported systems are serving agendas that are known to everyone,” implying a conspiracy against the morals of Muslims from the West. In the third paragraph, they express their “absolute condemnation of sex outside of wedlock, adultery, homosexuality, and abortion.” These “immoral practices” present a number of “dangers on individuals, family, and society.” Fourth, the petition considers Morocco as a reference for “moderate and open-minded” Islam. The organization refutes all kinds of extremism, both “exaggeration and excess of religion, and the extremism of sexual liberties and immorality.” Finally, the NGO reiterate their rejection of demonstrations calling for “sexual freedoms.” According to the organization, these protests “only serve the savage agendas of globalization and imperialism that don’t respect religions nor national and ethnic specificities.” After the petition reached 5,000 signatories, “Mawadah” expressed their “pride in Moroccan society’s attachment to their identity.” They also invited more people to sign. “The future of young generations in our nation is based on our efforts today to preserve our identity, our values, and our morals.” تم جمع أكثر من 5000 توقيع في أقل من 30 ساعة .. هذا هو المجتمع المغربي المتمسك بهويته وأصالته .. التواقيع مستمرة من… Posted by ‎مؤسسة مودة للتنمية الأسرية‎ on Monday, 21 October 2019 “Mawadah” foundation was created in 2015. Its main objective is helping maintain cohesive families, and a conscious and safe society in Morocco. The petition comes as a counter effort against the movement known as “Moroccan Outlaws.” The movement published a petition signed by 490 people calling for a change in laws incriminating sex outside of wedlock and abortion. The petition was published after Moroccan police arrested journalist Hajar Raissouni for sex outside of wedlock and illegal abortion, along with her fiance, her doctor, and his two assistants, in September 2019. In early October, Rabat’s court sentenced all the defendants to prison. On October 16, however, King Mohammed VI granted a royal pardon to Raissouni and the other defendants. The case sparked widespread outrage, not only among Moroccan activists, but also within the international community. Since its publication in September 2019, the “Moroccan Outlaws” petition has gathered more than 10,000 signatures.     A post shared by Moroccan outlaws (@moroccan.outlaws.490) on Oct 14, 2019 at 1:00am PDT  During a debate about abortion, Moroccan novelist Sonia Terrab, one of the movement’s leaders, said; “For me, it is a victory that youth are mobilizing with us, in this fight against unjust laws.” The debate took place at Mohammed VI University, in Casablanca, on October 16. Politicians, professors, activists, and religious scholars all took part in the debate.

The strike concerns all administrative and medical departments at the hospital, with the exception of emergencies and intensive care services. The National Federation for Health, affiliated with the General Union of Moroccan Workers (UGTM), announced the strike yesterday, October 22, through a press release. The workers on strike demand “an amendment to the basic regulation on joint interministerial technical commissions.” The strikers also called for the creation of two new grades for chief technicians. The syndicate’s demands include “a constructive and responsible dialogue” with the ministry of health. This new strike is part of a series of demonstrations that have taken place throughout 2019. Doctors and hospital employees have organized numerous protests to improve their work conditions and the quality of hospitals. Only a few weeks ago, on October 7, the Independent Syndicate of Public Sector Doctors (SIMSP) organized a national strike covering all Moroccan public hospitals.

Rabat – Polisario’s legitimacy claim has been dealt yet another blow: The separatist front will not take part in the first Russia-Africa summit on October 23 and 24 in Sochi.  A number of reports indicate that Russia invited 54 AU member states to attend the Sochi summit. The eastern European giant, however, chose not to issue an invitation to the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Meanwhile, the Polisario Front made an announcement turning the slight from Russia in their own favor by claiming that their non-attendance was a Polisario decision. As Russia’s Vladimir Putin prepared to welcome African leaders to the Sotchi summit for a two days meetings, a SADR spokesperson announced that the self-proclaimed republic would abstain from participating in the Soshi summit.  Russia worked outside the African Union (AU) partnership framework when inviting African states for the Sochi summit, according to SNN Sahara. Offering an explanation for the Polisario’s non-attendance, SNN Sahara reported; “The Sochi Summit, to be held on October 23-24, is not a summit of partnership with the African Union and is therefore organized by a unilateral Russian initiative.”. The AU has not signed a partnership agreement with Russia, unlike the European Union. For this reason, the Sochi Summit invitations were submitted to African nations recognized by the Russian government, rather than AU member states.  Around 40 African countries, including Morocco, confirmed their participation, reported Russian state-owned agency TASS. Russia is known for its strong diplomatic relations with Algeria. The north African country and neighbor to Morocco has been supporting and financing the Polisario Front for decades. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the current chair of the AU, will co-host the summit.  Businessmen, leaders, and representatives of Russian, African, and international companies are also set to attend the event. The major focus points of the summit are peace, trade, security, and politics, on both the continental and cross-continental levels. Russia’s choice not to include the separatist front reinforces the notion, growing even in pro-Polisario circles, that the separatist group is losing the legitimacy-recognition struggle in the international community.  In addition to the increasing number of countries throwing their weight behind Morocco’s Western Sahara proposal, an equally increasing number of countries have distanced themselves from the Polisario Front in recent months.  At this year’s Tokyo International Conference of African Development (TICAD) conference in August, Japan reiterated its support for Morocco and explicit dissociated itself from separatism in Western Sahara. The conference was organized in collaboration with the African Union Commission and so included all AU members.  In spite of the presence of a Polisario delegation at the summit, the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry was adamant about the country’s position as one of the rejections of separatism. “Japan does not recognize Western Sahara a state, neither explicitly nor implicitly,” the ministry said.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita met with US President Donald Trump’s senior advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on the sidelines of the 4th session of the US-Morocco Strategic Dialogue held on Tuesday, October 22. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) the meeting,  touched upon means to strengthen bilateral partnership between Rabat and Washington and allowed for an exchange of views on regional issues. The meeting between Bourita and Kushner comes less than six months after the White House senior adviser’s visit to Morocco, when he met with King Mohammed VI and several other Moroccan officials in May. On May 28, the King hosted a breaking fast ceremony as Kushner’s visit fell during the holy month of Ramadan in Morocco. The visit was part of Kushner’s tour in preparation for Washington’s economic conference held in June in Bahrain. The conference sought to encourage investment in Palestine. The timing of Kushner’s visit, however, drew criticism from observers, who suggested that the visit sought to earn Morocco’s support for the US Peace Plan for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,  also known as the “Deal of the Century.” Morocco’s government, however, denied any discussions on the deal with Kushner during his visit. A week after Kushner’s first visit to Morocco, Bourita told the press on June 7 that “Morocco does not know yet of the content of any peace plan and will express its position when it will be informed about the details of the initiative.” He added that Kushner’s visit to Morocco touched on “bilateral relations and developments in the Middle East.” In addition to Kushner, Bourita also met with Ivanka Trump, senior adviser to President Trump. Ivanka Trump among the US officials who welcomed Morocco’s reforms, including those related to women’s rights. Ms Trump conveyed her appreciation to Morocco’s reforms in a Facebook post in August. She said that her country applauds the “Moroccan government for this important step towards the adoption of inheritance law amendments, and look forward to supporting their full implementation.” The US official referred to the adoption of three bills related to communal agricultural land (sulaliyat).  The bill, unanimously adopted by the House of Representatives in August, takes into account the aspirations of rights holders, including women.

Rabat – In bizarrely racist comments, a guest on a morning show on French C-News channel, complained about the growing dominance of non-French cuisine. He said that food like Kebabs and couscous are not culturally French and “Maghrebize” those who consume them. “So are you troubled by her comments on Kebab are you not?” one of the two hosts asked the guest, referring to a statement by France’s Senegalese-born Government Spokesperson Sibeth Ndiaye. Ndiaye had previously said, optimistically speaking about the limits and promises of multiculturalism in France, that most “French people today eat Kebab.” The Senegalese-born French official, who has repeatedly faced racist attacks and been reproached a “lack of cultural taste” for appearing to espouse a lifestyle which her critics, in most cases avowed French nationalists, say is not “primordially French,” had meant her Kebab statement as a compliment to French multiculturalism, in spite of the persisting challenges in some anti-migrant circles. But Ndiaye’s praise of the evolution of French society did not sit well with the C-News guest. In response to one of the hosts’ questions about whether the Kebab comment “troubled” him, he unapologetically answered, “Yes.” When asked to elaborate, he provided what he says is a defense of French culture and cuisine. “No, all French people do not eat Kebab, only some do,” he started softly, adding, “Not all French people eat Kebab because, and I’m sorry to say this, we are neither in Algeria nor in Morocco, or Tunisia.” Pushed further by the hosts to offer a more compelling defense of why he found it so offensive that French people be associated with eating—and loving—Kebab or couscous, he fumed at the perceived assault on French cuisine and culture in general from foreigners. To speak as generally as Ndiaye did by saying “French people eat kebab,” he argued, is to imply that “all the French people have been Magrhebized.” The comparison jarred both hosts, leading them to ask, “So are you really saying that eating Kebab makes one Magrhebi, or Maghrebized, to use your own words?” The response came in a further nationalist zigzag, with the guest saying that he had not meant the comparison as the host appeared to have understood it. However, he firmly said “Yes” in response to the question, only to add that he would have said the same thing of Hamburger or Sushi, “because it is not French cuisine.” The statements, however jarring, are far from an isolated incident. Reports converge that France is witnessing a resurgence of Islamophobic and racist sentiments in the aftermath of the murder of four Police officers by a colleague who authorities believe had been radicalized. In the immediate aftermath of the murders, the French government called for “collective vigilance” to fight against radicalization. The country has since seen a surge in Islamophobia and racism, leading some observers to argue that many in France now feel emboldened to let out unapologetically racist remarks. Last week, a university in the Paris region listed typically Islamic lifestyle choices or ethical recommendations such as growing a beard, not shaking hands with the opposite sex, or wearing a jellaba, as signs of Islamist radicalization. When called out for the move’s blatant Islamophobia, the president of the university said there was nothing particularly offensive about the university’s concern with preempting radicalization among its staff and students.

Rabat – Travel guide website Lonely Planet has listed Morocco among top ten destinations for 2020. The list of the ten best destinations for 2020 features Morocco as the ninth most beautiful destinations in the world ahead of Uruguay, the tenth on the list. “Morocco is having a moment, with time-honoured attractions complemented by sustainable-yet-stylish lodging, restaurants serving up seasonal produce and coastal wellness retreats mixing up yoga and surfing.” The ranking extolled Morocco’s “improved infrastructure” which makes it easier for visitors to get around by road. Lonely Planet also recalled the inauguration of Africa’s first high-speed train known as LGV. “[This] means that you can zip from Casablanca to Tangier in just two hours.” The ranking guides its readers and followers to the most nostalgic areas in the countries, including the medinas (old cities) in Fez, Essaouira, Meknes, Tetouan and Marrakech. “You can still escape the crowds in Berber mountain villages, deserted Atlantic baches and far-flung desert outposts,” Lonely Planet wrote. Bhutan topped the list ahead of England, the second on the list, and North Macedonia. Morocco’s beautiful weather and culture continue to attract millions of visitors annually. Nearly eight million tourists visited Morocco by the end of July 2019.  The recent ranking from Lonely Planet is among a recent surge in reports that tout Morocco’s tourism assets.  Last week, Canadian-based online travel company Flight Network  named Marrakech one of the top 50 most beautiful cities in the world. Last year, Lonely Planet listed Meknes among the top ten cities to visit worldwide in 2019. Meknes is located about 60 kilometers west of Fez and 155 kilometers east of Rabat. “The notorious war-mongering sultan who moved Morocco’s capital to Meknès in 1672 would be turning in his grave if he knew how few visitors the city receives today compared with Fez and Marrakesh,” wrote the famous travel guide publisher.

Rabat – Facebook has announced the disabling of a network of Russian-backed accounts that praise President Donald Trump and attack former vice president Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 US elections. The Russian-backed network has the same hallmark and follows the same strategy as the group that interfered in the 2016 election. In 2016, a Russian backed network manipulated public opinion by filling up the newsfeed with content promoting Donald Trump and tarnishing the image of the then-candidate Hilary Clinton. The latest network to be dismantled had been using fake accounts on Facebook and Instagram in order to mislead public opinion and provoke social and political unrest. Facebook also disabled three misleading campaigns originating from Iran.  As part of the network, fake users on Instagram were posting content about U.S. politics and memes targeting Democratic presidential candidates. They also took advantage of sensitive topics, including racial and religious fault lines and LGBT questions to sow public discord. The social media company has undergone a series of policy improvements meant to boost its defenses against misinformation. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company’s latest efforts indicate the threat of “increasingly sophisticated attacks from Russia, Iran, and China,” but added he is “confident we’re more prepared now.” Following the takedowns, Facebook implemented new regulations on owners of Facebook pages. Owners are now required to disclose more clearly the organization they work for and whether they are tied to a state-owned news agency. In September, Facebook cracked down on a one-million-followers page called “I Love America” that posted pro-Trump memes but was actually run by Ukrainians. Facebook said that the page violated its policies on spam and fake accounts.

Rabat – 19,000 Moroccan seasonal workers are expected to travel to Spain this year to work in strawberry fields as part of a longstanding bilateral agreement between Madrid and Rabat, according to reports. The number of migrant workers needed for the upcoming harvest season in Spain’s Andalusia region indicates a steady need for seasonal workers from Morocco. Each year, close to 20,000 travel to Spain as part of the agreement. The high numbers reflect the importance of the Strawberry industry of the Spanish economy but also the significance of Moroccan migrant workers to sustain the business, Morocco’s Les Inspirations Eco newspaper reported earlier today. But the projected numbers tend to slightly decrease by the end of the recruitment process. Les Inspirations Eco noted that for last year almost 20,000 were expected to travel to Spain but by the end of the recruiting and screening process only 14,411 made the final cut. The first recruitment phase for this year is set to start by the end of November. One novelty for this year is that there will be four recruitment rounds, up from three in recent years. The project is the fruit of strong cooperation between the Spanish government and the Moroccan Ministry of Labor and Vocational Integration. The partnership is usually labeled as a bilateral agreement aimed at reducing Morocco’s high unemployment. The project has appealed to—and still does—thousands of Moroccan rural women. In the past months and years, however, there have been numerous complaints of sexual abuse, exploitation, and unpaid labor. “In Morocco, they are deliberately looking for those who are cheap and vulnerable to do this work, namely rural women with young children who only understand Arabic, cannot understand their contracts written in Spanish or claim their rights,” one woman recently told  the Guardian. Even as the project legacy has been stained by repeated reports of abuse and exploitation, the extremely high unemployment rate in Morocco means the project continues to appeal to many in the country. Earlier this year, Morocco set up a committee to deal with the recurring exploitation and sexual abuse complaints, vowing to preempt a repeat of previous scandals and defend the rights of the women it annually sends to Spanish strawberry fields.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Economy, Finance, and Administrative Reform, Mohamed Benchaaboun, announced yesterday, October 21, the budget allocations for  key sectors in the 2020 appropriation bill (PLF). The minister made the announcement during a plenary session in the parliament, chaired by the House of Representatives’ president, Habib El Malki, and the House of Councillors’ president, Hakim Benchamach. Health and Education The 2020 PLF allocated MAD 91 billion for education, scientific research, and health care. This budget represents 30% of the total state budget for the year 2020. The 2020 budget for the three sectors is about MAD 13 billion more than the 2019 education, scientific research, and health budget. The budget for education and scientific research will go from MAD 62 billion in 2019 to MAD 72.4 billion for 2020, representing a 16.75% increase. Meanwhile the health budget is set to increase by 14.41%, from MAD 16.3 billion to MAD 18.7 billion. The increased budget aims to support reforms in these vital sectors after a series of strikes and manifestations. Throughout 2019, demonstrators have deplored the quality of Moroccan schools, universities, and hospitals. Both doctors and teachers boycotted their places of work and took to the streets, demanding tangible changes in the health and education sectors. The bill also aims to create 20,000 jobs in the three sectors. The health sector will account for 4,000 new jobs, and education and scientific research will account for a further 16,000. The new positions represent 46% of the total of the positions forecast by Moroccan government for 2020. The PLF aims to create more than 43,000 new positions in total in the upcoming year. Benchaaboun also announced the allocation of MAD 1.7 billion for the health insurance system, RAMED, allowing it to cover more Moroccans, including freelancers and students. An additional MAD 3.5 billion will go to initiatives aiming to prevent students from dropping out of school, especially in rural areas, by providing support to their families. The initiatives include “Tayssir” initiative, giving parents financial support to keep their children in school, “One million schoolbags” initiative, and school buses in rural areas. The official also announced the cancellation of value-added taxes (VAT) on vaccines, to make them more affordable for low-income households. Moroccans’ Purchasing Power Aiming to alleviate the financial pressure on Moroccan citizens, the minister announced the allocation of MAD 26 billion to support Moroccans’ purchasing power. The MAD 26 billion budget is divided into several categories. Around MAD 14.6 billion will go into the preexisting compensation fund, maintaining the relatively low prices of butane gas, sugar, and flour for consumers. The compensation fund helps reduce the prices of these essential products through financing their transportation and distribution, for butane gas, and through importing them from international markets and selling them to distributors for lowered prices, in the case of sugar and flour. The minister added that the 2020 bill allocates MAD 630 million to supporting widows, and MAD 200 million for people with disabilities. This budget will go towards building social centers for people in precarious situations. It will also finance a project of monthly allowances for people with special needs, if the government decides to implement it. The National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), an initiative aiming to help Moroccans start their own income generating activities, will receive MAD 2.2 billion. Finally, the 2020 PLF allocates MAD 7.4 billion for the fight against social and territorial disparities. The 2020 budget announcement comes as the 2019’s second quarter household survey, conducted by the High Commission for Planning (HCP), showed that the index of household confidence is continuously declining. The index is based on the standard of living, the rate of unemployment, the opportunity to buy durable goods, and the financial situation of Moroccan households. Arts, Culture and Sports Benchaaboun also announced the 2020 allocations for arts, culture, and sports in the formation of human values within the younger generations. As part of the budget allocations, VAT on tickets to museums, cinemas, and theaters will go down from 20% to 10%. The government will also provide help to sports associations, mainly football clubs playing in Botola Pro, allowing them to transform into companies, through fiscal reductions. The budget announcement comes after a long year of demonstrations and protests across several sectors. It remains to be seen whether the money the newly reshuffled government is injecting into education, health, and purchasing power will have the desired impact.

Rabat – Sahrawis continue to call on the international community to intervene in the case of the three detained opposition  activists. A group of women protested the continued detention of the three activists on Sunday, October 20, near the Tindouf camps, where thousands of Sahrawis live. “We are here today to call for the release of our sons, who have been aggressively and unjustly arrested,” one of the women said in a video. Former Polisario police officer Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud shared the footage on his Facebook page. The Polisario Front arrested Moulay Aba Bouzid, Fadel Braka, and Mahmoud Zidane in June. Despite no formal charges and no trial, the three activists have been behind bars since June. In the video, one of the protesters said that the activists have been on a hunger strike for five days to condemn their unjust arrest. The separatist group arrested the activists for denouncing the living situation of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps, criticizing  freedom of movement restrictions. “The mothers of [opposition] prisoners Fadel, Bouzid, and Zidane called on Western countries to intervene for the release of their sons,” Mustafa Salma wrote.  For the former Polisario member, while the rest of the world seems to be stirred by calls for change, the youth movements and drives for change have not reached the  “ the Tindouf camps which are ruled by the Polisario Front with a security system that suppresses freedom.” Mustafa Salma said that the lack of “young leaders and drive of protest movements for change” in the camps is a “deliberate” move from the Polisario. He emphasized that there is only one secondary school in which a “few children from the camps are studying” in Tindouf. Most high school and university students are “studying in Algeria and they cannot come back to Tindouf camps during summer,” Mustafa Salma wrote. Sahrawis, women and men,  have been protesting the arrest of the activists for more than six months since the arrest. The Polisario Front has not responded to the calls for the release of the three activists. The international community also remains silent on the illegal arrest, despite the many cries for help from the relatives of the detainees. The UN report on the situation on Western Sahara from the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, briefly discussed the arrest of the activists. Paragraph 71 of the report indicates that the UN bodies were informed by the OHCHR on  “ the harassment, arrest, arbitrary detention and ill-treatment by Frente POLISARIO security forces of a human rights defender and a blogger engaged in documenting human rights violations in the region.” The report also recalled that the activists  “denounced the management of the Tindouf refugee camps on social media. They were reportedly arrested in June 2019 by Frente POLISARIO security forces following a sit-in at the Rabouni camp to protest the disappearance in 2009 of Khalil Ahmed.” Khalil Ahmed is a Polisario members who forcibly disappeared nearly 10 years ago. Algerian intelligence services along with Polisario members kidnapped El Khalil in 2009, two months after the Polisario had appointed him to monitor human rights in the Tindouf camps. The family of Khalil has been protesting his disappearance for months without any clear explanation from the separatist group.

Rabat – Moroccan Islamic scholar Ahmed Raissouni,  the head of the International  Union of Muslim scholars has  slammed activists and feminists who “exploited” individualism to defend “abnormal practices” following the arrest of Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni for abortion and sex outside marriage. Police arrested Raissouni on August 31. After a month of detention, a court sentenced Raissouni along with her fiance to one year in prison on charges of abortion and sex outside marriage. Less than two weeks later, King Mohammed VI pardoned the journalist and her fiance along with the doctor and medical team who allegedly conducted the abortion. Raissouni’s case took on an international dimension, with activists and feminists condemning her arrest and the Moroccan laws that criminalize abortion and sexual relations outside marriage. The case gave momentum to activists who took the unprecedented step of publishing  a Manifesto on September 23. The manifesto stands in solidarity with Raissouni, while also criticizing the laws in Moroccan law and the penalization of sex outside marriage and abortion. The manifesto by Sonia Terrab and Leila Slimani attracted attention from both opposition  and supporters. The signatories of the manifesto called themselves outlaws. Enemies of individualism For Ahmed Raissouni there are two types of enemies of individualism. The first category includes people who defend “certain abnormal practices” and wrongdoing such “adultery, homosexuality, and marital infidelity.” For these people, continues Raissouni, the aim is to defend sexual freedom. “Although sex and sexual freedoms  (…) are more enjoyable than this falsification and contempt,” the Islamic scholar said. Raissouni’s statement suggest that he does not only criticize the “outlaws” but also statements from Moroccan MP Omar Balafrej of the Federation of the Democratic Left (FGD)Party for criticizing laws against abortion and individual liberties. In a live video on his Facebook, Balafrej criticized several laws in Morocco’s criminal code, including article 489. The MP called for the removal of article 489 from the Moroccan penal code. Article 489 criminalizes “unlawful or unnatural acts with an individual of the same sex.” Homosexuality is illegal in Morocco, it is punishable by 6 months to 3 years of imprisonment with a fine ranging from MAD 200 to MAD 1,000. He also criticized Article 490. Article 490 criminalizes all sexual intercouse outside marriage, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The second category  includes those who prevent freedoms “unlawfully,” according to Raissouni. Raissouni took the opportunity to also criticize countries banning or seeking to ban the veil in public spaces. “Many countries around the world prohibit and fight individual freedoms, including the freedom to wear a veil for women, a niqab or a [covered] swimming suit.” “All these wasted rights and freedoms are neither known nor recognized by pornographic maniacs because they are top [priority] rights,” Raissouni concluded. In France, a nationwide debate broke out after members of National Rally (RN) verbally attacked a Muslim woman for attending a meeting on October 11 for wearing hijab. The members of the RN asked the woman, who accompanied her son to a school activity, to leave the room or remove her hijab.

Rabat – The Algerian regime has finally responded to the pro-Morocco comments of a former leader of Algeria’s National Liberation Front (FLN) on the Western Sahara conflict, reiterating its traditional commitment to the Polisario Front and the “Sahrawi people’s struggle for self-determination.” In comments to Algerian government-run news outlet Ech-Chaab on Monday, October 21, Communication Minister and Government Spokesperson Hassan Rabhi said that Algiers’ stance on Western Sahara remains unchanged and that  any pro-Morocco comments do not remotely reflect the guidelines set by the Algerian regime. “Algeria’s position on this issue is clear,” the minister said. “The only solution to the [Western Sahara] conflict is one that guarantees the organization of a transparent and inclusive referendum on self-determination, as laid out in all the UN charters and resolutions.” Rabhi spoke about the need to draw the boundaries between individuals’ opinions and the government’s position.  Regardless of a person’s status in the country’s political landscape, Rabhi suggested, any comments not made via official government channels should be perceived as “not reflecting the government’s position,” or influencing high-profile decisions on particular, sensitive issues. The expectedly muscular response comes unexpectedly late, four days after Amar Saadani, a former FLN Secretary General, said that “Western Sahara is Moroccan and nothing else.” Speaking to Algerian outlet TSA on Thursday, October 17, Saadani even went as far as lambasting Algiers for “pouring huge sums of money for the so-called Polisario for fifty years.” The former FLN leader spoke about the need to “break the impasse” in Western Sahara and recognize Morocco’s historical right to the disputed territory. He emphasized the importance of ending what he sees as a pointless rivalry between Algiers and Rabat in order to focus on building a working Maghreb Union. In the government’s response, Minister Rabhi asserted that Saadani is “entitled to his own opinions.” But the Algerian government’s spokesperson went on to belittle the FLN official’s statements, saying they do not have “the faintest value” or impact on either the Algerian government’s foreign policy or “the high level of responsibility with which the UN treats this [Western Sahara] question.” The comments from Saadani generated wild speculation about Algeria’s Western Sahara diplomacy. Supporting Polisario or the “Sahrawi cause” has been a distinguishable feature and “a cardinal principle” of the Algerian regime since the start of the conflict. With Polisario-bashing comments from a former leader of the country’s ruling party, however, there were talks of a growing discontent in parts of the Algerian political establishment with the country’s direct and heavy involvement in the Western Sahara stalemate. That Algiers waited four days to react, which is considered a very long time in such a case, reinforced that perception. Both Saadani’s remarks and Algiers’ uncharacteristic silence, some Algerian outlets enthusiastically commented, could mean that there were winds of change in the making regarding Algeria’s Western Sahara stance. The sense was that, after more than four decades of staunch upport to the Polisario Front, the new FLN cadre was perhaps poised to move past some of the party’s old principles and focus on opening up new avenues in regional politics. But the response from the Algerian government means such enthusiastic proclamations can wait. While issued late, Algiers’s response is set to dent the hope that greeted Saadani’s remarks, suggesting self-determination or support for Polisario is set to remain the essence of the Algerian regime’s Western Sahara agenda for some more years.

Rabat – The International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC), a member of the Islamic Development Bank Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Morocco’s OCP Africa to increase agricultural production yields and income levels for Africa’s smallholder farmers through strategic funding, innovation, and capacity-building measures. The CEO of the OCP Africa Karim Lotfi Senhadji and the CEO of ITFC Hani Salem Sonbol signed the MoU on Monday, October 21. Through the agreement, the two parties will strengthen their collaboration in various areas including training for smallholding farmers on sound agricultural practices, soil testing, and fertility management to support better yields.  The agreement will also cover innovation and digitalization tools to modernize agricultural practices, as well as capacity building and support of young farmers for sustainable and inclusive development. Sonbol commented that cooperation with OCP Africa is in line with ITFC’s mandate to support the development of strategic value chains in countries member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).  “The services provided by ITFC in the agricultural sector, both in terms of trade financing and tactical support, has expanded significantly over the past years, targeting critical areas of the value chain, from farm input to processing, pre-export, and export,” said the ITFC CEO “The sector is also one of the value chains that are ready for innovation and SME development.” Meanwhile, Senhadji stated that “the smallholder farmer is central to OCP Africa’s strategy to support the transition of farming communities from subsistence farming to modern, sustainable agri-business.” He added that “the agreement with ITFC will support efforts to train farmers on best farming practices, test soils for accurate fertilizer recommendations, facilitate access to financing, and improve access to markets”. ITFC and OCP Africa will jointly launch a new “OCP School lab” campaign in Senegal in November 2019.  OCP School Lab is an innovative program aimed at increasing smallholder farmers’ yields and incomes on strategic crops by offering a full set of agri-services. ITFC has been providing significant support to ensure food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2018, ITFC allocated $749.6 million to finance the food &amp; agriculture sector, representing 14.4% of the total trade finance portfolio, a 71% increase compared to the previous year.  Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 50% of ITFC’s food &amp; agriculture sector financing in 2018.

 Rabat – A man in his seventies died yesterday, October 21, after a tram in Casablanca hit him as he crossed the tracks, according to a press release from RATP Dev. RATP Dev is the company managing tramways in Morocco’s economic capital. The accident happened at 7:50am, on tramway line 1, between stations Hay Raja and Ibn Tachfine. The accident was inevitable, according to the same source. “Despite the use of emergency brakes, the driver could not avoid the collision with the old man who was trying to cross the rails without using the crosswalk.” Even though emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident quickly, the man succumbed to his injuries. RATP Dev also presented their condolences to the victim’s family, and recalled the importance of respecting traffic laws and road signs. Nine years after the launch of tramway systems in Morocco, many people are still unaware of the danger they put themselves in by not paying attention when they cross the rails or not letting trams have their priority. In February 2019, a cyclist died after colliding with a tram in Casablanca. In July of the same year, a man riding a bike died after getting stuck between two trams travelling  in opposite directions. The National Committee for the Prevention of Road Accidents posted a video on their Facebook page as part of a campaign to sensitize people of how dangerous crossing in front of trams can be. The video shows a number of shocking accidents on tramways, both in Rabat and Casablanca. عدم احترام أسبقية الترامواي يتسبب في حوادث فظيعة عدم احترام أسبقية الترامواي يتسبب في حوادث فظيعة مع كافة مستعملي الطريق (الراجلون، اصحاب الدراجات النارية، السيارات و حتى الشاحنات).

Rabat – Responding to the wave protests across several Lebanese cities for the fifth consecutive day, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced on Monday, October 21, a set of resolutions to put an end to tensions in the country. “We will cut the salaries of ministers and MPs by 50%,” Hariri said. He stressed that the 2020 budget does not contain any new taxes, adding that the government is working on a draft law to retrieve the looted funds El Hariri’s statements came in a televised speech aired live on all local TV stations. Protesters who had gathered in central Beirut chanted, “The people want to bring down the regime.” The government’s mismanagement of a deepening economic crisis and a new tax proposal have prompted Lebanese people to take to the streets to demand the government step down. Addressing protesters, he argued that the decision to end the protests is on their own hands. “These decisions are not for exchange. I am not going to ask you to stop protesting and stop expressing your anger. This is a decision that you take.” Hariri added that the country’s central bank and the banking sector will help reduce the deficit by about $3.4 million in 2020. The government will give $160 million as housing loans to revive the struggling construction sector and will also distribute millions of dollars to families living in poverty. Lebanese activists continued to insist on the overhaul of the political system as a response to Hariri’s statements. Earlier on Monday, the Lebanese presidency announced that the cabinet approved Hariri’s initiative to end the crisis. The cabinet met at the Presidential Palace in Baabda, Beirut. On Friday, October 18, Hariri gave his government a 72-hour deadline to come up with motivating solutions to overcome the crisis.

Rabat – As Morocco prepares to play more consequential, qualifying fixtures after a series of poor performances in friendly games, Morocco’s new coach has embarked on his first European tour to supervise Moroccan players already on his list and to discover new names to potentially reinforce his halting squad. Sources from the Moroccan team’s technical staff have been quoted as saying that Halilhodzic is particularly in search of a striker to resolve Morocco’s recurring goal scoring issues. During his European tour, the sources said, according to reports, the Moroccan coach will meet with players already featuring in his plans as well potential reinforcement, especially bi-national talents who may add more tactical depth, urgency, and scoring efficiency to the Moroccan squad. Weeks after he replaced Herve Renard as head coach of the Moroccan national football team, Halilhodzic has not particularly won over Moroccan fans and football commentators. The Atlas Lions coach has repeatedly spoken about “reconstruction” and discipline, but the results on the field—two alarm-raising draws against Burkina Faso and Libya, an unimpressive 1-0 victory against Niger, and an even more concerning 3-2 defeat against Gabon—have suggested his burden or responsibility (which is the word he prefers), is far heavier than he thought when embarking on his Moroccan adventure. In Halilhodzic’s defense, however, as he himself has markedly put it in pre and post-match conferences since he took over as Atlas Lions coach, a particularly stubborn issue with the Moroccan team is their perceived inability to score goals, to make a more effective use of their sometimes flamboyant passing style. While technical with the ball at their feet, and sometimes apparently irresistible with quick passing and ball possession, the Moroccan Lions have lacked inspiration and urgency in terms of actually scoring goals. The Lions’ story at the recently concluded CAN is a case in point. So was their participation in the 2018 World Cup. In both tournaments, Morocco impressed in ball possession and technique but struggled to translate its technical prowess into goals, leaving fans and observers with the accompanying sentiment of most disappointments: What if? Morocco will play Mauritania on November 15 as part of the CAN 2021 qualifiers. After exiting the 2019 CAN in what many Moroccan fans have described as one of the most devastating and humiliating scenes for Moroccan football, the new coach has been assigned with building a group that can win the next CAN and qualify for the 2022 World Cup. “Coaching Morocco is a big responsibility and an honor,” Halilhodzic said during a press conference immediately after he was appointed to replace Renard. He stressed his own objectives, which dovetail with those of the Moroccan football authorities, in accepting Morocco’s coaching offer. “My first objective is to qualify for the World Cup. I will try to qualify a fourth consecutive national team.” In that conference, the Moroccan coach was crystal clear about what he wanted his squad to be like. Consistency, discipline, urgency, and a sense of responsibility took the lion’s share of his proclaimed plan to succeed where a talent-soaked Moroccan group blew away the trust and admiration fans and commentators had lavished them with ahead of the recent CAN. Morocco is among the most promising footballing nations in Africa by all available evidence. The country’s national league is one of the most developed—and revered—on the continent and some of the Moroccan players in top European leagues—Ziyech and Hakimi come readily to mind; but Mbark Boussoufa and Younes Belhanda are not very far off the scale, and there are many emerging talents—are among the best in their respective positions. But since the 2004 CAN, when host Tunisia beat Morocco in the final, the Lions have mostly disappointed in major tournaments. With the persistence of the scoring issue and reports of old internal problems, it remains to be seen how Halilhodzic will implement his “reconstruction” and put forth a confident and reliable squad for CAN 2021 and the 2022 World Cup, the two explicitly cited goals in his contract with the Moroccan football federation.

Rabat – In yet another morale-boosting development for Morocco’s Western Sahara stance, the UN 4th Committee has concluded that a compromise-based solution, as put forth by both the Security Council and Morocco’s proposal, constitutes “the most viable solution” to the territorial conflict. With the upcoming UN talks on Western Sahara on the horizon, the Moroccan Autonomy Plan continues to gain widespread support in the international community. Many countries have either praised the “pragmatism” and “seriousness” of the country’s initiative or pointed out how it closely reflects the international consensus over a UN-brokered, compromise-based solution. Reiterating the growing international consensus, the majority of governments at the recent UN 4th Committee debates highlighted their support for a compromised-based, UN Security Council-moderated settlement process as laid out in the Moroccan Autonomy Plan, MAP reported earlier today. The report, summarizing the most consequential points the UN committee discussed in the past days, as well as the content of the resolution that resulted from the debates, noted that one unmistakable recurrence throughout the debates was the unanimous support over the UN-led political process. For many of the government representatives who spoke at the UN event, focusing on separatism or self determination would generate more complications in an already convoluted crisis. Not only is self-determination obsolete for the current context in Western Sahara, they argued, it stands in stark contrast with the latest developments and the series of UN recommendations and resolutions for a lasting and negotiated solution to the conflict. They highlighted that since 2007, when Morocco proposed a “serious” and “credible” Autonomy Plan, the UN has markedly moved away from self-determination and referendum to focus on “political compromise” as the most serious and feasible way out of the political quagmire in the disputed territories. The majority of petitioners on the UN committee stressed “the pertinence of the Moroccan initiative and its accord with international standards,” according to the MAP report. In their resolution, the 4th Committee referred to the different interpretations of self-determination in international law:  Independence or national sovereignty, free association with an independent state, free integration in an independent state, or “acquisition of any other political status.” They went on to show in their assessment of the best course of action for the Western Sahara dispute that Morocco’s proposal, more in line with free association with an independent state or free integration in an independent state, “represents the most modern and democracy-friendly reading of self-determination.” Western Sahara ‘not a matter of decolonization’ While separatism would further complicate the crisis, prolong the “suffering of Tindouf refugees,” and breed more instability in the region, the committee argued, Morocco’s autonomy proposal opens an avenue for “a practical solution that favors a win-win spirit whereby locals are allowed self-governance [under Moroccan sovereignty] in total respect of universal human rights and locals’ cultural and linguistic specificities.” Responding to the Morocco-friendly conclusions of the committee, Omar Hilale, the Moroccan representative at the UN, reiterated the “historical Moroccanness of Western Sahara.” In addition to the disputed territories being historically Moroccan, he asserted, Morocco’s legitimacy and sovereignty claims on the territories have become even more defensible with the 2007 Autonomy Plan. Hilale said Morocco’s proposal entails “pragmatism,” political compromise, “colossal development projects in the southern provinces” and is “the sole and unique incarnation” of the solution sought by the UN-led process. “The Western Sahara issue is not a de-colonization matter,” Ambassador Hilale said. He explained the support that Morocco’s proposal boasts from “many locals in the southern provinces” as well as the “numerous human rights violations by the Polisario in Tindouf camps.” The conclusions of the 4th committee are not binding, although they come in prelude of this month’s planned discussions at the Security Council over the UN’s next move in the conflict.  The conclusions constitute, however, opinions that the UN Security Council, the organ recognized as the only legitimate broker of the Western Sahara conflict, would take into account or not when deliberating on the next phase of the peacekeeping efforts in the territorial dispute. Meanwhile, in their assessments, both Ambassador Hilale and the concert of 4th Committee petitionists urged the Security Council to uphold its own latest resolution on the conflict and push for a realistic, pragmatic, and compromised-based sustainable solution.”

Rabat – Morocco’s 2020 finance bill will account for an increase in the kingdom’s national defense budget. The budget is set to increase by nearly 30% in 2020, from MAD 35.155 billion to MAD 45.438 billion. Staff costs will rise from MAD 22.330 billion to MAD 33.167 billion due to an increase in recruits and military conscripts in the Royal Armed Forces (FAR). In addition, FAR staff will benefit from higher wages. Equipment costs will rise from MAD 6.051 billion to MAD 7.125 billion.  Investment spending will increase from MAD 4.773 billion to MAD 5.146 billion.  Per article 40 of the 2020 finance bill, the minister delegate in charge of the Defense Administration will commit MAD 110 billion to an endowment expenditure account entitled the “Acquisition and Repair of Royal Armed Forces Equipment.” This equipment includes 24 Apache helicopters, 12 light transport helicopters, 24 tactical lift helicopters, and an electronic warplane. As Morocco prioritizes anti-aircraft defense, FAR will purchase at least one surface-to-air missile system (the American PAC-3) and a self-propelled howitzer (the American M109A6 Paladin). FAR will also acquire an infantry fighting vehicle and 25 fighter aircraft (American 25 F-16 Fighting Falcons). The acquisitions of military equipment comes as part of Morocco’s efforts to strengthen its military. Morocco aims to have a fully independent army, air force, and navy. The increased defense budget will also serve to strengthen the Royal Navy’s patrol fleet with a new frigate.  Morocco will also invest in a top-of-the-line coastal surveillance system as securing the coasts has become a key priority of the kingdom.

Rabat – Moroccan police have seized 595 kilograms of cannabis resin from a fishing boat off the Cabo Negro beach at Martil, a town near Tetouan and south of Ceuta on the Mediterranean Sea. Police made the seizure Sunday evening, October 20, while smugglers were transferring the drug from a rocky part of the Cabo Negro beach onto the boat, according to state-owned media Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) reported that police arrested three people on suspicion of attempting to smuggle the cannabis resin by sea: A 28-year-old, a 43-year-old, and a 55-year-old. The suspects are in the custody of Tetouan’s police department. The seizure was the result of collaboration between Martil security officers, the prefectural service of Tetouan’s judicial police, and the royal gendarmerie. The beach at Martil has also been the scene of multiple irregular migration attempts. In September 2018, Moroccan maritime police stopped irregular migrants from boarding a boat at Martil. Many Moroccans wishing to migrate protested that night, chanting the slogan: “The people want free harja [migration]!”

Rabat – The Sahrawi Association for the Defense of Human Rights (ASADEDH) has denounced the presence of a senior Polisario official in Spain, pointing out the war crimes and other human rights exactions associated with a number of separatist leaders. Bachir Mustapha Sayed, a senior Polisario official and brother of the co-founder of the Polisario Front, El Ouali Mustapha Sayed, recently spoke at a conference in Madrid on self-determination in Western Sahara. In a statement  in reaction to the invitation of Sayed as a conference speaker, ASADEDH expressed its “disappointment” with the move, arguing that the separatist official is one of the primary suspects in an ongoing investigation into wide-ranging human rights violations in the Tindouf camps between 1979 and 1988. At the conference, Sayed, addressing the controversial topic of human rights violations and war crimes in Western Sahara, vaguely referred to the obscure 1979-1988 years in the Tindouf camps, when a contingent of Polisario militia and a number of Algerian army officers are believed to have committed kidnappings, torture and other exactions to win the separatist front the unanimous support it sought from Tindouf refugees. Sayed preached “forgiveness,” saying that Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps should transcend their internal divisions and “wounds of war survivors” to focus on the lager goal of attaining self-determination. “We have all made sacrifices,” he said. In its statement, however, ASADEDH was categorical. The group suggested Sayed be prosecuted for his association with one of the darkest episodes of the Western Sahara conflict rather than be given a platform as a panelist. “We denounce the presence in the capital of Spain, Madrid, of Bachir Mustafa Sayed, one of the main accused or investigated by the Spanish National Court in the serious violations of human rights, such as kidnapping, torture, murder, etc. committed in the Sahrawi between 1974 and 1988,” said ASSADEDH’s statement. At a moment when the Western Sahara question is gathering steam in the international community—the UN Security Council will discuss the topic at the end of this month, and there is hope for a compromise-based solution to the conflict—the condemnatory statement is yet another blow to the separatist front’s claim of being the sole legitimate representative of Sahrawi interests. Even in Spain, where the Polisario Front has the backing of a number of—mostly leftist—civil society organizations, human rights violations and war crimes have traditionally stained the front’s rehearsed claims of Moroccan “occupation” and “human rights violations” in Western Sahara. In recent years, in addition to increasingly emerging accusations of embezzlement and mismanagement of the humanitarian aid to Tindouf refugees, the 1979-1988 exactions have constituted the most serious blow to pro-Polisario support in Spain. In 2012, the Spanish National Court opened an investigation  into the 1979-1988 events to shed light into the allegations hovering over a number of Polisario officers and Algerian military commanders said to have committed “genocide” in the Tindouf camps to wipe out “Sahrawi elites of Spanish origin” who might have opposed the separatist front’s agenda for Western Sahara. The investigation was launched after ASADEDH filed a complaint with the Spanish court. In the complaint, ASADEDH provided the testimonies of three victims of the events, pointing out that “the leadership of the Polisario Front has been the subject of numerous accusations of torture over Sahrawi populations for years.” Most critical, perhaps, the complaint added that the “genocide” was carried out in for the Polisario to “eliminate” dissenting Sahrawi elites and preempt a potential opposition to its legitimacy claims. The separatist front sought to “obtain a more direct and effective domain on the entire Sahrawi population… in their camps,” according to the complaint.

Rabat – Moroccan international football player Amine Harit is attracting serious attention from scouts of the Spanish club FC Barcelona, according to the Spanish edition of Sport magazine. According to the news outlet, an FC Barcelona scout, Ramos Planes, attended Harit’s latest game, yesterday, October 20. Harit’s team Schalke 04 played against Hoffenheim in the German football league Bundesliga. “Harit is a unique football player, he became an essential member of his team,” said Planes following the game. The Spanish club is aiming to preempt upcoming retirements within its squad by recruiting young talented players. The 22-year-old Moroccan player would be a strong option. Harit sparked FC Barcelona’s interest with his remarkable performances since the start of the season. The attacking midfielder has scored four goals and made two assists so far in the Bundesliga. The athlete’s outstanding performances earned him Bundesliga’s September Player of the Month award. Harit was born in France and played for a number of small French clubs, before his move to Germany’s Schalke 04 in July 2017. The current season is his best so far. While Harit’s contract with the German club lasts until 2021, a transfer to a bigger club before the contract’s end date is not unexpected.

Rabat – Football players are much more likely to get dementia and five times more likely to get Alzheimer’s disease than the general population, according to a study released Monday, October 21, by Glasgow University. The lead researcher in the study, neuropathologist William Stewart, said, “Risk ranged from a five-fold increase in Alzheimer’s disease, through an approximately four-fold increase in motor neurone disease, to a two-fold Parkinson’s disease in former professional footballers compared to population controls,” according to a BBC Sport report. The Glasgow study, called “Football’s Influence on Lifelong Health and Dementia Risk” (FIELD), looked at 7,676 professional football players active between 1900 and 1976 in comparison to 23,000 other people. Earlier this year, Don Williams, who has researched the connection between dementia and playing football for decades, called on sports authorities to ban heading in football for children and “curtailing this component of the game among adults.” Stewart emphasized that “every effort must be made to identify the factors contributing to the increased risk of neurodegenerative disease to allow this risk to be reduced,” the BBC noted. The researcher went on to say that “there are also wider potential health benefits of playing football to be considered.”  The FIELD study found that football players had a lower risk of dying from other diseases that plague the general population, including heart disease and some cancers. England’s Football Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association funded the study. In response to the study’s results, the Football Association relayed the findings of an independently chaired Medical and Football Advisory Group. The group found “there is not enough evidence at this stage to make other changes to the way the modern-day game is played.” The Football Association noted that former football players live on average more than three years longer than the general population. In 2017, a Drake Foundation study of the brains of 14 former football players found that the average age of onset of dementia was before the player’s 64th birthday. Twelve of the study’s subjects showed signs of “behavioral changes,” and 10 displayed increased aggression and “explosivity.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI sent a message to attendees at the second International Justice Conference, held under the theme “Justice and Investment, Challenges and Stakes.” The two-day conference opened its doors today, October 21, in Marrakech. Morocco’s Minister of State for Human Rights and Relations with the Parliament, Mustapha Ramid, relayed the King’s message at the opening ceremony of the event. The royal message focused on the importance of using modern technology to develop paperless legal processes as part of Morocco’s vision to develop its business environment. King Mohammed VI began his message by welcoming the international participants to Morocco for the conference, and emphasizing the importance of such events. “The conference offers this distinguished international gathering an opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences and to launch further partnerships in order to develop the justice system, enhance its standing and increase its efficiency and effectiveness.” The King went on to underline the efforts and achievements made by Morocco in the field of justice, with a clear focus on businesses and investments. “On many occasions, I have emphasized the need to develop a strategic vision for the improvement of the business environment,” the King recalled. “A core element of that vision should be the creation of conditions conducive to investment and the adoption of a modern, integrated legal system that makes businesses a driving force of economic and social development.” King Mohammed VI stressed “the need to simplify investment procedures, update business support programs, facilitate businesses’ access to finance, increase their productivity, and train their human resources.” The monarch then drew attention to Morocco’s progress in the Doing Business Index 2019. King Mohammed announced that Morocco aims to join the ranks of the top 50 countries worldwide in terms of the quality of business environment. King Mohammed VI cited the Moroccan commercial courts as an example of Morocco’s efforts to provide a high quality business environment, where investors’ rights are protected through the justice system. Using modern technology Finally, the King emphasized the importance of a digital transition in the judiciary field. “In the same vein, we should make the most of the means afforded by modern technology for the dissemination of legal and judicial information. We should also promote the paperless processing of legal procedures and judicial regulations and adopt online justice methods,” King Mohammed said. He added that online justice methods and paperless processing are “an effective means which contribute to swift and efficient judicial services and meet requirements for the settlement of business and financial disputes. These goals should be provided for in the law, and all the stakeholders in the justice system should get involved in the sector’s digital transition.” At the end of his message, King Mohammed VI thanked all the participants at the conference, hoping that their work will inform decision-makers and inspire researchers in the justice field. Marrakech International Justice Conference is an annual event, bringing together ministers, judges, legal experts, economists, politicians, and figures from finance, business, and academia. Around 800 participants from 83 different countries are taking part in this year’s conference.

Rabat – Police at the Marrakech airport have arrested a 22-year-old Brazilian in possession of 600 grams of cocaine, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN).  After performing an ultrasound on the suspect, police found capsules of cocaine in the Brazilian’s intestines, Maghreb Arab Press reported. The suspect had also hidden cocaine in his athletic shoes. Authorities took the man to a hospital for medical personnel to remove the cocaine capsules. The public prosecutor’s office has also opened an investigation into the suspect. The Brazilian arrived on a TAP Air Portugal flight from Lisbon. Moroccan police have arrested multiple Brazilians already in 2019 on suspicion of smuggling cocaine into Morocco. In August, Moroccan security services seized three tons of cocaine packages on a beach near Casablanca. Police have also seized cocaine at the Tangier Med-Port, from a helicopter crash, and at other Moroccan airports.

Essaouira – When we are ignorant about another culture, we search for stereotypes to fill the gaps, and, increasingly, turn to fear and hatred. The anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-difference rhetoric that currently presides over Western politics like a heavy cloud of populism and nationalism uses stereotypes to promote fear. It is a powerful force. But there is another way. In any given situation, as humans, we make presumptions about each other; we draw our own conclusions; and we like to categorize people. This makes us feel comfortable. As a foreigner living in Morocco, I feel myself being categorized and reduced to stereotypes on a day to day basis.  When waiters presume that because I am English, I must, like 75% of British people be unable to speak a language other than English, I smile. When they stubbornly reply to my fluent French in broken English, I am so accustomed to it that I am no longer annoyed.  When my brother-in-law still, after three years, presumes that because I am English I am totally ignorant of Moroccan culture, I no longer react. Every year, he kindly explains to me what Eid is or that we eat couscous on Fridays, despite having spent countless Fridays and religious holidays with me. While this is still quite trying, I have understood that it is out of kindness. He wants to make me feel included and to communicate with me about something he understands.  When my husband’s friends, male and female, make it clear that, because I am educated and European, it is very unlikely that I know how to cook, it no longer bothers me. When they explain to me at great length how to boil an egg or thank my Moroccan husband for preparing the meal that I have lovingly prepared, I manage a smile. Why? Because it is all kindly meant. What would I achieve by fighting against harmless stereotypes that actually make me seem more accessible in the eyes of people I very much want to like me?  My husband, too, has to put up with this type of stereotyping. He ignores the presumptions of some of my friends and neighbors that he eats only couscous and lives in a desert amongst camels and nomads.  Despite being Amazigh (Berber), he happily allows our son’s English doctor or acquaintances to ignore his ethnicity and chat to him about Arab culture. Because these stereotypes are kindly meant and used as a way to understand and embrace difference.  This said, stereotypes can be extremely dangerous and can be responsible for further dehumanization of “the other.”  “Does your husband make you stay inside and tell you what to do? I heard that’s what Arab men do when they get married.” This question came from Mariela, a 33-year-old Italian woman who works teaching children. “Aren’t you afraid of terrorism?” This question came from a 28-year-old accountant. “Don’t you have to wear a burqa?” My 35-year-old hairdresser wondered about Moroccan dress.  “Mixed marriages never work; he’ll become controlling and more extreme,” a 65-year-old retired French army officer commented at my wedding.  I could very easily list more of these comments and questions, utterances which reflect the deep, insidious nature of stereotypes. This kind of stereotype is what populist politicians and fear-mongers exploit to strike fear in the hearts of their voters. This kind of stereotype leads to hate, violence, and, in the world’s all too recent history, war.  It is a two way street; Moroccans are just as capable of this type of alarmist stereotyping. “You have no culture in the West and no religion. It’s all sex and alcohol,” a 35-year-old lawyer from Casablanca told me told me. “These European women just want sex, the way they dress is asking for it,” a 20-year-old mother of two commented on European culture.  “There are no morals where you come from,” This  comment came from a 50-year-old doctor from Marrakech. These comments from Moroccans are just as insidious, just as hateful and born, as are those of their European counterparts, from ignorance and fear. These thoughts and fears are fed to us everyday in the media, in newspapers, in Hollywood films, on Instagram, and by our politicians.  So where does this leave us? If everything we see on television, on the internet, and in newspapers is urging us to draw these negative conclusions what choice do we have but to fall in line and repeat these tropes of hatred and division? Perusing Instagram last week I found the answer. We must Strike for Kindness. Ben Fogle, a British television producer and UN patron of the Wilderness, has launched a hashtag campaign to encourage people to ignore the narrative of extreme rhetoric and hate and to embrace our humanity and kindness.  “Kindness matters. The world has become so fractured and torn. Everything is so polarised,” Fogle said on his Instagram account. “We need to disrupt the status quo of anger.” Every Monday, Fogle “Strikes for Kindness” in remote locations around the UK, and here in Morocco, it is time for us to join him. I am not suggesting that we should all be standing in forests wielding #strikeforkindness placards, but rather that in our daily lives we should be choosing to reject insidious stereotypes and trying to see the humanity in one another. Not all stereotypes are negative. Things and people we do not know can be frightening, and knowing something, even a cliche, about them helps us to relate to them and feel comfortable.  So, if you know nothing about Morocco, here are some “kind stereotypes” to cling on to: Moroccans are generous and friendly; the Atlas mountains and the Sahara desert are beautiful places to explore; Moroccans drink sugary mint tea with delicious almond cakes; they eat tagines; and they welcome strangers. Similarly, British people carry umbrellas because it rains all the time, are endlessly polite, like to queue, and love the Queen! By rejecting the stereotypes that divide us, actively choosing not to believe them but, rather, choosing to find the humanity and kindness in each other—strangers, foreigners, friends, and family alike—we can start to break the cycle of hatred and fear propagated by those in whose best interests it is for us to be divided.

Rabat – Morocco’s Marrakech International Film Festival (FIFM) is fast becoming a platform to attract stars from across the globe, according to US-based news outlet the Hollywood Reporter. The Moroccan festival has a “history of attracting A-list talent, featuring such actors as Jeremy Irons, Bill Murray, Viggo Mortensen and Robert De Niro,” reports the celebrity news outlet.  The 18th annual FIFM will kick off on November 26 in Marrakech and will run until December 7, with Scottish producer Tilda Swinton chairing the jury committee. Swinton said that her involvement in the festival is an “honor.” She added that the “state of cinema knows no boundary and the prospect of joining with my comrades from around our planet to discover and celebrate work from all her continents as a privilege and joy for which I am sincerely grateful and to which I look forward immensely.” Swinton has appeared in more than 70 feature films. She has also produced and co-produced feature films and documentaries since 2005. The magazine recalled that the Oscar-winner follows James Gray, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Milos Forman as president of the Marrakech International Film Festival. Gray led last year’s jury, which included Dakota Johnson and Palme d’Or winner Laurent Cantet.

Rabat – It was only after the Zionists “made the desert bloom” that “[the Palestinians] became interested in taking it from us.” Former Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol coined Israel’s “blooming desert” narrative in a 1969 speech.  In the 60 years that have passed, Israel has put significant efforts into greening a land that faces water insecurity and encompasses a vast desert. Green spaces like East Jerusalem’s Peace Forest now abound within an agenda to promote environmental integrity.  The Arava Valley, which borders the Dead Sea, is one of the driest areas in the world. Now, about 60% of Israel’s vegetable exports come from the valley’s naturally infertile soil, even as salinity increases.  The valley’s agricultural projects can attribute success to a blend of ancient practices and modern innovation. The Arava International Center for Agriculture Training (AICAT) works with its students, who are mostly from Africa and Asia, on fresh research and development to green inhospitable lands.  AICAT resource development director Noa Zer explained, “If you don’t doubt, you don’t innovate.”  Israeli’s agenda to green its lands is not propaganda, it is real. But so is its environmental destruction strategy in neighboring Palestine.  Israel’s aggressive colonialism has decimated Palestine’s natural environment. Palestine’s water, soil, and air pollution have reached lethal levels. The UN Development Programme labeled Israeli occupation as an official risk factor in Palestine’s environmental risk assessment. Israeli attacks on water desalination plants leave Palestinians, especially in Gaza, facing dangerous water threats. Diarrheal diseases approach epidemic levels. Cases of water-borne salmonella and typhoid are on the rise. Today, water pollution is the number one cause of child mortality in Gaza. An environmental assault on Occupied Palestine might seem a strategic move to rework territorial integrity. At the same time, environmental degradation does not discriminate based on borders.  A recent report from EcoPeace Middle East, a cooperative NGO run between Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian scientists, warned of cross-border contamination: “Collapsing water, sewage and electricity infrastructure in the Gaza Strip pose a material danger to Israel’s groundwater, seawater, beaches, and desalination plants.”  The World Health Organization predicts that none of Gaza’s groundwater will be fit for human consumption by 2020. An ongoing assault on Palestine’s water management is on course to infiltrate the self-proclaimed “green desert” nation of Israel. While cross-border organizations like EcoPeace Middle East are working toward multilateral solutions, Palestinians innovate to survive. Engineering minds whir in motion against stark environmental realities. GreenCake is quite similar to a cement brick—just remove most of the cement. GreenCake CEO Majd Mashharawi began the company in 2015, the year of her graduation from Gaza’s Islamic University. The brick she designed is made mostly from ash and is almost as durable as cement. With import restrictions in Gaza, building or rebuilding any structure is difficult.  GreenCake provides a construction option that locally sources materials, reuses waste, employs community members, and puts women in leadership positions. The company has sold over 50,000 blocks to date. Mashharawi is also the 25-year-old CEO of SunBox, her second major innovation. The company distributes small-scale solar kits designed by the young civil engineer. The solar panel, battery, and generator are affordable, easy to install at home, and provide enough energy for daily basic household needs. It is nowhere near a comprehensive fix, but it is a start, and it does not rely on a vulnerable main grid. The project is needed in Gaza, where occupation destroyed the strip’s only electricity plant in 2006. Without electricity, Gaza cannot consistently operate hospitals and desalination plants, and homes receive little grid power. SunBox now provides electricity to households and businesses, serving almost 1,000 people. And it is about to get bigger. SunBox recently received a major grant from Action Against Hunger to install solar power systems on 10 desalination plants around Gaza Strip. The grant is a major boon for the community and not just in terms of electrical power, also in terms of people power.  Mashharawi is a big believer in employment to counter extremism and hopelessness. “If those young people had dreams, they wouldn’t throw themselves at the border where you could lose your head, lose your leg or lose your arm,” she explained. She hopes startups like hers can empower local women and help give purpose to a frustrated, unemployed population. Mashharawi’s hopes echo a point of pride for Hanni Arnon, director at AICAT across the Israeli/Palestinian border. Arnon emphasized that AICAT does more than teach students about agriculture, that students see “women in roles of leadership, as heads of businesses, making decisions. They learn more about the importance of education.” Their states are deadlocked in conflict over a common ground, but Mashharawi and Arnon, innovators with big dreams, demonstrate a common ideological ground. Harsh natural realities may provide some fertile grounds for cooperation.

Rabat – In the eighth month of what has come to be known as the Algerian Hirak, thousands took to the streets in Algiers on Friday to demand the departure of the army chief, General Gaid Salah, as well as key civilian figures of the transition, according to local reports. “Huge crowds of Algerians demonstrated against the political establishment in the capital on the 35th Friday and renewed demands to end the General’s rule,” one local paper reported. Despite some reports of fatigue or loss of revolutionary fervor over the weeks, Algerians have continued to take to the streets every Friday to ask for the “radical changes” and reforms for which they have been demonstrating since late February. Last Friday, the streets of the Algerian capital were less crowded than during the previous Friday, when masses of demonstrators went out to oppose the planned revision of the country’s hydrocarbon law, arguing that both the current government and parliament lack the legitimacy to pass consequential bills. But the demands and the fervor remained the same. In chants and anti-establishment slogans, the crowd asked for the departure of an “illegitimate” government and parliament. With General Salah’s status as the most powerful survivor of the Bouteflika era and the de facto leader of the transition, protesters have made abundantly clear—and they reiterated that stance on Friday—that they want the general and his entourage gone. But General Salah has been trying to distance himself from the Bouteflika regime. In addition to the recent arrests of some key figures of the Bouteflika presidency, a move some have called a legitimacy-seeking with hunt, General Salah has maintained that some groups supportive of the former president plan to fuel the protests. He said the groups want to confront the military and force it into responding by violent repression. In response to calls for his resignation in the 34th week of the protests, General Salah also argued that some Bouteflika loyalists are paying some groups “to participate in the protests and attack the military.” Meanwhile, the General and Autonomous Workers’ Confederation in Algeria (CGATA), a principal instigator of the demonstrations, is calling for vigilance to “maintain the peaceful nature of the movements, renounce violence in all its forms, work to strengthen the cohesion among Algerians, maintain national unity and reject any foreign intervention.” The group is however rejecting the government’s call for elections to be held on December 12. The government’s schedule for the general elections is largely seen as a plot to support the presidency of a figurehead who would work to maintain the current political establishment in power. As a result, CGATA is asking for the departure of the current government “as a condition” for fair and transparent elections.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Education and Vocational Training Said Amzazi inaugurated on Sunday, October 20 the construction work for a multidisciplinary university in Taounate in northern Morocco. Taounate is a town located 284.6 kilometers away from the city of Fez. The university will be built in an area of more than 54 hectares. The two-year project will cost MAD 100 million. The project is in line with the ministry’s strategy to bring university services closer to students in the region, whose number exceeds 11,600. The university will house four amphitheaters with a capacity of 1,400 seats, 14 classrooms, 10 multimedia rooms, a conference room, a liverary and two sports platforms. Amzazi told MAghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the new university will house 5,000 students. “The purpose of establishing this institution is to facilitate access to the higher education system and scientific research in the province,” the minister said. Morocco witnessed a wave of protests in the region in  2016-2017. Commonly known as the Hirak Rif movement, the popular uprise came about as citizens in the Rif region and northern Morocco condemned the lack of universities and hospital to meet their basic rights. In response, Morocco’s government vowed to satisfy citizen’s needs by launching projects in order to meet the population’s demands. Despite the series of government  projects in response to popular demands, governor of the Bank Al Maghrib (BAM) Abdellatif Jouahri said in July that the major projects achieved in 2018 failed to meet social expectations. Jouahri also recalled statistics of the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP), emphasizing that unemployment fell to 9.8% in 2018. Despite the slight changes in employment rate, unemployment among youth aged 15 to 24 remains high, especially in urban areas. HCP said in a report that unemployment hovers around 40% in some urban areas.

Rabat – Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Bank al-Maghrib is adding a new award to his repertoire for his efficient governance at the Moroccan central bank. The Global Finance magazine in New York named Jouahri as one of the top ten central bank governors in the world. Jouahri won the award in Washington on Saturday, October 19 for the third consecutive year. The Moroccan top banker has earned several similar accolades for his achievements for the Moroccan economy. In October 2018, Jouahri received a trophy with an “A grade,” which is the highest distinction awarded by Central Banker Report Cards, an annual assessment of Central Bank governors  by Global Finance. At the Washington event on Saturday, Jouahri won a second prize, the best Central Bank governor in 2018 for the Middle East and North Africa, awarded by Global Markets newspaper. The Global Finance magazine also named Jouahri best central bank governor in 2017 and 2018. Jouahri became the governor of Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al Maghrib, in  2003. Founded in 1987, Global Finance launched its annual Central Banker Report Cards in 1994. The annual ranking, which evaluates the performance of governors from nearly 83 countries, is based on a scale from “A” to “F”. Jouahri got an “A” this year.

Rabat – With President Macron’s ambitious plan to sink millions of Euros into making French the third most spoken language in the world. Given the expected quadrupling of the African, Francophone population before the turn of the next century on account of a decreasing mortality rate, in many ways one could say: For better or worse,French is here to stay. As Paris was caught in the morning fog, with bakers and window cleaners welcoming the day, my father and I made our way to the Notre-Dame to attend the early mass on Sunday. Though a sixteen-year-old in the heavily secularized West, I found myself rather dumb-founded to stumble upon a practically empty nave as my father and I took up our seats in a rear pew. As the priest opened the sermon in French, a thin and invisible veil lowered between myself and the rest of the congregation, as usually happened whenever I found myself in exclusively French-speaking company. It did not matter. Even as a stoic atheist back then, I could do little else but sit there with an open mouth and gaze in awe of the seemingly never-ending ceiling of the church.  Masons of Paris “Can you imagine how the average Parisian needed little convincing of the existence of God, upon leaving their wretched cottages and entering the cathedral for the first time back then? Only by divine inspiration could the masons of Paris have constructed a ceiling so high, it reached the heavens,” my father whispered to me while keeping one eye on the priest to make sure he did not disturb the sermon. Before I could ask him about some of the stained-glass windows, the priest beckoned everyone to stand up for the ‘Sign of Peace’. While my father turned to his left to shake hands with a French couple, I found myself not within reach of anyone  who’s hand I was supposed to shake. But then I caught the eye of a little old lady who sat in the front row. It was only later that I realized she must have seen me looking around rather feverishly, when she decided to walk up all the creaking steps. The closer she got to me, the more petrified I became. And, before I realized I should have done the decent thing and walked down to her, she stood in front of me.  Instinctively my right hand somehow managed to reach out to hers. And as our hands clasped together, she took her left hand and placed it on the back of my right hand, all the while looking into my eyes. The veil was lifted.   Shed a tear Some of my more evangelical friends back then tried to convince me it was the moment where God tried to talk to me. “You genuinely don’t consider the idea that God was working through her? As you say, you even felt tears welling up when you left the church Wouter. You can’t deny your experience may have been part of something larger than yourself.” However, I had no intention of disowning the truth of my experience and was not suddenly convinced in the existence of an omnipotent God looking out for me. To quote the late, bare-knuckle, unapologetic atheist Christopher Hitchens: “What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.” The profound experience of ten years ago may not have turned me into a true believer, it did however leave me convinced in another way: Before I turn 30, I decided, I will be able to speak French properly. At the same time, I cannot help but feel a strange mix guilty and grateful, since learning French in post-colonial Africa is not without implications.  Post-colonial Africa Acclaimed Congolese-French writer Alain Mabanckou published an open letter in response to President Macron’s plan, stating “it is one of the last instruments that allows France to say it can still dominate the world, and have a hold over its former colonies.” When looking at the history of the African continent, it is not difficult to understand Mabanckou’s point of view. Yet, renowned Moroccan-French author Leila Slimani as the personal representative of President Macron on francophone affairs, assured audiences in an interview prior to Macon’s unveiling France did not harbor an elitist, linguistic view and regarded itself as “one of the francophone countries.” Nevertheless, speaking French in Africa remains a hot potato. Earlier this year Said Amzazi as Minister of Education faced a severe backlash, for proposing to replace Arabic with French as the instructional language for scientific subjects in Moroccan schools. Amzazi points to the Moroccan labor market, where only a limited group of students can attain prestigious, well-paid jobs offered by French companies.  As a result of decades of Arabization, students are taught in Arabic throughout high school, leaving them poorly prepared for scientific courses in university where French is the instructional language. According to Amzazi, this linguistic gap results in an ingrained insecurity among Moroccan students who cannot communicate in French, as opposed to bilingual students who can move up the Moroccan social ladder.  Despite Amzaiz’s zeal, trenchant criticism was levied against him. The proposal was regarded as elitist and harmful to the honor and pride of Moroccans, in particular by Abdelilah Benkirane as former chairman of the Justice and Development Party.   In Ghana, under President Nana Akufo-Addo, the government is preparing to step up and embrace French in the classrooms as well. In a world where 700 million people are projected to speak French before 2050 (80% of which are Africans), Akufo-Addo held a speech in French at a Francophone summit in 2018, announcing plans to make French a mandatory subject for all high school students.  But in Ghana, criticism is being mobilized against the top-down dominance of French too. Over 50 indigineous languages are spoken in Ghana, and critics fear for the longevity of these long-cherished, linguistic traditions. Akufo-Addo wanted to reassure the Ghanese people at the summit by stating, “our goal is to live, one day in a bilingual Ghana, that is English and French, together with our indigenous languages.” For better or worse The added value of French is in many ways apparent, as it opens more company doors both in Africa and abroad, flattens language barriers between people from Africa, Europe, and the Americas and opens up a world of ideas, politics, literature and cinema from Francophone countries.  Animated conversations with taxi drivers, being able to speak with tourists visiting Morocco from Tunisia, Congo and Canada, sceptically listening to a group of middle-aged men who are not convinced sub-Saharan migrants work to earn their keep; these are all moments I could not have experienced it without learning French in Morocco.  Nevertheless, as someone from l’occident, I think it is crucial to understand the legacy of the French language within Africa. Intellectual Frantz Fanon dedicated the better part of his career combatting the devastating effects of the ingrained inferiority complex in Francophone countries. The very least one can do is recognize this colonial legacy.   Whether French will be spoken a hundred years from now I do not know. But for now, I would say: For better or worse, French is here to stay.

Rabat – The governor of Morocco’s Bank al-Maghrib (central bank), Abdellatif Jouahri, has announced that the North African country will resume flexible foreign exchange regime. Morocco first introduced a floating exchange rate in January of 2018, increasing the rate from 0.03% to 2.5%. The country however took a break in 2019 for “itrs 2018 push for a more flexible exchange rate due to an economic slowdown, Bloomberg reported. Jouahri said that now is the right time to resume the flexible foreign exchange regime to “face external shocks.” “For us, the reform aims to absorb external shocks and boost Morocco’s competitiveness,” the BAM governor said. He said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) considers this time is “opportune”  to go back to the reforms. “The timing is the question and should be well chosen,” he added. Jouahri noted that the central bank will “distance” the country’s currency from the trading basket and give the market room to fix the dirham’s rates.” He added that supply and demand will determine the dirham’s value. In July the IMF  urged Morocco to expand its exchange rate flexibility by again increasing the float of the MAD. The IMF’s Executive Directors said in a report, “They welcomed the beginning of the transition to greater exchange rate flexibility last year which will help the economy absorb potential external shocks and remain competitive. They encouraged the authorities to use the current window of opportunity to continue this reform in a carefully sequenced and well-communicated manner.” With heavy external debts, Morocco’s economy was overwhelmed and unable to meet citizens’ growing demands, Jouahri emphasized in his annual report on the Moroccan economy, which he read in a meeting with King Mohammed VI on July 29.   During the meeting, Jouahri presented the central bank’s annual report on the economic situation for the 2018 financial year. The report stressed the need for a new economic model,  pointing out that Morocco’s economic performance in 2018 failed to meet the “growing social expectations.”

Rabat – The European Union (EU) and the United Nations Regional Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) for the Middle East and North Africa launched in Rabat a project to dismantle cross-border criminal networks involved in human trafficking and migrant smuggling in North Africa. Launched in Rabat on Friday, October 18, the joint EU-UNODC initiative is set to operate with a budget of €5 million.  The project seeks to support Morocco and other North African nations in dismantling irregular migration networks active in the region. The plan entails capacity building and specialized training for authorities in charge of the detection and interception of smuggling and human trafficking neworks, according to Maghreb Arab Press. The project also seeks to assist security services to have the ability to identify and investigate such cases, while protecting the victims. The project will span three years, with the primary  aim of developing the skills of law enforcement officials and the methods they employ to catch suspects involved in criminal networks. Commenting on the launch of the project in Rabat, EU ambassador to Morocco, Claudia Wiedey, said that Morocco has a “legislative framework meant to give it the means to prevent and punish crimes of human trafficking.” She also acknowledged Morocco’s “important achievements in the areas of strengthening domestic security.” UNODC representative for the MENA region, Christina Albertin,  emphasized the importance for Morocco to host the first phase of the project.  She also recalled the “long-term partnership linking Morocco to this institution and which has already involved several areas, such as the fight against terrorism, organized crime and money laundering.” The launch of the project comes just a day after an internal report from the European Commission extolled Morocco’s efforts to fight irregular migration. The report, cited by El Pais, emphasized that  the reduction of migrants’ arrivals in Spain is due to Morocco’s ongoing efforts to stop would-be migrants from taking sea routes to Spain from its coastline. El Pais said that Morocco managed to cut irregular migration in Spain by half this year.

Rabat – Harissa is a hot paste from North Africa which is often used in Moroccan cuisine. The spicy, tangy flavor adds a little something extra to any dish. Tagines, pasta, couscous, or simply freshly baked bread, all work deliciously with a little spoonful of harissa.  The principal ingredient in harissa is red chili peppers, but the rest of the recipe varies from region to region and from family to family. Some regions, for example, make green harissa and add herbs and flavorings to alter the traditional red paste.  Harissa is available in Moroccan stores and at olive markets or stalls, but they may contain preservatives. You can make your own at home with this easy recipe. Today I’m going to share with you how to make red chili harissa, a staple for any kitchen. 500 grams of red chili peppers, seeded and cut into pieces 4 medium red bell peppers, roasted, seeded, and cut into pieces 2 cloves of garlic 1 preserved lemon, seeded 1 teaspoon of ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of ground cumin 1 teaspoon of paprika ½ cup of olive oil Throw chili peppers, roasted bell peppers, garlic, and pickled lemon into a food processor and blend to make a smooth paste. In a skillet heat the olive oil on medium heat, add the paste from your processor, salt, coriander seeds, cumin, and paprika. Stir well, then cook the harissa for 10 to 15 minutes while stirring from time to time. Keep the harissa sauce in a clean and airtight glass container, put some olive oil on the top and keep it in the refrigerator for up to a month.  Now you’re ready to taste the aromatic spicy sauce.

Seffa Madfouna is a couscous or vermicelli dish; it is elaborate and celebratory. It can be prepared with chicken, lamb, or beef served hidden in a dome of steamed vermicelli “shaariya.” Today we’re going to make the unique meal using chicken and vermicelli. The vermicelli is sweetened with raisins, butter, and powdered sugar and then decorated with peeled and fried almonds, cinnamon, and additional powdered sugar. Some people choose to decorate with granulated sugar and cinnamon and serve without the chicken as a dessert at ceremonies or big events. In our home this dish is not reserved just for guests. Seffa madfouna is a favorite family dinner, often requested by my children and husband. I always cook it with chicken and vegetables for that comforting, sweet and savory taste.  So, let’s get started. Here’s what you’ll need: 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces 2 big onions, chopped 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley ¼ cup of olive oil 1 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of ginger ½ teaspoon of black pepper A large pinch of saffron ½ teaspoon of turmeric 1 teaspoon of smen (ghee) 3 cloves of garlic, minced 2 tablespoons of honey 1 kilogram of vermicelli noodles 200 grams of raisins soaked in water and drained 3 tablespoons of oil 2 tablespoons of butter 2 liters of water 100 grams of almonds, grilled and roughly ground Some ground cinnamon Icing sugar Add 2 liters of water to a couscous pot and place it on the stove at medium heat. Put some oil on the vermicelli before placing in the steamer above. Place the steamer on the couscous pot; once you see steam rise from the vermicelli, steam for 15 minutes. Remove the steamer and put the vermicelli on a plate. Add 1 cup of salty water and rub with hands to remove any knots from the vermicelli. Put the vermicelli back into the steamer and steam again. Steam the vermicelli 3 or 4 times; each time it should steam for 15 minutes. Add soaked raisins to steam with vermicelli for the final 15 minutes. Wash the chicken pieces and place in a pot with the onion and oil, then simmer on medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time. Add the cilantro and spices and cover with water. Cover the pot and cook for 40 minutes. When the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot, then add honey, and let the sauce simmer until it is thick. Remove the bones from chicken, then return it into the pot and stir well. Put seffa in a large bowl, add butter and some sugar and mix until butter is melted. Now spoon half of the vermicelli onto your serving plate before covering it with sauce and some of the chicken. Bury the chicken with the rest of the seffa and chicken sauce. Now it’s time to decorate the steaming mound of seffa with ground almonds, cinnamon, and icing sugar. Place the platter on the table and enjoy this delicious meal with family or friends. Servings: 8.

Rabat – One year ago, “Young 3arouss” (young bride) advertisements appeared on Lebanese Facebook and Instagram accounts. The posts, displaying stock photos of young girls, offered contact information to arrange marriage transactions for the minors.  An initial Lebanese outcry was loud and angry. Then, the Lebanese Women Democratic Gathering (RDFL) revealed that they had designed the fake posts to raise awareness for a real problem. The activist group not only sparked awareness about child marriage, they also lured customers. Men called the numbers making offers and talking themselves up as potential husbands. The group later published some of these calls online.  “What was scary, is how many men called to inquire about this, and giving the operator a sort of ‘CV’ that they had a house, enough money and come from a ‘good family’ to try and convince the operator to set them up with an underage girl to marry,” wrote one Lebanese blogger. The campaign, which aims to raise the country’s minimum marriage age to 18, won a Silver Lion for public relations at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in late June.  Most Lebanese say they are against child marriage, but Lebanon has no minimum legal age for marriage. Instead, it relies on religious courts to set the age, which in some cases can be younger than 15. While 6% of women in Lebanon were married as children, a relatively low rate for the MENA region, recent stories of successful and attempted suicides have invigorated a national campaign to protect girls.  The growing campaign also relates to the skyrocketing trend of child marriages in Lebanon’s Syrian refugee communities. “They are marrying early because of al Sutra. We have war. Many women are afraid of being raped, and if a married woman is raped, she is more likely to be forgiven by her husband but if an unmarried woman is raped, it will destroy her life,” one mother in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, where most of the country’s Syrian refugees have settled, told researchers. When used to talk about marriage, al sutra (covering) means protecting a woman or girl’s honor. Syrian communities living in Lebanon use this concept to preserve what they feel needs protection, by means of marriage. Lebanon hosts the largest per capita population of Syrian refugees in the world. One million people comprise more than one fifth of the country’s population. According to a 2016 study, 39% of women and girls in these communities were child brides. Most refugees in Lebanon live in informal tented camps or within more established refugee communities. (Lebanon also hosts an estimated 170,000 to 270,000 Palestinian refugees.) Living conditions in the camps are often squalid and dangerous. Family dynamics shift in these settings.  Heightened community violence toward women and girls means that more girls stay home during the day. Syrian teens reported feeling unsafe walking long distances to collect fuel and water, often citing rape as a concern.  Protection and poverty are referenced as two major child marriage drivers in this population. Men and women in these refugee communities see the issue differently, according to a report by NGO Girls Not Brides. Women from the study believed it came from heightened insecurity, while men felt it came from poverty.  A daughter’s marriage can bring the family a bride price, and remove her perceived costs to the family. One data collector, living in a camp, lamented her choice to marry off her 15-year-old daughter: “I am convinced that no girl should get married before the age of 18. But when it comes to reality, it is different.” The girl’s husband was able to support his young wife financially and to help support her family. Al sutra also comes into play against modern Lebanon’s perceived liberal values. Suspicious of exposure to Lebanon’s less conservative society, refugee parents may “marry them off, thus shielding their morality,” explained another refugee mother in the Marj area. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is home to roughly 40 million child brides. Given a steady decline over the past 25 years, now one in every five women in the region was married as a child.  Tunisia leads the way to eliminating child marriage with a one in 50 rate, while countries ravaged by war and internal conflict, like Yemen, Sudan, and Iraq, require the strongest efforts.  A landscape of war tends to encourage rape (often also used as a weapon of war) and domestic violence. In conflict zones, back-tracking on girls’ empowerment includes early withdrawal from school and a rise in child marriages. The future is unknown for many Syrian refugee girls. Cooperation with a progressive Lebanese movement may change the trajectory for this young female population, a population with potential in social development, peacebuilding, and breaking the cycle of poverty, if given the opportunity.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Office of Tourism (ONMT) has reached an agreement with the Royal Moroccan Golf Federation and the International Association of Golf Tour Operators (IAGTO) to boost golf tourism in Morocco.  The partnership is set to go into effect on April 2020, with a three-year agreement period.  The campaign, dubbed “more sun, more golf, more emotions,” aims to increase golf tourism in Morocco and create jobs in the golf business. The campaign will entail building more golf courses and promoting the Morocco’s golf industry in order to attract golfing tourists.  ONMT’s announcement on Thursday, October 17 comes shortly after the appointment of Nadia Fettah Alaoui as the new Minister of Tourism, a result of the government reshuffle.  “Our goal today is to showcase the strengths of our golf courses and our destinations in target markets and new markets by improving communication and managing distribution with a very innovative approach,” said ONMT’s general director Adel El Fakir in Thursday’s statement.  IAGTO is committed to ONMT’s communication goals and to promoting Morocco’s golf industry. IAGTO will also be expanding its network of affiliated tour operators.   IAGTO emphasized that the development of golf tourism in Morocco must be in accordance with the country’s sustainable development goals.  Morocco was named Africa’s top golf destination in 2015 and 2017 by the World Golf Awards Organization. IAGTO designated Marrakech the best golf destination in Africa and the Gulf region in 2015.  The Samanah Golf Club in Marrakech is set to host the second tournament of the Professional Golf Association TOUR Champions in 2020. The event will be the first PGA Tour-sanctioned event in Africa.  Although golf is a sizeable industry in Morocco, it is still emerging as a driving force of tourism in the Kingdom. The new OMNT campaign hopes to bring Morocco to the forefront of global golf tourism.

Rabat – Morocco’s opposition parties have called the newly appointed government to be more effective, “responsible, and pragmatic” as new ministers prepare to implement the “royal instructions” for a new development model. In a concert of statements earlier this week, as political parties took part in the opening session of parliamentary debates, the opposition reminded the newly appointed government of their duty to serve the needs and aspirations of the Moroccan people. The Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS), which recently left the PDJ-led government coalition in what some observers have called the end of political honeymoon, is now on the offensive against a government coalition it now considers ineffective and lacking the inspiration to solve the country’s most salient social and economic issues. In a statement published on October 15, PPS called on the new government to come up with a “new and pragmatic” political program in which it details how it plans to to rise up to the persisting challenges confronting the country. The new program program should “take into account the royal directives calling for effectiveness and rapidity” in the implementation of political reforms, the statement maintained.  Social justice and national economic performance took prominent spots in the PPS’s statement. In addition to providing “concrete responses to society’s frustration,” read the statement, the new government has the responsibility of putting forth a “working economic orientation aimed at driving up national production.” While not as defiant as the PPS, the Istiqlal or Independence party, also called on the El Othmani-led government to propose a pragmatic plan for parliamentary debates and approval before the implementation phase. 
 Like PPS, however, Istiqlal also holds the PJD-led government responsible for the country’s problems. “The government’s negligence and its failure to respond to the needs of the people is the cause of the country’s socio-economic crisis,” said a statement from the party. The calls come as many express doubts as to whether the new government reshuffle will make any discernible steps to break away from the old habits of the country’s governing class. Echoing that sentiment, Istiqlal’s Nizar Baraka said that Moroccans expect the new government to claim its “constitutional responsibilities” and deliver on promises.

Rabat – There is so much good news. The momentum towards more sustainable development models and their associated patterns of living is being driven in part by a confluence of critical factors: pollution from mass urbanization, ground and soil degradation, de-forestation, global warming, endangered natural habitats, retreating glaciers, growing social justice movements, and more.  The 2016 Paris climate accord was a foundation for collective global action. The accord was part symbolism, allowing global political leaders to rally their respective populations (and private industry) to the climate cause, and partly a general blueprint for a necessary pivot away from the burning of fossil fuels.  The 200 or more signatories committed to actions that would limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrialization levels while “pursuing efforts” for a more ambitious limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Three years later, skepticism now abounds about the ability to even reach the modest 1.5C goal. But work continues. There is progress nearly everywhere.  Morocco has built the Noor concentrated solar power (CSP) plant at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) program tracks Paris climate agreement signatory nations to quantify their progress in cutting carbon emissions.  Morocco was graded as one of the few countries on track to limit CO2 emission levels and meet its respective commitment under the agreement. Taiwan is soon completing a large offshore wind farm. In the UK, during this year’s third quarter, renewable resources generated more electricity than fossil fuels for the first time ever. Paris’ city center is car-free on the first Sunday of every month. New conservative political leadership in Madrid, Spain vowed to end the city’s car ban (applicable in the city center to cut air pollution) earlier this year but reversed that decision after widespread local opposition and court rulings in support of the ban.  A coalition of global cities committed to reduce CO2 levels, known as the C40, recently reported that 30 member cities have successfully cut greenhouse gas emissions in the past five years by ten % or more. Progress. A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) study demonstrated that surface air temperatures in the Arctic region are warming twice as fast as the global average temperature. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the summer of 2019 will be the hottest on record (tied with 2016) according to NOAA; five of the hottest summers ever recorded in North America have occurred since 2014.  Global air pollution causes an estimated six to seven million premature deaths annually. An EU research team documented a 30% glacier retreat phenomenon in the Peruvian Andes between 2000 and 2016. Similar glacier retreats have been seen in Greenland, the Himalaya Mountains and Alaska. EL Pais reported last week that according to research done by the Mediterranean Institute of Biodiversity and Ecology (IMBE) average temperatures in the Mediterranean region have already risen by a critical 1.5C during the age of industrialization.  And then there is petroleum. And coal. Natural gas, too. Seemingly in plentiful supply. Fossil fuels account for more than three-quarters of global energy consumption and they represent the leading source of global CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. As global economic development continues and household living standards rise (using today’s income-based standards), the use of fossil fuels for energy consumption will continue to grow through 2040 according to both the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. Department of Energy’s forecast and data agency, and the International Energy Agency. The petroleum export market has seen dramatic changes in the past five years. The U.S. now joins Saudi Arabia and Russia as the global oil powerhouse producers thanks to the U.S. shale oil boom, natural gas boom, technological advances that make wells more productive as well as more petroleum product transportation infrastructure. The EIA also reported last week that U.S. oil production averaged a record 12.6 million barrels per day.  Even with political and military tensions in the Persian Gulf region, oil supplies have remained relatively steady in the past few months—oil currently sells at about $56/barrel. The markets are largely shrugging off these tensions, confident in the ability of key producers to rapidly calibrate production output with global needs. Cheap oil, coal and natural gas may be putting the health of the planet at risk but high oil prices often result in developing nations having to export precious currency if they lack domestic oil and energy resources. No wonder nations like Morocco are vigorously developing local renewable energy sources.  The EIA also predicts that global natural gas use will rise another 40-45% by 2050. Natural gas is the cleanest burning (least polluting) of the fossil fuels. China is likely to double its natural gas usage in the next ten to fifteen years as it diminishes a reliance on coal to generate electricity. Off the coast of Mozambique, an Italian firm is building an enormous floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing facility due to start production in 2022. The movement away from coal towards natural gas as an electricity generation source is just beginning in many parts of the world, but it has begun. Qatar, Russia, the United States and Australia all plan to compete aggressively for supremacy in the growing LNG export market.  The takeaway: energy consumption across the globe continues to rise, as does the availability and use of renewable energy production sources. But, importantly, fossil fuel use (due in part to its affordability) will also continue to rise. The role of burning coal in raising atmospheric CO2 levels is well established: 30% of energy-related global CO2 emissions come from coal-powered electricity production.  And yet, global demand for coal actually rose slightly in 2017 and 2018 and the International Energy Agency predicts that demand for coal will be stable for several more years. Supply and demand.  Oil and natural gas are here; in the Persian Gulf region, in the Permian Basin in the southwest United States, the North Sea, the Niger Delta Basin, across Siberia, offshore Qatar and in Orinoco River Basin of Venezuela. Collectively, planning for the post-oil era is underway and sustainability is now on the agenda for governments and corporations alike. But the global economy marches on with energy sources that are on hand; expect a significant transition period to a global economy where renewable energy plays a commanding role even with the knowledge that environmental degradation and global warming represent well-documented, ongoing and significant threats to human existence. In the U.S. the fossil fuel industry has a strong supporter in President Donald Trump. Although Trump has instituted regulatory changes in the U.S. that promote fossil fuel usage, the movement toward sustainability and renewable energy sources represents a genuine paradigm shift in power generation that will endure beyond one particular political leadership cycle or another.  For instance, the EIA reported this year that U.S. power companies have retired or phased out nearly 550 coal-fired power plants since 2010. Natural gas and renewable sources have arrived.  The paradigm shift is also brought about by economics and the maturity of the renewable energy resources market. The costs of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind are now often cheaper than fossil fuel sources in some regions.  The early years of renewable energy sources included significant government subsidies for installation and maintenance. Now, economies of scale and technological advances have made renewable energy a sound business practice. Consumers, too, are paying attention to how their power is produced.  A recent report from Accenture and the UN Global Compact collected opinions and insights from more than 1,000 global executives and CEOs. “The Decade to Deliver: A Call to Business Action” represents a barometer on how corporate leadership views sustainability and equitable growth in a complex global economic system. There seems a broad consensus—if not detailed plans—on the need for new models of sustainable growth that embrace renewable energy resources. There is considerable optimism but one somber observation came from Peter Oswald, CEO of Austria-based Mondi Group: “Mother Earth doesn’t look at individual countries or regions, it’s the overall picture and the current system simply doesn’t work.”

Rabat – A French-Moroccan man on a Transavia flight from Paris to Marrakech attempted to open one of the plane’s emergency exits during the flight, causing panic on board.   The 34-year-old allegedly suffers from psychological disorders. He was traveling from Paris to Marrakech with his mother on Friday, October 18. He tried to exit the plane just 15 minutes after takeoff, according to witness accounts.  Panic ensued, and crew members intervened. The man was restrained after struggling against the passengers and crew members who were trying to immobilize him.  One passenger told Business Insider that “everyone was screaming in the plane” while the man himself said nothing.  The plane had to turn around and return to the Paris-Orly airport. The rest of the passengers had to wait for another plane to Marrakech.  Meanwhile, the man was transported to the airport police and placed in custody.  “A passenger attempted to open an emergency exit. The passenger was immediately controlled by the crew members,” says a statement issued by Transavia France on the day of the incident.  “The aircraft then landed at Orly without incident. The passenger was arrested by the police on his arrival,” the statement continues.  “We do not tolerate any behavior that could affect other passengers, crew members or flight safety.”

Rabat – The Political Affairs and Security Policy Division of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) hosted a delegation of Moroccan diplomats at NATO headquarters in Brussels from October 15 to 16. The visit came as part of NATO’s efforts to strengthen their partnership with Morocco in a variety of sectors. During the visit, the Moroccan diplomats met with NATO officials to discuss cooperation and sharing good practice. The delegation also attended discussions concerning NATO cooperation with countries in the Mediterranean Dialogue, according to a press release from NATO. The  North Atlantic Council launched NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue in 1994. The dialogue includes seven non-NATO countries from the Mediterranean region: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Defense, and education were both on the agenda for Morocco-NATO dialogue; however, the key focus was on weapons. The Moroccan delegation met with NATO officials to discuss arms control with a specific focus on small arms and light weapons. Ms. Clare Hutchinson, NATO Secretary General’s Special Representative for Women, Peace and Security, held a meeting with the Moroccan delegation during their visit to Brussels. Hutchinson and the Moroccan diplomats shared good practice in her areas of expertise and discussed cooperation in the fields of peace and security.  The latest diplomatic exchange comes after a delegation from Morocco’s military visited NATO headquarters in June of this year. The visit was the first of its kind and reflected the growing cooperation between Morocco and NATO.  In January 2019, Alejandro Alvargonzalez, NATO’s secratary general for political affairs and security policy traveled to Morocco to meet with the Minister Delegate for National Defense and Nasser Bourrita, Morocco’s Minister for Foreign Affairs.  During his visit, Alvargonzalez expressed NATO’s thanks to Morocco for its “indisputable loyalty to the people of the Mediterranean, Europe, and the Maghreb.”

Rabat – Tangier police arrested three criminals on Friday, October 18 for stealing motorcycles. The suspects, armed with swords, had threatened to stab their victims during the robberies. The police were able to apprehend the suspects thanks to a report from one of the victims. According to a statement from the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), Tangier police arrested the suspects in the car used to commit their crimes.  #مكافحة_السرقات_بالعنف #ولاية_أمن_طنجة : توقيف ثلاثة أشخاص يرتبطون بشبكة إجرامية تنشط في اقتراف سرقة الدراجات النارية تحت التهديد بالعنف. pic.twitter.com/epApBS2RyW — DGSN MAROC (@DGSN_MAROC) October 18, 2019 
Police later learned that the suspects were also the subject of national arrest warrants for kidnapping, ransom demands, and drug trafficking. The suspects were also linked to two other motorcycle robberies that took place the morning of the arrest.  Police recovered two stolen motorcycles and seized the suspects’ vehicle. Police also found false license plates, a tear gas canister, and four swords upon searching the vehicle. According to the DGSN statement, the three suspects are in custody while police continue the investigation into the case. There is an ongoing operation to arrest a fourth suspect.

Rabat – The Argentine embassy in Morocco, with diplomatic representatives from the Latin American country’s embassies in Tunisia and Algeria, inaugurated the first Argentine-Maghrebi cultural space in Rabat on October 17. The new cultural space is designed to consolidate and strengthen cultural links between Argentina and North Africa. The opening of the cultural space included a conference paying homage to the legendary Argentine author, Jorge Luis Borges. Borges, an icon in hispanophone literature, was heavily influenced by Arab culture and his travels to Morocco and Egypt. Led by Sergio Baur, director of the Argentine foreign affairs ministry’s cultural department, the event included readings from Borges’ works. The guest list included Moroccan academics, ambassadors, and diplomats. At the event, Morocco’s Zohra Lhioui, from the  Moulay Ismail University, spoke about Borges’ undeniable links with Morocco. The Argentine writer’s travels in Morocco are clearly reflected in his prose collection Atlas. Lhioui emphasized that Borges explicitly cited his experiences in Morocco in his short stories.  Borges was born in 1899 in Argentina, he travelled widely and later lived in Switzerland. He was an essayist and author of short stories. Morocco and Argentina already share strong diplomatic relations. Moroccan Minister Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in charge of African Cooperation Mohcine Jazouli said in March that the two countries share “excellent bilateral relations.”  Speaking at the inauguration of the new cultural space, Baur said he hopes that the space will promote dialogue and cultural exchange between the two countries.

Rabat – Though the town itself has a population of 2,800, the population of the villages scattered throughout the Skoura oasis in the Atlas Mountains is as many as 23,000 people. Many of the residents work as farmers. Their interaction with the oasis and its ecosystems is indispensable in their daily lives. But life in Skoura is not limited to growing olives, dates, and pomegranates.  Tourism is rife in the stunning oasis. Travelers visit the local sites and hear what locals have to say about their remote government and the future of Morocco.

Rabat – Stories of Qur’anic-scale locust plagues around some of the world’s holiest sites hit the news in past months. Swarms continue to threaten nations’ food security across the Arabian Peninsula.  Cyclones near the Yemen-Oman border in 2018 brought rainfalls that incubated a hardy crop of locusts. The, locusts, which can travel up to 150 kilometers per day, then went after crops. Regional efforts, coordinated in part by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), used wide-scale pesticide spraying to protect agriculture from the swarms. While Jordan was able to launch its air force against the plagues, the people of Yemen employed a more traditional technique. “Instead of them eating our vegetables, now we eat locusts with rice and our vegetables are fine,” a farmer told Middle East Eye. “Locusts swept the entire Arab region, but when they arrived in Yemen, Yemenis eliminated them.” Even armed with its protein-rich approach, Yemen faces the greatest locust-related food security threats in the region during coming months, according to an FAO Report from July 27. Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan also face upcoming challenges. But the region’s plagues are not all as visible as the locusts that swarmed Mecca. Some invaders are attacking from under water. “Plague-like proportions” of lionfish are invading the Mediterranean this year. The predatory species is wreaking havoc on Lebanon’s marine ecosystem.  “It’s like genocide,” Lebanese fisherman Atallah Siblini told Reuters. The lionfish are wiping out a complex ecosystem that fishermen and coastal communities rely on. “Now it is like 30 to 50 of them in one place. They started to scare away the other fish including sea bass which we depend on and they eat everything.” The predatory lionfish, also called pterois, devour other marine life and destroy coral reefs.  The lionfish’s name goes beyond its colorful mane; this fish is an animal of prey. Lionfish are voracious predators, capable of consuming larger fish and even fellow lionfish. Their stomachs serve for feasts, expanding up to 30 times their standard size for a good meal. Lionfish possess natural defense mechanisms worthy of the Arabian Peninsula. One female lionfish can lay up to 2 million eggs per year. As an invasive species, the growing populations have no known predators in the Mediterranean—other than humans.  Lionfish are healthy and delicious, and affected communities around the world have undertaken campaigns to increase lionfish consumption in an effort to curb populations. Indeed, humans must solve a problem that is anthropogenic in nature. Lionfish first entered the Mediterranean after expansion of the Suez Canal. The first Mediterranean lionfish was cited in 1991, with a mass arrival in 2012. Marine biologists also link the growing populations to climate change; the species thrive and reproduce well in warm waters. Rising ocean temperatures make the already-cozy Mediterranean an ideal environment for the glutton.  Complementing increasing fish consumption and culls, a salt block in the Suez could help deter the fish migration into the Mediterranean. But the lionfish is not the Sea’s only fishy threat. Further along the coast, an invasion reaches Israel.  Tens of millions of jellyfish are swarming along Israeli shorelines. Invertebrate “blooms” are an annual occurrence in these waters. Observation suggests a large increase in jellyfish numbers over the past few years, though data is unable to confirm. The jelly masses literally clog up operations at desalination stations and power plants, mirroring similar occurrences worldwide. The plants use seawater to cool operations, and the jellyfish are backing up filtration systems by the ton. One coal-fired power plant in southern Israel had to shut down operations in July to remove thousands of jellyfish from its system. The jelly invasion is killing other marine life, especially by starving out other fish. The predators consume massive amounts of plankton, eggs, and other small nutrition sources, cutting off the food supply for small fish and reverberating up the food chain. Even a short stay in these waters from the nomad species can have a lasting ecological impact. The jellyfish of course pose risks to humans, who are, once again, at least partly culpable for their growing presence. According to scientists, warming sea temperatures, pollution, overfishing of predatory species, and expanding the Suez Canal have all contributed to the boom in blooms.  Jellyfish tend to migrate to warm waters, such as the ever-warming Mediterranean, where they can easily reproduce. They require less oxygen for survival than most fish, which gives them a much higher tolerance for polluted waters. Coastline development and overfishing of predatorial finfish can also be blamed for the increasing presence, according to researchers at the University of Haifa.  The Washington Post cited a study suggesting that jellyfish “use structures such as offshore oil platforms and wind farms as incubators.” When it comes to coastline development, the jellies do not discriminate renewables. Alongside invasive species, plastics plague our oceans. Recent research shows that a jellyfish bloom may be just what is needed to filter small plastics from the world’s water. People can eat locusts; people can eat lionfish; people can even turn jellyfish mucous into plastic filtration systems. But before all, people can heed a warning cry of climate change, which, directly or not, brought each of these plagues into being.

Rabat – The court in France’s Grenoble gave Moroccan Comedian Abdelfatah Jawadi a six-months suspended sentence for marital violence on Friday, October 18. Police in France arrested Jawadi on September 12 when he was visiting his children, who are living with their mother in France. Franceinfo reported that Jawadi was living with a friend 100 kilometers away from his wife and children. He appeared at the Grenoble court accused of making murder threats against his wife and “repeated violence.”He  allegedly committed the domestic crimes between May and September 2019. Moroccan media widely reported the arrest of Jawadi last month, claiming that he had been arrested for raping a young French woman. Jawadi pleaded guilty to all charges, the news outlet reported. The comedian will be on probation for two years. The court also warned him not to contact his wife. The comedian justified his acts, claiming that he was experiencing mental issues due to his “deteriorating social conditions after he left Morocco.” He said that he “lost everything.”

Rabat – Moroccan football player Amine Harit has won the Bundesliga Player of the Month for September. Bundesliga News announced on October 18 that Harit had an excellent month with his German football club Schalke 04. The 22-year old player scored four goals and made two assists in Bundesliga matches throughout September. The football player won the Bundesliga award through a vote. The Bundesliga report emphasized that Harit “saw off competition from Philippe Coutinho, Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski, Stefan Lainer and Christian Günter.”  Harit joined the Schalke 04 club in July 2017. The football player was born in Pontoise, north of Paris. Last year, German media also speculated that Harit’s career might be affected by his alleged addiction to gambling. The player had another shock when he was involved in a fatal car accident that killed a 30-year-old pedestrian in Marrakech in June 2018. The young player paid a fine and received a suspended four-month sentence after the accident. Earlier this year, Harit shared his story with his fans, friends and relatives, and those who didn’t yet know his name. In an article titled “Remember the Name”  Harit narrated his family’s story and t his sense of belonging to Morocco. The football player said that he loves France for giving him “everything in” in his life. Morocco,however, remains special for him because “Moroccans… are my people too.” Harit is also a key football player with the Moroccan national team. He participated with the Atlas Lions during the 2018 World Cup.

Rabat – Morocco’s Education Minister is optimistic about the prospects of the series of new reforms initiated to improve performance at Moroccan schools,. The minister says that the broader goal is to boost teaching quality and equal opportunity. According to Minister Said Amzazi, the North African country is poised to be a respected participant in the worldwide scramble for state-of-the art innovation and scientific research. But to do so, he said, there is a need to invest in “quality education for all.”  Amzazi’s comments came on Thursday, October 17, as he presented,  the accompanying vision of the recently passed education bill, Law 51.1, at an event in Fez. In his presentation, the Moroccan minister invoked his usual sticking points.  He said that education is the lifeblood of the country’s new development model and that it is necessary to boost education performance and teaching quality for Morocco to reach the development level it aspires to. Even as he spoke in the wake of a government reshuffle that has not settled doubts on the delivery ability of the country’s governing class, Amzazi was reassuring as far as the education sector is concerned. He repeatedly emphasized that social integration and inclusiveness are an essential part of the new educational reforms.  In accordance with the King’s call for the governing class to work towards the emergence of a  “new Morocco,” where social inequalities are considerably reduced, he argued, the reforms in the education sector mostly have to do with investing in the making of a new “republican” and well-performing “school for all.” Social equity and equal opportunity, he said, constitute the driving spirit of the new education bill.  Amzazi’s insistence on equality and quality education, worldwide competitiveness, and equal opportunity is reminiscent of the counterargument he has traditionally offered to critics of the new education bill. As the new law entails the adoption of French, rather than Arabic, as the language of instruction for scientific subjects, conservative Moroccans have said the bill constitutes an assault on Moroccan identity and pride. In response, Amzazi notably said in an interview in April that the widespread adoption of Frecnch would end Morocco’s “linguistic fracture” and make Moroccan students more competitive on the world scene.

Rabat – Moroccan police seized 1.65 tons of cannabis resin on Thursday, October 17 in Chichaoua, central Morocco. Police suspected that the seized drugs have links to an international drug trafficking networks,  the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement. Police confiscated the cannabis at the entrance to the town of Chichaoua onboard a truck registered in Morocco. Police arrested  the driver, a 36-year old Moroccan national. Police also seized a pneumatic boat used in “maritime traffic.” Police put the suspect into custody for further investigation to determine the circumstances of the case and to arrest any possible accomplices involved in the drug trafficking network. The operation is part of Morocco’s strategy to combat drug trafficking in Morocco. Throughout the year, Moroccan police and customs have been collaborating to abort drug trafficking attempts across Morocco. On Wednesday, October 16, Morocco’s Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII) said that its staff seized a total of 8,342 kilograms of cannabis resin since October 11. The DGSN in September said that security services seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15. The statement added that security services also seized 1,161,000 psychotropic pills and 44 kilograms of cocaine.

Rabat – Flight Network, a Canadian-based online travel company, has named Marrakech one of the top 50 most beautiful cities in the world.  To gather the data, Flight Network asked more than one thousand travel writers, bloggers, and agencies from around the world to name the best cities they have visited.   Marrakech and Cape Town are the only African cities on the list; meanwhile, the only Middle Eastern city Flight Network mentions is Dubai.  The company selected Marrakech for its rich history, which is evident in the ochre city’s beautiful old palaces, gardens, and mosques.  “You’ll feel like you’ve been transported into a movie while you walk through the Old City, and then feel transported back to today when stepping into the New City,” the Flight Network article states.  The article mentions le Jardin Majorelle, the Koutoubia Mosque, the old medina, and Jemaa el-Fna as some of the city’s best sites.  As Morocco’s top tourist destination, Marrakech is often the recipient of international praise.  The city’s Royal Mansour Hotel was voted the best in Africa and sixth in the world, and two Marrakech riads won Trip Advisor choice awards in 2019.  Football star Cristiano Ronaldo selected Marrakech for the site of his luxury hotel, set to open in 2020. Houda Saad, a Moroccan singer, has already opened a hotel in the city.  In addition to various conferences and summits, Marrakech also hosts major cultural events such as fashion shows, art exhibitions, film festivals, and concerts.  Marrakech is a favorite of celebrities from around the world, who travel to the ochre city for vacations, weddings, honeymoons, or music video shoots.  In August 2019, Morocco’s tourism observatory noted that overnight stays in the city are increasing, while the overall number of visitors in Marrakech has increased by 8% between January and July 2019.  As the city continues to develop, Marrakech will inevitably attract even more foreign visitors.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has described the recent cabinet reshuffle as a “success.”  On Thursday, October 17, El Othmani acknowledged that the reshuffle was not an easy task, welcoming the contribution and  the joint efforts of all political parties. On October 9, the government unveiled its plan for the new government. The shortlist named those ministers who would be leaving their posts, and new faces on the government bench as part of the cabinet reshuffle. A striking change that came with the cabinet reshuffle was the reduction of the number of government ministers, from 39 to 23.  Top ministers, such as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch and Minister of Industry and Trade Moulay Hafid Elalamy maintained their positions. For El Othmani, the reduction of the number of government members was “necessary.” He said that the move would ensure the “efficiency and a better coordination of the governmental action which will have a positive impact on the implementation of public policies.” The new cabinet, will “continue carrying out the missions and the objectives laid down in the royal speeches and in the government’s program,” El Othmani said.  El Othmani’s cabinet has been vowing to implement the instructions of King Mohammed VI, who urged the government to come up with a new development model to tackle social disparities and to meet citizens’ growing demands. “The government is working on clear goals and specific measures,” El Othmani said,  emphasizing the importance of accelerating the pace of action in the interest of Moroccan citizens.

Rabat – Morocco ranked 42nd worldwide in hunger and malnutrition severity, according to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2019 rankings, published on October 14. GHI considers the severity of hunger in Morocco as low. GHI is designed to raise awareness and understanding of the struggle against hunger, provide a way to compare levels of hunger between countries and regions, and call attention to those areas of the world where hunger levels are highest and where the need for additional efforts to eliminate hunger is greatest. The index is based on four criteria: the percentage of the population that is undernourished, the percentage of children under the age of five who have low weight for their height, the percentage of children under the age of five who have low height for their age, and the mortality rate of children under the age of five. The rate of undernourishment within the Moroccan population is estimated at 3.4% in 2019. Undernourishment has reduced from 6.8% in the year 2000. The rates of children under the age of five who have low weight for their height and low height for their age are 3.4% and 16.6% respectively. Both numbers have reduced since 2000. In 2000, 4.3% were underweight, while 24.4% had a low height for their age. Finally, the mortality rate of children under the age of five in Morocco is 2.3% in 2019, down from 5% in 2000. The overall hunger index of Morocco went down from 15.8 in 2000 to 9.4 in 2019, marking a shift from a moderate hunger severity in Morocco to a low one. Morocco also moved up two places in the rankings compared to last year, 2018, climbing from 44th globally to 42nd. Morocco ranked 2nd in Africa, according to the index, behind Tunisia (24th globally). It also ranked 4th in the Arab world, behind Kuwait (1st), Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia (34th). On the global rankings, 17 countries shared the first rank with an index below 5, including Bulgaria, Cuba, Turkey, Ukraine, and others. The countries at the tail of the rankings were Chad (115th), Yemen (116th), and the Central African Republic (117th), with extremely alarming hunger severity. One of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) is to end world hunger by the year 2030. GHI’s ranking, however, shows that achieving the goal of zero hunger in about a decade is almost impossible. In fact, GHI 2019 results show that many countries have higher hunger indexes now than in 2010. The report also states that around 45 countries wouldn’t be able to eliminate hunger within their populations by 2030. Conflicts and wars, social disparities, and climate change are some of the principal root causes of undernourishment and malnutrition.

Rabat – The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), which had previously ruled against Wydad in the seemingly unending EST-Wydad scandal, is considering a new verdict that could back up Wydad’s claims, new reports have suggested. The reports speak of “new evidence” that could swing yet another CAS “final verdict” in favor of the Moroccan club. Wydad’s board was serious when they suggested last month that it would take the African Football Confederation (CAF) and EST exceptionally solid evidence to make them give up on their struggle to be announced as the “deserving winners” of the 2018-2019 African Champions League.  According to emerging reports, the unearthing of the new body of evidence is giving Wydad hope, weeks after both the “relevant bodies” of the CAF and the CAS ruled that the Moroccan club’s championships claims were untenable because its players refused to resume the match when they were losing 1-0. Background The saga began when Tunisia’s EST hosted Wydad in late May for the second leg of the African Champions League final. The Tunisian club was leading by 1-0 when Wydad’s El Karti equalized at the beginning of the second half.  But the referee initially–and wrongly–ruled out the goal for offside. Wydad players protested, asking that the referee use VAR to review the equalizing action. There followed minutes of hot debates, only for the referee to stop the match more than 30 minutes before the normal timing. CAF went on to declare EST as Champions, only to change its mind on the following day when “new evidence” suggested that the game had been mired in multiple irregularities, among which a late-minute dysfunctional VAR.  EST’s claims were especially hit by accusations of influence-peddling and a recurrence of deliberate rigging of the VAR system ahead of important games. While CAF had ruled for a rematch on a “neutral ground,” both clubs felt they deserved to win, with each of them seizing CAS for an independent, final verdict. That phase of off-the-field legal battles was won by EST. But Wydad vehemently disagreed; until the emergence of new evidence recently, this sounded like the petulance of a bad loser. But the “new evidence” suggest the Moroccan club could be right after all.  An unending saga? Among the new pile of evidence, according to reports, is damning footage indicating that Ahmad Ahmad, the CAF president, was intimidated and “threatened” by the president of EST minutes before CAF’s first decision to hand the Tunisian the trophy. Another complaint from Wydad is the “absence of a security mechanism” at the Rades stadium for both Wydadi players and supporters. Most important in Wydad’s complaint, however, is the VAR argument. The Moroccan club considers that it is unfair that EST took advantage of VAR during the first leg in Rabat and later denied its Moroccan visitors the same opportunity.  In the equally controversial first leg in Rabat, the Tunisian club was only able to sustain the 1-1 draw because, on two occasions–first a goal and then a penalty, both wrongly dismissed–the Egyptian referee of the first leg used VAR to make controversial calls in favor of EST. Not only was the VAR not functional during the second leg, Wydad has pointed out, but it was only later that both teams were reportedly told that the VAR system had “been deactivated” for the match.  While CAS has “in principle” agreed to review the new evidence and make its final verdict accordingly, it now remains to be seen how CAF will accommodate whatever may come out of another CAS ruling, especially if the prospective final verdict annuls the previous final verdict.  The African body, which is currently undergoing a series of reforms, has already been accused of inconsistency and self-ridicule after taking contradictory stances on the EST-Wydad saga. In the event of a CAS verdict favoring Wydad, the complex circumstances of the scandal suggest the beginning of another long saga of off-the-field arm wrestle between the two clubs.

Rabat – The first biennale in Rabat has welcomed more than 51,000 visitors in less than a month of its opening, according to a statement from the National Museums Foundation (FNM) on October 15.  A biennale is a large-scale contemporary art exhibition. The Rabat biennale is the first of its kind in the Moroccan capital, with the theme “a moment before the world.”  Under the patronage of King Mohammed VI, the Rabat biennale aims to showcase the capital as a “city of light” and the “cultural capital of Morocco,” according to FNM.  The concept of an art biennale (biennale is Italian for every other year) was first conceived in 1895 with the Venice Biennale in Italy. This cultural event established the archetype for future biennales. Art shows of this kind now occur in cities and museums around the world.  Rabat’s first biennale Abdelkader Damani, a French-Algerian architect, art historian, and philosopher, is curating the first Rabat biennale. Every artist involved in the Rabat biennale is a woman, a decision made by Damani to forge a new history of art.  “Equality of men and women is a chief concern of humanity that we should be engaged with,” Damani said in an interview with artnet News.  “If you want to rewrite the history of art, you need to create new conditions for how you select the artists, because if you use the same protocol that has been done from the 19th century to now, you are going to end up with about 90% of the selected artists being male, and working in English, French, or Spanish.” The Moroccan sculptor Ikram Kabbaj is one of the biennale’s 63 female artists, who are of 27 different nationalities and various artistic disciplines. Other Moroccan artists include dancer Bouchra Ouizguen, photographer Deborah Benzaquen, visual artist Majida Khattari, graphic designer Zahra Sebti, and plastic arts creator Khadija Tnana. The three “white cards” presented to artist Mohamed El Baz, filmmaker Narjiss Nejjar, and writer Sanae Ghouati will further enrich the presence of Moroccan creators in the biennale.  The biennale will conclude with a conference of women writers, novelists, poets, and essayists around a parliament of writers. Nearly 50 literary artists will convene under the aegis of Sanae Ghouati, professor at Ibn Tofail University in Kenitra and the Tunisian novelist Faouzia Zouari. Rabat: City of light While Casablanca and Marrakech have each been hosting a biennale for nearly ten years, the Rabat exhibition is the first to arrive in Morocco’s capital.  The first Rabat biennale is one of several projects that have been launched in recent years to break the confines of Rabat’s status as an administrative city.  King Mohammed VI wants to establish Rabat as Morocco’s “city of light, capital of culture.” The Sovereign’s cultural projects include the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, which opened in 2014, and restoring several historical sites such as Bab Chellah and the souk Essabat streets in Rabat.  The Museum of History and Civilization, and the National Library have already been completed.  Rabat’s Grand Theater is still under construction and will be a world-class auditorium upon completion.  Further renovations of Rabat’s historic sites are to follow, which will solidify Rabat as a modern capital in a historic city.

Rabat – The Muslim woman who experienced Islamophobic attacks from France’s National Rally party (RN) last week has spoken out about how the event at the Regional Council of Burgundy-Franche Comte affected her life and that of her son. Fatima E. accompanied her son to a school activity to explore the mission of the general assembly at the regional council. The school trip, however, did not go well for Fatima, who faced Islamophobic insults from the members of the RN in front of her son because of the hijab or the veil. Fatima spoke to Le Parisien about the incident, emphasizing that what concerned her the most was the distress of the children. “They were really shocked and traumatized.” Photos of the woman trying to calm her son who was crying after hearing RN’s comments went viral. The move angered several public figures who strongly condemned the RN attack against Muslims. During the meeting held on October 11, leader of RN Julien Odoul asked the president of the council to ask Fatima to remove her hijab or to leave the meeting. “It’s the republic, it’s secularity. It’s the law of the Republic, no ostentatious [religious] symbols,” said Odoul, exploiting France’s secularity to promote his own agenda.  The president of the council, Marie Guite Dufay, refused his request, emphasizing that no law allows her to ask the woman to leave for wearing hijab. The RN members then left the meeting. Fatima said that the only thing she could do is to smile. “I smiled first at his stupidity,” she said. She added that she received support from several elected regional officials who wanted her to stay. “When I saw my son crying, I told them that I will not be able to stay.” She said that she also faced verbal attacks when she was leaving. On her way out, she met right-wing regional elected member Karine Champy who told her “You will see, we’ll win.” She said that the RN member wanted to provoke her to react. “They destroyed my life,”  the mother said. She added that she feels a “rejection that I had not felt before and that will have consequences.” She said that she now understands why women with hijabs refuse to participate in school trips. The RN’s move divided public opinion about the hijab in public spaces. While some denounced the move, others seized the opportunity to attack Muslims. The deputy editor of France’s Le Figaro publicly stated that he “hates the Muslim religion,” and that he believes it is his “right” to make openly criticize a religion on national television. However, public figures, including actors, called on France President Emmanuel Macron to intervene. “How long will we keep tolerating hatred against Muslims,” the French public figures asked in a collective statement published by Le Monde.

Rabat – The Moroccan government council adopted the 2020 appropriation bill (PLF), along with three related project decrees yesterday October 17. The council, chaired by the Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, convened a meeting in Rabat to table the decrees, according to new government spokesperson Hassan Abiaba. The PLF targets a growth rate of 3.7% for Morocco’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020. The government council based the objective on the assumption of a cereal harvest of 70 million quintals, an average oil price of $67 per barrel, and an average butane gas price of $350 per tonne. The spokesperson explained that the new appropriation bill is based on four priorities. The first priority is the implementation of the framework law on the reform of education and training systems, as a way of reducing social disparities and ensuring equal opportunities. This priority includes social support for schooling, the implementation of a plan for the development of vocational training, and the promotion of entrepreneurship. The second priority is setting up social protection mechanisms. It aims to support the middle classes and disadvantaged social groups, notably through the extension of medical coverage and health insurance. The third priority is speeding up the implementation of regionalization. Regionalization aims to address territorial disparities through strengthening regional resources and implementing administrative decentralization. The final priority is giving a new dynamic to investment and supporting businesses. The objective of this priority is to create and promote financial support funds for very small to medium-sized businesses. Abiaba also announced the budgets allocated for each priority. The implementation of the framework law on the reform of education and training systems, for instance, would require the creation of new jobs with a budget of MAD 72.4 billion.

Rabat – Agadir police presented a fqih to the city’s appeal court to face charges of pedophilia, on October 17. The fqih worked at a mosque in douar Ait Brahim, near Tiznit (100km from Agadir). Some of his students accused him of sexual abuse. “Fqih” is the Arabic word for scholar in Islamic religion. It is someone who usually works at a mosque, leading the daily prayers, and teaching the Quran to children in between prayers. Police started to investigate the case when the parents of two students at the mosque, a boy and a girl, filed a complaint against the alleged pedophile. The complaint led to his arrest by Royal Gendarmerie. According to testimonies from the children and their parents, the fqih forced students to perform in sexual acts, mainly by using violence. The father of one of the female victims noticed a decline in his daughter’s mental health, along with her unwillingness to go to the mosque where she used to learn Quran. After insistently asking her, the victim told her father that the fqih forces her to touch and kiss his genitals. The shocked parent asked other students at the mosque and they confirmed that they also have been victims to the same abuse. Another testimony from a 9-year-old boy told the same story. According to the boy’s father, the suspect used to take his son to the bathroom and force him to touch his sexual organs. The number of reported pedophilia cases in Morocco is constantly growing. In 2015, a report from Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) stated that 935 cases of pedophilia were reported during that year, growing from 713 in 2012. Articles 484 through 487 of Morocco’s penal code say that the penalty for sexual abuse on minors is two to 30 years of prison, depending on evidence, the gravity of the acts, and the relationship between the offender and the victim. While the law is strict in this type of case, it is not always easy to apply, mostly due to lack of evidence.

Rabat – Moroccan gynecologist Doctor Mohamed Jamal Belkziz expressed his relief at getting out of prison following a royal pardon, but also his sadness over the lack of support from his gynecologist colleagues. Moroccan police arrested, the gynecologist on August 31. He faced charges of performing an illegal abortion on jouralist Hajar Raissouni. Having been sentenced to  a prison sentence, King Mohammed VI granted Belkziz a royal pardon on Wednesday, October 16. On September 30, Rabat’s court of first instance sentenced Dr. Belkziz to two years in prison and two years of ban from medical practices for illegal abortion. In the same case, journalist Hajar Raissouni, her fiance, and the doctor’s medical team also faced prison sentences prison. On October 16, however, King Mohammed VI granted a royal pardon to all of the defendants. “My dignity was destroyed, but the royal pardon gave it back to me. I thank the King for that,” said Belkziz in an interview. The doctor, however, denounced the “injustice he was victim to.” He also regrets the lack of support from his colleagues and the national council of gynecologists. “I chaired the national council of gynecologists for almost six years in Rabat. When cases like mine happened, we used to constitute an experts committee and present our scientific findings to the justice, even if they don’t ask for it,” said Belkziz. “It’s shameful!” the doctor added while telling the media outlet that he practiced medicine for 40 years with altruism and honesty. “Never in my professional career have I been blamed by a patient,” he added. Belkziz also talked about his suffering in prison: “At one moment, I just gave up, I was destroyed. Today, the royal pardon gave me back my strength.” The doctor also promised to get back to his job: “I will continue my career, but for the moment, I need to rest and spend some time with my family who suffered a lot.” Following Belkziz’s arrest, a number of doctors associations protested in the streets asking for his freedom, including cardiologists, endocrinologists, and gastroenterologists. The association of Moroccan gynecologists, however, did not participate in the manifestations.

Rabat – Stephanie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg appeared in a cream-colored Moroccan kaftan dress with gold detailing at a state banquet.  The banquet took place on Tuesday, October 15 in Luxembourg to celebrate the arrival of Queen Mathilde and King Philippe of Belgium.  The Belgian royals were in Luxembourg for a three-day visit meant to strengthen ties between the two countries. They were accompanied by a delegation of over 200 people.  The duchess’ choice of a kaftan for the gala appears to have been inspired by her recent visit to Morocco in September. Meanwhile, the red sash signals Stepahnie’s royal European status.  While the Hereditary Grand Duchess usually opts for more traditional European styles, she has been seen in dresses clearly inspired by the Middle East and North Africa.  On the second night of the Belgian royals’ trip to Luxembourg, Stephanie wore what appears to be a red abaya, a type of garment traditionally worn in the Gulf. The gown’s neckline and ornate detailing, however, give the dress a Moroccan touch. The Hereditary Grand Duchess also wore a simple purple and gold kaftan dress during her October 2017 economic mission to Dubai.  Stephanie is not the only Western royal to take a liking to Moroccan styles.  Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex wore a Dior gown inspired by Moroccan kaftans during her visit to Morocco in February 2019.  Princess Lalla Salma’s timeless style has certainly left an impression on her royal counterparts in the West.

Rabat – Morocco’s Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII) has announced that its staff members have seized a total of 8,342 kilograms of cannabis resin at the ports of Casablanca and Tangier Med since October 11. The ADII recalled the major drug seizure operations conducted by Moroccan security services during the month of October in a statement published on Wednesday, October 16. The customs staff, in collaboration with specialized members of the national police, seized 142 kilograms of cannabis resin on Friday, October 11. The statement added that security services also seized six tons of cannabis resin in the crossing point of Guerguerat on Monday, October 14. On Monday, October 14 customs services in collaboration with national police also seized two tons of cannabis resin in the Tangier Med port. The ADII said that the operations are part of the implementation of a strategy seeking to fight against drug trafficking. The customs office said that in May that its staff seized 19.2 tons of cannabis resin in 2018, 14.7 tons less than the number of cannabis resins seized in 2017 ( 33.7 tons). In addition to customs, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has also been intensifying efforts to crackdown drug trafficking attempts. On September 19, governor of the judicial police Mohamed Dkhissi said that police seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15. He added that security services also seized 1,161,000 psychotropic pills and 44 kilograms of cocaine. Dkhissi said that police arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking during the same period. He emphasized that there has been a “significant” increase of 40% in the number of drug trafficking cases. “There was a similar increase in the number of people arrested [for trafficking drugs] by 50 percent, with 94,010 people arrested, including 308 foreigners, while 62,839 people were arrested in the same period last year.”

Rabat – Former secretary-general of the Algerian  National Liberation Front (FLN) party Amar Saadani has strongly criticized his country’s position on Western Sahara.   Algeria historically backs the Polisario Front’s claim over Western Sahara. In an interview with Algerian French speaking news outlet TSA, the Algerian politician  condemned Algeria’s decision to back and finance the separatist group, who he thinks failed to “break the impasse.” For Amar, the Sahara is “Moroccan and nothing else.” He said that his point of view is based in historical fact. The  69-year old politician criticized the Polisario Front, stating that Algeria has been “pouring huge sums [of money] for the so-called Polisario for fifty years.” He said that the relationship between Algeria and Morocco is greater than “this question.” The politician hopes that the recent developments in the Maghreb region will help revive relations between its countries. During the interview, Saadani said that the situations in Tunisia and Algeria are “favorable because there is the election of a new president and the change of Tunisia’s system.” “Algeria is moving towards an election and a change of system,” he added. Since February, protests  have swept Algeria, calling  for a radical political change and the removal of the  Bouteflika era elites Ammar emphasized that the question of the Sahara “must come to an end.” Algeria,  under the leadership of former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and the de facto leader, Gaid Salah- the Algerian army chief- have long backed the Polisario Front and its separatist ideology, which is against Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Algeria and Morocco have also shared icy diplomatic relations with the crisis over the closed border between the two countries since 1994. Algeria closed the border with Morocco after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens. Morocco’s decision  followed a terror attack on the Atlas Asni hotel in Marrakech. Morocco’s government, under the instructions of King Mohammed VI, has been calling on Algeria to engage in a dialogue to break the stalemate and re-establish diplomatic ties. “I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries,” said King Mohammed VI in his November 6, 2018 speech. Amar echoed King Mohammed VI’s call for the restoration of diplomatic ties between Morocco and Algeria saying that both countries should open their borders. “I think that the question of the Sahara must come to an end and that Algeria and Morocco must open their borders and normalize their relations,” Amar said. He added that the “money paid to the Polisario, with which its members have walked around with in luxury hotels for fifty years” must he be invested in other Algerian cities. “This is my opinion even if it displeases some [people],” he said.

Rabat – The granting of the royal pardon to Hajar Raissouni has ignited a firestorm of mostly positive reactions.  “Finally a happy and wise decision,” tweeted Youness Maksine, the publication director of Akhbar Al-Yaoum, the Arabophone newspaper where Raissouni works as a staff writer. Feminist activist Ibtissame Betty Lachgar said Raissouni’s liberation was a promising signal for the “fight against dranconian and sexist laws.” While some have raised thinly veiled concerns over the political calculations behind the royal move, others, and it would appear the majority, have expressed satisfaction that their numerous calls and pleas had finally been heeded by a “wise” King. Mostly, the reactions came with a note of delight, sometimes gleeful reflections on the promises and challenges on the road of those fighting for a more liberal vision of Morocco. At the beginning of this week, on Monday, there was an air of renewed fervor over the Raissouni case, with Morocco’s individual freedoms and human rights advocates repeatedly calling for the release of the journalist.  Even after weeks of social media campaigns and rallies, “We stand with Raissouni” advocates ran into a brick wall in the form of an unrelenting Moroccan judiciary which had already made up its mind about the price to pay for “illegal abortion” or “sex outiside of marriage.”  Raissouni’s case became, as a result, the cause celebre of those fighting for an alternative vision of Morocco, from feminist activists to liberal Moroccans and moderate Islamists striving to end what they see as an instrumentalization of religion for political purposes. To stand with Raissouni became synonymous with standing against a “backward,” “obsolete,” and “suicidal” vision of Morocco.  Quickly–and quite naturally, some would argue–the Raissouni case jumped beyond the confines of defending the “inalienable rights” of one particular woman and morphed into the ultimate embodiment of the daily struggle of Moroccans–mostly women– feeling that they were constantly self-censoring to fit into the codes and regulations not representative of the societal transformations their country has been through in recent years.   The mess was big enough, but its shifting from Raissouni vs Public Prosecutor to Conservative Moroccans vs Liberal Moroccans made it even greater, murkier, and complex.  “I think that Moroccans, mostly the youth and women, have had enough. For their sake, we will not give up,” Moroccan writer and activist Sonia Terrab said on Monday, announcing the second  public engagement phase of an advocacy group she had helped launch in the wake of the Raissouni incident.  Terrab, who spoke with the religious zeal of somebody who “has had enough” of the perceptibly unconscionable shackles society was imposing on her and other Moroccans’ self-expression, asserted that the common goal for Morocco’s freedom fighters should be to have the authorities release Raissouni.  Regardless of their political or ideological affiliations, for advocates of a new and rule of law-governed Morocco, the now released journalist became the cross-ideological glue they had not asked for.  The royal pardon came amid such a deep divide between clashing visions of Morocco. Particulalry interesting, however, is the fact that the royal pardon, granted to Raissouni, her fiance, and the medical staff said to have carried out the abortion, provides a fertile ground for a host of narratives. One line of reasoning, immediately plausible after the unexpected but not at all surprising royal move (royal pardons, especially in the wake of controversial prosecutions, are a common thing in Morocco) was that, as always, the King was again taking into his own hands an extremely divisive matter to broadcast yet another message about his reconciliatory vision of Morocco.  Like the adult in the room rising above the legitimate but sometimes petulant claims of two diametrically opposed camps, the King placed himself above the ideological divides while simultaneously giving credit to both camps when needed.  By not interfering with the legal procedure that culminated in a one-year prison sentence for Raissouni, he was respecting the judiciary’s constitutional right to independence. And yet by overruling the Rabat court’s decision barely a month after its was pronounced, he was also telling the other Moroccans, those standing with Raissouni and (purportedly) perpetual victims of the political status quo, that he has heeded their pleas and calls for an intervention.  Reactions from both Raissouni and the ministry of justice make for this particular reading. “The royal pardon has corrected an unjust prosecution,” Raissouni told AFP. She held up to her apparently undimmed conviction that the whole affair had been politically motivated. At the same time, she was happy and relieved that the King was attentive to her plight. To her, the royal move was humane and a breath of fresh air.  In a press release after most Moroccan publications aired the news about the King’s call, the ministry of justice was quick to provide its own reading. The statement obviously disagreed that the prosecution had been unfair or politically motivated.  The ministry highlighted the King’s “compassion” and “concern” for a young couple’s future and dreams. While the prosecution of the couple was motivated by their “mistake,” the press release argued, they are entitled to their dream of “founding a family in accordance with legal and religious prescriptions.”  Self-serving vagaries and rationalizations aside, the ministry’s message, like Raissouni’s to AFP, seemed to be one of rejoicing in the royal move. But where the former saw a respectable and commendable discharge of royal duty in accordance with the country’s Constitution, the latter saw the King deploying his “compassion” for a righteous cause.  “I am innocent…. I have suffered a great injustice and a terrible aggression,” Raissouni stressed after her release. But she suggested she is moving beyond resentment, acrimony, or self-serving indignation. All she now hopes for, she said, is for her case to “serve as an engine” to drive debates forward on the penalization of abortion, sex outside marriage, and all the other litany of practices Morocco’s individul freedoms advocates deem “obsolete” and unrepresentative of modern Morocco. While it would be tempting to engage in the appealing and inevitably protracted debate over which reading is more reflective of the underlying premise of the royal move, it also begs stressing that both reasonings appear to agree that, at bottom, the move was motivated by human considerations.  Meanwhile, a third camp has taken the royal pardon as an opportunity to hit back at what it sees as unfair external criticisms of Morocco’s march forward.  As should have been expected, the Raissouni case went beyond Morocco’s borders. At the outset of the controversy,  a number of international observers and human rights advocacy groups lambasted the country for its supposed culture of politically motivated trials when prosecuting government critics or dissidents.  “Morocco’s arrest, prosecution, and brutal violation of Hajar Raissouni’s private life illustrate the country’s lack of respect of individual freedoms, and apparently the selective enforcement of unjust laws to punish critical journalism and activism,” Ahmed Benchemsi, Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa communications director, said in the aftermath of Raissouni’s prosecution.   Although relatively inaudible in the hot debate of visions between conservative and liberal Moroccans, the third camp saw in the frenzy of reactions from foreing news outlets and international NGOs a “regrettable” tendency to interfere with Morocco’s internal debates.  However, like the two dominant camps, proponents of the third reading also hail the King’s resolve to put himself above the clash of visions driving Morocco’s societal debates.  “The King made his call without taking sides in the necessary debates Moroccans have been having about the evolution of their society,” one government source told AFP. “Regrettably, however,” the source added with a discernible note of frustration, “some foreign intellectuals, NGOs, and media organizations have invited themselves in this legitimate debate.”   All these readings have a certain kernel of truth to them. But beyond conflicting rationalizations of what may have motivated the royal pardon–whether a perfectly calculated PR move or genuine concern for the plight of a citizen who somehow embodied the continued struggle of Moroccan women–the King’s ultimate message echoed the “I am the King of all Moroccans” spirit his speeches and public statements have so earnestly emphasized over the past months.

Rabat – The UN announced yesterday, October 16, a list of 30 influential business leaders who will become members of the newly created Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) alliance. Moroccan business woman Miriem Bensalah-Chaqroun appeared on the UN list as a member of the alliance. The members of the alliance, created by the UN’s Secretary General Antonio Guterres, will work together in the next two years in order to draw investments from the private sector towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Bensalah-Chaqroun is currently a director at Holmarcom group, a family holding business, as well as CEO of Oulmes, a mineral water company. The co-presidents of the GISD alliance for the next two years will be Oliver Bate, CEO of Allianz Group, and Leila Fourie, CEO of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The other members of the alliance are CEOs of large multinationals, including the Bank of America, Citigroup, ICBC, Infosys, Investec, Santander, and UBS. The alliance will be separated into three groups with distinct objectives. Bensalah-Chaqroun’s company, Oulmes, will co-preside over the group focusing on investment opportunities in developing countries, along with Allianz Group. “I really believe that investments in sustainable development are crucial to guarantee an inclusive economic growth, reduce social and regional disparities, and preserve natural resources,” said the businesswoman following her nomination. According to the UN, the majority of developed countries don’t stick to their commitment of aiding the development of developing countries. The financial sums needed for development in emerging countries are estimated at thousands of billions of dollars every year. Even if all developed countries maximize their aid, it would still not be sufficient meaning that the private sector needs to take part.

Rabat – National Express, already the main bus operator in 6 Moroccan cities, has doubled its presence in Morocco. The UK transport company is set to take on Casablanca’s bus service having signed €1 billion dollar contract.  The company, operating as ALSA in Spain and Morocco, took over operations of the municipal buses in Rabat in August and plans to reinvigorate Casablanca’s transport system.  Dean Finch, the company’s chief executive, expressed his satisfaction with deal which well and truly seals National Express’ growing “I am delighted we have secured this significant contract in Morocco. This nearly doubles our presence in Morocco, which had already doubled in August with Rabat’s successful start-up.” The latest contract comes into effect in November with 400 buses transporting 100 million passengers a year. National Express will introduce a further 300 buses in 2020.  Over the course of the contract, set to last 10 years with an option to extend a further 5 years, the UK company plans to introduce new payment schedules and systems, as well as redesigning the network. A press release from National Express reflected the company’s wish to expand their presence in Morocco. “As in other Moroccan cities, there is opportunity for further growth in other local Casablanca transport markets, such as school buses and tourist services.” National Express merged with Spanish bus company ALSA in 2005. ALSA won its first contract in Morocco in 1999, bidding for, and winning, operation of Marrakesh’s urban transport system.  The company now operates the bus service in Rabat, Khouribga, Agadir, Tangier, Marrakesh, and, as of November, Casablanca.  ALSA, as part of the National Express Group, will be taking the contract over from M’dina Bus, the company that has managed buses in Casablanca since 2004.  The city’s contract with M’dina Bus will expire at the end of October.Transport in Casablanca has long been a source of discontent for Casablanca’s population. The M’dina Bus fleet was made up of old, poorly maintained buses. In January 2019, a bus belonging to the company caught fire in the middle of a crowded intersection. Fortunately, no human casualties were recorded.

Rabat – A video showing a martial arts coach beating up one of his female students during a training session in a Moroccan gym has gone viral on social media. The video shows what appears to be a kickboxing coach punching a female student in the face. The student is not wearing any protective gear and does her best to block the coach’s punches. After a few punches, the coach accelerates the rhythm of his blows. The fast and successive punches hurt the student, almost knocking her out. Moroccan kickboxing champion, Badr Hari, shared the video on his Facebook page. He expressed his shock at the video and called on the managers of gyms and coaches to stamp out such behavior. I am particularly shocked by this video which shows an unconscious « man » beating a young girl. This is not sport. This is not kick boxing. This horrific scene shouldn’t happen and I cannot remain insensitive. Please do not allow this cowarldy and irresponsible attitude in your gyms. Posted by Badr Hari on Saturday, 12 October 2019 More than 11,000 people commented on Hari’s post, expressing their anger towards the coach and the shocking video. The post was also shared more than 11,000 times, by people from different countries. The president of the Moroccan Federation of Kickboxing, Muay Thai, Savate and similar sports, Abdelkarim El Hilali, also intervened after the video went viral.  El Hilali called the presidents of all regional leagues for martial arts to lead investigations in order to find where the incident took place and prevent similar ones in the future.

Rabat – Morocco’s determination to collaborate with its international partners to fight irregular migration has borne fruit. Spanish news outlet El Pais reported on October 17 that Spain has managed to reduce  undocumented migration by half. The news outlet cited recent data, indicating  that 24,159 people arrived in Spain this year. The decrease in the number of arrivals  marks the first serious decline in irregular immigration by land and sea since. Spain has been putting irregular migration issue as one of its priorities since last year after the arrival of 64,298 people in Spain last year. El Pais also cited an internal report from the European Commission, emphasizing that  the reduction in migrants’ arrivals is due to Morocco’s ongoing efforts to stop would-be migrants from taking sea routes to Spain from its coastline. The commission also extolled Morocco’s migration policy, stating that the “preventive efforts by Moroccan authorities continue to be effective and they are key to understanding  the strong reduction in arrivals in Spain during 2019.” The report added that Morocco’s efforts have prevented thousands of departures by land and the rescue of dozens of other migrants “who were returned to Moroccan territory” El Pais recalled the European Union’s financial aid to Morocco to help tackle border control issues stemming from to the pressure of the flow of migrants. Morocco’s migratory policy takes into account “shared responsibility” as one of the key methods to tackle migration issues. In August, the Moroccan government announced that Morocco aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. Director of migration and border surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali said in August that “border security is the responsibility of all countries, all countries must contribute to make the fight against cross-border crime an effective fight.” Zerouali also said that the Moroccan-Spanish  collaboration on migration is exemplary and a “model of cooperation between the south and the north.” “We work with mixed maritime patrols between the Royal Gendarmerie and the Civil Guard, air and land and cooperate in the exchange of information to fight against [criminal] networks,” he said  He added that “working together creates trust” between countries.

Rabat – Around 340,000 Moroccans are suffering from schizophrenia, according to a report published by Chams and Sila, two Moroccan non-profit organizations for the promotion of mental health in Morocco. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. Symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, abnormal behavior, disorganized speech, and disturbance of emotions. The study showed that 75% of Moroccan families with a schizophrenic relation don’t really understand the illness. As many as 25% of those households believe that schizophrenia is caused by supernatural reasons, such as witchcraft and djinns (ghosts). About 70% of Moroccans suffering from schizophrenia have visited or were taken to visit traditional healers, herbalists, or fqihs. The report also mentioned that only 11% of Moroccans believe that schizophrenic people need to stay in mental health facility. The numbers presented in the report give an insight into the situation of people suffering from mental illnesses in Morocco. Awareness about mental health among the Moroccan population is still very low. A large number of Moroccans still link mental disorders to superstitious beliefs. The Moroccan organizations published the report in conjunction with the World Mental Health Day, last Thursday, October 10. Chams and Sila also published the study in preparation for the upcoming Profamille Conference 2019 in Marrakech. Profamille is an international programme that aims to teach people the ways to help their family members suffering from schizophrenia. The conference that will take place on November 21 and 22 will serve as a launching ceremony for the programme in Morocco. The Chams and Sila associations act as local partners of the programme in Morocco. The event will be open to the public, with preregistration, and it will include presentations and workshops around mental health hosted by doctors, professors, and educators.

Rabat – The White House has confirmed the authenticity of a letter sent from US President Donald Trump to Tayyip Erdogan, President of Turkey. Trump sent the letter to Erdogan on October 9 in an attempt to convince the Turkish president to withdraw Turkish troops from Syria. Turkey has deployed troops for its military “Operation Peace Spring” in northern Syria. The Turkish operation is, according to Erdogan, to “secure its borders by eliminating terrorists there and ensuring the safe return of Syrian refugees and Syria’s territorial integrity.” Several countries criticized the Turkish move, including Arab states, the UK, and other European states. The US President was among the world leaders to strongly oppose Turkey’s military operation in Syria.  in what the Guardian describes as a “bizarre” letter, Trump asked for dialogue with Erdogan. “You don’t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don’t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy – and I will,”  Trump threatened. Before telling Erdogan that he would call him “later,” Trump said that “history will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way.” He concluded his letter by asking Erdogan to “ not be a tough guy.” “Don’t be a fool!” Trump said to the Turkish President. The several public figures in the US and internationally have expressed surprise at the letter, with some of them thinking it was a joke. Mike Quigley, a member of US  House Intelligence Committee told CNN that he thought it was a “prank.” “I actually thought it was a prank, a joke that it couldn’t possibly come from the Oval office.” The BBC quoted presidential sources from Turkey, stating that Erdogan “thoroughly rejected” Trump’s letter. The sources told the BBC that the Turkish president put Trump’s letter in “the bin.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Education Minister, Said Amzazi has revealed that an increasing number of Moroccan pupils are leaving private schools to join public ones. Amzazi, who was speaking at a parliamentary session on October 14, said that the unusual trend–Moroccan parents are traditionally known for preferring private schools for their children–is indicative of a “regain of trust” for the country’s public education system.  “This year, over 52,000 of last year’s 700,000 pupils at private institutions left their private schools in direction of public ones,” Amzazi said when asked about the current state, and the future of Morocco’s public schools.  As far as Amzazi sees it, this usually unheard-of shift speaks of the improving standards in the country’s public institutions.  He argued that the change means the country’s public learning institutions are “progressively” gaining back the reputation that used to be theirs in the first decades of post-colonial Morocco. To make sense of what Amzazi sees as an encouraging trend, his ministry has requested a nation-wide study to explore the underlying reasons behind the change.  The prospective study, according to sources who have been briefed on its scope and content, seeks to answer questions such as “Why are masses of students joining public schools?” or “What would motivate a parent to prefer public schools over private ones?” Even before the results of the study, however, the minister is convinced that the change boils down to the “progressive improvements” in Moroccan public schools.  During a conference late last month, Amzazi, who was already aware of the trend, unreservedly spoke about how Morocco’s public schools are evolving, claiming their lost reputation, and “progressively regaining” public trust.  But the news comes amid a persisting negative perception of public schools among most Moroccans, and it is doubtful whether the arguments put forth by the minister are the only ones that account for the change.  Last August, a government-sponsored study established that persisting disparities and social inequalities continue to stain Morocco’s education system, giving private schools the upper hand over ill-financed, destitute public schools. Contrary to Amzazi’s insistence on Morocco’s public school gaining back their nobility, an alternative reading, supported by most non-government bodies, is that the exorbitant fees at private institutions are most likely prompting many parents to resort to public schools instead.

Rabat – Security services in Sale, Rabat’s twin city aborted an irregular migration attempt on Wednesday, October 16. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced the arrest of five suspects involved in organizing a network for undocumented migration. Police also apprehended 22 candidates for irregular migration, including a 16-year old minor for as part of their investigation. During the investigation, police seized  21 lifejackets, fuel, and knives. The investigation into the circumstances of the case and arrest accomplices involved in the criminal network is ongoing. The operation is part of Morocco’s strategy to combat undocumented migration that has been one of the priorities due to the flow of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco. Morocco is both a destination and a transit country for migrants seeking to reach Europe. In August, Morocco’s government announced that authorities aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. Moroccan security services, especially members of the royal navy, have conducted regular rescue operations to assist irregular migrants at. On October 10-13, members of the navy rescued 329 irregular migrants in the Meditteranean. The migrants were mostly from sub-Saharan nations. The list of migrants included 49 women and several children, who were aboard small boats.

Rabat – Solidarity with Hajar Raisouni, the journalist jailed for “illegal abortion” and sex out of wedlock, is morphing into a broader call from civil society for more individual freedoms and human rights. “In the beginning, we were just two, then 5, then 10, then 200… and now we are as many as 12,000 signatories,” said Sonia Terrab, a Moroccan writer turned activist. Late last month Terrab co-wrote a manifesto in defense of Raissouni.  Speaking at a conference in Casablanca on October 14, days after a Rabat court upheld the accusations against Raissouni, Terrab passionately talked about the role of social movements in the emergence of a new, rule of law-governed Morocco.  “The Outlaws,” the movement Terrab was formally presented at the Casablanca conference, according to Telquel, started off with a temporary mission as simple online advocacy for Raissouni. Weeks later, however, the group is developing into a movement for the defense of individual freedoms in Morocco.  According to the Moroccan writer, with the growing interest in their movement and the sustained debates among Moroccans about the state of individual freedoms and the rule of law,  they thought it would be good to turn the temporary advocacy group into a full-fledged civil society movement.  The group now aims to become an official participant in the necessary debates around social mores in Morocco, as well as the political reforms needed to usher the country in a new, much-hoped for an era of a consolidated democracy. “When we saw that signatures were flying in and we reached 2000 signatories in the early days,” muted an optimist Terrab, we told ourselves, ‘Hey, this is really gaining ground’.” The movement “touched people,” she insisted, adding that the more interest and engagement they received from the public and thousands of Moroccans calling for things to change, “the more we told ourselves that we needed to shoulder more responsibility.” Beyond the feeling of social responsibility, Terrab also appears to embrace the hope that, given that youth and women constitute the crushing majority of Morocco’s population, the country’s conservative, Islam-inspired legal norms are ultimately untenable. But while change appears inevitable, she argued, it will take particular people and movements to bring about the necessary conditions to inspire the much-expected collective change.   “It is first and foremost a question of timing… But maybe I’m wrong,” she said with caution.  But that cautious line was immediately dented by her clear determination to continue fighting on behalf of Moroccan youth and women who she said have had enough of the way Moroccan society and authorities tend to limit the expression of individual freedoms. “I think that Moroccans, mostly the youth and women, have had enough. For their sake, we will not give up.” But the Raissouni case also highlighted a sad, sober reality of online advocacy and armchair activism.  In the wake of the Raissouni controversy, while indignation and determination flew all over the place on various social media platforms in defense of Raissouni and Moroccan women in general, the rallies in solidarity with Raissouni struggled to gather the same momentum.  In most cases, the people who showed up at rallies and marches, where the message could have been given more urgency, and more transformative stridency, were a tiny fraction of the overflow of supportive voices that had shared messages of “change now” and “we stand with Raissouni” on online platforms. As “The Outlaws” prepares to formally enter Morocco’s fragile social advocacy terrain,  Terrab is clear about the overarching goals.  While she described the overall sentiment as one of driving social and political change in Morocco, she was insistent on the need for Morocco’s individual freedoms and human rights advocates to not speak in dispersed, scattered voices.  “The aim of this conference is to centralize our voices and messages so that we are no longer dispersed,” said Terrab. But while doing so, she and her group are determined to follow up on the Raissouni case.  As the controversial case seems to have faded from the public eye weeks after the Rabat Court handed the journalist a one-year prison sentence, the group wants to bring the issue back to public prominence. They plan to publish a series of articles and newsletters in the coming weeks to resurrect the debate about releasing Raissouni. By doing so, the hope is to re-engage the country’s judicial authorities on the Raissouni case with the aim of adding fuel to a larger, and much-needed discussion on individual freedoms, human rights, and independent justice.  Terrab and her group are hardly the only ones calling for fundamental changes in both Morocco’s penal code and the larger, entrenched embrication between religion, culture, and whatever is left or becoming of Moroccan society or identity.  Supportive voices from all walks of life have generally made the point that many articles in the Moroccan penal code are obsolete and contrary to the spirit of the 2011 Constitution. Their central argument is that Morocco has considerably changed and national regulations need to reflect the social transformations the country has experienced. But with the perception that Morocco’s Islamist ruling party is not poised to embrace the transformation the youth and women are calling for, it remains to be seen how effectively social justice warriors like “The Outlaws” will affect public policies and change the terms of Moroccan public debate.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Interior has submitted a document to all Moroccan administrations calling for a simplification of the parental recognition procedures for children born from undocumented marriages. The Wali general director of local collectivities, Khaled Safir, addressed the document to all regional Walis and governors. The paper invites its addresses to inform communal councils’ presidents as well as officials in charge of civil status documents’ services of the importance of simplifying the administrative procedures for child registration. Article 16 of the Family Code considers the marriage certificate as the only legal and official proof of marriage. Couples without a marriage certificate face administrative obstacles when trying to register their children in civil records. The new orders seek to reduce problems related to child registration. They also seek to protect children’s rights and ensure their eligibility for school. In January 2018, Moroccan administrations launched a campaign to promote the registration of undocumented children in civil records. The Human Rights’ Ministry stated that the number of Moroccan children who are unregistered in civil records is currently estimated at more than 83,000. The practice of marriage without a legal certificate, known as “Fatiha” marriage, is still prevalent in Morocco, especially in rural areas. While the marriage is valid from a religious point of view, it is not legally recognized. Couples without a legal marriage certificate cannot register their children in official civil records. The children, therefore, have no legal identity and can face problems when registering for school.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has granted a royal pardon to Moroccan journalist Hajar Raissouni. The Al Akhbar al Yaoum journalist received a one-year prison sentence from the Rabat court for undergoing an illegal abortion and sex outside marriage. A press release from the Moroccan Ministry of Justice announced the news of her pardon on Wednesday, October 16. The Moroccan Ministry of Justice said that the royal pardon seeks to preserve Raissouni’s future and that of her fiance, who were going to build a family in accordance with Morocco’s law “despite the error they may have committed,” which led to their arrest. Moroccan police arrested Raissouni along with her fiance, a Sudanese national, in the entrance of a clinic monitored for practicing illegal abortion. Both Raissouni and her fiance denied abortion claims. The royal pardon also included the doctor and medical staff arrested for performing the alleged illegal abortion. The royal pardon also included the doctor and medical staff arrested for performing the alleged illegal abortion. Hajar Raissouni’s case sparked nationwide created debate and divided public opinion in Morocco. The case also drew criticism from human rights activists and international NGOs. The activists and associations called for the immediate release of the journalist. On October 2, more than 300 people rallied in front of the Moroccan parliament in protest against the Rabat’s Court of First Instance’s verdict in the case. The activists condemned the arrest and prosecution of Raissouni for abortion, calling for individualism. The Moroccan law criminalizes abortion when is not practiced to preserve the mother’s physical health or in case of an urgent medical threat. Sex outside marriage is also a crime in Morocco, according to Article 16 of the Family Code.

Rabat – Morocco’s position on Western Sahara received a boost during the 4th Committee of the United Nations on Tuesday, October 16, with a group of countries expressing their support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. El Salvador, one of the latest states to withdraw recognition of Polisario’s self-proclaimed SADR, reiterated, on October 16, its support for the UN-led political process. The process aims to achieve a “realistic, pragmatic and sustainable political solution based on compromise” for the Western Sahara conflict. Speaking to the committee, Permanent Representative to the UN Egriselda Lopez said that her country encourages efforts to find a “peaceful, fair, and lasting solution.” Burkina Faso, one of Morocco’s African allies expressed its full support for Morocco’s territorial integrity to the committee. The Burkinabe representative emphasized that Morocco’s autonomy initiative represents a “compromise solution” to the conflict. Morocco submitted the Autonomy Plan to the UN in 2007 as a proposal to end the conflict over Western Sahara. The “serious and credible” initiative, as called by several countries in the international community, plans to offer Sahrawis the legitimacy and the right to govern their own affairs through the devolved government. Residents would also benefit from Morocco’s southern provinces’ resources in Western Sahara. For Burkina Faso, the Moroccan Autonomy Plan “takes into account the specificities of the region and meets the international standards in the devolution of powers to local populations,” permanent representative of Burkina Faso to the UN Eric Y. Tiare said on Tuesday. Human rights concerns Tiare also expressed satisfaction with the development projects initiated by Morocco in its southern provinces  “in favor of the Sahara populations.” The diplomat echoed the concerns of the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres,  who warned against the situation of Sahrawis in Tindouf camps in his annual report. In his recent report on the situation in Western Sahara, the UN chief said that Sahrawis the Tindouf camps are suffering from malnutrition and diseases. Anemia and other diseases are prevalent among children, and pregnant women. Tiare also expressed “concern over the situation of populations in the Tindouf camps, which are recommended to be registered in accordance with international humanitarian law, the UNHCR mandate, the recommendations of the UN Secretary-General, and Security Council resolutions since 2011.” Gabon’s deputy permanent representative to the UN also welcomed Morocco’s autonomy initiative during the meeting. For Gabon, the Autonomy Plan would “not only to put an end to the current impasse but can also lead to reach a negotiated political solution.” The Autonomy Plan, according to the representative from Gabon, is in line with international law as it takes into account the regional specificities and the need to involve local populations in the development of the region. The Gabonese diplomat recalled the challenges in the region, including the security challenges in the Sahel region, a situation that has long worried about Morocco’s security services. “While the Sahel region is facing security challenges, we need to work towards a rapid political settlement of this regional dispute that undermines cooperation among the countries in the region,” the diplomat said. El Salvador, Gabon, and Burkina Faso are among a long list of countries to reiterate support for Morocco’s position during the 4th UN Committee. Other countries supporting Morocco’s territorial integrity in the symposium include Yemen, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Burundi, and Guinea.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI’s Ambassador Youssef Amrani handed his credentials to South African President Cyril Ramphosa on Tuesday, October 15. The president accepted the new ambassador’s credentials at an official audience in Pretoria.  The Moroccan ambassador told Morocco World News that he has the “immense privilege and the great honor to present to His Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa the letter of Credence.” He added that he conveyed King Mohammed VI’s “warm greetings and best wishes” to Ramphosa. He  also expressed Morocco’s “desire to reinforce bonds of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.”
 “Our two countries commonly agreed upon the necessity to achieve this ambition by deepening and reinforcing their historical relations, inherited from the years of struggle against apartheid,” Amrani told MWN. Amrani is the first Moroccan ambassador to South Africa in 15 years. His installation reflects the warming diplomatic relations between South Africa and Morocco which have, historically, been icy. South Africa has a longstanding relationship with the Polisario Front. The African country’s position on Western Sahara has been an impediment to strengthening cooperation with Morocco.  However, November 2017 saw a change in the tensions between the two countries following a meeting between King Mohammed VI and then President Jacob Zuma at the European Union – African Union summit in Abidjan.  South Africa and Morocco, both big players on the African continent, share a commitment to developing bilateral relations with a view to achieving their joint pan-African vision. The two countries want to boost South-South cooperation on the continent and are working towards the 2063 AU agenda.  A forward-looking partnership Speaking about the position of both Pretoria and Rabat in the African continent, Amrani emphasized that the two countries “are the largest investors in the continent and as regional hubs, they are called upon to play major roles in the African integration process through enhancing inter-African trade and investment to promote growth and shared prosperity through appropriate tools like the African continental free-trade area.”  Pretoria and Rabat were strong proponents of the Africa Free Trade Agreement. Upon implementation of the agreement in May of this year, former Moroccan Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said, “The entry into force of the agreement will contribute to the implementation of the Royal Vision, based on the idea that Africa’s future is the work of the continent itself and its citizens, and that it is time to move forward on this path.” In the spirit of moving forward, the new ambassador to South Africa reiterated Morocco’s commitment to its newfound friendship with South Africa and the development of the African continent. The ambassador also shared his agenda of priorities with MWN, emphasizing that “intensifying” political dialogue with South Africa at the bilateral level is one of his priorities. He also said that he seeks to “promote people-to-people relations by deepening exchanges in the areas of culture, education, food security, climate change, energy, and tourism.”

Rabat – Days ahead of the UN talks on Western Sahara, Morocco’s Autonomy Plan continues to gather momentum as many African countries call it the most “credible” and “serious” way out of the Western Sahara conflict. Speaking yesterday at a session of the UN 4th Committee, representatives from a range of countries lauded Morocco’s “tangible efforts” towards peace and stability in the region and in the continent in general. For the supportive countries, Morocco has made “serious” and “credible” steps to maintain security and peace in the disputed territory. Referring to Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. Representatives from Guinea and Burundi pointed towards the “serious” steps Morocco has taken since its put together its plan in 2007. “The Moroccan initiative is a compromise-based solution,” said Guinea’s Fatoumata Kaba, hinting at Morocco’s proposal compatibility with the UN directives. In all of its recent resolutions on Western Sahara, the UN Security Council has repeatedly called for a spirit of “compromise” and “pragmatism.” According to Kaba, Morocco’s proposal, as well as its recent actions and policies in the Dakhla and Laayoune regions, perfectly embody the UN’s call for a compromise-based dialogue. “Morocco’s initiative is in accord with international law, the UN Charter, and all UNSC resolutions,” stressed the Guinean official. Albert Shingiro, who represented the Republic of Burundi, agreed with his Guinean counterpart. In his allocution, the East African official spoke warmly of Morocco’s stabilizing role in the Sahelo-Saharan region, in addition to its increasing efforts to secure peace and stability at the continental level. The 2007 Autonomy Proposal, he argued, is part of “Morocco’s serious and credible efforts” to broker a lasting, politically negotiated resolution to the longstanding political stalemate in the territorial dispute. Adding a note of hope, Shingito praised the ongoing UN-led dialogue. He said that the latest developments in the conflict, especially the fact that the four parties–Polisario, Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania–are back to the negotiating table  is an “encouraging sign” The chorus of support from Burundi and Guinea comes as Morocco continues to score diplomatic points in Africa and beyond. While the country’s return to the African Union has perceptibly strengthened its African diplomacy and given it more credibility on continental affairs, countries outside of the continent are increasingly joining the pro-Morocco crowd. In most international discussions in recent months, Morocco’s plan is seen as the safest route to secure stability in the fragile Saharan region. Just last week, a number of international security experts, also speaking before the UN 4th Committee, highlighted Polisario’s terrorist links, arguing that separatism would breed more instability and security in the region, especially in the Sahelo-Saharan corridor where a number of terrorist groups have gained considerable ground in recent years.

Raat – The Moroccan Observatory for Anti-Normalization with Israel has strongly condemned the participation of former Israeli Minister of Interior Meir Sheetrit at the 12th annual World Policy Conference (WCP) in Marrakech, held on October 12-14. The observatory issued a statement on Tuesday, October 15, saying “ a new zionist penetration in Marrakech with the participation of terrorist Meir Sheetrit, the former Minister of the Interior and Zionist at an international seminar.” The observatory complained that “Zionists started considering Morocco as a paradise of normalization.” The statement criticized the government of Morocco for the “intentional confusion between Moroccans” and “the Moroccan diaspora in Israel.” The statement added that Sheetrit is “one of them [one of the Moroccan diaspora in Israel] since he was  born in the region of Errachidia mid-last century.” Several Moroccan movements, including the anti-normalization observatory, have been active in condemning any move to normalize ties with Israel. Morocco’s government has long repeated its “constant” position, denying any change in relations with Israel. Moroccans heavily criticized the visit of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser this summer.  The visit raised concerns among critics, suggesting that Kushner’s visit aimed to seek support for the US-led Middle East Peace Plan. Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, however, denied that Kushner’s visit touched on the Deal fo Century. He said that the visit concerned other topics, including means to strengthen the US-Morocco diplomatic ties. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani reiterated Morocco’s position regarding Palestine last month. He said that Morocco and King Mohammed VI  have stated their “clear position that all attempts to undermine the status of Jerusalem are unacceptable.”  In letters and statements from King Mohammed VI Morocco has officially “expressed rejection for the deal of the century once for all,” El Othmani added. The Moroccan government and King Mohammed VI have always expressed their full support for the Palestinian cause.   The Palestinian Authority categorically rejected the US-led initiative.  Moroccan movements, especially the anti-normalization observatory, called for protests against the “Deal of the Century.” Thousands of Moroccans rallied in Rabat in June to denounce US policy in Palestine. The protesters condemned the “maneuvers aimed at the Palestinian cause to liquidate the rights of the people; including hostilities in Al6Quds and the Goland and the rest of the occupied territories.” Morocco under the leadership of the  King also was among the first countries to warn the US and the United Nations after US President Donald Trump decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Rabat  – The National Office of Railways  (ONCF) has announced that traffic on the Marrakech-Casablanca route will be restored on Wednesday at noon. The statement comes after an ONCF train came off the rails on Tuesday, October 15, at noon, drawing criticism and fear among Moroccans. Photos show four cars of the AL ATLAS train N ° 610, connecting Marrakech to Casablanca, off the rails. No injuries were reported during the incident. ONCF said that the work to restore traffic on the Marrakech-Casablanca route lasted all night and will  “continue until 12:00 p.m.” The ONCF recalled that they have deployed all human resources in an effort to restore the train service. The company said that bus services “have been set up since Tuesday to ensure” that its passengers arrive at their destinations, including Casablanca, El Jadida, Settat, and Marrakech.  The company asked its customers to contact the customer center on 2255 to find out about changes to the train schedule. “We apologize again for the inconvenience,” the ONCF wrote. The accident is the third of its kind since 2018, drawing strong criticism from passengers and citizens. The accident drew flashbacks to a tragic incident, which took place in Bouknadel when a train connecting between  Casablanca and Kenitra. Last year in October, a train derailed killing seven people, while more than 125 people were injured. The accident caused uproar and mourning among Moroccans. ONCF claimed that the accident was due to high speed in a place that drivers should reduce speed. The train driver was sentenced to five months in prison. A second incident took place in January 2019 when another ONCF train came off the tracks in Casablanca in January. No passengers were on board.

 Rabat – A North African-American company launched new mobile application “Yassir,” for taxi reservations at night in Casablanca on Tuesday, October 15. The launch took place at a presentation given by the app’s creators. The application allows its users to order a taxi in the same way as ridesharing service Uber. The difference, however, is that “Yassir” works with actual taxis rather than independent drivers. The users can input the address of their destination, as well as their current location. The application then puts them in contact with an available taxi driver who is already nearby. After the ride, both the driver and the passenger can rate each other. Lilkoum Dima Yassir Yassir s’agrandit ! RDV ce soir et tous les soirs à venir 😉
Commandez votre taxi de 20h du soir à 07h du matin sur Casablanca ! Téléchargez l’application et commandez votre Yassir ce soir !
Android: http://bit.ly/YassirGooglePlay
IOS: http://bit.ly/YassirAppStore
Lilkoum Dima Yassir Posted by Yassir Maroc on Saturday, 5 October 2019 At the moment, the service is only available between 8 pm and 7 am, a period when it is difficult for travelers to find a taxi, and for drivers to find passengers. “We conducted a study to understand the difficulties that both passengers and drivers face. We found out that passengers cannot find a taxi and drivers cannot find customers at night. Our services will satisfy both sides,” said the general director of “Yassir” in Morocco, Rachid Moulay El Ghazi. As the app offers an upgraded service from traditional taxis, the prices are also higher than the normal taxi fares. The company’s general director emphasized the agreement between the app creators and taxi drivers, to avoid the problems that arose in the past between taxi drivers and other independent drivers. In February 2018, American ridesharing services company Uber decided to shut down its services in Morocco, three years after they launched it. The shutdown came after taximen in Casablanca staged protests against what they called the “unfair competition” from Uber. Last summer, “Yassir” signed an agreement with the Democratic Syndicate of Transports that allows taxi drivers to work with the application. The agreement, however, included a number of requirements for the drivers before registering with “Yassir.” The drivers willing to work for the company need to be the owners of their cars. They must also undertake regular training, especially in conflict management. Additionally, taxis must be less than five years old and properly maintained. The company aims to widen their presence  in Morocco. “Yassir” will offer more services in the future, such as food delivery. They also intend to expand their services to be available in more Moroccan cities. “Yassir” was created in 2007 in Algeria. It currently operates in the three North African countries of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco.

Frankfurt – The High Commission for Planning (HCP) in Morocco has launched an interactive tool on its website called “How Are Moroccans Organizing Their Time?” Users can compare how they spend their time with other groups of Moroccans based on age and sex. Using data from two studies of Moroccans aged 15 and up in 2012, the interactive website shows how much time Moroccans spend on leisure, work, domestic work, and physiological needs. After first asking users their sex and age, the website asks questions like “How many hours do you normally sleep in a day?” If your answer is fewer than eight hours, you are in the minority; 60% of Moroccans sleep eight or more hours per day. Men are less likely to sleep eight or more hours, and fewer than half of men aged 35-60 get a full eight hours. Interestingly, men are more likely to spend over an hour on “personal care” than women, although the margin is small: 25% of men and 22% of women. Seven-thirty a.m., 1 p.m., and 9 p.m. are the times of day most frequently given to eating.  Between mealtimes, men are more likely than women to be working full time and less likely than women to be doing domestic work. Only 35% of working women spend 6 or more hours on work daily. Working women, however, spend on average just under 4 hours doing domestic work each day. The statistics for men showed a different story; 60% of men said they do not do domestic work like cooking, housework, and shopping. However, only 5% of women said the same.  Men also spend less time on domestic work: 80% of men spend less than one hour, 18% spend 1-5 hours, and 2% spend more than 5 hours. In contrast only 13% of women spend less than one hour on housework, 45% spend 1-5 hours, and 43% spend more than 5 hours. The most common leisure activity Moroccans engage in is watching television. The average person spends 2 hours and 39 minutes in front of the screen daily. Other than in the categories of television and conversation, men spent more time than women on leisure activities: sitting at cafes, reading, sports, napping, civic life, shopping, and religion. HCP drew its information from a “Household Time Use Survey” and “Employment Survey” in 2012.

Rabat – French newspaper Le Monde will publish, October 16, an open letter to the president of the French Republic, Emmanuel Macron, calling for an end to Islamophobia. Ninety French public figures have called on Macron to condemn verbal attacks on Muslims after members of a French political party publicly insulted a Muslim woman. On October 11, France’s National Rally members called on the president of the regional council, Marie Guite Dufay, to ask a woman accompanying her son in a school activity to leave a meeting at the Regional Council of Burgundy-Franche-Comte because she was wearing a veil or hijab. Photos circulating online show the woman’s son in tears after seeing his mother subjected to insults in front of his peers. The request, which came from the leader of RN Julien Odoul stirred controversy in France, drawing criticism. “It’s the republic, it’s secularity. It’s the law of the Republic, no ostentatious [religious] symbols.” Said Odoul, exploiting France’s secularity to promote his own agenda.  “We cannot start the session with a minute of silence for the victims of the police headquarters and accept that [the hijab],” he added, explicitly linking the mother in a veil to the recent attack in the Paris police headquarters which left four police officers dead.  The collective statement to denounce hatred against Muslims in France comes as a direct response to the RN incident, among other public displays of religious hatred. “How long will we keep tolerating hatred against Muslims,” the French public figures asked, calling for an end to the growing tolerance of hate speech among French politicians and journalists. Cited by Le Monde, the condemnatory message emphasized that such actions constitute “incredible violence and hatred for all those children.” “By our cowardice, by our renunciations, we have contributed little by little to letting [these behaviors] pass, and accepting them.” The list of public figures who have condemned the RN’s move includes French actor Omar Sy, Sociologist Christine Delphy, and Ce French screenwriter Celine Sciamma. Le Monde’s decision to publish the statement calling for an end to islamophobia comes after the deputy editor of France’s Le Figaro publicly stated that he “hates the Muslim religion,” and that he believes it is his “right” to make openly criticize a religion on national television Islamophobic attacks in France increased by 52%  in 2018 compared with 2017, according to the Organization against Islamophobia in France (CCIF).

Rabat – Deputy editor of French newspaper Le Figaro Yves Threard is at the center of controversy after making statements against Muslims and Islam. During debate show  “Le Grand Soir” (the Big Evening) broadcast on LCI on Monday, October 14, the deputy director of the newspaper’s editorial board said that he “hates Islam.” “I hate the Muslim religion,” he openly said during a debate over the wearing of the veil or hijab in public space. The TV show discussed the question of a ban on hijabs in public places following a controversial statement from Julien Odoul, a member of France’s National Rally (RN) last week on October 11. Odoul and his colleagues asked the president of the Regional Council in France, Marie Guite Dufay, to tell a veiled Muslim woman accompanying her son at a school activity to remove hijab or leave. Odoul’s statement came in response to the murder of four policemen by a colleague who French police “believed had been radicalized.” Dufay said that she could not intervene as there was no reason for the woman to leave. She described the party’s behavior as a “surge of hatred” and “unworthy of elected officials of the republic.” Threard displayed staunch support for the RN’s move, stating that he is totally against the hijab in public spaces. He said that he had to leave a bus once when he saw someone wearing the veil. The deputy director of the editorial board went so far to  say that Islamophobia “does not exist,” emphasizing that everyone has the “right to hate religion.” Several French public figures condemned Threard’s statement, including journalist Samuel Gontier. Yesterday, Monday, October 14, Grontier said, “ Thank you for the idea. From now on, I will wear a veil to take the bus to avoid any meeting with Yves Threard.” More than 1,000 people retweeted his post in reaction to Threard’s statement. Jennifer Pademi, another journalist in France said, “This month of October is particularly violent, I feel that everyone is freewheeling. When will it stop,”. She added, “Imagine you’re a Mulsim and you work at Figar* and you discover that?” The Organization against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) announced that Islamophobic attacks increased by 52%  in 2018 compared with 2017.

Rabat – Amid anti-radicalization debates in France, a university in the Paris region has provided its employees with a list of what it considers signs of radicalization. In an email to its staff on Monday, October 14, the University of Cergy-Pontoise urged employees to “signal events that may have serious consequences,” referring to behavior and physical appearance considered to hide signals of Islamist radicalization. The email, in accordance with the recent call by France’s Emmanuel Macron to be “collectively vigilant against the Islamist Hydra,” listed a typically Muslim attire and Islamic ethical recommendations as potential signs of radicalization. In the email, the university requested that its staff report fellow employees or students whose behavior they deem suspicious.  According to the list, sent to professors in the form of an Excel file, growing a beard, wearing short trousers, or a jellaba should all be considered as suspicious signals of radicalization. Also cited is a person’s “sudden change of conviction” or “heightened interest in international affairs.”  The “sudden change of conviction” mostly has to do, according to the list, with a perceived refusal to defer to “women’s authority” in professional settings or the “non-consumption of alcohol.”  As far as the “warning” list is concerned, anyone who stops consuming alcohol, starts exhibiting religious or creationist tendencies in their behavior or during conversations, declines handshakes, “suddenly stops consuming pork,” or even starts showing interest in “discussing the role of women’s ” in society is considered suspicious. The document echoes a recent call from the French ministry of interior, which, in the aftermath of the murder of four police officers by a fellow, radicalized officer, called on French society to collectively tackle the country’s Islamist radicalization issue. The French government called on the entire country to be “vigilant” against the “invisible signs of radicalization,” invoking long beards and “a regular and ostentatious practice of prayer” as potential radicalization signs.   When asked to comment on the move from the University of Cergy-Pontoise, however, a spokesperson from the French Ministry of Higher Education denied any links with the government’s call, saying that the university’s email was “not reflective of government’s directives.” Likewise, in a subsequent message on Twitter, the university apologized for the “inconvenience,” tweeting that the move was “in no way a warning system.” Rather, argued the tweet, the university’s action was simply designed to help “the people who may be affected by these phenomena.”  For his part, Francois Germinet, the president of the university, stopped short of conceding that the move was discriminatory or particularly offensive to the university’s Muslim community.  He merely told France’s Liberation newspaper that the email’s list “had no sense. Therefore, the message has simply and purely been removed.” The controversy comes as France grapples with the resurgence of Islamist radicalization in the wake of the murder of the police officers. Since then, there have been rampant, repeated calls in France’s conservative circles condemning France’s supposed “cultural surrender” to Islam and Muslims.

Rabat – Members of the Moroccan Royal Navy rescued 329 irregular migrants from October 10-13 in the Mediterranean. The migrants were mostly from sub-Saharan nations. They were aboard small boats, a military source quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has said. The list of migrants included 49 women and several children. Authorities provided first aid to the migrants, who were brought back safe and sound to several ports across Morocco in Tangier, Al Hcoeima, Nador, and Ksar Sghir, northern Morocco. Morocco, due to its proximity to Europe, has been facing the pressure of irregular migration. As part of Morocco’s strategy to combat irregular migration, national police arrested four suspects for alleged links to criminal networks active in undocumented migration. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the three suspects were subject to a search warrant for their alleged involvement in the organization of undomecumted migration. During the operation, police seized knives, two cars, a dose of cocaine, mobile phones, as well as a significant sum of money in cash. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation to determine the circumstances of the case. While some of the risky irregular migration operations manage to cross the sea, others fail resulting in serious casualties. Last month, security services found the bodies of 18 migrants on the beach of Ain Harrouda, near Casablanca. The migrants had attempted to cross to Europe on inflatable boats. Former spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi said in August that security services aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019.

The incident killed seven people and injured as many as 125 people. In January 2019, another ONCF train also came off the tracks in Casablanca, damaging most of its compartments. No passengers were on board, the ONCF said. A video documenting the accident shows the smashed and overturned compartments of the trail which was derailed in the morning of January 4.

Rabat – With six participating films and four awards, Moroccan cinema had a successful year at the 2019 Alexandria Mediterranean Film Festival. The festival ran from October 8 to 13 at the Sayed Darwish Theater in Alexandria, Egypt.  The Moroccan film with the most awards is “Nomades,” directed by Olivier Coussemacq. Although Coussemacq is a French director, “Nomades” entered the competition as a Moroccan film as it was shot in Morocco, uses Darija, the Moroccan dialect of Arabic, and features Moroccan actors and actresses.  Coussemacq’s experience growing up in Morocco inspired the story.  The jury for the feature film category included Moroccan actor Mohamed Miftah. Coussemacq won awards for best feature film and best director, while Moroccan actress Jalila Talemsi won best actress for her role in the film. Talemsi won the same prize at the Alexandria festival in 2012.  Moroccan director Mohammed Rida Gueznai won the first prize award in the documentary category for his short film “Le vieil homme et la montagne” (the old man and the mountain).  Gueznai’s short film also won the “Adobe Best of the Best” award at the Zayed University Middle East Film Festival in April 2019.  The feature film “Ultimate Revolt” by Moroccan director Jilali Ferhati won the Special Jury Prize. Moroccan actress Fatima Kheir attended the festival as part of the jury panel.  Ferhati, born near Khemisset in 1948, has won a multitude of prizes at various film festivals throughout his career in cinema. The 17th Marrakech International Film Festival paid a special tribute to Ferhati in 2018.    Ferhati is known for his films Chateh Al Aftal Ad-daine (1991), Memory in Detention (2004), and From Dawn (2010).  Two additional Moroccan films participated in the festival: “l’Ombre d’un mur” by Aissaoui Abdelhafid and “Assia” by Malika Zairi. The two films were not among Moroccan prize-winners.

Frankfurt – The coach of Morocco’s national football team, Vahid Halilhodzic, plans to restructure the team and is considering enlisting more local Moroccan players. Halilhodzic made the comments at a press conference in Tangier on Monday, October 14, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), before Tuesday’s friendly against Gabon. “I do not know enough the level and skills of local players,” admitted Halilhodzic, who has only been coaching the Atlas Lions since August. The coach has called up 40 players for evaluation. If they prove to be capable football players, they may earn a spot in the national team. Halilhodzic also repeated his line that the Atlas Lions are “in the process of major reconstruction.” Moroccan fans were disappointed with the team’s performance at the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019 in Egypt in June. Halilhodzic hopes to improve the team’s prospects in the upcoming CAN 2021 qualifiers with restructuring. In the meantime, ahead of Tuesday’s friendly match against Gabon, Halilhodzic tried to set expectations low. While he said the team is “rebuilding some things,” he noted, “We should not expect a good result … or a good game on the field.” The coach explained that many of Morocco’s best players are off duty due to injury, are aging out of the game, or cannot play some games with the national team because their clubs do not want them to.  The captain of the Atlas Lions, Mehdi Benatia, retired from playing with the Moroccan team earlier this month. Benatia had played with the Lions for more than a decade. Lately, the Atlas Lions have been playing in a series of friendly games. Morocco drew against Burkina Faso (1-1), won against Niger (1-0), and drew against Libya (1-1). After Friday’s game against Libya, Halilhodzic said he was disappointed with the team’s performance. Many of Morocco’s starting eleven are famously dual citizens. Many were born to Moroccan parents in European countries, and when it came time to choose which country they would play for in international football, chose Morocco, even though most play professionally in European leagues. In Morocco’s latest game, Libya’s sole goal came from Sanad El Ouarfali, who plays for Morocco’s own Raja Athletic Club (RCA) in Casablanca.  Only three of the 26 players Halilhodzic picked to play as starters or substitutes in the Libya and Gabon friendlies play for Moroccan clubs. With Halilhodzic’s evaluations of 40 new players and restructuring, the composition of the Atlas Lions may change in the run up to the next CAN and World Cup. Morocco will begin playing the qualifying games for CAN 2021 in November. The Atlas Lions are in CAN’s Group 5 and will play against Mauritania, Central African Republic, and Burundi.

Rabat – Security services rescued 67 men and boys from an “Islamic school” in Daura, in northern Nigeria. The police freed the students aged between seven and 40 from the school. The students had been “tortured and abused,” reported the BBC. The boys and men were chained while undergoing “inhuman and degrading treatment,” the police said. Police arrested two teachers and the owner of the school. The school had 300 students on roll. However, the other students had managed to escape before police arrived, according to the BBC report. The incident is similar to an earlier rescue operation at a so-called “Islamic school” in Kaduna, northern Nigeria. Police freed, on September 26, more than 300 students during the operation. One of the young men abused at the  previously raided “Islamic school” has described the experience he and his companions lived as “hellfire.” Isa Ibrahim, told the BBC, “If you are praying they will beat you. If you are studying they will beat you.” He said that his family sent him to the place to correct his behavior. President Muhammadu Buhari said earlier in 2019 that his government planned to ban the schools. He added, however, that the government would not do so immediately.

The Arab Muay Thai Championship is a yearly competition organized by the United Arab Muay Thai and Kickboxing Federation. More than 120 athletes from 16 countries took part in this year’s event, which took place from October 10 to October 13.

Rabat – Moroccan police and customs collaborated to foil an attempt to smuggle 5 tons and 996 kilograms of cannabis resin in the Guerguerat crossing point, south of Dakhla, Morocco on Monday, October 14. Border control operations in the region enabled the arrest of a truck driver along with two accomplices, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said. During the operation, Police and customs seized almost six tons of cannabis resin carefully concealed onboard an international transport truck bound for another African country. Police put the suspects into custody and opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the case. Police are also investigating possible links with local and international criminal networks. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to fight the international trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances.   Throughout the year, Morocco intensified its security operations against drug trafficking. This is not the first time when police have confiscated cannabis in the region. Back in April, Moroccan police, in coordination with customs officers in Guerguerat at the Mauritanian border, seized 11 tons and 940 kilograms of cannabis on a truck bound for “an African country.” Police also seized two tons of cannabis resin on September 17 in northern Morocco and a further two tons of cannabis in Laayoune, southern Morocco on September 17. Moroccan customs said in a report in May that they seized 19.2 tons of cannabis resin in 2018. The national police announced in September that security services seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15. The wali (governor) of the judicial police, Mohamed Dkhissi, has said that police security services arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking.

Frankfurt – King Mohammed VI has sent a message of warm congratulations to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on his winning the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. “I am confident this international tribute will strengthen your resolve to press ahead with your praiseworthy efforts to promote the universal values of coexistence, tolerance and brotherhood,” the King wrote, as quoted by state-owned media Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The King also noted his appreciation of Morocco’s “close brotherly African bonds and fruitful cooperation” with Ethiopia. Abiy Ahmed, who has been prime minister of Ethiopia since April 2018, won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, October 11, for his efforts in brokering peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The two countries fought a border war between 1998 and 2000, but the conflict ended in stalemate. The prime minister’s early move to visit Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Afwerki’s return visit to Ethiopia helped to begin a process toward peace and the reopening of trade and transportation links between the two countries. The Norwegian Nobel Committee also honored “all the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions.” Just months after Abiy Ahmed became prime minister, he signed declarations of peace with Afwerki to end the status of “no peace, no war” between the countries. The Nobel committee noted that one breakthrough for the agreement to happen was Abiy Ahmed accepting the border line of a 2002 independent commission. Within Ethiopia, Ahmed relieved some of the pressure stifling civil society and released thousands of political prisoners.  Beyond Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed also worked for peace in South Sudan and Sudan and mediated between Somalia and Kenya and between Eritrea and Djibouti. In the last 20 years, six other Africans have won the Nobel Peace Prize: Ghana’s Kofi Annan (2001), Kenya’s Wangari Maathai (2004), Egypt’s Mohamed El Baradei (2005), Liberia’s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee (2011), and the DRC’s Denis Mukwege (2018).

Rabat – The horror film “Achoura,” directed by Talal Selhami, won the Special Jury Prize of the Sitges Fantastic Film Festival. The festival ran from October 3 to 13 in Sitges, Spain.  The festival’s jury presents the award to a film of notable artistic quality and production.  The French-Moroccan director worked with Moroccan producer Lamia Chraibi to create the horror film. Moroccan actors Omar Lotfi and Younes Bouab star in Achoura alongside Sofia Manousha, Ivan Gonzalez, Mohamed Choubi, and Moussa Masskri. The horror film explores Moroccan urban legends, which have remained relatively untouched by contemporary cinema.  The film begins with four children in the Moroccan countryside entering a decrepit, protectorate-era house during the celebration of Achoura, a Moroccan holiday that commemorates the dead.  According to an urban legend, the house is home to a djinn, or ghost, named “Boughatate” that feeds on innocent children. Consequently, one of the four children mysteriously disappears while playing in the house. 25 years later, the missing child reappears—just as several children are kidnapped, signaling the return of Boughatate. The four friends, now adults, face the child-eating creature together.  Selhami’s six-year career Shot in 2015 around Casablanca, Achoura premiered at the Paris International Fantastic Film Festival in December 2018 after three years of delays. The production team pushed back the release date in order to finalize the film’s special effects.  Selhami was committed to meeting international standards, and his dedication certainly paid off.  The film met success at the Tangier National Film Festival where it won the award for best production, and at the Film Festival of Marrakech.  Achoura also won the grand prize at the Hard Line Festival in Germany in October 2018 and competed at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival in April 2019. Selhami was born in Paris in 1982 and launched his career in 2003 with the short film “Patient X.” He then went on to direct five additional short films.  In 2010, Selhami entered the world of cinema with “Mirages.” He has since directed a total of five feature films and one documentary.  Achoura is expected to arrive at Moroccan cinemas in the near future.

Rabat – The National Rally of Independents (RNI) political party held an assembly for Moroccans living outside Morocco yesterday, October 13, in Frankfurt, Germany. A number of  party members  living in Europe attended the event, along with the party’s leaders.  Party president Aziz Akhannouch and former minister of justice Mohamed Aujjar topped the list of attendees . During his speech, Aujjar praised RNI and its members for their competencies. He also promised that his party, if elected, “will create miracles and surprises in 2021, under Akhannouch’s leadership.” “By then, we will be able to produce cars and planes in Morocco. We will make real miracles happen for a bright future,” added the senior member of RNI. Aujjar also stated that his party “aims to serve the country and its citizens, unlike others who exploit institutions to settle scores and share the spoils.” The RNI politician’s comments met backlash on social media, with many users criticizing Aujjar for his apparent ignorance of Morocco’s thriving automotive industry. The statements come one day after Morocco’s Head of Government, Saadeddine El Othmani, implicitly attacked the RNI. During an assembly of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) on Saturday, October 12, El Othmani criticized the “unkept promises” of the RNI. Talking about the 34-year-old new minister of labor and PJD member, Mohamed Amakraz, El Othmani said: “PJD always creates surprises. There are people who promised to give youth a position in the government, but they didn’t. As for us, we didn’t say anything, but we gave a chance to our youth.” The Head of Government’s comments were targeted towards RNI, whose leader, Akhannouch, promised to give the youth high-profile positions in the government. During RNI’s assembly, Akhannouch also answered El Othmani’s statements. RNI’s president and the minister of fisheries and agriculture started his speech by justifying the “broken promises.” “I told the youth that they would be part of the 2021’s government, and I am aware of what I said. I can’t put young people in big political positions directly, they need to be trained first to succeed in their missions,” said Akhannouch. The Moroccan minister also expressed his surprise at El Othmani’s statement, as it came only one day after King Mohammed VI’s speech. The King invited all political parties to avoid conflict and focus on the services they provide to the citizens. “[El Othmani’s statement] is a disturbance of King Mohammed VI’s speech, it’s illogical,” said Akhannouch. RNI and PJD are both part of the coalition that forms the Moroccan government. The exchange of jibes between the two party leaders comes less than a week after the government shuffle, and could evolve into more tension between the parties.

Rabat – The Jordanian Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Center has listed King Mohammed VI among the top 50 most influential Muslims. The ranking appeared in the center’s 2019 publication on 500 Most Influential Muslims. The publication features the top 50 influential Muslim personalities, and Morocco’s King Mohammed VI appears at number seven. In its profile on King Mohammed VI, the publication said that he “influences the network of Muslims following the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, and is a leading monarch in Africa.” The overview also emphasized that the King is often “lauded for his domestic reform policies and countering terrorism.” The report recalled that the monarch “tackles issues of poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion at home, and has improved foreign relations.”  The publication referred to King Mohammed VI’s repeated calls for a more advanced development model to meet the growing demands of citizens and curb social disparities. The center added that the King has a huge influence over Muslims in Africa. “King Mohammed VI leads the largest African monarchy, with a population of 32 million.” The report also mentioned Morocco’s momentous move to call for a conference to discuss “the rights of religious minorities in Islamic lands,” in 2016 in Marrakech. The conference convened world leaders. “The King invited hundreds of the Islamic world’s leading scholars to gather for a 3-day summit in Marrakesh in January 2016 to address the question of the treatment of religious minorities in Muslim-majority communities,” the report said.  The center’s overview of the King and Morocco mentioned that Morocco is “home to the oldest university in the world, Al Karaouine.” The report added that the university, located in Fez, is the center of the Maliki school of jurisprudence. In addition to King Mohammed VI, the 50 top influential Muslims includes General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi; King Salman of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and President Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.

Essaouira – I love cafes; I always have. My mother says that even as a toddler I was the first to suggest a cafe trip and to make judgements on the qualities of the place. There is a certain freedom and joy in sitting alone in a cafe with a book, reading a little, and watching the world go by.  A favorite Sunday activity of mine is to take a book and sit for an hour or so in a cafe in Essaouira medina (old city) and just be. Obviously now I have a child, there is a lot less reading involved, but my son, at 6 months, is already an avid people watcher.  However, there is difficulty in choosing the right cafe.  Despite being married to a Moroccan man and having lived here for nearly three years, my obvious status as a non-Moroccan makes finding the right cafe a challenge. Tourist cafes which are comfortable and more European in style often lack authentic Moroccan charm, whereas the true Moroccan cafes are not necessarily the right place either. When I have been to “authentic” Moroccan cafes, full of smoke emerging from behind newspapers held stiff in male hands, the response is always the same. Whether it stems from curiosity, disapproval, or consideration, there is always a moment of staring, an awkwardness with the waiter, and an uncomfortable silence across the space. Meanwhile, the tourist traps, such as Essaouira’s famous Italian cafe in the main square, have a very different ambience. I suppose, more comforting to a European eye, but in reality less friendly. Women and men of all ages and nationalities sit at tables scattered across the picturesque square. Italian gelato, milkshakes, and speciality coffees adorn the menu.  But, despite having been there regularly for nearly three years, the waitresses still treat me, or indeed ignore me, with the same haughty, icy politeness that marks interactions with all their non-Moroccan customers. I try to greet them, say “How are you?” to no avail.  I would not mind so much if when I went to this cafe with my mother-in-law, husband (who several of them went to school with), or one of his sisters, they received the same treatment. No, this cold reserve is reserved for foreigners.  However, between the tourist traps and the traditional Moroccan “nous-nous” (meaning half coffee-half milk) cafes filled with men and cigarette smoke, I have found a happy medium.  Cafe Tasnime Rabi, 31, runs a “nous-nous” cafe in Essaouira’s new town, known as Ghazoua. His dream is for the newly opened Cafe Tasnime to appeal to both the traditional older Moroccan customers who come to drink black coffee over a cigarette and chat with neighbors and the younger generation.  At this cafe, virgin cocktails and caramel lattes appear on the menu alongside the sugary black espresso. The balance between the modern and traditional is precarious, but it seems to work.  A middle aged man in flip-flops wanders over the zebra crossing, his grey tracksuit bottoms and disheveled hair betray the time of day. Eight a.m. He has just got up and is on his way to his local cafe for a “petit pain” (a pastry) and espresso.  As he sits down, a young woman leaves the cafe. Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt with her long black hair flowing down her back, the woman holds a vanilla latte in a take-away cup. She leaves the cafe, talking on the phone and slowly walking down the road in the direction of the university.  As I settle into my usual seat on the front porch, far from looking askance at a woman and a baby sitting down in a men-only zone, the elderly man wearing a white jellaba and reading the paper at the table opposite warmly greets us. “Salam alaikum,” he calls over, to giggles from the baby. At a neighboring table, the man in flip-flops looks over at the baby, smiles, and waves and then puts out his cigarette out of consideration, half-way through smoking it. This is, without doubt, among my favorite cafes in Essaouira. Although its view is of a zebra crossing over the Essaouira-Agadir road, I only had to go once to feel comfortable there. The grey walls and austere facade in no way reflect the warmth of the place. In front of the cafe is a small terrace space, protected from Essaouira’s wind. Upstairs is a spacious roof terrace, usually beset by groups of smoothie and coffee drinkers, Moroccan and tourists, chatting and escaping the cigarette smoke below. But, most importantly, both the cafe’s staff and its customers make one feel like a member of the “Cheers” cast, always polite, friendly, and natural, and always “glad you came.”  Cafe L’Horloge Close to Essaouira’s Bab Sebaa sits a little square within the medina’s ancient walls, and in the square, sits a cafe that time forgot.  Though this area of the medina is a tourist honey pot, the blue and white check clothed tables outside cafe l’Horloge often remain empty. Tourists survey the old-fashioned tables and the unclear menu with a critical eye, muttering to each other. Those who do take a chance on the old-world cafe whose menu, like its decor, appears to be frozen around 1975, are in for a treat. Run by two elderly brothers wearing brown woolen jumpers, knitted circa 1980, even in the height of summer, the cafe is an oasis of calm in the busy medina. My favorite table sits under a large tree which spreads over the tiny square, offering its shade to coffee drinkers.  The twisted roots of the ancient tree separate the cafe’s seating area from a sprawling carpet shop next door. The hand-woven Amazigh (Berber) carpets fill the space with color and charm. This is a perfect place to people watch; tourists, Moroccans, and expats all parade by perusing the wares of the neighboring shops and peering suspiciously at the gloomy interior of Cafe l’Horloge.  Inside the cafe, smoke fills the Moroccan salon while one of the two brothers watches a black and white television and an elderly woman fusses in the kitchen that can be seen through a hatch. Popping inside to use the cafe’s always clean toilet facilities is like catching a glimpse into the cross section of an old-fashioned Moroccan home.  While I freely admit that the cafe’s menu is nothing special, the atmosphere of calm and familiarity makes up for the limited choice of beverage. The cafe offers traditional Moroccan lunches as well as basic soft drinks and coffee.  Going to cafe l’Horloge is like visiting an elderly, kindly uncle—there is no fuss, no great performance, but a simple and genuine welcome, and a sense of continuity and stillness.  Essaouira brims with chic, modern cafe spaces, high quality restaurants, fast-food eateries, and Moroccan “nous-nous” cafes, and each of them has a unique ambience and feeling. As in any city in the world, it is up to us as visitors and residents to be adventurous and open, to search out the rough diamonds, authentic spaces, and, sometimes, a place to feel at home.

Rabat – Kais Saied won more than 70% of votes in the Tunisian presidential election, beating out his opponent Nabil Karoui by more than 40 points.  Saied is the second freely-elected president of Tunisia after Beji Caid Essebsi, who became president in 2014.  The retired law professor, nicknamed “Robocop” for his austere manner, has no political experience nor party affiliation. In contrast to his multimillionaire opponent, Saied had to borrow money to register as a candidate and barely campaigned at all.  Saied’s divergence from Tunisia’s political norm, however, is what made him so appealing to such a large majority of voters.  Saied is calling for constitutional reform and a complete overhaul of the country’s political system in favor of a decentralized democratic model. He promises to fight the flaws of the old system: corruption, clientelism, opacity, and nepotism.  Saied’s platform also prioritizes improving healthcare and education, uprooting poverty, combating the country’s rising consumer prices, and reducing unemployment.  In terms of foreign policy, the new president is a pan-Arabist and denounces any normalization with Israel.  His conservative social views include favoring the death penalty, criminalizing homosexuality, and opposing equal inheritance for men and women.  Saied earned the support of both far-left groups and Islamists, most notably the “Muslim democratic” Ennahda Party.  He is also very popular among Tunisian youth. The polling institute Sigma Council estimates that about 90% of 18- to 25-year-olds voted for Saied. The election’s voter turnout reached nearly 60%, according to the same source.  Robocop vs. Corleone Saied’s opponent, a wealthy businessman and TV station owner, campaigned from prison after being booked on suspicion of tax evasion and money laundering.  Nicknamed “Corleone” after the main protagonist in the 1972 film the Godfather, Karoui is suave, charismatic, and allegedly corrupt. The former presidential candidate earned millions from various business ventures such as Karoui &amp; Karoui World, a leading advertising company in the Maghreb, and the private Tunisian TV station “Nessma.”  In addition to running a poverty-fighting charity, Karoui also has a popular show in which he gives out domestic appliances to needy families. The liberal populist was nicknamed “Nabil Makrouna,” which translates to “Nabil Pasta” in the Tunisian dialect, after he handed out bags of pasta to the poor.  Tunisian authorities arrested Karoui in August after a three-year investigation. However, his supporters have denounced the charges as a conspiracy against his candidacy. Released just days ago, Karoui may attempt to challenge the election results.  A new era of Tunisian politics Saied is set to hold office for a five-year term, during which he will have control over the country’s defense, foreign policy, and national security.  His main challenge, however, will be reducing the 15.4% unemployment rate.  The election results come less than three months after former president Essebsi’s death on July 25, 2019.  Essebsi was the first democratically-elected president of Tunisia after the 2011 Arab Uprisings swept through the region.  Essebsi was a long-time player in Tunisian politics, having served under the post-independence leader Habib Bourguiba and the deposed president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Essebsi is credited with maintaining stability in Tunisia during his presidency. However, he faced criticism for being too authoritarian regarding matters of security. Some opponents accused him of seeking to restore Ben Ali’s rulership.  Saied’s victory demonstrates Tunisian voters’ unquestionable rejection of the ruling elite who have held power since the 2011 uprisings.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR) have announced their categorical rejection of any dialogue initiative with the Polisario Front. A military source said that the Moroccan army “have not and will never engage in a dialogue” with the separatist group. The source quoted by MAP added that some media outlets misinterpreted the report submitted by the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, to the Security Council on the Western Sahara conflict. The military source referred to some pro-Polisario news outlets, claiming that the Moroccan army and the Polisario Front have reached an alleged agreement on a “bilateral working and coordination mechanism.” In Paragraph 26 of the UN report, Guterres said that MINURSO “has taken steps to increase its engagement and dialogue with the parties [Polisario and Morocco].” The report added that the UN peacekeeping operation has “developed a draft bilateral working and coordination mechanism with each of the parties to provide a venue for dialogue to more proactively tackle potential violations before they become formalized, and to allow opportunities for the parties to articulate any technical perspective which might be at variance with the Mission’s determinations.” Morocco’s military emphasized their position on dialogue with the separatist group saying, “While reaffirming the invalidity of this interpretation, it should be pointed out that the Royal Armed Forces have and will never engage in a dialogue with the Polisario.” The military source agreed that the Moroccan military forces are working closely with MINURSO to ensure compliance with military agreement NO.1 and ceasefire agreements to better prevent any violation of them.” MAP said that the coordination mechanism mentioned in the UN report is a “mechanism between the Royal Armed Forces and MINURSO.”

Rabat – A Spanish court handed verdicts ranging between nine to 13 years in prison to nine separatists, who led the bid for Catalonia’s independence in 2017. Spain witnessed rising tensions in 2017 after Catalonia’s ousted president  Carles Puigdemont led an “independence” campaign. After Catalonia styled itself as an independent state, the Spanish government stripped the autonomous region of its self-proclaimed statehood, describing the region’s independence as illegal. Puigdemont, however, resisted Spain’s move, calling on his Catalan supporters to resist the decision. Puidgemont’s vice president Oriol Jungueras received a sentence of 13 years in prison. Jungueras became the main defendant in the case after Puigdemont fled Spain to Brussels to avoid prosecution. Jungueras was sentenced by the Spanish Supreme Court on charges of “sedition” and “misuse of public funds.”  The court also banned Jungueras from “holding public office for 13 years,” the Guardian reported. Former Catalan foreign minister Raul Romeva received a sentence of 12 years for the same offenses. Former regional government spokesman Jordi Turull and former labor minister Dolores Bassa also received a sentence of 12 years in prison. The former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell was sentenced to 11  and a half years in prison. Former Catalan interior minister Joaquim Form and former territorial minister Josepp Rull both received prison terms of 10 years and six months. Pro-independence activists Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez will serve nine-years behind bars.  Puidgemont, who is still on the run to avoid prosecution, criticized the court’s sentences. Puidgemont called for immediate action in response to the sentences. In a Twitter post, he called on his supporters to rise up in support of the jailed politicians.  “It is time to react … for the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia,” he said.

Rabat –  President of Rwanda Paul Kagame has expressed his ambition to collaborate with African leaders who contribute to the development of the continent. Having arrived in Morocco on October 12 to take part in the World Policy Conference (WPC), the Rwandan president said that Africa is “nobody’s prize to win or lose.” He added that it is the responsibility of Africans to contribute to the development of the continent to help it reach “its full potential.” The WPC  kicked off on Saturday, October 12, convening business leaders. During the summit, the attendees discussed the global economy and international relations among other topical points. Kagame said that “trade shapes a nation’s economy in powerful ways.” The Rwandan president took the Aid for Trade initiative as an example, emphasizing that it is a positive approach. The aid for trade initiative is led by the World Trade Organization (WTO).  It seeks to “encourages developing country governments and donors to recognize the role that trade can play in development.” Speaking about the concept behind the initiative Kagame said that this “should have been the approach all along.” The president extolled trade cooperation between Africa and other continents, stating that the African countries enjoy “strong trade relations around the globe, whether with Europe, India, North, America, and China.” Kagame emphasized that trade with “everybody” actually “leaves us all better off.” Kagame also recalled the African Continental Free Trade Area, which seeks to accelerate the “intra-African trade and boosting Africa’s trade position in the global market.” He said that the continental free trade is now “in force and trading will commence in July 2020.” “The revitalization of the African Union Peace Fund, which now stands at more than $125 million has enhanced the credibility of Africa’s security partnerships, and it should continue to grow,” he said. Kagame’s visit to Morocco is the first of its kind since June 2016 when he met with King Mohammed VI. The monarch also visited Rwanda in October 2016. The exchange of visits helped the two countries to establish diplomatic relations and reinforce their cooperation through several agreements. During the King’s visit, senior officials from Rabat and Kigali signed several bilateral agreements. Morocco and the Republic of Rwanda further reinforced their partnership through the signing of a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the poultry industry in Kigali,  on October 2.

Rabat – Morocco’s minister of fisheries and agriculture, Aziz Akhannouch, visited the National Apple Fair in Midelt, central Morocco, on Thursday, October 10. Footage documenting the minister’s visit shows him jokingly telling the governor of Midelt’s province, Mustapha Nouhi, that the prices of apples are “too low.”  In the video, the president of an apple production cooperative offers the minister an apple. After tasting the apple, Akhannouch asks if it was produced locally. The cooperative’s president confirms that the apple was produced in the region of Midelt. Impressed by the taste and quality of the apple, Akhannouch turns to Midelt’s governor, saying: “These apple prices are too low, it’s unbelievable! The prices should be higher.” Nouhi replies: “This product is also available in large quantities, you should taste other types.” The minister’s statement comes only a few days after the World Bank published a report about Morocco’s current socio-economic status. The report indicates that around 9 million Moroccans are living under the poverty line or at risk of poverty. Comments on the video considered the statement as “disrespectful towards Moroccans,” taking into consideration their already poor purchasing power. Following his visit to the event, the minister stated that apple production is a key sector in the region’s economy. He added that apple production reaches 400,000 tonnes annually. The production was estimated at only 120,000 tonnes before the launch of Morocco’s Green Plan in 2008. Morocco’s Green Plan is an agricultural strategy designed to make agriculture the main growth engine of the national economy. It aims to develop pluralistic agriculture that is open to foreign markets, locally diversified and sustainable. Midelt’s National Apple Fair took place between October 10 and 13, 2019. It is an annual event giving farmers and cooperatives from different regions of Morocco an opportunity to exhibit all their apple-related products. Midelt is known as the national capital of apples. Around 90% of Moroccan apples are produced in the Midelt region.

Rabat – Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita has stated that the Arab League’s condemnation statement made against Turkey in an emergency ministerial meeting on October 12 does not necessarily “reflect” Morocco’s position. The Arab League issued a statement to condemn Turkey’s military “Operation Peace Spring” in northern Syria. Turkey’s move drew criticism from the UK, several European states, and the Arab League states. For Turkey, the operation seeks to “secure its borders by eliminating terrorists there and ensuring the safe return of Syrian refugees and Syria’s territorial integrity,” reported the Anadolu Agency. The Arab league called on the United Nations to take action against Turkey. The statement condemned Turkey’s “attempts” to impose “ demographic changes” in Syria. The statement also called on Arab countries to take measures, including “economic, investment, and cultural measures to contest the Turkish aggression.” Al Jazeera reported that both Qatar and Somalia had reservations about the statement. Morocco also joined the two countries, with Bourita emphasizing that the statement of the Arab League does not reflect the North African country’s position. Bourita added that Morocco “did not voice reservations about the statement out of the kingdom’s keenness not to disrupt the general atmosphere of the meeting.” Libya rejected the statement. This is not the first time in recent weeks that Morocco’s foreign minister has affirmed the independence of Morocco’s foreign policy.  The Moroccan government stands by the principle of non-interference in other country’s domestic affairs. On Sunday, October 13, Morocco strongly condemned a statement on the Algerian protests from a former Moroccan official during a business symposium. Salaheddine Mezouar, the president of the General Confederation the Moroccan enterprise federation (CGEM) commented on the hirak movement in Algeria during the World Policy Conference (WCP) held in Marrakech, drawing strong criticism from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ministry described Mezouar’s statement as “irresponsible, awkward, and unthinking,” emphasizing that the country does not interfere in the domestic affairs of other states. Mezouar announced his immediate resignation in the wake of the ministry’s statement.

Rabat – Sima Sami Bahous, representative of Jordan at the United Nations, has reiterated her country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Bahous made clear Jordan’s position on Western Sahara at the 4th Commission of the UN General Assembly in New York. The Jordanian official stated that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, submitted to the UN in 2007, is a “serious and realistic mechanism that takes into account the specificities of the region, the territorial integrity and the full sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over its territory.” The diplomat added that her country welcomes the “positive engagement of the Kingdom in the search for a definitive political solution to the question of the Moroccan Sahara.” She added that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan remains “in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.” Bahous also lauded Morocco’s development projects in the southern provinces. The ongoing initiatives are aimed at improving Sahrawi populations’ living conditions. Several countries have reiterated their support for Morocco’s autonomy plan and its sovereignty over the southern provinces in Western Sahara during the UN symposium. Supportive countries include Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Morocco maintains strong diplomatic relations with Jordan, whose King Abdullah II visited Morocco in March.  During his visit, the Jordanian monarch met with King Mohammed VI to discuss topics of common interest. Both monarchs expressed a strong willingness to preserve and maintain strong diplomatic bonds.

Rabat – Jassim Sayar al-Maawda, representative of Qatar at the UN reaffirmed his country’s unwavering support for Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara on October 11 The Qatari diplomat reiterated his country’s call for a “final and consensual political solution to the Moroccan Sahara” conflict. Qatar also reaffirmed support for the UN-led political process to find an agreed upon and mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. The Gulf country maintains its position that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, submitted to the UN in 2007 by Morocco, is a pragmatic and just initiative which could end the regional conflict. In addition to Qatar, three other Gulf countries expressed unwavering support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. Saudi Arabia said during the fourth commission on October 7 that it rejects all infringements against Morocco’s territorial integrity. Saudi Arabia’s permanent representative to the UN Abdullah Al Mouallimi said that his country maintains that the Autonomy Plan is a “constructive alternative aimed at achieving a just and a realistic” political solution. The same statement was echoed by the UAE and Kuwait. The support of the four Gulf countries came a few weeks before the meeting of the Security Council. The council will convene its members on October 30 to vote on a new resolution to extend the mandate of the UN peacekeeping operation, MINURSO. The mandate of the MINURSO, which monitors the ceasefire agreement in Western Sahara, will expire on October 31.

Rabat – Gunmen attacked worshippers at the Grand Mosque in the northern village of Salmossi in Burkina Faso on Friday, October 11. The gunmen, who stormed the mosque, killed at least 16 people, while several others fled the scene. Al Jazeera reported on Sunday, October 13 that 13 people died on the spot. Three others died due to serious injuries. Burkina Faso has witnessed violent attacks from armed groups since 2015, including ISIS and Al Qaeda.  The BBC said that many locals fled to the Malian border after the attack. Quoting the UN, the news outlet added that more than 250,000 people in Burkina Faso have been forced to flee their homes over the past three months. The deadly attack against worshippers comes a few weeks after an ISIS attack against soldiers in August in the north eastern village of Koudougou. The attack killed 24 soldiers.

Rabat – Julien Odoul, a member of France’s National Rally (RN) is at the center of a controversy after asking a Muslim woman to remove her viel at a plenary meeting of the Regional Council of Burgundy-Franche-Comte on Friday, October 11. The Muslim woman was accompanying her son and his class on a school trip to explore the mission of the “democratic assembly.” 1/ C’est en humiliant les mères publiquement devant leurs enfants qu’on crée du communautarisme
2/ La loi de 1905 ne prévoit pas cela
3/ Le RN n’est pas qualifié pour parler « au nom des femmes qui se battent pour leurs droits partout »
Vous n’êtes nos alliés nulle part. https://t.co/oe0bopkJuh — 🇫🇷 MarleneSchiappa (@MarleneSchiappa) 12 octobre 2019  Odoul and his colleagues asked Marie Guite Dufay, the President of the Regional Council, to have the woman either remove her hijab or leave the meeting.   Dufay, however, replied that she can only intervene when someone exhibits disruptive or offensive behavior, reported Le Bien Public. “This is not the case. So there is no reason for this person to leave,” she said. She described the RN’s move as a “surge of hatred” and “unworthy of elected officials of the Republic.” The Muslim woman left the room with her son after the argument. Photos of the boy crying after the attack on his mother went viral on social media. Dufay said that she spoke with the Muslim woman to express support. Dufay plans to visit the boy’s school on Tuesday, October 15 to meet the children, their teachers, and companions. It was not enough for Odoul to attack the Muslim woman in the meeting. The elected official took to his Twitter to justify his action. The RN member, however, received strong condemnation from public figures and officials. “It is by humiliating mothers publicly in front of  their children that we create communitarianism,” said Marlene Schiappa, a French politician and Secretary of Equality between women and men. Sophie Montel, former member of the European Parliament, also denounced the RN’s action, emphasizing that it is “so disgusting” to attack a woman in front of children.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has strongly criticized Salaheddine Mezouar, president of Morocco’s General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM), after he commented on the political climate in Algeria.  Speaking at the 12th annual World Policy Conference (WCP), Mezouare expressed support for the hirak (protest)  movement in Algeria, emphasizing that such political protests “bring hope” to the region. Following the ousting of former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Algerians protesters are calling for a complete overhaul of the political system and the removal of the political elite from power.  The WCP opened in Marrakech on Saturday, October 12,  with the participation of world business leaders.  In response to CGEM president’s statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on Sunday, October 13. The statement said thatMezouar “thought it is necessary to comment on the internal situation in Algeria at an international conference held in Marrakech.” The ministry went on describe the CGEM president as “irresponsible” and having taken an“unthinking step.” “The CGEM cannot replace the government of his majesty the King in taking positions on international issues and in particular development in this neighboring country,” the statement said. The Ministry reiterated that the Moroccan position in this subject is “clear and constant.” Since the early phases of the popular movement in Algeria, Morocco has emphasized that its policies  stand by “the principle of non-interference” in Algeria’s protests and the countries’ domestic affairs. In March, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said  that the  Moroccan government will maintain its “non-interference” as regards the massive demonstrations in Algeria. Bourita said that Morocco will “neither meddle with the internal developments that Algeria witnesses nor comment on them.” Morocco’s policy counts on strengthening win-win diplomatic cooperation through respect for states’ sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs. Following the controversy, Mezouar, who also served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced his resignation as president of the CGEM. Mezouar had been the president of CGEM since May 2018, succeeding   Miriem Bensaleh, who held the office for six years.

Rabat –  This weekend marked World Mental Health Day. The annual event aims to raise awareness of mental health issues and mobilize efforts to provide support and treatment.  Danish ambassador of Morocco, Nikolaj Harris opened the doors of the Danish residency in Rabat to welcome the Moroccan Ministry of Health, doctors and several stakeholders on the 2019 mental health awareness day. In his opening speech to the attendees, Harris stressed the importance of mental health as an issue around which a lot of initiatives have to be mobilized. “Every 40 seconds a person commits suicide on account of mental health issues, making it an acute problem for all,” stated Harris. Combatting mental health issues requires companies to invest in medical development.  Founded over a hundred years ago in Copenhagen, Lundbeck focuses solely on developing medicines for brain diseases with a foothold in the MENA-region. “Over 700 million people suffer from depression globally, 50% of them do not receive their proper medication,” stated by Managing Director Henrik Agerbaek-Larsen. According to Agerbaek-Larsen, long term investments by companies are essential for developing brain medicines. “On average it takes ten years of research before a medicine is fit for mass production,” Agerbaek-Larsen underlines. Products of Lundbeck are registered in more than 100 countries and reach 50 million patients worldwide. But before patients receive their proper medication, as Agerbaek-Larsen concludes the presentation: “Increasing the awareness of mental health, is in many ways the first step to help a patient.”

Rabat – In Morocco you can pick up preserved lemons at any hanout or spice stall for a very low price, but in European countries there a bit harder to come by. If you’re craving the taste of Morocco you can preserve lemons at home in a kilner-jar and sample the flavors of North Africa at your leisure! In Moroccan cuisine preserved lemons are used in a large variety of fish and chicken dishes, as well as tagines. A particular favorite of mine is a chicken tagine with green olives, preserved lemons, and a pinch of saffron. For a lighter meal, you can use preserved lemons to flavor baked or steamed fish or even a basic tray bake with chicken thighs, potatoes, and some fresh ginger.  Today I’m going to show you how you can keep the taste of Morocco in your kitchen cupboard, it only takes 15 minutes This simple recipe only has a few, easy to find ingredients: 5 lemons (Mayer lemons are better) 5 to 6 teaspoon of coarse salt Juice from 2 more lemons 1 glass jar Now we’re ready tos tart: Wash the jar with soap and hot water and let it dry. Wash the lemons well and wipe them with a dry and clean dish towel. Make two incisions on the top of each lemon lengthwise downward shaped ‘X’ so that they open up but remain attached at the base. Open each lemon and pour in 1 teaspoon of salt. Put the lemons in the glass jar one by one. Add the lemon juice. Press the lemons as tightly as possible in the jar to get the juices flowing. Cover the jar tightly and let it in a dry and dark place. Every two or three days, open the jar and compress the lemons to release more juices.  The pickled lemons will be ready to use in a month, then you can keep them in the refrigerator for about 6 months. Before using the preserved lemons, remember to wash each lemon to remove the salt.  Serve with tagines and salads.

Rabat – As the earth’s climate challenges increase, many communities have started to suffer consequences, forced to leave their lands and homes for a better future. Climate change requires global collaboration to implement effective solutions to save the earth and the people it is already impacting.  It is an exacerbating factor for some extreme weather worldwide, making floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms, a rise in sea-level, and the extinction of some species more common at an unprecedentedly rapid and growing pace.  Alongside social, economic, and environmental factors, migration is also causally linked to climate change. Many reports have noted that migration is driven by environmental degradation, which is exacerbated by climate change. In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pointed out that “the greatest single impact of climate change might be human migration, with millions of people displaced by shoreline erosion, coastal flooding, and agricultural disruption.” The mass displacement of people can put a heavy burden on new host territories and requires a migration policy for refugees, including accommodation and integration programs. In 2016 the US Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated $1 billion to help communities adapt to climate change in 13 states. The grants included the first direct allocation of federal funding to move an entire community. Climate-related migration The International Organization for Migration (IOM) defines environmental migrants as “persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move within their country or abroad.” Climate change-related migration is sometimes referred to as climigration. The new term defines the mass relocation of people because of extreme weather conditions. There are few cases where climate change is the direct factor for migration, such as for island states. More broadly, climate change is recognized as an exacerbating factor that increases migration. Although it is hard to determine the exact number of environmental migrants globally, the IOM estimated that by 2050 between 25 million and 1 billion environmental migrants. Climate change exacerbates resource shortages which may prompt displacement. In Africa, 64% of the population depends on agriculture to earn their living. Due to the effects of climate change, the challenge of shortage of natural resources, causing agricultural disruption, has led many Africans to migrate into the north or internally, according to a report from the World Economic Forum. Mass displacement from rural to urban areas pressures governments to provide aid to the struggling agriculture-dependent population. In this sense, resource shortage may also act as a threat multiplier for conflict, making room for the rise of non-state armed groups. Conflict, in return, further drives displacement.  Understandably, climate change and migration are linked. As shifting climate patterns become more severe, the migration flow rises. World leaders seek to address the two issues jointly. If they do not, a new migration crisis may arise and become uncontrollable. Climate change resilience Climate change effects can be reduced in many ways, partially by implementing a resilience policy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change resilience as the “capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation.” Resilience is not reaction. Resilience entails proactively implementing adaptation and mitigation measures to reduce vulnerability to climate change.  UNHCR’s role in protecting climate refugees  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) plays a crucial role in raising awareness about climate change’s causal link to migration and urges the world to preserve the rights of refugees including climate refugees. Currently, there is no legally defined category for climate refugees. The 1951 Refugee Convention does not include environmental factors in criteria for asylum seeking. This means there are no legal protections in place for environmental displacement within this lexicon.  UN Security Council talks earlier this year mentioned climate migrants for the first time ever, though all members did not reach unanimity on the phenomenon. Addressing the effects of climate crisis, such as increased natural disasters, is possible. The UNHCR, Georgetown University, and other universities have established a partnership to develop relocation guidance to protect people from disasters and environmental change while preserving their human rights. The UNHCR remains committed to addressing climate refugees’ challenges and finding durable solutions to the adverse climate change impacts. It is also committed to providing technical support to parties in implementing the Paris Agreement, which came into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement requires all parties to try to limit increasing global temperatures to under 2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times and to and adapt to the effects of climate change. Natural resource depletion Climate-related resource shortages are evident in many cases of climate displacement in Morocco.  Declining agricultural production in Morocco’s Al Haouz Province, directly related to stressed water resources, has driven rural to urban migration from local farming communities. The Moroccan government has partnered with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to support farming cooperatives in the area. New agricultural techniques are improving production yields and involving more community segments in value creation.  “Before joining this cooperative, I had left the village. I was working in the city. But when the cooperative was being formed, I got a call from my friends, thank Allah. Since 2014 I have been back in my village,” explained Brahim Laaouina, who now works with the Agadir Igoudar cooperative. Resource management initiatives such as these cooperatives have shown success in curbing or reversing such migration flows. In the first 7 months of 2019, humanity consumed all of its yearly share of natural resources such as water, soil, and clean air. “Earth Overshoot Day” fell on July 29 this year—the earliest date ever, according to a report from the Global Footprint Network. The Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity’s level of consumption exceeds the number of natural resources the earth can regenerate.  Morocco impressively almost makes it to the end of the year before having its own overshoot day, estimated to be on December 16. Qatar, in comparison, exhausted all of its share of natural resources by February 11. Global Footprint Network pointed out that people are currently consuming 1.75 times faster than the earth can regenerate. People are now exploiting the natural resources of the next generations.  The overconsumption of natural resources will only exacerbate climate change and reduce capacity for resilience To combat the early depletion of natural resources, the Global Footprint Network launched a campaign called “#MoveTheDate,” proposing solutions to limit consumption to one year of natural resources annually.  It suggested that cutting by in half carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from burning fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming, the date could move 93 days later in the year. In Africa, Morocco and Gambia are the only countries currently meeting the CO2 emissions standards set in the Paris Climate Convention.

Rabat – Fez police arrested three suspected drug traffickers today, October 12, after an exchange of gunfire.  According to the Directorate General of National Security (DGSN), the suspects, aged between 25 and 47, initially resisted arrest and attempted to flee.  Police approached the suspects, who were in a car at the entrance to the city of Fez. One suspect, armed with a shotgun, fired four shots at the officers. The police were forced to use their weapons against the suspects and fired six bullets, wounding one suspect. The injured suspect has been hospitalized, while the other two are in police custody.   The three individuals were in possession of more than two tons of cannabis resin, 280 kilograms of narcotics, cocaine, MAD 8,390, cell phones, and foreign license plates.  ولاية أمن فاس..استعمال السلاح الوظيفي خلال تدخل لتوقيف ثلاثة مشتبه فيهم على متن سيارة خفيفة، وحجز طنين و280 كيلوغراما من مخدر الشيرا بحوزتهم. pic.twitter.com/ZCT6zpQdWL — DGSN MAROC (@DGSN_MAROC) October 12, 2019  Police are still investigating the criminals’ possible links to larger networks.

Rabat – Petitioners at the UN 4th Committee have highlighted what they call “dangerous links” between the Polisario Front and terrorist groups seeking to wreak havoc in the Sahelo-Saharan region, according to reports. Speaking about the longstanding stalemate in Western Sahara, a number of petitioners, international security experts were keen to suggest that security threats in the disputed Western Sahara territories are likely to increase should the separatist front get the territorial control it seeks. Irina Tsukerman, a New York-based human rights specialist and security analyst who has traveled to Western Sahara for field research, detailed a concerning picture of terrorist infiltration in Polisario ranks. “In December 2018, I interviewed several former Polisario prisoners and relatives of former inmates based in Dakhla. Through their accounts, I learned not only about the extreme abuses they had endured during their imprisonment, notably brutal torture, but also about the security problems associated with collusion between the Polisario and the main international terrorist organizations,” Tsukerman said. She also noted the existence of “tunnels dug in the Tindouf camps by an international terrorist group, in full view of all.” According to Tsukerman, the tunnels are often used to transport weapons and combatants who regularly travel to the Polisario-administered territories to train Polisario fighters. Other petitioners, echoing Tsukerman’s sticking points, mentioned the proliferation of a wide-range of “illicit activities” in the region. They mostly warned against the smuggling of arms and drugs. “Military organizations such as Hezbollah have established training camps in the Tindouf camps in southwest Algeria and are constantly seeking to recruit desperate and vulnerable youth from these camps for terrorist purposes, smuggling, and drug and human trafficking,” said Susan Ashcraft, a former special agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The news is set to come as a further blow to the Polisario Front’s campaign to win the support of the international community for its statehood aspirations in Western Sahara. In addition to the reports of the growing feeling among UN diplomats that Morocco’s autonomy proposal is the most viable option out of the decades-long deadlock in Western Sahara, Polisario’s stance has been weakened by the group’s perceived links with groups like Hezbollah, Boko Haram, and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, among others. Over the years, a number of security analysts have maintained that a Morocco-governed autonomous Western Sahara is the best bet against the region’s many security risks. In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner in May of last year, following Morocco’s diplomatic spat with Iran (Rabat was accusing the Islamic Republic of sponsoring Hezbollah’s presence in Western Sahara), Michael Rubbin called on the US and the international community to support Morocco’s Western Sahara agenda. Describing Polisario as the “prostitutes of global terrorism,” he concluded that supporting separatism in the disputed territory would be akin to leaving the entire region at the mercy of a coalition of terrorist groups.

The fourth installment of the Grand Prix of His Majesty King Mohammed VI of Tbourida will surely be a highlight of the event.  Tbourida, known as internationally as “Fantasia,” is a traditional Moroccan exhibition of horsemanship. The colorful display features a group of horse riders dressed in traditional attire riding in synchrony while firing guns. This Maghrebi custom exemplifies the strong relationship between man and horse.   The International Arab Thoroughbred Show, the International Beard Horse Championship, the Moroccan Arab Horse Breeders’ Cup, the Equi-play tour Finale, and the International Show Jumping Competition are other notable competitions within this major event. The show will also feature educational programs and conferences related to horses. Morocco has a rich legacy of equestrian traditions. The city of El Jadida has been closely connected to horsemanship for centuries, making it the perfect site for the annual horse show.  The show will run from October 15 to 20.

Rabat – Morocco is set to become the first African venue for a UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) event. German-Moroccan lightweight fighter Ottman Azaitar said earlier this week that he and his brother Abu, also a fighter, are working with a UFC team to make Morocco the venue of the company’s first African event. “We are working with Ali (Abdelaziz) to bring the UFC to Morocco,” Azaitar said on Tuesday. “UFC have to come to Africa, we showed that we are able to take over in the UFC, and now we want the UFC to come to Africa, and welcome in Morocco. We’re going to make it happen, it’s everything easy, and everything is set up there, just come. Let’s do it.” As more African fighters impress UFC audiences, a UFC fight in Africa is just a matter of time, MMA Junkie reported yesterday. While echoing that sentiment, Azaitar, visibly excited to feature in a UFC-sponsored fight in front of a crowd in his home country, suggested there is no point in waiting for months and years before Morocco gets the UFC nod. Morocco is ready and has all the infrastructure it takes to host a UFC event, he said. Azaitar explained: “I already had one fight in Morocco, MMA fight, we have everything. We have a good healthcare, we have good infrastructure, we have good flights, we have good hotels, we have good venues, we have everything already in Morocco. Some people don’t know what’s going on in Morocco but my brother Kamaru Usman and Henry Cejudo just came back from Morocco and they saw, and they can tell you.” The Moroccan’s remarks come a month after he graced UFC fans with one of the purest, most impressive knockout wins in the sport. Taking on Finland’s Teemu Packalen in on September 7 in Abu Dhabi, Azaitar delivered what has since been touted “the scariest knockouts in recent history.”

Rabat – Moroccan organizations and activists fighting for the rights of people with disabilities took to the streets of Rabat today, October 12. The demonstrations began this morning at 10 am in front of Bab El Had in the medina of Rabat. Today’s protests follow the anniversary of the tragic death of Saber El Haloui.  El Haloui, a visually impaired activist, fell from the rooftop of the Ministry of Families headquarters in Rabat during a sit-in on October 7, 2018. The National Association of People with Disabilities, the National Association of Unemployed People, and the National Association of Visually Impaired People are among the non-profit organizations present at today’s demonstration.  The groups are challenging the Moroccan government’s “fake promises” to promote the rights of people with disabilities, according to a statement given to MWN on Tuesday, October 8 by activist Hafid El Hanouni.  “We want the government to activate their plans to promote handicapped people’s rights. They keep giving us fake promises to improve Morocco’s image on the international level, but in reality, disabled people in Morocco are still living in a very difficult situation.” The activists are calling for ID cards for people with special needs, social grants, free transportation, employment opportunities, and special schooling facilities for children with intellectual disabilities.

Rabat – In a statement to Moroccan TV channel Arryadia, the coach of Morocco’s national football team, Vahid Halilhodzic, expressed his disappointment at his team’s performance during the friendly game against Libya. The game that took place yesterday, October 11, in Oujda ended in a 1-1 draw. Morocco took the lead in the 20th minute after defender Jaouad Yamiq, who plays for Italian club Genoa CFC, scored a goal. The Libyan squad equalized the score in the 42nd minute of the game, thanks to a goal from Sanad El Ouarfali. El Ouarfali currently plays for Morocco’s Raja Casablanca. 
 Halilhodzic did not hide his disappointment in his post-game interview, “There is a lot of work to do to rebuild the team.” “The game’s result is disappointing. We really wanted to win to please the fans who supported us here in Oujda. There are many things that should be improved,” said the coach. “We had a number of scoring opportunities, but we rush and panic… We could have won if Rachid Alioui transformed his last minute chance into a goal, but it is what it is,” added Halilhodzic. The Bosnian coach also praised the performance of the Libyan team, “They are a surprising team, with many technical qualities, especially in counter-attacks.” “We are trying to completely rebuild the team… We need time to get good results,” concluded Halilhodzic. The friendly game against Libya is part of the Atlas Lions preparations for the 2021 African Cup of Nations (CAN) qualifiers. Morocco will face Gabon in a second friendly game next Tuesday, October 15, in Tangier.

Rabat – The Moroccan Association for Intercontinental Road Transportation in Morocco (AMTRI-Maroc), the Moroccan Association for Transportation and Logistics (AMTL), and the National Federation for Multimodal Transportation (FNTM) have called all international road transportation professionals to go on a 48 hours strike, starting Monday, October 14, at midnight. The three organizations called for the strike during a press conference, on October 10.  At the press conference they discussed the difficulties facing professionals in the domains of transportation and logistics. The professionals are demanding a modification of the 1974 royal decree, placing responsibility on the drivers in cases where the vehicles contain illegal products. Drivers are calling for an urgent implementation of transport documents, describing precisely the contents of the cargo. They also request the application of the weight limitations. The organizations also demanded that the National Company for Transportation and Logistics (SNTL) pay their outstanding debts, outstanding since 2010, for the benefit of all transportation companies in Morocco. The presidents of the three organizations calling for the strike said that “the strike will cause undesirable losses for a number of parties.” They also invited the ministry of transportation and logistics “to engage in a serious dialogue with professionals of the domain.” The ministry reiterated their engagement in ensuring a productive dialogue with transportation professionals. However, the ministry expressed their shock from the timing of the strike, “which coincides with a sensitive conjuncture.” According to statistics presented during the press conference, intercontinental merchandise transportation through Tangier has an annual growth of 13%. The number of containers passing through the strait of Gibraltar went from 160,000 containers 10 years ago, to around 300,000 in 2018. The number is estimated to reach 500,000 by 2025.

Rabat – Customs officers in Ceuta’s crosspoint Bab Sebta seized on Thursday, October 10, 218 last-gen smartphones. A Moroccan living in Ceuta attempted to smuggle the smartphones to Morocco without declaring them to the Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII). Customs services estimated the value of the seized phones at MAD 1,046,250. The would-be smuggler tried hiding the phones in a special compartment under his car’s seats. In another operation on the same day, customs services at Bab Sebta, in collaboration with officers from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), arrested a Moroccan living in Spain who attempted to smuggle 34 kg of cannabis resin into Morocco. The suspect had hidden the drugs in the frame of the car he was driving. Moroccan authorities have doubled their efforts in recent years to stop  illegal drug and merchandise trafficking attempts. In 2018, the Moroccan government announced that the country has been implementing “a multi-dimensional national strategy to fight illegal drugs and is determined to  place civil society at the forefront of this national strategy.” Mustapha El Khalfi, former Spokesperson of the Moroccan government, said Moroccan authorities prosecuted 107,000 people in drug-related cases in 2017. El Khalfi added that Morocco’s geographical location as the gateway to Europe makes it a target for criminal networks.

Rabat – New studies reveal that Gulf of Aqaba coral reefs show resistance to climate change. The hard coral species may provide scientific insight to build reef resilience across the world’s oceans. The opportunity brings scientists from Israel and the Arab world together to address an environmental issue that transcends politics. The Royal Marine Conservation Society of Jordan (JREDS) released its first field guide to the Gulf of Aqaba’s hard corals in May. The guide reports detailed conditions of the world’s northernmost coral reefs, located in the narrow waters north of the Red Sea. The gulf, which is approximately 170 kilometers long and 15 kilometers wide, is a marine biodiversity hotspot. It attracts divers from around the world and provides valuable ecosystem services. The field guide reports 11 endemic species in the waters of Aqaba. Sixty-five percent of the 23 known endemic Red Sea coral species dwell in the Gulf of Aqaba. “Some of the reported species represent their first record in the northern Red Sea, which is a high value for Jordan indeed,” said Mohammad Tawaha, JREDS’ marine conservation programme manager. Coral reefs survived the dinosaurs’ extinction and multiple ice ages. In recent decades, about half of the world’s coral reefs have been lost. The remainder face vital threats such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, and predatory species.  Preserving reefs, the world’s most complex ecosystems, protects the valuable services they provide. Research shows that about 500 million people worldwide depend on coral reefs for their livelihoods, directly or indirectly. Global reefs’ economic benefits are approximately $30 billion annually. This includes fisheries, coastal protection, and tourism.  Reefs also regulate local climate, protect against extreme weather events, and absorb high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean.  Aqaba’s corals provide hope for reefs. The species show a unique resilience to climate change threats like rising ocean temperatures and acidification. Scientists recently studied these species under stressful conditions mimicking future climate change conditions, and the corals proved hardy. This gives hope that reseeding Aqaba’s corals can protect dying reefs in the Red Sea and potentially across the world.  “There are techniques—we can propagate corals,” Dr. Fuad Al-Horani, University of Jordan professor of coral biology and ecology, explained. “We can climatise them to conditions available to them in the other seas. So, once we grow them, we can send them abroad where they can grow them into deteriorated areas or damaged reef areas.” The discoveries spurred a landmark alliance. Scientists from contentious countries are coming together to protect reefs. Researchers from Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen will join forces on an environmental issue that transcends politics. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) will serve as a mediator to ensure scientific cooperation. Their work is critical to the interests of all involved parties: “The relatively narrow sea is surrounded by countries and people who are directly dependent on the well-being of the coral reefs. At the same time, the proximity of urban areas and tourism to the reef may inflict damage to it if we aren’t wise enough to coordinate our actions when using this asset,” Maox Fine of Bar-Ilan University recently commented.  Anders Meibom of EPFL explained the project’s political nature: “Try to imagine a ship flying a Swiss flag sailing on the Red Sea, with scientific workers and visitors from all the countries of the region … And all this is happening despite the complex political situation on shore.” The Red Sea Transnational Research Center opened in March. Its researchers will study Red Sea corals, especially from the Gulf of Aqaba. They will examine why these corals are so resistant to climate change and how the species can help combat reef degradation in the Red Sea and across the world’s oceans. Most importantly, they will study how to protect them. These corals may be climate change resistant, but they face myriad other threats. Human-caused threats include fish-farming, agricultural runoff, pollution, desalination, coral harvesting, and urbanization.  “Here in Aqaba, our biggest problem is us affecting the marine environment as humans,” eco-diver Abdullah Al Momany said. “I think the government needs to enforce the law, do more awareness programmes, and do more effort in protecting the marine life.” Environmental threats also exist, including natural predators, disease, and extreme low tides.  The scientific discoveries and regional alliance come at a time when development actors deprioritize ocean health. The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as Agenda 2030, are a global roadmap to a prosperous future for all.  Goal #14 focuses on ocean life: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.”  Oceans are critical to livelihoods and prosperity, especially in many emerging economies. Despite their importance, leaders across sectors in the developing world consistently ranked SDG 14 as a least important development priority, according to a study by AidData Research Center at the College of William and Mary. Only 5.4% of respondents ranked SDG 14 within their top six prioritized SDGs.  Oceans may not hold the development spotlight, but the new discoveries show great potential to improve prosperity via the marine world. JREDS Executive Director Ehab Eid hopes that Jordan’s reef studies will bring the issue into the public spotlight.  The fact that Israel and several Arab states agreed to cooperate on the problem shows its vital importance. The unlikely alliance amidst remarkable tensions could bring a greater public focus to the challenges facing life below water. In the meantime, problems underwater remain largely underappreciated within the development community.

Rabat – Some of the strongest critics of female genital mutilation (FGM) are those who have experienced it. Consider the following story: A teenager fled threats in Somalia and pursued a new life in the UK. Applying resourcefulness and determination, she paved a new future for herself. A medical examination revealed her as a survivor of female genital mutilation, an experience which ignited a personal drive to campaign against the practice.  She began her own foundation and received a title from a major governing authority. She later visited her family in Somalia to address her mutilation. A world-renowned activist, her inspirational story is now portrayed in film. Who is she? She is Waris Dirie. And she is Ifrah Ahmed. Two decades apart, two Somali-born women walked similar paths to the same destiny: A life’s commitment to end FGM. The two leaders, who support each other’s work, are now at major moments in their movement. Dirie quite literally returned to the international spotlight on March 7. The former supermodel collaborated with luxury lingerie and erotica brand Coco de Mer to raise awareness. The video campaign is Dirie’s first modeling project in two decades and benefits her charity, the Desert Flower Foundation. Coco de Mer’s industry concerns female pleasure, a theme inextricable from mutilation. Ifrah Ahmed’s biographical movie, “A Girl From Mogadishu,” finished its film festival circuit at New York’s 51Fest on July 21. “I want this movie to travel the world,” the activist said. “I want to reach the decision-makers, the leaders and the young people, who are the future…. Girls are being traumatised by FGM. Children are dying. I hope people will watch this movie and understand that this has to end.”  Female genital mutilation dates back over 2,000 years to the pharaonic era. People still practice it worldwide, especially in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Muslims, Christians, and other believers continue a tradition that has historically geographic and social, not religious, roots. People commonly perform FGM to guarantee purity, decrease female libido, and maintain honor. Dirie and Ahmed are among an estimated 200 million women and girls worldwide today to have experienced the practice. Their native Somalia has the highest FGM prevalence rate worldwide at 98%, according to a 2013 UNICEF report. The mutilation indicates a girl’s marriageability, significant in a culture where bride prices factor into family livelihoods. The majority of girls in Somalia face this rite of passage between ages 5 to 9. Usually women who have not been professionally trained perform the procedure using knives, broken glass, or razor blades. Most Somali girls undergo a severe version of FGM called infibulation. This involves removing or reshaping all external genitalia and sewing the vaginal opening nearly shut. A small hole remains for urine and menstrual blood to drain, which then occurs very slowly and can cause severe pain and infection. FGM also poses maternal danger during childbirth. Breaking the vaginal seal can lead to fatal hemorrhaging. Tearing can result in fistula and urinary incontinence. The sewn barrier may also delay the baby’s exit from the birth canal, sometimes resulting in stillbirths and infant mortality. Often, the wound is re-stitched shut after delivery. The practice is medically unnecessary, and the rights community widely condemns it.  Practitioners employ pseudo-religious justifications to continue the harmful practice. Critics say it subjugates women. It is “deeply entrenched in the patriarchal need to control women’s bodies and sexualities,” according to Zainah Anwar, executive director of Muslim women’s rights NGO Musawah.  Somalia’s Constitution prohibits, but does not explicitly criminalize, the practice: “Circumcision of girls is a cruel and degrading customary practice, and is tantamount to torture. The circumcision of girls is prohibited,” Article 15(4) reads. Somalia’s Constitution, by its own declaration, is the “supreme law of the country,” after Islamic Sharia law. As it turns out, Islamic legal scholarship often condemns the practice. The prophet Muhammad did not have his daughters cut and said humans should “not harm ourselves or others.”  The Qur’an does not reference FGM but explicitly describes the devil leading people to mutilation: “I will create in them false desires … to deface the fair nature created by Allah.” (Qur’an 4:119-120).  Muslim proponents of FGM may cite the singular hadith (a story from the prophet’s life) that refers to the practice, in which the prophet told a woman to cut less severely. This hadith, written roughly 250 years after Muhammad’s death, was later declared unreliable by its own author. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, representing 53 Muslim-majority member countries, denounces FGM.  And in Somalia, one senior cleric joins Ahmed and Dirie with his campaign against FGM. “I was shocked to learn that Islam does not support female genital mutilation,” said Sheikh Ibrahim Hassan. “The majority of Muslims have lived in darkness for centuries.”   “It’s very hard to convince people to abandon the practice but when you search the Quran and the Sunnah there is no reference to FGM,” Hassan said in a radio broadcast sermon. “We are killing the dreams of our girls by subjecting them to this brutal act. Those carrying the practice have inherited it from their ancestors and not teachings from the Quran,” he continued.  A 2018 UN report argued that religious leaders “have a unique role in mobilizing communities towards changing attitudes and norms that perpetuate female genital mutilation.” Leaders like Hassan assume a weighty role in the anti-FGM movement. Official legislation in Somalia also plays a role. The country witnessed a landmark prosecution in July 2018, after a 10-year-old girl died from mutilation. The girl’s parents hampered the investigation, reportedly hiding the perpetrator from police. Many rights advocates still saw the case as progress. “It is not acceptable that in the 21st century FGM is continuing in Somalia. It should not be part of our culture. It is definitely not part of the Islamic religion,” Deputy Prime Minister Mohammed Gulaid commented on the prosecution. Activists call for legislative focus to fight the practice on American soil, where approximately 513,000 girls are affected, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Today, FGM is still legal in 16 US states.  An evangelical Christian minister’s daughter from Kentucky came forward in April to report that she and her sister were subjected to the practice as children. Dr. Renee Bergstrom revealed in 2016 that a Christian doctor performed the operation on her as a 3-year-old.  She indicated the story was not limited to her: “I witnessed Christian religions declaring masturbation a sin, some Christian leaders and doctors recommending circumcision to prevent it, physicians carrying out the practice, and our American culture first accepting this form of sexual abuse and then denying it ever occurred.” Most FGM in the US occurs in immigrant diaspora communities, but some “heartland” Americans exploit Christianity to justify the practice. A federal judge from Michigan declared the US’s national ban on FGM unconstitutional in a controversial ruling last November. The case against medical practitioners and parents involved families from a small Muslim sect originating in West India.  American leaders introduced the Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2019 to the Senate in June to remove the technicality cited in the Michigan ruling.  Most countries worldwide legally prohibit FGM. Many anti-FGM activists call for stronger legal action, along with educational interventions and a push against medicalizing the practice.  Some also call on believers and religious leaders to reverse the practice’s misaligned ties to faith.  Dirie’s 1998 autobiography, “Desert Flower,” explored underlying ties between FGM and her personal faith. “I feel that God made my body perfect the way I was born. Then man robbed me, took away my power, and left me a cripple. My womanhood was stolen. If God had wanted those body parts missing, why did he create them?”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has called on political parties to show a willingness to work together to face the challenges slowing Morocco’s growth. In a speech at the opening of the legislative year at the parliament on Friday, October 11, the monarch emphasized that this the new parliamentary year “should be placed under the motto of responsibility and hard war, since we are halfway through the current parliamentary term.” The King called on political parties to use the legislative session “properly” in order to bear the responsibilities that citizens have entrusted them with. The King instructed the parliamentarians to “compete to serve the citizens’ interests and the nation’s causes”  away from any “pointless disputes, or wasting of time and energy.” Morocco’s government has witnessed several crises among political parties recently. Most recently, the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS), a member of the government coalition decided to leave the government. The party cited a lack of solidarity and cohesion and accused some of the parties of opportunism at a time when unity is needed to meet the growing social demands of citizens. The decision of the PPS comes less than a week from the government reshuffle which took place on Wednesday, October 9.  For King Mohammed VI, the new phase of reforms starts “now.” He said that this phase requires “not just involvement of all, but also greater confidence and cooperation, and more unity, mobilization, and vigilance, free from any pointless disputes, or wasting of time and energy.” The King said that the government and political parties should start to implement the instructions for the reforms that he has outlined during his recent speeches, especially the speech on Throne Day in July. In his speech, King Mohammed VI spoke about the challenges that are hindering growth and progress in the country. The King said that the country has “made a quantum leap in infrastructure development, whether it is highway construction, the high-speed railway, major ports, renewable energy facilities or urban development and revamping.” However, the monarch stated that he realized that these achievements are not “enough” on their own. In today’s speech, the King renewed the need to follow a well-structured strategy to tackle the challenges. He called on the government to” lay down well-thought-out plans, involving good preparatory work, careful implementation and continuous monitoring of decisions and projects, be it at the national, regional or local level.” The King also called on the private sector to collaborate with public institutions to implement reforms. “It is also the responsibility of the private sector, particularly when it comes to funding – not to mention the important role dedicated civil society organizations should play,” the monarch said. King Mohammed asked all stakeholders to bear the responsibility and work together to translate to implement reform projects on the ground. “In this regard, there can be no shirking of responsibility, especially if the principle of public accountability is strictly enforced,” he said.

Rabat – Morocco’s King Mohammed VI is urging the private sector, especially financial and banking institutions, to play an integral part in the country’s new development model. Addressing the parliament on the occasion of the opening of the first session of the “fourth legislative year of the tenth legislature” earlier today, the monarch spoke about “shouldering responsibilities” and “honoring commitments” towards the country and its people. The King recalled that the purpose of the political elite, the government and elected representatives at the parliament is to “compete to serve the citizens’ interests and the nation’s causes.” Reforming civil service, upholding political accountability, and preserving national unity at all costs, all unmissable staples in the King’s speeches, prominently featured in the monarch’s address to the parliament. But, the King reiterated on many occasions in the speech, developing a country, ensuring that the people’s problems are adequately dealt with, and “making resources available” for all, go beyond the limited purview of the government and elected officials. While the political elite does have a duty of serving the country, the involvement of the public sector is just as crucial, according to King Mohammed VI. In fact, the King argued, the government’s actions can only hit intended targets when buttressed by a healthy, responsible, and country-loving private sector. The King called the private sector’s involvement a “moral contract,” as opposed to the “social contract” between government and the people. He said: “I am referring, in particular, to the banking and financial sector, which is at the centre of any development endeavor. Implementing projects and decisions, and ensuring follow-up to them, involves more than just the signing of contracts and agreements. It is, above all, a moral contract involving reason as much as conscience. This is a matter of shared responsibility for all concerned stakeholders. Each party is duty-bound to fulfill its obligations and honor its commitments.” In urging the private sector to play its part in going forward with Morocco’s new development model, King Mohammed particularly highlighted the role of banks as the sources of loans and investment packages. Without banks availing the necessary resources and funds to accompany government policies, nothing of substance can be achieved.  “I am calling on banks to play a greater social role in promoting development, especially by simplifying and facilitating access to loans, by being more open to self-employment projects and by financing the creation of small and medium sized enterprises.” As ever, the King acknowledged the remarkable progress Morocco’s banking sector has registered in the past two decades. “The number of citizens who opened a bank account has increased threefold,” he noted. At the same time, Moroccan banks are leaders in Africa and growing in assertiveness worldwide. Yet, again as ever, the monarch said that while the progress deserves credit, there is still more to do to make Moroccan banks more globally competitive and reliable drivers of growth and development partners. “Banks are therefore expected to keep up efforts and invest in modern technology and innovative financial services to increase the number of Moroccans who have access to financing and banking services, thereby serving the interests of banks as well as those of the citizens in a balanced and equitable way and contributing to development,” the King said.

Rabat – The ministry of national education, vocational training, higher education and scientific research’s headquarters in Rabat hosted yesterday, October 10, the inauguration ceremony of the 2019-2020 academic year of second chance schools. During the ceremony, minister of education Said Amzazi announced the opening of 46 new second chance schools. Second chance schools are schools for young people, aged between 12 and 20, who dropped out of school and would like to get back to studying. They aim to offer vocational training in different industries, coupled with basic language, communication, and soft skills classes. The slogan for the new academic year is; “The second chance programme in the heart of school, equity, and citizenship.” Amzazi gave a speech during the ceremony. He thanked all the partner organizations of the second chance schools project, including UNICEF and the European Union. He also announced that the ministry will sign new partnerships with more institutions across Morocco. The minister also recalled the department’s goal to open 80 second chance schools in Morocco by 2021. The ministry of education carried out extensive research and field investigations to determine the best training and education programs for students registered in second chance schools. Amzazi also presented signed contracts to directors of the regional academies of education. The contracts relate to the opening of 46 new second chance schools. There are currently 32 second chance schools educating students in Morocco. Last academic year, more than 3,600 students attended classes and trainings in second chance schools. This year, the number is expected to almost double, up to 7,000.

Rabat – Former Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud slammed Algeria and the Polisario Front after an Algerian diplomat described his country as a “hospitable land” for refugees. Secretary-General of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Rachid Baladhan said that Algeria is a “hospitable land,” opening its doors to “individuals and groups of women and men seeking freedom and dignity.”  The Algerian diplomat made the comments at the 70th session of the UNHCR’s Executive Committee in Geneva.  The ambassador said that the Algerian state has been home to “a large number of Sahrawi refugees” for over 44 years, referring to the Sahwari’s living in the Tindouf camps in southwest Algeria. The statement provoked a strong response from Mustafa Salma who has recently criticized Algeria and the Polisario Front for alleged human rights abuses against Sahrawis living in the camps.  On Thursday, October 9, the Sahrawi activist condemned the Algerian diplomat for the statement that praised Algeria’s efforts for Sahrawi activists. “Did the Sahrawis know the [meaning] of beggarly before going to Algeria?” Mustafa Salma asked rhetorically. Responding to the Algerian diplomat’s claims, Mustafa Salma added that “Sahrawis do not have freedom in the Algerian land.” “Their freedom of movement within the Algerian territory is prohibited without the permission of the Algerian military.” If one of the Sahrawis is granted a pass, according to the activist, the movement is still restricted. Sahrawi’s movement within Algeria is limited to  “a specific purpose, in a specific place, and for a specific period.” The activist also condemned the restrictions of Sahrawis at the hand of Algeria, emphasizing that every refugee in the camps wants  to “know how to obtain a passport from the Algerian administration.”  Mustafa Salma also outlined the contradictions in the Algerian diplomat’s statement regarding dignity. The activist said that Sahrawis are denied the right to work in Algerian institutions. He decried this policy, saying that Algeria’s refusal to grant the camp residents the right to work forces them to wait and beg for international aid and charity.  “Begging is certainly incompatible with dignity.” Mustafa Salma’s comments come in the wake of a report penned by   Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the situation of Western Sahara and submitted to the UN Security Council on October 10. In his report, Guterres warned against the alarming situation in the camps, citing malnutrition and anemia as major sources of concern.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI gave, on Friday before the members of the two houses of the parliament, a speech on the occasion of the first session of the fourth legislative year of the tenth legislature. Here follows the full text of the speech: Ladies and Gentlemen, Distinguished Members of Parliament, It gives me great pleasure to preside over the opening of the fourth session of the current parliamentary term, and to meet, once again, with the nation’s representatives. This parliamentary year should be placed under the motto of responsibility and hard work, since we are halfway through the current parliamentary term. This means the present legislative session is quite some time away from the contentious debates that usually characterize the election period. For this reason, I think this legislative session should be used properly by parliamentarians to shoulder the responsibility citizens have entrusted them with, and compete to serve the citizens’ interests and the nation’s causes. As Members of Parliament, you are also expected to make sure your efforts are commensurate with the requirements of the new phase, which I outlined in the last State of the Nation Address. You will recall that I laid special emphasis on the most important economic and development challenges involved in this phase. It is, therefore, the duty of politicians – the government, parliament and political parties in particular – to provide for the conditions needed to rise successfully to the above-mentioned challenges. Distinguished Members of Parliament, The new phase starts now. It requires not just the involvement of all, but also greater confidence and cooperation, and more unity, mobilization and vigilance, free from any pointless disputes, or wasting of time and energy. One of the top priorities of this phase is to implement reforms and follow up on decisions and project execution. This is basically the mission of the executive and the legislative branches. It is also the responsibility of the private sector, particularly when it comes to funding – not to mention the important role dedicated civil society organizations should play. The government is required to lay down well-thought-out plans, involving good preparatory work, careful implementation and continuous monitoring of decisions and projects, be it at the national, regional or local level. Since the administrative apparatus is put at its disposal, the government should tap all means available to it, especially statistical data and inspection and control mechanisms, in order to guarantee the efficient implementation of decisions, making sure stakeholders work with one another in a transparent, harmonious way. In this regard, there can be no shirking of responsibility, especially if the principle of public accountability is strictly enforced. As far as parliament is concerned, the Constitution has given it broad powers in the field of legislation, oversight of the government and assessment of public policy. As Members of Parliament, you are responsible for the quality of the laws passed to implement projects and decisions on the ground, making sure they are attuned to the pulse of society, fulfil the citizens’ aspirations and address their concerns. It is also your responsibility to monitor government action concerning all matters relating to the management of public affairs, and to determine to what extent government action is responding to the real concerns of the citizens. Distinguished Members of Parliament, No matter how appropriate the decisions are, and regardless of the quality of the projects planned, implementation will always hinge on the availability of resources. For this reason, I have always insisted on the sound preparation of programs and projects, especially matters relating to funding and to the settlement of real estate issues. Needless to say, government efforts alone will not suffice in this regard. This means the private sector should be involved in the development process. I am referring, in particular, to the banking and financial sector, which is at the centre of any development endeavour. Implementing projects and decisions, and ensuring follow-up to them, involves more that just the signing of contracts and agreements. It is, above all, a moral contract involving reason as much as conscience. This is a matter of shared responsibility for all the stakeholders concerned. Each party is duty-bound to fulfil its obligations and honour its commitments. Such a contract does not involve government institutions and elected officials alone. The private sector – especially financial institutions and the banking sector – is also concerned. Thank God, Morocco has a vibrant, robust, professional banking sector which contributes to the resilience and development of our economy. Morocco’s financial system is subject to strict regulatory controls undertaken by independent and competent national institutions. This enhances trust in our banking sector and reinforces its credibility, both domestically and abroad. Thanks to the progress it has achieved, our banking sector has been able to invest in a number of foreign countries, especially in Africa. Nevertheless, several segments of society still have a negative perception of the banking sector, as if banks were only interested in quick, guaranteed profit. This is evidenced, for example, by the difficulty young entrepreneurs have in obtaining loans, and by the limited financial support provided to graduates and for the creation of small and medium sized enterprises. I am fully aware of the fact that it is difficult to change certain mind-sets within the banking sector. You will recall, in this regard, that I stressed the need to change mentalities in the civil service and to put an end to behaviour that impedes development and investment. I therefore urge our banking sector to show greater commitment and to be more effectively involved in the country’s development dynamic, particularly with regard to financing investment projects and support for productive activities that create jobs and generate income. In this respect, and in addition to the financial support they give to large businesses and companies, I am calling on banks to play a greater social role in promoting development, especially by simplifying and facilitating access to loans, by being more open to self-employment projects and by financing the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises. To this end, I ask the government and the Moroccan Central Bank to coordinate with the Professional Group of Moroccan Banks in order to develop a special program to provide financial support to young graduates and fund small self-employment projects. Indeed, a number of institutions have had a successful experience in financing projects developed by young people and facilitating their integration into social and professional life. Such projects have had a positive impact on the young people concerned, their families and the community. This plan, whose various phases I will be monitoring with the government and the parties concerned, should be based on the following: • Firstly: enable as many young, qualified project holders as possible, from various social backgrounds, to obtain bank loans in order to launch their projects, and provide assistance to make the plan as successful as possible; • Secondly: give financial support to export-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those trading with Africa, and enable them to benefit from the value added offered by the national economy; • Thirdly: facilitate public access to banking services and to opportunities for professional and economic integration, particularly for people involved in the informal sector. I do not think one needs to point out that economic activity hinges mostly on the development of banking services. I applaud the results achieved in this area over the past two decades, given that the number of citizens who opened a bank account has increased threefold. Banks are therefore expected to keep up efforts and invest in modern technology and innovative financial services to increase the number of Moroccans who have access to financing and banking services, thereby serving the interests of banks as well as those of the citizens in a balanced and equitable way and contributing to development. However, this plan will not achieve its goals without the effective involvement of the citizens, who should shoulder their responsibilities and honour their loan terms and conditions. Likewise, financial regulatory and control institutions and mechanisms should monitor the various operations involved, and make sure there is a balanced, trust-based relationship between finance institutions and borrowers. Naturally, I need to point out, in this regard, the social responsibility of financial institutions, and the need for them to contribute to constructive initiatives, whether they concern social and humanitarian issues, the preservation of the environment or the promotion of sustainable development. Distinguished Members of Parliament, Building a country that is committed to progress and development and that responds to the concerns and aspirations of the citizens requires all stakeholders to take concerted action. From this podium, I should like to call on the legislative institution you represent as well as on the executive branch and the private sector – especially the banking sector – to be actively involved in this national development endeavour and ensure the success of the new phase we are embarking upon. I therefore want you to rise to the occasion, show a keen sense of responsibility and commitment and put the nation’s best interests above all other considerations, for the good of the country and the people. Almighty God says: “O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Apostle, and make not vain your deeds!”. True is the Word of God.

Rabat – Last Wednesday, Morocco’s Head of Government, Saadeddine El Othmani, announced the names of the new ministers entrusted with carrying out the “royal instructions” that have dominated Morocco’s political scene in recent months. No sooner had El Othmani made the announcement than reporters and analysts, driven bonkers for different reasons, started scrutinizing the head of government’s choice of a team expected to deliver the bulk of the changes King Mohammed had repeatedly announced—or perhaps show some glimpses of the fundamental changes to come. Overall, some reporters suggested, the much-anticipated move from El Othmani was an earnest assessment of the Moroccan leadership’s desire to weather the socio-economic storms confronting the country. The move’s overriding principle, it has been reported, could be said to be a “nod to concerns over the slowing economy.” On closer inspection, however, was the change made reflective of the changes announced? Opinions are, as ever, divided on the question. While the balance largely swings in favor of critics, who see the new ministerial composition as continuity rather than rupture, as announced in the King’s plea for “injecting new blood,” El Othmani’s list does have some merits. Notwithstanding the chorus of rebukes which has greeted the announcement of unlikely survivors (Moulay Hafid Elalamy and Aziz Akhannouch, for example), the announcement revealed new faces and unexpected exits. From the few real changes—reduction of ministerial positions from 39 to 24, suppression of departments deemed redundant, or even the summoning of a few non-partisan technocrats (there were in total six new members)—there appeared to be a slight desire to, as one policy analyst put it, “convey a message of austerity in these troubled times for the economy.” Whereas the reduction of ministerial portfolios is certainly the most salutary aspect of the reshuffling, there was an overall air of novelty and desire for enacting real change, as evidenced by the impressive, promising profiles of the few new names on El Othmani’s list. In the appointment of Nadia Fettah Alaoui as Tourism Minister, there was a clear message of a willingness to give the helm of the strategic ministry to a technocrat, HEC Paris graduate, whose mastery of the financial sector was essential in landing Saham Finances, where she recently served as CEO, in the league of Insurance giants in Africa. Crowned African CEO of the year in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, in 2018, Alaoui, mostly has admirers who believe her ministerial tenure is a breath of fresh air for Morocco’s highly critical tourism sector.
The same thing goes for Driss Ouaouicha, appointed as Delegate Minister for Higher Education and Scientific Research. As president of Al Akhawayne University in Ifrane, Ouaouicha was instrumental in turning that university into one of Morocco’s most coveted and internationally acclaimed learning institutions. He has obviously been called upon to devise the reforms needed in Morocco’s struggling higher education system. The new Health Minister, Khalid Ait Taleb comes with similar baggage as an accomplished medical doctor who previously served as the president of the Hassan II Hospital in Fes. Or Nouzha Bouachareb, the environment and territorial development engineer appointed as Minister of Territorial Administration, Urbanization and City Management Policies. Of the six new faces, only Mohamed Ama Kraz, the 33-year-old lawyer appointed Labor and Professional Insertion Minister; and Hassan Abyaba, the new Minister for Culture, Sports, Youth and also Government Spokesperson, have not elicited the same wildly positive reactions as their technocrat peers. However, Kraz’s young age is resonant with the King’s insistence on youth inclusion, whereas Abyaba’s successful, decades-long tenure as spokesperson of the Constitutional Union, a liberal conservative party, suggests he will at least be an effective government spokesperson. For all the measured optimism surrounding the new faces, however, a reshuffling move that was supposed to be the signal of a new era, or the beginning of Morocco’s resolve to boldly march towards its much-hyped “new development model,” has largely been perceived as a disappointment. For critics, the political tsunami that had been announced turned out to be a minor tremor. In his Throne Day Speech in late July, King Mohammed VI was blunt about what direction he wanted Morocco to move in. As the country grapples with persisting challenges of socio-economic disparities, battles to carve up a new social contract, and strives to maintain the promising dynamics it has witnessed of late in some sectors, the King insisted, there was an urging need to “complete the ongoing reforms” and “correct the shortcomings.” For Morocco to realize its domestic and regional aspirations, the King maintained, there was a necessity to summon new faces, or, as he put it, “inject new blood” into the country’s governing class. But it is highly doubtful whether El Othmani’s reshuffling satisfies the post-Throne Day Speech euphoria that preceded it. More broadly, the newly announced, 24-member government, which was supposed to respond to the King’s injunction of “fundamental changes” to propel Morocco above its current development level, has mostly been interpreted as a familiar tale of partial, feigned political reshuffling. Most ministers kept their positions, sometimes slightly altered in names or prerogatives. Plus ça change, plus c’est la meme chose (the more things change, the more they stay the same), as many Francophone outlets in Morocco have suggested, in a series of reports on the new governmental team. In a sense, with only six new faces, this was more a semblance of reshuffling than the bold, audacious changes which had been promised. While the government may (rightly) claim the need for continuity when it comes to enacting effective or tangible changes, there is a common complaint that, at heart, the very survival of some ministers calls for caution as to what to expect. There is, for instance, the case of Agriculture Minister, Aziz Akhannouch.
Not only was his 12-year spell in the same department seen as reason enough to finally replace him, Akhannouch, who had been at the center of fraud and corruption allegations in the past few months, was broadly expected to not feature on El Othmani’s list. As one report has sharply put it, however, against all odds, Akhannouch appears to “have rooted himself” as Morocco’s irreplaceable Agriculture Minister. The survival of ministers like Akhannouch, Elalamy (Minister of Industry, Trade, and New Technologies), or Said Amzazi (Education Minister) has ignited doubts over whether the new team will deliver what the King expects of them. Also concerning for some is the notable absence of women (only four women feature on the list) and youth (the new Labor Minister being the only representative) in a government that was supposed to embrace audacity and novelty, to break away from old habits. More still, the appointment of a few independent technocrats has not masked the fact that this is a mostly a PJD-dominated government. As the news comes in the midst of serious debates on individual freedoms —especially patriarchy’s limitations on women’s rights and bodies—there are fears that a government dominated by an Islamist party will devote little attention to societal themes deemed crucial in progressive circles but subversive and un-Moroccan in conservative, Islamist circles. In this, too, the new government trumps the “national coalition” spirit the King had wanted it to evince. These abiding concerns are inspiring a sense of reshuffling fatigue among many Moroccans, a kind of carryover effect associated with witnessing continuity trumpeted as newness. Moroccans—especially journalists and policy analysts—had massively succumbed to the heady excitement that came with the “royal instructions” that El Othmani take corrective measures to put the country back on track, to set the stage for implementing the new development model. But where the King (and surely the Moroccan media) hoped for El Othmani to come with names and a vision that would win back the trust of Moroccans, the majority of whom see government officials as an assemblage of self-serving, disconnected elites, the head of government delivered a fumbled performance. And so, as seemingly irreplaceable ministers grind their way through the years, Moroccans, at least judging from their hushed whispers and grumblings on social media, seemed to be left in a purgatorial state, unsure of when or whether salvation (the new development model) will really come.

Rabat – Police arrested man in his 40s after he stabbed five people at a shopping center in central Manchester, UK. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said that they arrested a man in his 40s on “suspicion of serious assault.” GMP added in a statement that “specialist officers are continuing to respond to an incident” at the shopping center.  The security services confirmed that five people “have been stabbed and taken to hospital.” The police added that “Counter-Terrorism Police North West are leading the investigation as we determine the circumstances” given the location of the incident. Police put the suspect in custody for investigation.

Rabat – Police at the Maritime Border Post in Tarifa, Spain arrested have arrested a 35-year Belgian-Moroccan national subject to an arrest warrant from Moroccan security services for drug trafficking. Europa Press reported on Thursday, October 10, that the police arrested the suspect when he was attempting to take a ferry to Tangier, Morocco. Police arrested him during the passenger document check-in. The suspect was wanted by Moroccan police for his involvement in a cannabis trafficking network. The news outlet said, if convicted, the suspect would serve a sentence of up to ten years in prison according to Article 129 of the Moroccan criminal code. The operation is part of a win-win strategy to combat cross-border crime. Morocco and Spain regularly collaborate in the fight against drug trafficking, irregular migration, and terrorism. In June, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Spain is “Morocco’s largest trading partner and the two countries are linked by exemplary cooperation relations in several areas such as migration management and anti-terrorist cooperation.” Despite tremendous efforts to combat drug trafficking, smugglers continue to look for ways to smuggle cannabis from Morocco to Europe. Data from analytics company New Frontier Data claimed that Morocco is Europe’s biggest cannabis supplier. The wali (governor) of Morocco’s judicial police said in September that Morocco’s security services had seized 44 kilograms of cocaine in the first nine months of 2019. During the same period, police seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives.

Rabat – In his first public comments after the recent government reshuffle, Morocco’s newly appointed Delegate Minister for Education and Scientific Research, Driss Ouaouicha, said that his department holds the key to driving up Morocco’s performance in many other essential sectors for the country’s dream of effectively implementing its new development model. Ouaouicha, who was speaking at his installation ceremony in Rabat, on Thursday, September 10, spoke extensively about the “critical importance” of education, especially higher education and specialized professional training. Honoring the “royal vision” that underpins the recent government reshuffle requires a working formula to make Morocco’s learning institutions competitive and highly performing, he argued. For Morocco, Ouaouicha said, securing a better future calls for taking education seriously and investing considerably in higher education. “Higher education is the future for Morocco,” he said. The new minister, whose success in his previous position as the president of the prestigious Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, subtly hinted at the suggestion, prevailing in reactions to the reshuffling, that his documented familiarity with higher education-related challenges is reason enough to expect positive results from his appointment. “I am not new to this department,” he stressed, chronicling some of his years as lecturer and then dean at a number of Moroccan universities, before being appointed by King Mohammed VI as president of Al Akhawayn University. Beyond his familiarity with the journey he is about to embark on, Ouaouicha, “grateful and honored by the King’s trust,” also spoke about responsibility and the virtue of “serving my country.” He spoke about “feeling proud” of his appointment. “At the same time,” he added, “I feel immense responsibility.” In response, Education Minister Said Amzazi, one of the survivors of the reshuffle, congratulated the new delegate minister on his appointment. Amzazi reminded Ouaouicha of the sense of calling and mission that comes with his new position. As a member of the new El Othmani-led government team, Amzazi stressed, Ouaouicha’s role will consist in duplicating the success of his previous position by putting his expertise and experience at the service of Morocco’s ambition to raise its higher education level and make the country more competitive. Like Ouaouicha, Amzazi extolled the virtue of education, saying that an A-rate education system should be at the heart of Morocco’s much-reported new development model. Only after succeeding its educational reforms, both ministers argued, can the country expect to reach its dreamt development level.

Rabat – The World Bank issued a report, providing a new overview of Morocco’s economy and the challenges impeding socio-economic progress in the North African country. The report indicates that Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to “slow further to 2.7% in 2019.” The World Bank explained that the slowdown of the GDP is due to a “decline in agriculture.” The  2018-2019 agricultural season in Morocco was poor, mainly due to weak rainfall. In August, Morocco’s Ministry of Agriculture announced that the cereal production in 2018-2019 has reached 52 quintals, down by 49 % compared to last year. The report, however, shows a positive forecast for non-agricultural growth in 2019. “Nonagricultural growth will improve (3.4% in 2019 compared to 3% in 2018), driven by better performance of phosphates, chemicals, and textiles output,” the report finds. With a population of 35.2 million in 2018, Morocco continues to face the challenges of poverty. The report finds that 24% of the population, equating to nine million Moroccans, can be “considered poor or at risk of poverty.” The Moroccan government has long promised to tackle socio-economic crises to meet expectations. The government, however, has failed to meet the population’s growing demands, Governor of Morocco’s Central Bank Abdelatif Jouahri said in a report in July. He said that Morocco experienced challenges due to the slow recovery of non-agricultural sectors last year. The top banker warned that Morocco is in dire need of reform to place the country back on the path to higher growth. Unemployment is also one of the challenges weighing down Morocco’s growth. Despite positive indicators on the decline of unemployment, the World Bank said that the rate of unemployment in Morocco remains “high.” “The unemployment rate will slightly decline to 9.3% in H1-2019, underlined by a protracted fall in the labor force participation, which dropped to 46.1.” The report, however, warned in a side note that the unemployment rate fell, “but remains high, especially for the youth and women.” Positive outlook The report said that public finance will remain under “stress with high and rigid current expenditures.”  The World Bank acknowledged that the fiscal deficit “will not decline as expected and will stall at 3.6% of GDP in 2019.” However, the report finds that growth in the country is expected to “pick up gradually and average 3.3% over 2020-2021.” The growth will be mainly driven by “high foreign investments.,” the report finds The World Bank supported other reports, emphasizing that the automotive industry is one of the promising markets in the North African country. “In particular, significant FDIs continue to flow into automotive industries,” the report said.  The World Bank took the new PSA plant as an example, emphasizing that it will  “eventually double the sector’s production capacity– as well as into logistics and trade services following the expansion of the Tangiers port. Inflation is projected to average around 1 percent over the medium term.”

Mdina Bus en feu pic.twitter.com/6KhSKr4U14 — Fadel Abdellaoui (@fadelabdellaoui) October 11, 2019  Local police and civil protection intervened quickly to control the flames. Police also opened an investigation to determine the causes of the incident. Local authorities notified Casablanca’s inhabitants of possible delays for some school buses. They also assured Casablanca’s population that regular bus lines will continue to operate normally. The contract between Casablanca’s city council and M’dina Bus will come to an end by the end of October. The company has been long criticized for the poor quality of its fleet and services. In January 2019, a bus belonging to the company burst into flames in the middle of a crowded intersection. Luckily, no human casualties were recorded. At the start of October, Casablanca’s city council announced the successor of M’dina Bus. Spanish company Alsa, already operating in a number of Moroccan cities, will replace M’dina Bus as of November 1.

Rabat – Morocco’s ministry of industry, investment, and green and digital economy, seized on Thursday, October 10, 192,000 low-quality chargers at Tangier-Med port. The operation took place in collaboration with Moroccan customs. An accredited laboratory ran tests on samples from seven different brands of the seized chargers. The tests concluded that the chargers do not respect security norms and represent a danger for Moroccans, said the ministry in a press release. According to the statement, customs services have seized more than 748,500 imported low-quality chargers since the start of 2019. In September 2019, customs seized 250,000 low-quality chargers in the port of Casablanca. Following the operation, the ministry announced the launch of a campaign to “protect Moroccan consumers” from hazards linked to low-quality home appliances, especially mobile phone chargers and batteries. The ministry said that the measure comes as an “urgent” response to a number of incidents in the past months. The campaign came a month after the death of a 7-year old girl in a house fire. The 7-year-old girl, Hiba, lost her life in a blaze caused by a low-quality phone charger in her room. She lived in a low-income neighborhood in Sidi Allal Bahraoui, a small town in the Khemisset Province in the Rabat-Kenitra-Sale region.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI will chair the opening of the first session of the fourth legislative year of the tenth legislature on Friday, October 11, at the Moroccan parliament. King Mohammed VI will deliver a speech to both the members of the House of Representatives and the House of Councilors, a statement from the Royal Household, Protocol, and Chancellery said in a statement. Moroccan television channels and radios will broadcast the speech starting at 2.30 p.m. Traditionally, King Mohammed VI opens the new legislative in October. Members of Parliament are required to wear traditional dress (jellaba) in accordance with the rules of procedure of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives. King Mohammed VI’s speech is expected to address the government reshuffle, which took place on October 9. The monarch is set to discuss his aspirations and expectations from the new ministers. The government reshuffle shrunk the number of ministers from 32 officials to 23 in several sectors. Most of the ministers from Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani’s first government kept their positions, including the Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamiy and Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannnouch. October 2018 speech Last year in October, King Mohammed VI urged the government to consider vocational training as a means to curb unemployment. “It is necessary to work on creating more bridges and links between vocational training programs and general education courses within a unified, integrated system,” King Mohammed VI said in his speech. He also discussed the importance of the agricultural sector as it “constitutes a more dynamic source of opportunities and be instrumental in improving living conditions and consolidating stability in rural areas.” During his 2018 speech, the King also spoke about the government’s decision to reintroduce mandatory military service, calling on all citizens of all social classes to show mobilization to defend their homeland. King Mohamed VI said that the military service “enhances the sense of belonging to the homeland.” “With regard to performing military service, it must be emphasized that all the Moroccan citizens concerned – without exception – are equal, regardless of social background, diploma or education,” the monarch said.

Rabat – The peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara, also known as MINURSO has published a report on the situation in the region. The report was submitted by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres on October 2. The document is in line with the responsibility of the UNSG to issue a report before the expiration of the MINURSO mandate. The MINURSO’s six-month mandate is due to expire on October 31. The document provides the Security Council with a summary of the activities of both Morocco and the Polisario Front in Western Sahara, as well as an overview of the MINURSO mission in the region. The report also covers the situation of Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. The secretary-general devoted a part of his report to reiterating his concerns over the challenges that the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps are facing.  Malnutrition and disease top the list of concerns.  In the fifth section, paragraph 63, Guterres said that malnutrition is one of the biggest concerns along with the prevalence of anemia. The UN top official recalled that the UN organizations operating in the camps, including UNHCR “continued to work closely together on the treatment and prevention of anemia, stunting, and malnutrition among young children, girls, pregnant and lactating women.” The UN chief warned that indicators studying malnutrition and anemia are of major concern. The UNHCR and the UN World Food Program (WFP) conducted a survey in April, according to the report. “The results have shown a worsening situation compared with 2016,” Guterres warned. He said that all indicators of malnutrition in the camps increased from the survey conducted in 2016, “including global acute malnutrition.” The UNHCR and WFP survey found that global acute malnutrition had increased from 4% in 2016 to 7% in 2019. The report added that the cases of stunted growth also increased from 18 % in 2016 to 28%  in 2019, whereas, anemia in children had mounted from 38% to 50 %. The survey indicated that anemia in women also increased from 43% to 52 %. UN fails to address the embezzlement of aid The United Nations Secretary-General has strongly condemned malnutrition in almost all of his recent reports. However, the reports have failed to look at the root of the issue: The embezzlement of humanitarian aid. Despite the prevalence of malnutrition in the Tindouf camps, the UN has failed over the past than four-decades of the conflict to address the issue of the embezzlement of humanitarian aid from the international community intended for Sahrawis living in Tindouf camps. Several reports warned against the alleged embezzlement involving the separatist group and  Algeria. One recent report was an opinion piece published by Spanish news outlet La Provincia, in which president of the Canary Sahawi Forum Miguel Angel Ortiz condemned the embezzlement of aid and corruption in the camps. Ortiz said that the Tindouf caps witnessed the “misappropriation of some  €2.5 million of humanitarian aid” from the international community destined for Sahrawis living in Tindouf camps. The article explained that the Polisario Front was unable to justify the expenses related to the grants, “which shows how corruption is deeply-rooted among the separatists.” In another scandal, last year Pro-Polisario news outlets  Futuro Sahara, reported that Sahrawis were surprised to find popular aid products on display in Algerian grocery shops. Funding concerns The secretary-general conveyed concerns from human rights organizations operating in the camps. The organizations mostly complain about funding concerns. According to the report, the “main challenge for humanitarian actors remained the funding shortfall.” The secretary-general warned that the UNHCR is not able to meet international standards “in its life-saving activities,” including water and sanitation, health, education, energy, and protection. Paragraph 66 of the report said emphasized that “None of the targets for 2018 were achieved in these sectors.” The secretary-general also regretted the brain drain on skilled personnel who are leaving for better-paying jobs in several sectors, such as health and education. He said that brain drain in these sectors is of major concern. The well-skilled personnel often leave because of the “lack of financial incentives and difficult working conditions,” he explained. The secretary-general also warned that health infrastructure in the region requires an “urgent need of rehabilitation” to meet the demands of the Sahrawi population. The water crisis is also prevalent, with Guterres calling for urgent steps to be taken to find new water sources. “New water sources are urgently required as the population receives on average only about 12 liters of drinking water per person per day, which is well below the minimum standard of 20 liters per person per day,” he said. This is not the first time that Guterres has condemned the issue of nutrition in the region. In most of his previous reports, the Secretary-General has warned against malnutrition and its consequences on the region’s population. In his October 2018 report, Guterres recalled the frustration among the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps against the “lack of progress in the political process” for Western Sahara. They also decried the “persistent difficulties, such as malnutrition, brought by the steady reduction in humanitarian aid.” In his October 2019 report, Guterres sought to encourage financial aid to help the UN organizations contribute to the human development of the Sahrawi population in the Tindouf camps. In paragraph 85, the UN chief said: “I underscore that figures related to refugees in the Tindouf camps are strictly for humanitarian assistance and protection services, and do not in any way constitute eligibility for political settlement or referendum purposes.” He, therefore, warned that the Sahrawi population is in dire need of aid to overcome the alarming challenges. “Health and nutrition indicators have reached alarming rates and the provision of drinking water continues to fall well below international standards,” he said.

Rabat – The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, informed the Security Council that the Polisario Front has failed to “comply with requests by MINURSO to resolve” some violations. The UNSG issued his report on Western Sahara two weeks ahead of the expiration of the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MINURSO. In the report, Guterres warned that MINURSO still faces challenges due to the Polisario’s violations east of the berm, or security wall,  in the region. Guterres informed the Security Council of the Polisario Front’s continuous violations. He stated that the Polisario failed to “comply” with MINURSO’s requests.  The UN chief emphasized that the separatist group has not yet responded to warnings to remove buildings “recently constructed by Frente Polisario in various locations outside of the restricted area.” “A logistics hub consisting of 10 new buildings located inside the restricted area near Bir Lahlou, which had already been declared a violation in 2017 and included in the list of long-standing violations in 2018, remained operational,” the report said. The document listed other new buildings both in Tifariti used by Polisario’s army as well as the relocation of a “security detachment in Tifariti.” The report describes the actions as violations. Other violations include activities in other buildings including the “unauthorized relocation of an engineering company in Tifariti. The report added that the Polisario Front established five new observation posts in Agwanit, Bir Lahlou, and Tifariti, which are all restricted areas. For Guterres, the actions are classed as “violations”. The UN chief concluded paragraph 32, emphasizing that “Frente POLISARIO has so far failed to comply with requests by MINURSO to resolve any of the violations.” The report listed other violations by the Polisario Front. The Polisario has disregarded MINURSO’s warning. For Guterres, such tension will hinder the development and progress of the UN-led political process to find a just and mutually acceptable solution to end the dispute. The report said some of Polisario’s military vehicles and personnel remain in the restricted area despite warnings. “The military post of Frente Polisario at ‘waypoint 6 … in the restricted area 16.6 east of Guerguerat, consisting of two tents, two to three vehicles and between two to six personnel  was again declared a violation in April, although it had been moved out of the buffer strip, it remained in the restricted area.” The UN secretary-general warned that the Polisario front turned a deaf ear to MINURSO’s request to abandon the post. “A request to Frente Polisarioto abandon the post remains unheeded,” the report finds. The United Nations mission in the region also declared Polisario’s armed presence with heavy weapons in Awanit and Tifariti as a violation. Despite warnings, the Polisario Front again defied UN requests. MINURSO also identified violations by the Polisario separatists in Mijek in June, when a vehicle “hit an anti-tank mine inside the buffer strip” in the region. The attack caused one death and two injuries. “Upon investigation, MINURSO determined that the individuals involved in the incident were Frente Polisario military personnel, and their presence in the buffer strip was declared a violation.” Polisario does not communicate The UN chief warned that the Polisario Front continues to “refuse all meetings with the Missions leadership, both civilian and military in Rabou, where all meetings had previously been held.” The Polisario Front has been urging the MINURSO and the UN to hold the meetings in the Western Sahara, which is a violation of the agreements. The UN Secretary-General stipulates that  the lack of communication between MINURSO personnel and members of the separatist group “impedes good communication and effective working relationships with the parties, and handicaps MINURSO in the implementation of its mandate.” The threat of terrorism is a real struggle In his recent report, the UN secretary-general echoed international concerns over the terror threats in the region, allowed to flourish by a lack of security. “The threat related to terrorist groups and criminal activities in the region continues to cause great concern owing to its unpredictability and the unknown level of risk, especially with regard to the team sites located in remote areas east of the berm, the unarmed ground patrols covering long distances across the Territory and the resupply of convoys,” the report said. The UN chief emphasized that MINURSO is facing the risk of terrorist attacks “owing to the prevalence of malicious actors in the surrounding areas.” Although there have been “no new direct or explicit threats against the Mission since 2017… arrests of terrorist suspects in Laayoune and Tindouf refugee camps within the past year are a reminder that the threat remains real,” Guterres warned. The statement against terror threats in the region is also shared by Moroccan security services, who warned that Tindouf camps might be safe ground for terrorists. The situation causes concern not only for Morocco but also for its international security partners. In February, Italian media outlet Analisi Difesa published a report written by Anna Rita Palamerio on the scourge of terrorism in the Sahel region. The author said that the Tindouf camps in southwest Algeria “suffer serious social conditions,” where thousands of Saharawis live in alleged unbearable living conditions, furthering the “spread of terrorism in the Sahel-Saharan region.” The author added that the camps serve as the main source of recruitment for several terror organizations, including  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJW). In his report, Guterres argued that the leader of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, issued in April 2019 a statement “calling for militants operating in West Africa to multiply attacks against “Crusader France and its allies”, raising terrorism-related concerns.  Following his review and observations, the secretary-general said that he hopes to see both the Polisario Front and Morocco engage in the political process in “good faith” as soon as a new Personal Envoy is appointed. The secretary-general reiterated appreciation over the efforts of the former envoy, Horst Kohler, who resigned in May due to health concerns. “I call on Security Council members, friends of Western Sahara and other relevant actors to encourage Morocco and Frente Polisario to engage in good faith and without preconditions in the political process as soon as a new Personal Envoy is appointed,” said the secretary-general. He added that after his meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on the sidelines of the 74th General Assembly of the UN, “ I believe progress can be achieved to overcome constraints regarding these aspects on the Moroccan side.” He also urged the Polisario front to show the same spirit, asking them to resume the longstanding practice of meeting with MINURSO. “It is also my hope that Frente POLISARIO will resume its longstanding practice of meeting MINURSO leadership in Rabouni,” he said.

Rabat  – Spanish security services are investigating 31 Moroccan nationals over driver’s license fraud. Spanish news outlet Diario de Almeria reported on October 9 that the suspects have been allegedly falsifying Moroccan driver’s licenses for €250 to €3,000, according to Diario de Almeria. The suspects then use the permits to convince Spanish authorities that they are authorized to drive and swap the falsified Moroccan permit for a Spanish one. The news outlet added that the investigation started at the beginning of 2018 when the Almeria Province’s Traffic Headquarters noticed a forgery. All 31 of the suspects live in El Jido and La Majonera in Spain.. The Spanish Criminal Code “defines fraud as obtaining undue profit from the victim using deception.” If convicted of fraud, the suspects could face  up to three years behind bars and a fine. “The prison sentence can be increased to up to eight years if there have been certain aggravating circumstances,” the Law Reviews reported.

Frankfurt – The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded its 2019 Nobel prize in chemistry to three scientists for their work developing the lithium ion battery, which powers cellphones, laptops, and other electronic devices. Missing from the recipient list is Rachid Yazami, the Moroccan scientist who invented the graphite anode, which is used in most cellphones’ lithium batteries today. The three Nobel winners—M. Stanley Whittingham, John B. Goodenough, and Akira Yoshino—all made important advancements in the lithium ion battery. Speaking of the laureates in an interview with Morocco World News, Yazami said he has “great respect for them…. I’m very happy for the three of them.” However, he continued, “It’s a disappointment for me.” Laughing, he commented that the Nobel committee made phone calls to the laureates on cellphones using his working anode. During the announcement on Wednesday, October 9, Sara Snogerup Linse of the Nobel committee for chemistry explained, “The laureates developed lightweight batteries with high enough potential to be useful in many applications, truly portable electronics.” Whittingham developed the first usable lithium battery in the 1970s, but it could explode if recharged too many times, and his discoveries are no longer in use today. Goodenough created a rechargeable battery that used cobalt in 1979, resulting in more stable and manageable batteries. Yoshino greatly increased the safety of the lithium battery by inventing one without metallic lithium in 1985. Yazami’s greatest accomplishment came in creating the lithium graphite anode, which, according to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), “is the most commonly used anode in commercial lithium-ion batteries today.” He explained to MWN that his invention not only made the battery economical, it was safe, and it worked.  “All other anodes that have been used so far show that either they don’t perform well … either the cycle life of the battery is very short, or the battery is unsafe.”  Because the Nobel committee can only choose three or fewer recipients for each prize, Yazami speculated it came down to a single vote.  “I think [the committee] had to make a decision, a very hard decision, between Stanley Whittingham [and myself], I’m just guessing.” With a chuckle, he said, “Congratulations to him, and what can I say? I’m so sorry for myself.” Yazami said he has been expecting the Nobel committee to recognize scientists’ work on lithium ion batteries for 15 years now. At least, he said, the prize came in time for Goodenough, who at 97 is the oldest recipient of any Nobel prize. The 2019 Nobel chemistry award chose not to recognize Yazami although a previous award celebrating achievements in lithium ion batteries did. In 2014, the NAE awarded Yazami, Whittingham, Yoshino, and Japanese scientist Yoshio Nishi with the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering for each of their significant contributions to the lithium ion battery. Yazami noted that the Draper prize focuses more on practicality than the Nobel prize, which is more concerned with celebrating ideas. At age 66, Yazami said he has hope that his turn will come to receive the Nobel. Although he retired from his position at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), he commented, “A scientist never retires.” With 150 patents, he said he has plenty of work to do seeing if he can turn the patents into practical products. The future of lithium ion batteries, Yazami said, may be in finding ways to charge batteries faster and in studying the interaction between materials science and artificial intelligence in order to create longer-lasting batteries.

Frankfurt – Hassan Abyaba, has become Morocco’s new minister of youth, sports, and culture and government spokesperson. On Wednesday, October 9, King Mohammed VI appointed Abyaba to the cabinet position under Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in a government reshuffle. Abyaba, who taught at Casablanca’s Hassan II University,  will be taking over three portfolios. He will replace Mohamed Laaraj, the previous minister of culture, Rachid Talbi Alami, the previous minister of youth and sports, and Mustapha El Khalfi as government spokesperson. Abyaba has experience as a spokesperson, having served as the spokesperson of his party, the Constitutional Union (UC) since 2016. The politician joined the UC in 1989 and soon became the party’s deputy secretary-general of youth. As youth minister, Abyaba will face the challenge of Morocco’s high youth unemployment rate. Earlier this year, the High Commission for Planning reported that the unemployment rate among urban youth is as high as 40%. While Abyaba does not have a clear record in working in the sports or culture sectors, he completed his doctorate in human resources in 2010 at the Mohammed V University of Rabat.  Abyaba has also received training in leadership and negotiation management in the US and Germany. As sports minister, Abyaba will inherit the task of securing Morocco’s long-held desire to host the FIFA World Cup. Morocco has an increasingly large profile in hosting championships and tournaments. In August 2019, Rabat hosted the 2019 African Games. The politician was born soon after independence in Settat, near Casablanca. He first obtained a bachelor’s in geopolitical studies before earning a master’s and doctorate in the same field. In 2018, he became president of the Arab Liberal Federation. The federation is a group of 13 political parties “committed to the principles of freedom, responsibility, pluralism, tolerance, market economy, civil state and separation of religion from state affairs, where every citizen enjoys a life of peace and prosperity.” Abyaba’s new position as government spokesperson will require him to work closely with El Othmani’s ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD).

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad El Othmani appointed Khalid Ait Taleb as the new Minister of Health as part of the government reshuffle announced yesterday, October 9. Ait Taleb was born in Agadir and graduated from the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Rabat. The 55-year-old is married and has two children.  Since the Hassan II University Hospital Center of Fez opened its doors in 2009, Ait Taleb acted as the general director of the hospital and the head of its visceral surgery department.  He is a commendable surgeon, according to his colleagues, who gave a statement to the French-language news outlet Le360. “He is an excellent surgeon, the proof is that he has run the University Hospital of Fez for ten years,” the source said, also indicating that Taleb is a good manager.  Prior to his appointment as Minister of Health, Ait Taleb served briefly as the Acting Secretary General of the Ministry of Health after replacing Hicham Nejmi, who was dismissed from the position last month.  Turmoil in the public health sector A new Minister of Health will come as a welcome change for the medical professionals and students who have been staging strikes since 2017.  Anas Doukkali became the Minister of Health in January 2018, and his mandate was marked by a series of protests led by the Independent Union of Public Doctors (SIMSP), public sector health professionals, and medical students from around the country.    SIMSP denounced the Ministry of Health for standing by while the public health sector deteriorated, and for excluding public sector health professionals from official negotiations and dialogue.  More than 1,000 public sector doctors resigned en masse during the series of demonstrations, demanding better pay, benefits, and working conditions.  Protesters also called for an end to unfair administrative and judicial proceedings, and demanded the integration of unemployed nurses and health professionals into the public health sector.   From March until August of this year, Moroccan students protested against poor medical training conditions and the government’s move to privatize medical education and services.  Medical, dentistry, and pharmaceutical students boycotted their final exams, which ultimately prompted the Ministries of Health and Education to reach an agreement with the National Commission for Medical Students.  Doukkali recently faced criticism from members of his former political party, the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS), for condemning the party’s unanimous decision to withdraw from the government October 1. The current Minister of Health Khalid Ait Taleb is one of six newly appointed ministers that have emerged from the government reshuffle.

The new minister earned a PhD in environment and territorial development from the Mohammadia School of Engineers, in Rabat. She also graduated from the Higher Institute for Business and Management (ISCAE). Bouchareb is a national council member of MP, and the president of the women’s section of the Harakie movement, a division of MP comprised of the younger members of the party. The official has already served as an expert consultant within several ministry departments. She also worked for international organizations such as the World Bank, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). One of the main issues Bouchareb will need to tackle as minister of housing and urban policy is the problem of slums. In 2004, Morocco launched the “Cities Without Slums” programme, targeting 85 Moroccan cities with the aim of making them “slum-free.” The programme was expected to end by 2011. However, 2018 statistics from the ministry of housing declared that the project met its goals in only 58 out of the 85 target cities.

Rabat – The Japanese group JTEKT Corporation opened a new plant in Tangier Automotive City on Wednesday, October 9. The new production site for steering systems, worth MAD 220 million, covers an area of 11,300 square meters. State Secretary to the Minister of Industry Othman El Ferdaous said during the inauguration that the JTEKT group plant has created 90 jobs in the automotive industry and spare parts sector in Morocco. “The factory is not only dedicated to the manufacture of automotive plants but also a school for Moroccan workers, which Japanese investors consider highly competent and in line with technological developments,” El Ferdaous said. The executive director of the Japanese company Hirofumi Matsuoka said that the new plant  is JTEKT’s “first industrial site on the African continent, expressing the group’s ambition to expand further in order to become the leader in Africa in terms of steering systems production.” The factory is using the latest technologies, he said. The executive director said that PSA Group in Morocco is the largest customer for JTEKT. Ambassador of Japan to Morocco Takuji Hantani attended the inauguration event. The group announced the start of construction works in September 2018. Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said last year that the company invested around €20 million for the construction of its new plant. JTEKT’s plant is expected to start production in 2020 and aims to produce 300,000 units in its first year. With over 45,600 employees, the Japanese manufacturer has more than 136 subsidiaries in 27 countries around the world. In 2017, JTEKT had a turnover of €11 billion. The group’s determination to put its new Africa-based plant in Morocco reflects the country’s potential as a promising market for the automotive industry. The industry is one of the pillars for Morocco’s economy as it creates more jobs than other sectors. The Ministry of Industry and Trade said that between 2016 and 2018, the industry created 116,611 jobs, representing 28.8% of all new jobs in the time period.

Rabat – Moussa Faki Mahamat, the president of the AU Commission, has highlighted Morocco’s environment-friendly policies, as well the country’s front-seat role in the AU’s fight to promote peace and stability on the continent. The laudatory remarks, yet another supportive, morale-boosting message for Morocco’s Africa-focused diplomatic gaze, came in a recent meeting between the AU official and Morocco’s AU representative. During his meeting in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with Ambassador Mohammed Arrouchi, Morocco’s permanent representative to the AU and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, Mahamat was particularly full of positive remarks about Morocco’s role in African affairs.  From promoting intra-African exchanges to making tangible efforts to help fellow African countries’ socio-economic prosperity through expertise sharing and reliable partnership, Mahamat argued, Morocco is quickly becoming an assertive African voice and an inspiration for many countries on the continent. In addition to evoking the traditionally security and stability-focused AU talking points, Mahamat and the Moroccan ambassador also mentioned the growing significance of climate change in African geopolitics and national policies across the continent. On the climate front, Mahamat lauded Morocco’s environment-friendly efforts and its initiative to share its energy efficiency expertise with the rest of the continent.  As the meeting came at the end of Morocco’s one-month tenure at the helm of the AU Peace and Security Council, Mahamat and Ambassador Arrouchi seized the opportunity to review the AU body’s achievements during Morocco’s chairmanship.  Under Morocco’s leadership, the AU PSC’s agenda featured meetings on climate change policies for Africa, the post-Omar al-Bashir transition in Sudan, and the recently concluded UN General Assembly.  Mahatma’s supportive message comes as Morocco, aware of the notable gains it has made in Africa in recent months, seeks to capitalize on the leadership position its pan-African efforts have helped it secure.  Recently speaking at a panel on “The Interdependence between Peace, Security, and Development,” Morocco’s Nasser Bourita insisted on Rabat’s unwavering commitment to initiating “effective and coherent” intra-African platforms to collectively meet the challenges facing the continent.  From climate change, socio-economic underdevelopment, to the lingering conflicts in some African countries, Bourita stressed, “Morocco strongly believes that the response to all our challenges is concerted action and shared responsibility.”

Rabat – A member of the Justice and Development Party (PJD) Jamila Moussali has replaced former Minister of Solidarity, Social Development, Equality and Family Bassima Hakkaoui from the same party as part of the government reshuffle on Wednesday, October 9. The reshuffle comes following an urgent call from King Mohammed VI to give fresh momentum to Morocco’s public services administrations with high-level competencies and elites. Moussali replaced Hakkaoui, who served as a minister of solidarity since January 2012. Moussali’s career Moussali was born in 1969, in the northern town of Ouezzane. She studied at Mohammed I University in Oujda, where she earned a PhD in history. Moussali also studied law. The new minister started her political career in 2002, as a member of the parliament for PJD. She served as secretary of the House of Representatives between 2012 and 2015. In 2016, Moussali was appointed as minister delegate to the minister of education. The official served as a social counselor at Sale city council between 2004 and 2015. Between 2009 and 2014, Moussali served on several national committees. The strategic committee for the fight against bribery, and the committee for dialogue with civil society around the new constitution were among her appointments. Moussali is also a member of the Moroccan section of the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC), and the president of the “Wiam” center for family counseling and guidance. Replacing a controversial minister The former minister of solidarity, Bassima Hakkaoui, has been under a lot of popular pressure in recent years as Moroccan activists called for her resignation through protests and petitions. Hakkaoui was criticized for her silence on rape and murder cases, as well as violence against women. The former minister made no comment on  the case of Khadija, a 17-year-old in Beni Mellal who was gang-raped and forcibly tattooed, and that of Zeinab, a 23-year-old who was gang-raped on a public bus, both in 2017. In June 2019, Hanane, a 34-year-old woman was brutally raped and killed in Mellah, Rabat. Her entire ordeal was captured on film and circulated on social media. Hakkaoui did not comment publicly on the incident. The last time Hakkaoui publically commented on the rape of a Moroccan woman, it was the case of Amina El Filali, a 16-year-old girl from Larache, Morocco, who committed suicide by ingesting rat poison on March 10, 2012. El Filali committed suicide because she was forced to marry Mustafa Fellaq, a man ten years older than her who had raped her twice. The marriage meant that he could escape prosecution thanks to Article 475 of the Moroccan penal code, which, at the time, de-criminalized rape if the rapist later married their victim. Commenting on the case to the press, Hakkaoui said: “Article 475 of the Penal Code is unlikely to be repealed under pressure from international public opinion. The marriage of the girl to her rapist does not bring her real harm.” Whether the new minister will take a stronger stance on sexual violence against women remains to be seen.

Rabat – The government released, in September 2019, the second edition of Mustapha El Khalfi’s book entitled; “Moroccan Sahara: Illusions and Realities about the Conflict.”  The government-sponsored publication classes itself as “a guide for effective advocacy.” El Khalfi released the first edition in 2016. The second edition of the book details the history of the Western Sahara conflict up until 2019 and delves more deeply into online advocacy and the use of social media. Since the publication of the book’s first edition, the Western Sahara case has seen significant development in favor of Morocco, not least Morocco’s return to the African Union (AU).  Moroccan diplomacy has also made strides over the past three years, resulting in several states revoking their recognition of the self-proclaimed SADR.   Another significant event detailed in the book is the recent inclusion of Morocco’s western provinces in the EU agricultural and fisheries agreements.  In a groundbreaking development, Algeria ended its neutrality and participated in the two UN roundtables. Also significant in El Khalfi’s book is the steady progress of the development model of the southern regions. The book is structured in 15 parts that each explore, and logically refute separatist fictions. El Khalfi uses geographic, historic, and scientific facts to disprove the false claims propagated by the Polisario and Algeria that have, throughout the history of the conflict, complicated it on the international stage.  The newly released version is available in 4 languages: Arabic, English, Spanish, and French. It is addressed to civil society and highlights the most effective ways to advocate about Morocco’s primary national issue. El Khalfi’s writing is designed to reject some of the more regularly peddled falsities about the conflict. He proves that the Polisario Front’s claims that they are advocating for the Saharawi people are myths. He also strongly refutes with facts the idea that Morocco’s return to AU is an implicit recognition of the self-styled SADR.

Rabat – Head coach of the Moroccan national football team Vahid Halilhodvic said that  Moroccan football player Abderrazak Hamdallah refused his invitation to play with the Atlas Lions. In a press conference on Wednesday, October 9, Halilhodvic said that Hamdallah had refused to join the Moroccan national team’s training camp ahead of the two friendly games against Gabon and Libya. The coach said that Hamdallah, who plays for Saudi football club Al Nassr, was on the initial list. “I know his story,” said Halilhodvic, adding that he contacted him to request that he join the team. “He told me that he does not want to play for the Moroccan team now.” Halilhodvic added that members of the football team’s technical staff and former football player  Mustafa Hajji had also contacted him. “He is a player with a lot of great potential, but he also has many flaws,” the coach said. It did not take much for the player to respond to Halilhovidc statements, stating that he had not received an invitation to play with Morocco. On an Instagram story post, Hamdallah said that he “denies the news that he refused to [play] with the Moroccan national team as I have not received an invitation from the coach nor the Moroccan Football Federation [FRMF].” In September, the football player promised to release a video to explain why he left the national team. In June, Hamdallah left the training camp where the Moroccan team was training in preparation for the 2019 African Cup of Nation (CAN). After his exit, the FRMF released a statement claiming that the football player left due to an injury. The explanation raised questions among Moroccan football fans. Several sports news outlets also said that the major cause of his exit was a rift with his teammate Faycal Fajr during a friendly match between Morocco and Gambia in June. The new head coach said that he has been following Hamdallah during his latest games with Al Nassr. “I saw his reactions in the latest games with his club, he received several [yellow] cards. This is negative for a football player.” The coach said that he trusts the lineup he has for these two friendly games, including  Amine Harit and Youssef En-nesyri. Halilhodvic said that what happened with Hamdallah is similar to the case of Kevin Malcuit, a Moroccan-French football player. Halilhovidc called Malcuit to join the Atlas Lions in the game, but he refused the invitation.

Rabat – The film adaptation of Leila Slimani’s Goncourt-winning novel, “Chanson Douce,” is set to hit the big screens on November 27, a recently released trailer has indicated. While the movie adaptation of the novel had already been announced as in project, it was unclear who the actors would be and how similar the film version would be to the enchanting horror that made the book such a big success. But the trailer, which features actress Karina Viard magisterially personifying Louise, the complex nanny figure at the heart of the novel’s bitter-sweet reflection on motherhood, marriage, love, and Parisian life in general, appears set to echo the novel’s elusively engrossing drama. Added to Viard’s masterful personification of Louise is the combination of the talented Leïla Bekhti and the Cesar-winning Antoine Reinartz, playing the role of husband and wife, parents and bosses of the disgruntled, deceptively angelic Louise. Rabat-born Slimani started her career as a reporter for Francophone magazine Jeune Afrique, writing on social issues (especially women’s rights and the intersection of religion and cultural mores) in North Africa. After taking a break from journalism to focus on and hone her creative writing, Slimani hit France’s bookshelves in 2014 with her promising debut novel, Le Jardin de l’ogre (In the Garden of the Ogre). But it was her 2016 novel, Chanson Douce (translated into English as Perfect Nanny in America, and Lullaby in Britain) which definitely shot her star in the skies of Franco-Moroccan and world literature. The book’s “artfully calculated prose” was central in many readers and reviewers’ favorable view of Slimani’s writing. “Leila Slimani doesn’t care if you’re uncomfortable,” one literary reporter recently wrote, speaking of the agonizingly pleasant texture of Chanson Douce. American feminist and writer Roxane Gaye echoed that sentiment in her review of the novel. Chanson Douce, Gaye wrote, “is incredibly engaging and disturbing . . . You read the entire novel knowing something terrible is coming. In that, Slimani has us in her thrall.” With such wildly positive, A-rate reviews of the novel, it remains to be seen whether the film adaptation, whose talented crew suggests a certain desire to duplicate the same special effects, similar critical acclaim, will be as artful and irresistible as Slimani’s celebrated minimalist prose.

The International Institute for Tolerance (IIT) in Dubai established the summit last year as part of an initiative led by His Highness to instill values of tolerance and peace amongst countries, societies, and individuals.  Dr. Hamad bin Sheikh Ahmed Al Shaibani, the managing director of IIT, believes that the summit demonstrates the UAE’s commitment to the values represented by the culture of dialogue and acceptance in accordance with the UAE’s founding values.  These values of tolerance were inscribed in the UAE by the founding fathers under late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, according to the press release.  “Since its inception, the UAE has provided a true translation of the values of tolerance and openness,” Sultan Butti bin Mejren, the Chairman of Emirates Real Estate Solutions, states in the press release.  “Values of respect and equality derived from sharia laws and authentic Arab customs have helped create this ideal climate in a country like the UAE which ensures tolerance, and where everyone contributes to the progress and prosperity of the society.”

The Moroccan fighters visited the American boxer for a media day. Tyson hosted a number of UFC champions to announce the creation of “Dominance MMA Management,” a company bringing together the biggest names in mixed martial arts (MMA) in the aim of securing the biggest fights and contracts for them. Ottman and Abu Bakr are known as the only Moroccans who signed a contract with UFC, the largest MMA promotion company in the world.

Tyson has appeared in several films, including a documentary and a Broadway show on his life.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has unveiled shortlist of the new minister as part of the government reshuffle, urged by King Mohammed VI. Despite King Mohammed VI’s instructions to inject fresh blood into the government with a new generation of names in Moroccan politics, most of the newly appointed ministers’ faces are familiar on Morocco’s political scene. Anas Doukkali, a member of the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) lost his position as the Minister of Health. The new cabinet will see him replaced by Khalid Ait Taleb. Mohamed Amkraz, also from the PJD, will replace his fellow party member Mohamed Yatim as Minister of Employment. Member of Morocco’s Constitutional Party Houssein Abyaba will replace Minister of Sports and Youth Rachid Talbi Alami. Abyaba will also replace the Spokesperson of the Moroccan Government, and Mustafa El Khalfi. The new government spokesperson is also tipped to become Minister for Culture, leaving him with three top government roles.  Mohamed Benabdelkader, member of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) will replace Mohamed Aujar as the Minister of Justice. USFP lost its position in the Ministry delegate in charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad after the appointment of PJD members Nezha El Ouafi to replace Abdelkrim Benatiq. Nadia Fettah, who is a new face in the government, will replace Mohamed Sajid Minister of Tourism. PJD will retain its position in the Ministry of Human Rights, headed by party member Mustapha Ramid. Other officials who will keep their positions include Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah from the PJD ; Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhannouch from the National Rally of Independents (RNI).  Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, Minister of Economy and Finance Mohammed Benchaaboun, Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Ellalmi, Minister of Education Said Amzazi; and Minister of Logistics Abdelkader Amara will also retain their government seats. Other members leaving the current government include Minister of Solidarity and Family Bassima Hakkaoui, and  Secretary of state to the ministry for transport Najib Boulif. Minister of Culture Mohamed Laraaj , Minister of Governance Lahcen Daoudi, and Secretary of State to the Minister of Industry  Rkia Derham also lost their government positions in the reshuffle. Revitalizing Morocco’s political elite In his latest speeches, King Mohammed VI called on the Head of Government to revitalize Morocco’s political elite and renew its public services.  The King was clear that high-level national elites should be “chosen on merit and competence.” The King said in his Throne Day Speech that he had tasked Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani to prepare a list of competent elites eligible to take part in government. The monarch urged El Othmani to consider people with high competencies in order to contribute to the country’s social development. “I ask the Head of Government to submit to me, after the summer break, proposals to fill executive posts in the Government and the civil service with high-level national elites chosen on merit and competence,” he said. Morocco’s socio-economic stability is precarious, provoking the Kin to call for a new development model to serve the demands of Moroccan citizens. Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Morocco’s Central Bank made it clear in front of the monarch that Morocco’s economic performance does not meet growing social demands.  The top banker made his comment in the King’s presence ahead of the Throne Day speech. The reshuffle is not the first of its kind under the leadership of the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD). Historical precedents In 2017, King Mohammed VI sacked Benkirane for delays in forming a government through coalition with other parties. The King subsequently appointed El Othmani, who promised to make his ministers work to serve the demands of Moroccan citizens. In January 2018, the King received the five new ministers set to fill the vacant positions in the Ministry of  Education, the Ministry of Urban Planning, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in charge of African Cooperation, and the secretary of state to the Minister of Education. Among the appointed ministers was Anas Doukkali, Minister of Health whose party the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) recently decided to withdraw from the recent government coalition. Earlier this month, the PPS issued a statement to announce its decision to leave the coalition. Doukkali, however, strongly contested the party’s decision. His colleagues, particularly the party’s leader Nabil Benabdellah and party member  Charafat Afilal criticized him for rejecting the party’s unanimous vote. Afilal called Doukkali an opportunist, who does not want to leave his position as a minister. She said that despite his presence on the political scene since 2010, Doukkali does not “get the political codes right.” “Leaving the government is not the end of the world,” she argued.

Rabat – Another US delegation arrived in Morocco to discuss ways to boost diplomatic and economic collaboration between Rabat and Washington. Democratic party congresswoman Karen Bass led the US delegation of American representatives to Morocco.  Bass told the press on Tuesday, October 9, after a meeting with Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita that the US officials are “very impressed by the noteworthy progress made in Morocco in recent years, particularly in terms of development.” The delegation’s meeting with the Moroccan official touched on “ways to strengthen cooperation between Rabat and Washington in a number of areas,” she said.  She also emphasized the need to make “more efforts to explore and open new horizons for bilateral relations.” Bass recalled the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Morocco and the UN. Morocco and the US signed the FTA on  June 15, 2004. The agreement has been effective since January 1, 2006. The official said that the US and Morocco have to use the “many benefits offered by this agreement. She recalled that Morocco is the “only African country linked to the USA by a free trade agreement.” Through the agreement, the volume between Morocco and the US more than quadrupled during the 2006-2018 period. The trade reached $5.44 billion in 2018, compared to $1.34 billion. Exports also increased more than fivefold to $1.38 billion in 2018 from just $0.26 billion in 2006, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported in July. The visit of the US representatives come less than two weeks after a delegation from the Banking Committee at the US Senate visited Morocco on September 30. Senator Richard Shelby, chairman of the Banking Committee at the US Senate, led the delegation. Shelby expressed his committee’s determination to boost partnership with Morocco.

Rabat – The popular London travel magazine “Wanderlust” announced on Wednesday, October 2, the winners of its annual World Guide Awards.  Every year, the magazine selects ten winners from a pool of over 4,000 nominees based on tourist testimonies and reviews. The top three receive gold, silver, and bronze awards.  This year, Moroccan tour guide Ismail Ingrioui earned the bronze award. “He received more testimonials than any other guide this year, and each was glowing with praise for him,” the magazine wrote of Ismail.  With his “unrivalled insight into local traditions, history and culture” and his “ability to go the extra mile,” Ismail has mastered his craft over nearly ten years.  The 31-year-old from Azilal in the Atlas Mountains currently works as a freelance trip leader and can be booked through the top-rated travel company Moroccan Guides Travel. 2019 marks the third year in a row that the magazine recognized Moroccan tour guides in their top three award-winners. Wanderlust recognized Moroccan tour guides in Khalid Lamlih in 2017 and Abderrahim Oukioud in 2018. The two guides received gold and bronze awards, respectively.   All three award-winning guides hail from the Atlas Mountains.  From Azilal to Marrakech Ismail described how he came to have the “exciting and enthusiastic life” of a tour guide.  Before launching his career, he told MWN, he lived a very simple life in the mountains of Azilal, looking after his father’s sheep during the summer holidays. Going to university was the turning point in his life, he said.  Ismail received his Bachelor’s degree in English at the University of Cadi Ayyad in Marrakech.  “Once I learned English, many opportunities were available to me, including guiding.” Ismail knew he wanted to share with foreigners “a slice of Morocco’s majestic imperial cities, famous Sahara desert walks, and regal mountain treks that only the locals know and enjoy.”  His career officially began in August 2010 after completing a one-year program at the Mountaineers Training Center (CFAMM) in Tabant. Since then, he has led over a hundred tours in the English language. “Education is the key. The more you focus on education now, the more opportunities you will get.” Traveling is the best teacher As a tour guide, Ismail is an ambassador of his country. He takes travelers all over Morocco. His favorite way to present his country to tourists is through visiting Chefchaouen, Fes, the Sahara, the Atlas Mountains, and Marrakech.  “Some parts of the country offer history, some nature, some beauty, and others offer a place for self reflection.” “My career is full of amazing and adventurous moments,” he said. “The best part of it is leaving a smile on travelers’ faces and making them fall in love with Morocco and its people.” Ismail also enjoys the opportunity to share his culture with travelers from all over the world. He loves to show tourists Moroccan hospitality and illuminate the generosity of his country’s people. “Being a guide has taught me a lot about my country and it opens my mind to other cultures,” he added. “Most of all, it taught me a lot about myself as a person, because as a trip leader, my work is about having a connection with people.”  He explained that in order to succeed in having a connection with others, one has to know themselves fully.  “Reflect. Understand yourself. Know what makes you happy, sad, and motivated; what gives you negative feelings.” As a tour guide, Ismail is constantly exposed to new people, cultures, and ideas. His thirst for learning inspired him to look beyond his home country of Morocco.  “Once I learned about my country, I pushed myself to travel and learn about other cultures.” Ismail has traveled to Canada, Europe, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Kenya, Brazil, England, and Peru. He also challenged himself to learn Russian and studied at the National University of Kharkiv in Ukraine for one year. He firmly believes that “traveling is the best teacher.” Ismail is grateful to be able to teach others about Morocco, and to learn from his travelers in return. He is humbled by the testimonials that earned him third place in the Wanderlust World Guide Awards. “His powerful personal story, told openly and sincerely, had a profound impact on us,” one testimony in the magazine says. “We were spellbound.” “Ismail gave the tour a very personal touch. He really focused on what would give us the best experience,” shares another testimonial.  Ismail is excited to continue this work and help even more travelers fall in love with Morocco.

Rabat – King Abdullah II of Jordan held on Tuesday, October 8, a phone call with King Mohammed VI to check on his health. Jordanian news Agency PETRA reported that King Abdullah “checked on the health of King Mohammed VI of Morocco.” The phone conversation came after a statement from the royal office announcing, on September 29, that King Mohammed VI contracted an “acute bilateral pneumonitis of the viral original.” The monarch’s health condition compelled his personal doctor to prescribe medical rest. King Abdullah checked on the health of the monarch after his “recovery from a recent ailment,” the Jordanian news agency added. King Abdullah of Jordan also wished the monarch “continued good health and well-being,” the statement added. Morocco and Jordan maintain strong diplomatic ties reinforced through the determination of both countries to strengthen their diplomatic ties. King Abdullah visited Morocco in March, when he met with King Mohammed VI to discuss several topics of common interest. During the visit, the Moroccan and Jordanian monarchs reiterated their commitment to the Palestinians’ struggle for rights and dignity of Palestinians. The visit also served as an opportunity for both to discuss ways to expand business ties between the two kingdoms. Morocco foreign minister Nasser Bourita reiterated his country’s commitment during his visit to Jordan in July. Bourita told the Jordanian press that his visit is meant to reaffirm Morocco’s commitment to the new “communication and cooperation channels” initiated between the two countries under the leadership of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI and Jordan’s Abdullah II.

Rabat – Guinea has renewed its commitment to maintaining “good and friendly” bilateral relations with Morocco, as well as its support for Morocco’s project to promote South-South cooperation. The news came after a meeting between Morocco’s Nasser Bourita and Tibou Kamara, Special Advisor to President Alpha Conde and Minister of Industry and SME. At a joint press conference following their meeting, the two officials spoke about the “special” and “historical” ties binding the two nations. They also maintained a shared desire to further their cooperation in a wide-range of fields. Education, agriculture, and energy all feature on the agenda. Speaking about Morocco’s growing significance and diplomatic assertiveness in African and South-South circles, said that Guinea is “ready to promote Morocco’s South-South vision, which is very dear to the [Moroccan] King.” He also commented on the relations that have traditionally existed between the Moroccan monarchy and successive Guinean regimes, pointing out that the depth of their cooperation is a reflection of “the spirit of brotherhood and friendship that have historically driven the relationship between our leaders.” He stressed, “Guinea will walk alongside Morocco on the road to African unity.” In response, Bourita said that the Guinean minister’s warm words testify to the good reputation and respect Morocco has earned in years of perceived dedication to furthering African causes and promoting regional stability and cooperation. Like Kamara, Bourita spoke at length about Morocco’s South-South vision, and King Mohammed’s well-established, abiding interest in Africa and pan-Africanism. “We will work together to implement the shared orientations of our two governments and reinforce our singular relationship.” Guinea’s support comes as yet another morale boost for Morocco’s African diplomacy. In the past months, Morocco has perceptibly won the hearts and minds of many on the continent, driving some commentators to dub the country “the face of modern Africa.” More specifically, since its readmission to the African Union, Rabat has established itself as a prominent promoter of African issues at the global level, a trendsetter on socio-economic and development projects, and a reliable partner on key areas like security, agriculture, and education. Late last month, a number of African delegations at the UN General Assembly “saluted” Morocco’s pan-African vocation, “commitment to African causes.”

Frankfurt – Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP) is set to grow 2.9% in 2019, Minister of Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun told the cabinet on Tuesday, October 8. The 2019 Finance Bill, enacted in November 2018, projected a growth rate of 3.2%. Benchaaboun noted that healthy domestic demand has supported the growth of the economy. Overall non-agricultural production is set to have grown significantly more than it did in 2018, at 3.3% growth compared to 2.6% growth. The World Bank also predicts growth of 2.9% in Morocco’s economy in 2019. Morocco’s GDP has not grown as fast as it did last year (3%) or in 2017 (4.1%). However, the International Monetary Fund, which projected 2019 growth at 3.2%, expects the growth rate to increase to 4.5% by 2024. After the cabinet meeting, Government Spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi spoke in a press conference on Benchaaboun’s report, including his predictions on the government budget deficit in 2019.  The 2019 Finance Bill set a budget of MAD 443 billion, which the government expected to be higher than its revenue. Benchaaboun gave the figures in a presentation on his plans for the 2020 Finance Bill. While the 2019 Finance Bill anticipated a government budget deficit of 3.3%, Benchaaboun said the deficit will actually reach 3.5%. The rate of overspending is still lower than it was in 2018. The 2018 deficit was 3.7%.  Apart from 2017, when the deficit was also 3.5%, the 2019 deficit will be the lowest deficit the Moroccan government has carried since 2009. The GDP growth rate and budget deficit may seem disappointing, especially considering the 2019 Finance Bill’s aspirations. Benchaaboun, however, noted that Morocco kept the deficit under control despite the high cost of social programs. Earlier in the year, the government made a “social dialogue” agreement with civil servants after strike. The agreement will cost MAD 14 billion. Of this significant sum, 6 billion will be spent this year. Out of its MAD 443 billion budget, the government will spend MAD 18 billion on its traditional subsidies of sugar, butane gas, and flour. An increase in the price of butane gas contributed to higher subsidy fund spending. The government has also spent increased amounts on the Tayssir program that helps rural families send their children to school, more university scholarships, improvements to the Medical Assistance Program (RAMED), and other programs for widows and people with disabilities. This year, the government implemented the third phase of the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), a five-year phase that is set to cost MAD 18 billion. Phase III of the initiative will focus on four programs: Reducing unequal distribution of infrastructure and basic services, supporting the vulnerable, economically integrating young people, and investing in education. Benchaaboun also noted the MAD 3.6 billion the government spent on the Advanced Regionalization Project and other funding for the Anti Spatial Disparities Program. In addition to social program spending, the government spent a large portion of the budget on paying its arrears to companies.  Benchaaboun said the government “decided to make 2019 the year of the settlement of State arrears’ repayment in respect of VAT. The government repaid companies approximately MAD 40 billion.

Rabat – The American luxury and lifestyle travel magazine Conde Nast Traveler published on Monday, October 7, their ranking for the Reader’s Choice Awards. Royal Mansour Hotel placed as the best hotel in Africa and the 6th best hotel in the world. Reader’s Choice Awards is an annual survey that the magazine launched in 32 years ago. It lists the best 50 hotels, resorts, cities, islands, and cruise lines around the world. The magazine bases its rankings on the votes of more than 600,000 travelers. Conde Nast Traveler wrote a review about the Marrakchi hotel, describing it as “a swoon-worthy showpiece of Moroccan decorative art.” The hotel is comprised of 53 individual riads, each with a courtyard, a living room, a bedroom, and a private rooftop terrace. Facilities provided by Royal Mansour are indoor and outdoor swimming pools, spas, and two restaurants: La Grande Table Marocaine and La Grande Table Française. The hotel also implemented an underground tunnel system which the staff, dressed as “genie-like butlers,” use to travel around the hotel unseen. Royal Mansour has won many awards in recent years, marking it as the best hotel in Morocco and Africa, and one of the best hotels worldwide. In 2017, Conde Nast Traveler Reader’s Travel Award selected the Moroccan hotel as the best hotel spa in the world. Royal Mansour was not the only Moroccan hotel on this year’s list. La Mamounia Hotel, also in Marrakech, ranked 28th best hotel in the world. Marrakech is known as the tourist capital of Morocco, receiving more than 2 million tourists every year. Celebrities regularly visit the ochre city to celebrate their birthdays, most recently the American rapper Ludacris and the pop singer Madonna.

Rabat – Police arrested on Tuesday, October 9,  a man and his wife for their involvement in the sexual assault of a woman. The General Directorate of National Security announced in a statement that police arrested the two suspects in Sale, Rabat’s twin city.   The 36-year old man, who works as a street vendor along with his 26-year old wife“raped the victim with a bottle of beer,” the statement said.  Police added that the two suspects were under the influence of drugs. Police seized five video recordings documenting the assault on the suspect’s phone. “This criminal act is motivated by revenge because of an alleged relationship between the man and the victim,” the statement said. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation. The incident is not the first of its kind. In July, a rape case caused uproar and protests after eight suspects raped a woman in Rabat.  The suspects also posted the video of the rape crime online, causing a nationwide uproar on social media.  The main suspect used several devices to rape the victim, including a bottle. The violent rape caused the death of the victim. Morocco has witnessed several shocking rape cases in recent years.  Cases of sexual harassment and violence against women are also prevalent.  The increase of such crimes led women’s rights activists to urge the government to implement Law 103-13  to hand severe punishments to all suspects involved in sexual assault, domestic violence, and public harassment. Despite the implementation of the law in September 2018, such crimes still persist. Activists and feminists believe that the law has not made any difference as it does not explain what the victims should do in case of rape and how security services have to tackle sexual assault. International human rights lawyer Stephannie Wilman Bordat told Morocco World News that the law cannot be described as a “law because it has 17 articles so it is really extremely short and it did not address any of the issues related to gender-based violence that Moroccan women and NGOs have been advocating for ten years.”

Rabat – The Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) published on Monday, October 7, statistics on non-EU immigrants currently residing in France. These statistics exclude immigrants who have obtained French nationality or citizenship. According to the INSEE statistics, of France’s 67 million inhabitants, 4.1 million are immigrants.  Maghrebi nationalities make up almost half of this figure with 1.83 million people.   Algerians constitute France’s largest immigrant community. With 807,500 people, this group is 20% of the total number of non-EU nationals in France.  Moroccans are the second largest non-EU nationality present in France, with 755,400 people, or 18.4% of the total immigrant population.  Tunisians add another 275,900 people to the Maghrebi immigrant community.  France is also home to 622,000 Portuguese nationals, along with 286,400 Italians and 248,000 Spaniards. However, citizens of the EU who live in France are not considered migrants.  Moroccans in France The French Ministry of Interior and the Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian confirmed that between 300,000 and 400,000 Moroccans received visas for France in 2018.  Moroccans are also the largest foreign student community in France. 39,855 Moroccan students were enrolled in French higher education institutions during the 2017/2018 academic year.  Additionally, Moroccans are the second-largest community of foreign-born doctors practicing in France. 7,000 Moroccans are enrolled in the French order of doctors as of 2018.    France deported more than 1,000 undocumented Moroccan migrants in 2018, making Moroccans the 4th most commonly deported nationality in France.  France remains a popular destination for Moroccans who are pursuing economic and educational opportunities, traveling for leisure, or living abroad.

Rabat – The World Bank has announced a new $500 million loan to finance a program to support Morocco’s education sector. The Moroccan Ministry of Education and Vocational Training and the World Bank are set to launch a new education program, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. The program seeks to support the goal of improving educational results for all. It will benefit from a World Bank fund of $500 million in the form of a program loan for results “under which disbursement of funds is conditional on achieving key results.” Hind Belhabib, the official in charge of strategic direction, statistics and planning at the ministry said that the program is part of the support that the World Bank gives to the Moroccan government, especially to the national education sector. She added that the program aims to help with the implementation of the strategic vision of the 2015-230 reform and the framework law on the education and training system. Belhabib emphasized that the ministry seeks to generalize the education of children between four and five years old. In recent years, Morocco has accepted loans from several financial institutions amid rising of external debts. Several officials, including the Head of Court of Auditors Driss Jettou, President of High Commission for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi, and the governor of the Central Bank Abdellatif Jouahri warned the government that debt is weighing down Morocco’s economic growth. Last year, Jouahri said he expected external debt to rise to 16.6% of Morocco’s GDP in 2019, up from 13.8% of GDP in 2018. Jouahri acknowledged in July that Morocco is experiencing a financial crisis as the country’s economic performance was not able to keep up with the “growing social demands.” Data from CEIC shows that Morocco’s external debt reached $51.3 billion in March 2019.

The 20-year old football player told sports news outlet AS about his goals, achievements, and future plans. Hakimi, who plays for Germany’s Borussia Dortmund, said he is proud of what he has achieved so far. “I’m now a different Achraf,” he said. When asked about his performance in the Bundesliga, the international player said that he “brought” his style to German football. “I brought my style of play and my ideas on the game when I came, but I also know I had to improve a lot.” He is also proud of the achievement and improvement he has experienced with Dortmund. “And ever since I arrived, I’ve felt like, bit by bit, I’ve been doing just that.” He also described himself as a better player, getting “regular football, playing week in, week out and really enjoying myself.” The Moroccan player said that confidence is the key to better performance. Speaking about his impressive performance in his last game with Dortmund against  Slavia Prague on the Champions League, the football player said that he was delighted to help the team to win. “It’s a tough group,” he said. Hakimi scored two goals in the match. “Those two goals are for my partner [th actor Hiba Abouk] and the baby we’re expecting. We always talk before games,” Hakimi said. The football player revealed that he promised his girlfriend that he would score a goal and dedicate it to his unborn baby and his partner. “Well, in the end, they got one each,” he said. Last week, Hakimi announced his girlfriend’s pregnancy via Instagram. “Yesterday I promised my lady that I would go out on the field with a clear objective: to score a goal to dedicate to our future baby. The joy and enthusiasm pushed me to score not one, but two. Thanks to Hiba Abouk for making me feel the best feeling that can exist, and for being my life partner and my best friend! I love you!” wrote the football player in Spanish. Hakimi is both a key player for Morocco’s national team and for Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund’s captain and teammate Marco Reus said that Hakimi is a “weapon” for the German club. “He’s incredibly fast. He played sensationally, that first goal was really outstanding,” Reus said after the win.

Rabat – PSA Group’s CEO Carlos Travers said that the French manufacturer’s new plant, inaugurated in June in Kenitra near Rabat, is “one of the most efficient” factories. On Monday, October 7, Travers said in Zaragoza that the new PSA plant in Kenitra has an annual production capacity of 100,000 vehicles and associated motors. Speaking about the PSA group’s factories, “the plants in Zaragoza, Madrid, and VIGO are progressing satisfactorily in terms of competitiveness, although those in Portugal and Morocco are still more efficient.” He added that the best thing to do is to “share the best practices developed by each of these factories.” PSGA is one of the leading companies operating in Morocco, a promising market for the automotive industry. The French company seeks to produce 200,000 cars per year by 2020, exceeding the 100,000 expected in the original 2015 contract. At the opening, both PSA leadership and the Moroccan government reiterated the notion that the launch of PSA’s Kenitra plants came as part of a larger scheme to make Morocco Africa’s go-to destination for investment and innovation.  PSA Group’s workforce in Morocco stood at 350 in 2017 and is expected to reach 2,200 by the end of 2019, in addition to 20,000 indirect jobs. In 2017, PSA Group’s worldwide sales reached a record of 3.63 million vehicles compared to 3.15 million in 2016, up 15 %. The Ministry of Trade and Industry announced in April that the automotive industry creates more jobs than other sectors. The ministry said that between 2016 and 2018, the industry created 116,611 jobs, representing 28.8% of all new jobs in the time period.

Rabat – When the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS) announced its withdrawal from the current government coalition, led by its Islamist ally the Justice and Development Party (PJD), it signaled the end of a honeymoon between two political formations that, until the handshake on their collaboration in late 2011, had very little in common. The left-wing party exited the government ahead of a reshuffle that was heralded by some media outlets as the end of the government coalition. Speculation was rife that the cabinet reshuffle would see the PPS reduced to just one ministerial department, or removed from the coalition altogether. In any case, the decision that was taken by PPS’ political bureau and endorsed by its central committee on October 4 marks the end of 22 years of participation in the Moroccan government.  Despite being relatively small in size compared to other political formations, PPS remained a key player in government coalitions since 1997. The party played a role in Moroccan politics that exceeded the number of parliamentary seats the party won with every election. PPS’s participation in three governments from 1997 to 2011 (led by then-prime ministers Abderrahmane El Youssoufi, Driss Jetto, and Abbas El Fassi) was understood because it was part of a coalition led by either of its two historical allies, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, best known by its French acronym USFP, and the Party of Istiqlal (PI).  The three formed what was known in Arabic as the ‘’Koutla Demoqratiya’’ (the Democratic bloc). The ‘’Koutla’’ was the main political opposition to the late King Hassan II and the governments were led by parties which his infamous Ministry of Interior had created to win elections through fraud. But, when in 2011 the former leader of PJD, Abdelilah Benkirane, extended an invitation to PPS to join his coalition, the party was divided over whether to accept or reject the groundbreaking offer. The main subject of contention was the ideological differences between the ex-communist party and the Islamists. The two parties were on opposite sides when the controversy over the change in the family code broke out at the turn of the 21st century; the changes were deemed by conservatives as too liberal. At the time PPS’ former minister Mohamed Said Saadi was heading the ministerial department that introduced the plan to reform the ‘’Moudawana’’. So, when PPS’s members were urged by their leadership to accept Benkirane’s extended hand to join his upcoming government, Saadi was the most prominent detractor from the potential ‘’unholy’’ alliance. Despite being divided over the issue, PPS ended up accepting the offer. Over time the ex-communist party became PJD’s closest ally. The alliance was fostered by a strong relationship between the leaders of the two parties, Benkirane, and Mohamed Nabil Benabdellah. Benkirane was so generous with PPS that he offered them four ministerial departments in his first government. This was something that the left-wing party had never achieved in the past, while serving alongside its longtime allies. Other factors also contributed to solidifying this partnership. In July 2013 the Party of Istiqlal, then led by the highly controversial Hamid Chabat, withdrew from the government over a disagreement with Benkirane, forcing the latter to swallow his pride and invite his foes at the National Rally of Independents (RNI) to join his majority. The fourth party to join the coalition, the Popular Movement (MP), was easily swayed left or right and was not an ally Benkirane could count on in times of need.  In 2016, MP sided with RNI in an effort to twist Benkirane’s hand as he sought forming a government after an impressive victory in general elections. Both parties said they would only join Benkirane’s coalition if two of their allies, the USFP and the Constitutional Union (UC), could join as well. Furthermore, Benkirane had to exclude Chabat and his party, with whom he reconciled, from any coalition. Facing such adversity, PPS was the only true friend the Islamist party had. Siding with PJD proved, however, to be politically detrimental to the left-wing party when it became entangled in the existing tension between the PJD and the Royal Palace. In September 2016, Benabdellah drew upon himself and his party the wrath of the Royal palace when he criticized the King’s friend and personal advisor Fouad Ali El Himma for his alleged continued support for the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), which he co-founded in 2008.  The Royal palace issued an unprecedented communiqué in harsh-language. The communique accused Benabdellah of making ‘’false statements’’ during an election period. PAM was hoping at the time to defeat PJD but ultimately the Islamist party prevailed. PPS would, later on, pay a heavier price for its alliance with PJD. In October 2017, King Mohammed VI dismissed Benabdellah, then the minister of housing, and Houcine El Ouardi, who served as the minister of health under both Benkirane and the current Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani.  The two PPS cabinet members, along with two other ministers, were accused of poor performance and were held responsible for the delay of projects in Al Hoceima, the scene of months-long protests calling for employment and development for the impoverished region. Members of the left-wing party felt that their ministers had been singled out by the Royal Palace. PPS’ former secretary-general Moulay Ismail Alaoui said that his party co-members “did not deserve to be sacked’’, expressing his astonishment over why other ministers, whose departments were also involved in the projects, had been spared. Now that the ex-communist party prepares to regain the opposition parliamentary seats after two decades in government questions arise. The future of the PPS itself comes into question, but also the future of its former ally, the PJD. While the PJD theoretically continues to lead the government coalition, the question is how much influence the Islamists will really retain now they are left with parties that historically have shown them little sympathy.  The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – Moroccan organizations and activists fighting for the rights of people with special needs will take to the streets to protest in Rabat on Saturday, October 12. The demonstrations will start in front of Bab El Had, in the medina of Rabat, at 10 am. The National Association of People with Disabilities, the National Association of Unemployed People, the National Association of Visually Impaired People, and other non-profit organizations will all be present at the demonstration. “We want the government to activate their plans to promote handicapped people’s rights. They keep giving us fake promises to improve Morocco’s image on the international level, but in reality, disabled people in Morocco are still living in a very difficult situation,” Hafid El Hanouni, a member of the National Association of Visually Impaired People, told Morocco World News. The activists have a sizeable list of needs. Some of the most urgent, according to El Hanouni, are ID cards designed for people with special needs, social grants, free transport, and employment. The protesters will also ask for special schooling facilities, created for children with mental disabilities. The protests coincide with the first anniversary of the death of Saber El Haloui, a visually impaired activist. The protester died on October 7, 2018, after falling from the rooftop of the ministry of families headquarters in Rabat. El Haloui fell during a sit-in of visually impaired citizens calling for employment. The upcoming manifestations will not only commemorate El Haloui’s death, but also the death of Miloud El Hamraoui during a similar manifestation, back in December 2011. El Hamraoui, a visually impaired activist, fell from an escalator during protests at the ministry of families headquarters. “If these incidents happened in a more developed democratic country, the minister would first of all resign. Not only that, but the government would also punish the people responsible for the incident,” said El Hanouni.

Rabat – Spanish police arrested a Moroccan born suspect on October 5  in Madrid for alleged manufacturing of explosives. On October 8, Spanish news outlet El Mundo shared new evidence from the investigation carried out upon the arrest of the Moroccan suspect.  The news outlet reported that the 23-year old alleged terrorist was plotting attacks against the Spanish Minister for Justice, Dolores Delgado. El Mundo reported that the suspect was planning attacks in several Madrid Metro stations and public spaces in Madrid. Legal sources quoted by the Spanish news outlet said that the suspect had a list of possible targets. The police seized a notebook in which the name of the Spanish acting Justice Minister appeared regularly. The suspect, who was born in Tetouan,  in northern Morocco, has Spanish citizenship. Police arrested the suspect for his involvement in a terror organization and “terrorist threats.” El Mundo said that the police also arrested the suspect’s father who was “subsequently released” without charges. A Spanish judge explained that the suspect was plotting to commit an “attack on behalf” of the ISIS terror group. Police allegedly seized a video of the suspect pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Baker Al Baghdadi. The suspect owned a video with a list of targets across Spain. Moroccan security forces regularly work with Spain to combat terrorism. Moroccan police, in cooperation with Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services, arrested a Moroccan terror suspect in April. The suspect was allegedly planning a terror attack in Seville, southern Spain. In June, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Spain is “Morocco’s largest trading partner and the two countries are linked by exemplary cooperation relations in several areas such as migration management and anti-terrorist cooperation.”

Rabat – Cuba’s ambassador to Morocco, Elio Eduardo Rodriguez Perdomo, announced yesterday, October 7, that Cuba plans to open an embassy in Rabat. The Cuban ambassador made the announcement during his meeting with Morocco’s Habib El Malki, President of the House of Representatives. The Cuban ambassador to Morocco presented his credentials in August 2018. However, he has been living in Paris, France, since his appointment. “All conditions are in place to raise the level of bilateral relations. The opening of a Cuban embassy in Rabat is an important step in this direction,” said El Malki, according to a press release published on the House of Representatives’ website. Perdomo also announced that his country will nominate a new ambassador to Morocco when the embassy opens. In July 2019, Moroccan sources revealed that the position will be assigned to Javier Domokos Ruiz, according to Spanish press agency EFE. The ambassador’s visit comes only two weeks after the Moroccan and Cuban ministers of foreign affairs met on the sidelines of the UN 74th General Assembly, in New York, United States. This visit is Perdomo’s third official visit to Morocco, after his first in August 2018, and a second visit in May 2019. Relations between Morocco and Cuba were frozen for almost 37 years. On April 21, 2017, the two countries decided to re-establish their diplomatic relations, following a visit of King Mohammed VI to the Caribbean country. Since the 1960’s, relations between the two countries were marked by increased tension as a result of Cuba’s decision to side with Algeria during the Morocco-Algerian military conflict of 1963 known as the “Sand War.” Cuba’s support for Algeria was motivated by the Caribbean country’s sense of affiliation with Algeria due to a mirrored struggle for independence. Morocco severed its relations with Cuba in 1980. For the past four decades, Cuba has welcomed and trained scores of young Sahrawis from the Tindouf camps. While Cuba still supports the Polisario, Moroccan analysts believe that the reestablishment of ties between Rabat and Havana could be a major step towards a more neutral stance from Cuba on the conflict.

Cooperation between the two countries has strengthened in recent years in terms of trade, tourism, diplomacy, and investment.  As of 2018, the relationship between Morocco and India is at its height. With joint security initiatives, an air services agreement, a social register program, and more than $1.5 billion USD in trade, strong ties between India and Morocco are proving to be a mutually-beneficial engagement.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on Friday that will deny entry to legal immigrants who cannot prove that they will have health insurance or the means to pay for it within 30 days of their arrival to the United States.  Trump argues that hospitals are providing care to uninsured individuals without compensation. These uncompensated care costs “can drive hospitals into insolvency,” the President states in the proclamation.  Uninsured individuals, he continues, strain taxpayers and government budgets by relying on publicly funded healthcare programs.  “Immigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our healthcare system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with higher costs,” Trump declares.  How much does health insurance cost? Most advanced and industrialized countries have a universal healthcare program. The US is an exception, and more than 40 million people do not have health insurance.  Some citizens receive coverage through their employers or share the plan of an insured parent or spouse. Others purchase healthcare plans independently.  Low-income citizens can rely on government-funded programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration.  Some health insurance companies and programs refuse to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.  Those hoping to immigrate to the US cannot benefit from federal health programs. Instead, they must receive health insurance through their employer or purchase a plan individually.  Premiums for individual unsubsidized health insurance plans average around $440 per month, but this rate can differ according to an individual’s age and state of residence. Family plans are significantly more costly and usually amount to more than $1,000 per month. Exemptions The proclamation is set to go into effect on November 3, 2019. It applies only to non-American citizens residing abroad seeking to apply for an immigrant visa to the US.  It does not apply to foreign nationals who receive a valid immigrant visa before the proclamation goes into effect.  Also exempt are refugees, asylum-seekers, non-citizen children of US citizens, recipients of Special Immigrant Visas, immigrants with a suitable sponsor in the US, unaccompanied migrants under the age of 18, immigrants who would carry out US law enforcement objectives, and immigrants whose entry would be of national interest. Applicants for immigrant visas will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Rabat – Over the weekend, a video of a “prank” on a poor man in Marrakech went viral. Social media users called for the pranksters to be severely punished, while groups of Moroccans visited the victim’s home to offer him aid.  The viral video shows two young men humiliating and mocking an impoverished elderly man.  One of the pranksters calls over the man and offers him charity, explaining that his boss instructed him to give to the needy. A friend films the encounter on his phone.  The main culprit counts out MAD 1,400 and pauses to ask the man, who appears to be in his 60s, if he has children. When he responds that he does not have children, the suspect removes MAD 200 from the stack of money.  The prankster then asks the man what he plans to do with the money. The man explains that he intends to pay his rent and bills, and perhaps buy food if he has money left over.   The offer of MAD 1,200 turns out to be a joke, and the youth curses at the old man. The prankster and his phone-wielding friend begin to laugh.    The prank sparked outrage across social media, and Facebook users condemned the cruelty of the video. “He deserves prison for what he did to that poor man,” one Facebook user said of the main culprit.  The viral video also garnered mainstream media attention within Morocco.  Yesterday, the Arabic-language Moroccan media outlet Chouf TV interviewed the man at his home. The man spoke about his hardships to Chouf TV and described the pain he felt as the pranksters mocked him.  Charitable Moroccans also responded to the prank.  “Please give me the address of this person or any way that I can get to him,” one Facebook user commented on the Chouf TV clip. She was not the only one with the idea to help the man directly. Videos and photos posted to Facebook show groups of Moroccans cleaning the man’s house, helping him replace old and broken furniture, and offering him words of kindness. They also bought him a cell phone to use in case he needs something.  “All Moroccans should help this poor old man,” another user commented on Chouf TV’s video.  The French-language news outlet Le Site Info reported on Sunday that local police have opened an investigation into the case. Under Moroccan law, it is illegal to film and distribute footage of someone without the person’s explicit and freely-given consent.  Articles 447-1 and 447-2 of the Penal Code explicitly prohibit these intentional actions.  Under Article 447-1, the crime of recording a private exchange is punishable by six months to three years in prison, and a fine of MAD 2,000 to 20,000.   Under Article 447-2, the crime of distributing illegally recorded private information or conversations is punishable by one to three years in prison, and a fine of MAD 2,000 to 20,000.  The culprit from the prank video has allegedly expressed his remorse on Facebook and said that he intends to go to the man’s house to apologize.

Rabat – Violent clashes emerged yesterday, October 6, at the Popular Movement (MP) party’s headquarters, in Rabat, during the party’s national council. The party’s members held the council to come up with a 24-member list, to form MP’s political office. The members, however, were divided into two camps that could not agree on one list. The disagreement quickly evolved into a brawl.  Each of the two disputing groups supported a different member list. MP president Mohand Laenser chaired the first list, composed of mainly long-term  party members. The second list was led by MP member Mohamed Fadili, and included younger members of the party. The clashes caused injuries among the members and serious damage to the headquarters equipment. Members of the two groups brawled with each other and threw chairs.  The MP president left the party’s headquarters and called for police intervention. Police officers intervened to put a stop to the confrontation, and ambulances provided medical care to injured members.  The political party has not yet released a statement regarding the incident. This event happened only a few days before Moroccan Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, is expected to announce a new government members list. On July 29, King Mohammed VI called on the head of government to conduct a reshuffle. “I ask the Head of Government to submit to me, after the summer break, proposals to fill executive posts in the Government and the civil service with high-level national elites chosen on merit and competence,” the King said in his Throne Day speech. On October 1, the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS) left the Moroccan government. The PPS accused the political parties of the governmental coalition of  thinking about ministerial positions more than thinking about reforms.

Rabat – Minister of Health Anas Doukkali has announced his decision to step down from the political bureau of his party,  the Progress and Socialism Party (PPS). The decision comes less than a week after PPS  announced its decision to leave the government coalition, citing “lack of cohesion and  solidarity “between political parties in the government.” Last week, Doukkali strongly opposed his party’s decision to leave the coalition. Former Secretary of State Charafat Afilal, who is also a member  of the PPS criticized Doukkali, calling him an “opportunist.” Afailal told Media24 that when the party members voted for the party’s withdrawal from the government Doukkali “violently” contested the “unanimous decision.” Despite being part of the party since 2019, “he [Doukkali] gave the impression of having believed that our participation in the government was eternal.” She also accused him of making some young people in the PPS to protest the vote. “He tried to stop the vote and suddenly I lost my temper against a minority that wanted to sabotage the process while some members came from far away to validate the decision of the political burdeau.” Afilal said that Doukkali does not “get the codes of political parties right, personally I was a minister for five years and it was not the end of the world when I was told to leave the government.”  The former minister suggested that Doukkali does not want his party to leave the government so that he can remain at the head of the Ministry of Health. Several videos documenting the vote inside the political bureau of the PPS show Doukkali strongly arguing with the leader of the PPS Nabil Benabdellah. At one point, Doukkali appeared urging Benabdellah to count some group of young people in the back of the room who were protesting the decision to leave the government. The videos, however also showed large number of PPS members voting for the decision to leave the coalition. King Mohammed VI appointed Doukkali as minister of health in November 2018.

Rabat – Polisario separatists continue to express frustration at the support Morocco has garnered in recent years from international powers, such as Spain and France. Pro-Polisario news outlet ESC Sahraui published an opinion piece  under the title “France pushes Sahrawis towards the inevitable, devastating war in North Africa.” The piece by Salem Mohamed reflects the Polisario Front’s frustration a the position of several countries in favor of Morocco’s sovereignty. “The authorities of the French state crossed line by using commercial and political blackmail to influence the UN’s decisions regarding the Western Sahara conflict,” the piece reads. For the author, Sahrawis in the region “run out of patience,” especially due to the lack of a political solution to end the conflict over the region. “Under these conditions, war is not a threat but an inevitable consequence since all possibilities for a political solution have vanished,” Mohamed said. The author also accused countries, such as Spain and France of supporting Morocco’s position for the sake of their own interests. The separatist reporter commented that it is only with a view to their own economic or political interests that countries such as France and Spain express support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. “The large economic investments in Morocco by France, Spain and other Western countries explain the current situation in Western Sahara: ‘A solution that is not the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara could cause a serious conflict for these states,’” ECS Sahraui reported. For the Moroccan government, the members and some non-members of the Security Council resolutions, however, the Autonomy Plan serves as a “serious and credible” solution that would help the region regain stability and serve the interest of Sahrawis. Submitted to the UN in 2007, the Autonomy Plan seeks to grant Sahrawis the right to devolved government and access to all necessary financial and economic support from Morocco. The publication purports that “western countries”supports Morocco’s due only to self-interest, causing frustration among Polisario supporters.  ECS Sahraui threatens that “All that means t 100% the beginning of a new war.” The publication also accused the US of self-interest, naming oil as the western giant’s motivation for supporting the Autonomy Plan. “Some maps showing that the entire north coast of Western Sahara can have significant oil and gas reserves have been made public in British magazines,” Mohamed wrote. The US angered the Polisario Front recently after an article from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said that the White House cannot support the creation of a state or “Western Sahara” in southern Morocco. The WSJ emphasized that the US emphasized its support during private talks with Morocco.

Rabat – The Ministry of Economy and Finance has released it’s half-yearly report on the execution of the 2019 Financial Law. According to the report, Morocco has a deficit of MAD 21.8 billion as of June 2019. When taking into account the 2019 Finance Act, however, Morocco achieved a surplus of MAD 13.3 billion during the same period.  Morocco’s 2019 Finance Act was approved in the winter of 2018. The project is based on a national growth rate of 3.2%, a contained inflation rate of less than 2%, and a constant budget deficit of 3.3%. The plan gives priority to bolstering social policies that focus on education, employment, and health. The other goals of the project are to stimulate private investment, pursue institutional and structural reforms, and preserve macroeconomic balances.  Since its implementation, the project has raised taxes on cigarettes, decreased some notary fees, raised vehicle circulation fees, and increased the subsidy fund.  Budget deficits arise when state spending outweighs state resources.  Total state resources reached MAD 236.4 billion during the first half of 2019. This figure is comprised of ordinary revenue (52.7%), medium and long-term debt receipts (26.8%), Special Accounts of the Treasury receipts (20%), and the revenues of the state services managed autonomously (0.5%). Total state expenses for the first half of 2019 amounted to MAD 223.1 billion. This figure is comprised of ordinary state expenses (54.7%), capital expenditure (14.5%), Special Accounts of the Treasury emissions (17.9%), and debt amortization (12.6%). Total state resources outweighed total state expenses in Morocco for the first six months of the year. Based on these figures, the 2019 Finance Act has generated a surplus of resources over expenses. The surplus amounts to MAD 13.3 billion.  However, calculating a state’s budget balance uses only ordinary revenue and ordinary expenses. Morocco has an ordinary resource balance of MAD 173.2 billion, while ordinary expenses total MAD 195 billion. The difference between the two figures is the budget deficit, which amounts to MAD 21.8 billion.    Budget balances from the first half of this year have met the goals of the 2019 Finance Act.

Rabat – Dutch-Moroccan Ouisam Karim has been stuck in the Spanish enclave of Melilla for over a month. While Karim was waiting for the Melilla-Malaga ferry after spending his vacation in Morocco, Spanish authorities confiscated his passport believing it to be a forgery.  Though of Moroccan origin, Karim was born in the Netherlands, in the city of Helmond near Eindhoven.  Karim’s family approached the Dutch newspaper Eindhovens Dagblad, who reported the case over the weekend. Karim was waiting in line with his ticket for the ferry on September 3 ready to go home again when police inspected his passport Upon inspecting Karim’s Dutch passport, the Spanish authorities grew skeptical and confiscated his passport. The police also took Karim into custody. Undocumented migrants attempting to cross to the border at Melilla, are known for using fake passports regularly. Police brutality “I was beaten and intimidated by police officers. I was not allowed to call anybody, I could not reach out to a lawyer and nobody spoke English,” Karim told Eindhovens Dagblad. In an attempt to alleviate the situation, Karim signed a paper he did not understand, but thought would ensure his release. Instead, he was kept in jail for two days. Police finally released Karim but without his passport or credit card. “I have asked the Dutch embassy for help several times, but they cut off the connection at every turn,” as Karim explained to NRC-Handelsblad.  Alone in Melilla without access to his bank account or identity documents, Karim was robbed and was forced to sleep on park benches. Dutch politician takes action Outraged by the situation and lack of progress, Karim’s family approached the media and raised alarm among politicians. Social-democratic member of the European Parliament Kati Piri took it upon herself to bring this pressing matter to her colleagues at the Hague who presented the case to the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs. “This situation is bizarre. Minister Grapperhaus [Minister of Justice. ed] flies all the way to Thailand to secure the release of a convicted owner of a coffee shop, but leaves this man in Melilla to himself? This is European soil for pity’s sake,” Piri told NRC-Handelsblad.   Hoe kan het gebeuren dat je als 24-jarige Nederlandse staatsburger vier weken (!) op straat moet zwerven in #Melilla en @minbuza geen slaapplek, geen paspoort, geen terugreis voor je regelt? https://t.co/aZQ3Y8tCSV — Kati Piri (@KatiPiri) October 5, 2019  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to NRC Handelsblad by stating: “We are in close contact with the Spanish authorities to provide them with the proper documents.” There was, however, no comment on the ongoing delays keeping Karim in Melilla; “The embassy is doing everything it can.” In a further bid to help Karim, Piri contacted the mayor of Arnhem in the Netherlands, Ahmed Marchouch. Marchouch, in turn, used his contacts in Melilla to organize safe accommodation for Karim.  “I know the complex situation in that particular region quite well, since I was born in a village close by,” Marcouch told NRC Handelsblad. “Acquaintances of mine have taken him under their wing (…) and Karim’s father provided me with a copy of his passport that was verified by an employment agency. Nothing indicates to anything suspicious.” Marchouch concluded by stating, “It is exceedingly worrisome this matter takes so long.” Karim’s family plans to travel to Melilla as soon as possible.

Essaouira – For as long as I can remember, two paracetamol or a pint of water was the remedy for most ailments in my parents’ household. My father, a retired army officer, has a rather comical obsession with dehydration which, I am afraid, I have inherited. Any time my husband says he has a headache or any other mild illness, my first response is to ask if he has had enough water to drink. In my defence, the answer is usually no.  While I am beginning to indoctrinate him with my family’s culture, it is no’t just a one way street. To my paracetamol and dehydration, my husband has a very long list of his grandmother’s remedies. Or, what I like to call, Mwee’s Magic.  I first became aware of traditional Moroccan cure-all remedies the first winter I spent in Casablanca. Having presumed, as most tourists do, that winter does not really exist in Morocco, I was surprised to find that it was actually very cold.  Soon after this realization, I got a cold and then a cough. My husband, concerned about the hacking sound I had begun to make, said we needed to consult a professional. Presuming he meant a doctor, I said there was no point. We set off, however, on his motorbike to visit “the professional.”  As we sped towards California, a more well-to-do area of Casablanca, I realised we were going to see Mwee. Upon arrival, my cough started to rear its ugly head, and Mwee sprang into action.  Returning from the pantry with garlic, olive oil, and a handful of figs, she set about stuffing each of the dried figs with a clove of garlic. She then put each of the stuffed figs into a small pan with a large glug of olive oil from her blad (countryside). Over the heat, the mixture began to look like a sort of unappetizing brown jam. I was given strict instructions to eat six spoonfuls before bed. I have to admit I was not thrilled with the idea of six entire spoonfuls of the pungent mixture, but I like to follow the “Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it” philosophy. After the first, forced spoonful, it was not actually that bad, and, after three nights of the medicine, I no longer had a cough.  Mwee, meaning mummy, is my husband’s grandmother. Everyone in the family from her own three daughters to her great grandchildren and her sons-in-law call her Mwee. Mwee was born in a village in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. She was brought up speaking Chleh, a dialect of Tamazight (Berber), and had no formal education.  Married young, she is now a great-grandmother to four at the age of 69. While she has never left Morocco, she can’t speak any other languages, nor can she read, she has a wealth of traditional knowledge and knowhow.  Mwee, like many Moroccan women of her generation and background, understands something perhaps more important—traditional healthcare methods, using only what the earth provides. While some of her remedies are from Islamic tradition, for instance the use of honey, her knowledge of herbal medicines comes from centuries of tradition, passed down from mother to daughter in the Amazigh (Berber) village where she grew up.   Convinced by the fig and garlic cough mixture, I have slowly added more of Mwee’s magic recipes to my repertoire and now make sure to have a cupboard stocked with figs, cumin, garlic, dates, zatar (dried thyme), and other herbs which I have not identified in English. Here are just a few of Mwee’s natural remedies—I have kept it simple as a novice in the world of Morocco’s health secrets. For children, or adults, having trouble sleeping, a handful of dried verbena boiled in milk in the evening is a simple way to ensure a good night’s sleep. Mwee puts a lot of sugar in it, as does my husband, but I prefer it as it comes. Being English, I really do not like to talk about bowel movements, but in this case it is necessary. If you have diarrhea (sometimes this is inevitable in Morocco), a spoonful of ground cumin, washed down with a glass of water—I cannot escape it—will solve the problem. Mixing these ground herbs and spices with honey can make a syrup which relieves the symptoms of asthma: Thyme, oregano, fennel, aniseeds, cumin, onion seeds, nigella seeds, verbena, chamomile, and fenugreek.  Zatar, or dried thyme, is a key ingredient in many of Mwee’s magic remedies but is most commonly used for an upset stomach. A spoonful of zatar brewed in boiled water is a quick way of resolving stomach pain without filling yourself with pharmaceutical products. The smoke from burned, dry wormwood can, according to my sources, reduce the chances of catching a cold. If lots of people in your house are suffering from the sniffles, burning a handful or wormwood can reduce the chances of the bug spreading.  Similarly, boiling the plant and then inhaling the steam also has beneficial properties for a sore throat or chest infection.  Cinnamon brewed in boiling water makes a delicious tea which can be used for pain relief—particularly for menstrual pain. Replacing the cinnamon with sage helps with hot flashes during the menopause.  Another tea, the leaves of an olive tree can be brewed in boiled water to make a tea to lower cholesterol.

Rabat – Countless research papers, analyses, and historical accounts tell the story of the Western Sahara conflict. However, these impersonal papers can only go so far in documenting the human stories of lost lives and lost dreams. The all too true story of the real impact on the lives of the Sahrawis can only be seen through the eyes of those who have lived the conflict.  Since the beginning of October, former senior Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud has been haunted by flashbacks of the guerilla war in Western Sahara which date back to the 1970s. Mustafa Salma recalls the bombs that destroyed Sahrawis’ houses and shelters, leaving them homeless and in search of a place of safety.  The groundbreaking narrative directly contradicts years of Polisario Front-led propaganda that Morocco was responsible for the displacement of thousands of Sawahris.  Mustafa Salma revealed the untold story about the guerilla war and how the Polisario Front exploited the violence to displace Sahrawis from Moroccan southern provinces to the Tindouf camps. The former separatist has spoken out about the violation of human rights by the Polisario front, a situation that has been ignored for decades by pro-Polisario academics and media. For Mustafa Salma, the Polisario is not and cannot represent Western Sahara or Sahrawis. There are documents and statistics, proving how the front forcibly kidnapped thousands of Sahrawis to the Tindouf camps. With several documents proving Polisario’s violations, Mustafa Salma questioned the existence of evidence that backs the Algerian and Polisario’s accusations against Morocco. Polisario and Algeria have long accused Morocco of displacing Sahrawis. But for Mustafa Salma the question remains whether there “is any evidence which  proves that Moroccan forces took Sahrawi families and displaced it by force to Algeria or to Morocco?” The answer is no. In contrast, Mustafa Salma has memories of the Polisario Front hunting Sahrawis and taking them by force to the Tindouf camps, a Polisario-run region in southern Algeria.   The camps are allegedly in dire conditions due to malnutrition, oppression, and other human rights violations. ‘I survived a massacre’ In one of his accounts posted on Facebook, Mustafa Salma took his followers on a journey into his memories of the conflict.  The former Polisario member entitled the post “how I survived the massacre.”   “I remember that my brother and I spent more than an hour to study on the evening of October 5  [1979]. It was the second month of the school season. We were in the fifth grade. The punishment was awaiting anyone who did not study. I remember that I organized my books and textbooks in my brown and black school bag,” Mustafa Salma wrote. He said that the school was three kilometers away from their house. “On the dawn of October the 6 we woke up terrified due to the sound of tanks ” and gunshots. “Suddenly and without warning, the bombs began to fall closer. We witnessed the explosions. The bombs were falling as fast as if they came from a machine gun. People rushed to enter their houses. Due to panic, I went into our neighbor’s house with some people,” Mustafa Salma recalled. The Polisario and Morocco fought for 16 years, it was the bloodiest war in the history of the dispute. The war ended with a partial settlement and a UN-brokered cease-fire in 1991. Hundreds died during the war while other Moroccan soldiers were held captive in the camps for more than 25 years. Mustafa Salma recalled that on the same day his house exploded. “When I came out I saw a pile of cement instead of our house.” Mustafa Salma said that it was the day when the Polisario Front took his with his cousin and her two sons to a place that they did” recognize. “After a few miles, they left us next to a river and they told us to hide in the trees. In the same river, I found my mother and my brother and we finished the journey that lasted four nights to the Tindouf camps with other 750 civilians from the city of Smara.” For Mustafa Salma, the displacement was the “largest kidnapping [ operation] and mass displacement of the Sahara war, which was called a ‘liberation, by the Polisario Front.” Since the 1970s, it has been propagated by the Polisario-led narrative that Morocco was responsible for the displacement of the Sahrawi people. Mustafa Salma’s testimony directly contradicts this unquestioned part of the history of the Western Sahara Conflict.  Displacement to the inferno Mustafa Salma recounted how the Polisario Front acknowledged the displacement and the kidnap of Sahrawis, who were taken by force to the Tindouf camps. “A statement from the Polisario Front acknowledged they took with them 166 citizens [from a region called] Lbouirat,” Mustafa Salma said. He added that the number of Sahrawis displaced from Tan-Tan to Tindouf must be bigger. Mustafa Salma said that people in the city of Tan-Tan “certainly have statistics on those who lost their families in that [displacement] process. They know exactly who burned Tan Tan market,” referring to the Polisario Front.  The former Polisario member added that the separatist group admitted in several official statements that it had “forcibly displaced”  more than 1,000 people from the southern provinces and from Oued Noun regions and took them to the Algerian territory during 1979. The Polisario Front, however, was blocked from accessing more of Morocco’s southern provinces after Moroccan security services started the construction of its security belt in 1980. “A massive displacement campaign began for several months, including the Sahara, northern Mauritania, and the Algerian-Malian border,” he said. Mustafa Salma said that the guerilla war was a bloody event. During the devastating battles of the 1970s,  he lost his two five-year-old sisters, as well as his pregnant cousin and her sibling. The Western Sahara conflict did not end with the UN-brokered 1991 cease-fire. Nearly 30 years later, the United Nations is leading the political process to find a mutually acceptable and agreed upon solution to end the dispute. The Security Council will convene by the end of October to vote on a new resolution to extend the mandate of the UN peacekeeping operation in the region, known as MINURSO.

Rabat- Amid the perception of sustained interest from some of Europe’s biggest teams, Hakim Ziyech’s Dutch Club, Ajax Amsterdam, has renewed its exit clause with the Moroccan football player. Ziyech’s sustained brilliance in both the Dutch league and the European Champions League is backing up the notion that he could be of enormous significance for any squad seeking to maintain or raise its attacking standards. Dutch outlet De Telegraaf reported on October 4 that Ajax has decided to “remove clause” from Ziyech’s contract so that the player’s European suitors can no longer pay “only €30 million” for Ziyech. By removing the €30-million clause from Ziyech’s contract, the Dutch club is partly understood to have sealed Ziyech’s undisputed tenure in the team’s project. Also relevant here is he Dutch champions’ perceived desire to seek more financial benefits from selling a player whose sustained performance means, as far as business is concerned, suitors’ increased willingness to buy. As well as sending the message that Ziyech is worth more than €30 million on the current transfer market, however, Ajax is also brushing aside any doubts they may have had about the Moroccan’s value or commitment to the club, according to De Telegraaf. Dubbing Ziyech “the Moroccan magician,” the Dutch newspaper suggested that Ajax’s move came as a result of “improved commitment” on both Ziyech’s and Ajax’s management sides. Both parties are understood, from the spirit driving the renewed contract, signed last month, to value their current relationship. But while the move clears out suggestions of Ziyech leaving the club during the January window in European football transfer, it remains to be seen whether the “Moroccan magician” will stay much longer in the Dutch capital. Ajax is yet to specify a new amount for Ziyech’s exit clause, but the player’s current status means that prospective amount will be far higher than the previous, €30-million clause. In a highly inflated market for football transfers, where clubs can pay exorbitant fees for a player they feel is needed to strengthen their squad, €50 or 70 million (a safe interval bet for an exit clause, should Ziyech keep up his current shape by the time one suitor finally comes knocking) is not particularly high for European heavy weights who still continue to verbally court the Moroccan’s services. Clubs like Arsenal and Bayern Munich are still reportedly following up with their desire to sign the Moroccan playmaker. Most recently, however, there are suggestions that Zinedine Zidane’s in-transition Real Madrid is among those seriously considering singing Ziyech. Madrid, one recent report suggested, is battling with England’s giants, including Unai Emery’s in-transition, promising Arsenal and Guardiola’s excellent Manchester City, to get the Moroccan from Ajax for an estimated fee of €50 million. While there has only been desultory mention of Ziyech in Real Madrid’s transfer targets, the idea of adding the Moroccan to a struggling Real Madrid team now easily comes across as a reliable, sensible suggestion as Real Madrid battles to improve its collective, sharpen its attacking arsenal. Although leading the Spanish league at the moment of this writing, Madrid has been largely unrecognizable on numerous occasions in the past weeks. What is more, with France’s PSG keen on keeping Neymar (Madrid’s priority) at all costs, and Real Madrid not really impressed with Eden Hazard, its biggest transfer after Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure, the idea of adding Ziyech to the squad is even more matter-of-fact. Football, however, is pretty much a mercurial business: Ziyech may end up extending with Ajax or signing with a club that has not been even cited among the frontrunners in the race to lure the Moroccan from Amsterdam. Key in the next Ziyech-Ajax-Europe tale will depend largely on the Moroccan’s form in this year’s Champions league. Should Ajax impress as they did last year, and should Ziyech be an invaluable, integral part of yet another stellar Ajax squad, €60 or 70 million for the Moroccan is no deterrence for a European market where clubs have paid as much for defenders or goalkeepers.

Rabat – Moroccan candidate Wiman Radwan mesmerized the jury of the Voice Middle East after she performed “you are the reason” by Calum Scott during the third blind audition of the competition on Saturday, October 5. Before turning around to convince the Moroccan woman to join their team, the jury members were touched by her calm and strong vocals. Egyptian singer Mohamed Hamaki was the first to buzz the button to discover that the strong vocals come o from a beautiful woman with pink lipstick, stylish glasses, and shiny long black hair. The 22-year old woman from Casablanca was sitting in a wheelchair, concentrating on performing her song and astonishing the jury. It took a few seconds for Moroccan diva Samira Said to join her jury colleague Hamaki. The singer publicly praised the young woman for her enthusiasm and the positive energy she brought to The Voice stage. Jury members Ahlam and Raghib Alama, two singers from the Middle East, also turned around for Wiman. Suffering from myopathy, the Moroccan woman dreams of becoming a singer despite all the challenges she is facing due to her illness. Myopathy is a disease of the muscles that causes muscle fibers to not function correctly. All of the jury members wanted to have Wiam in their teams, but she finally chose Hamaki, who shed some tears for her strength and the positive energy. “She was stronger than all of us,” he said. Wiam qualified for the second phase of the competition.

Rabat – Kaspersky, an anti-virus provider, has ranked Morocco 34th in the list of countries with the most detected cyber threats. Between April and June 2019, a total of more than 5.06 million internet users in Morocco were victims of cyberattacks, mainly malware attacks. Malware attacks execute unauthorized actions on the victim’s system. Kaspersky said in its quarterly bulletin on cybersecurity in Morocco, that around 30.7% of “Kaspersky Security Network” users were victims of web-based threats. Countries with the highest cybersecurity threats during the same period were Algeria with 44.1%, Nepal with 43%, and Albania with 40.1%. The director of Kaspersky’s BtoB sales in North Africa, Pascal Naudin, said that “the majority of threats can be addressed through simple reflexes and good actions to adopt.” In the second quarter of 2019, Kaspersky’s solutions detected more than 15,166 malware incidents locally on computers using Kaspersky Security Network in Morocco. The malware incidents were distributed via USB sticks, CDs, DVDs, and other “offline” methods   In total, 52.9% of users were victims of local threats between April and June, placing Morocco 61st worldwide. The report, Kaspersky explains that protection against such attacks requires not only an antivirus solution that can handle infected objects, but also a firewall, an anti-rootkit feature (a hidden process that changes the behavior of the operating system or even its kernel) and control on the devices. During the same period, the highest local threats were recorded in Afghanistan (71.3%), Tadjikistan (69.1%), and Uzbekistan (68.8%). The antivirus company further explained that when a Kaspersky customer is a victim of an online threat, the source of the threat is automatically saved.  Based on these data, the proportion of incidents caused by servers hosted in Morocco was 0.01% worldwide for the second quarter of 2019, it added. “This represents 44,293 incidents between April and June, placing Morocco 51st worldwide, far behind the top 3: the United States (54,51%), the Netherlands (22,44%) and Germany (4.04%),“ says the report.

Rabat – Nearly 515,000 visitors of all ages flocked to the Malbata space in Tangier, which hosted the third annual Open Days event initiated by the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The initiative seeks to advance communication and respect between security forces and citizens. The flow of citizens to the Open Days reflects the “growing interest of Moroccan and foreign tourists and residents,” the DGSN said in a statement. The Open Days kicked off on October 2 and ran until October 6 under the theme “Serving citizens, honor, and responsibility.” For the DGSN, the event was an “opportunity to interact positively with the expectations of citizens.” The event served as a platform to introduce DGSN’ bodies and to explain the different specialisms within Morocco’s security units “mobilized to preserve the security of citizens and the homeland,” added the statement.  At the Open Days, DGSN featured  50 exercises and simulations of the various security intervention against terrorism and organized crime. The event also included shows from biker brigades and musical troops as well as shows to inform the public of the DGSN various security units and corps and their missions. The Open Days also showcased the DGSN’s advanced equipment. The event hosted a space for a blood donation operation with the participation of police officers and visitors. Art was also part of the event as four police officers won a literary competition supervised by an academic jury. The four police officers who won the awards showed interest in poetry and prose. The DGSN also hosted a concert in honor of the police and their efforts to serve citizens. The national police expressed their deep “gratitude to all citizens and foreign nationals” who attended the Open Days. The DGSN also expressed satisfaction and appreciation to all “territorial authorities, elected councils, government departments, banking institutions, the private sector, civil society, and the media for contributing to the success of the” third annual Open Days event. The Open Days are part of Morocco’s security initiative to ensure communication, trust, and respect between security forces and citizens. Last year’s annual Open Days took place at Bab Jdid square in Marrakech. More than 260,000 visitors attended last year’s event.

Rabat – The Moroccan government and the MRC expressed the desire to strengthen cooperation in areas of common interest, including renewable energy and eco-tourism. Moroccan Secretary of State to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Mounia Boucetta met with the executive director of the MRC An Piche Hatda on Friday, October 4 to promote cooperation on water resource management. “The meeting was an opportunity to identify ways to strengthen cooperation and exchange of experiences between the two parties in several areas of common interest,” Hatda told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). He added that the partnership between the MRC and Morocco represents a good example of south-south cooperation. The areas of partnership between both parties include water resource management, “particularly the capacity building of the MRC in the field of irrigation through dispatching to Morocco a delegation of experts from the Commission to benefit from the Moroccan experience in this field,” he explained. The irrigation approach is part of Morocco’s Green Plan to cope with the water challenges in the country. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, the irrigation system is part of the approach for preserving natural resources with a “view of ensuring sustainable agriculture.” The commission also seeks to benefit from Morocco’s expertise and leadership in solar and wind energy. Hatda said that the MRC is also keen to “benefit from the Moroccan experience” in the eco-tourism, particularly in the sector of tourism training and the promotion of rivers within the tourism market. Expressing satisfaction with the partnership, Boucetta said that “Morocco is the first African and Arab country to enter into a partnership with the Mekong River Commission.” The Moroccan official concluded her statement, emphasizing that the partnership is in line with the kingdom’s determination to strengthen and diversify South-South, win-win cooperation.

Rabat – Israeli troops shot a Palestinian protester in the chest on Friday, October  4. The protester died of his wounds.  The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said that Israeli forces wounded at least 54 others in the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces continue violations against Palestinians, who have been protesting against the Israeli occupation as part of the Great March of Return. The weekly protests that began in March 2018. The Israeli army told AFP that 5,800 Palestinians gathered at different points along the fence. The Israeli forces claimed that some of the protesters “threw stones and explosive devices towards soldiers.” Israeli troops have been approaching protests violently against the demands of demonstrators, who have been calling for the “right to return” and the end of Israel’s 12-year old blockade of the Gaza Strip. The killing of the Palestinian protester comes a week after Israeli forces killed another demonstrator on Friday, September 27. The Ministry of Health in Palestine said that Israeli forces shot and injured 32victims during the protests. The United Nations along with several countries have condemned the continuous attacks on Palestinians. At the emergency meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on September 15 Secretary of State to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mounia Boucetta said that Israeli violations “undermined” the stability of the region and the two-state solution. The Moroccan official said that the violations also hinder international efforts to revive the peace process.

Rabat – Police have arrested two suspects for their alleged involvement in drug trafficking Oujda, eastern Morocco, near the Algerian border. The suspects are 39 and 41, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement on October 6. Police arrested the first suspect in possession of 320 grams of cannabis resin in a car with a fake number plate. Police arrested the second suspect during a search operation in Beni Drar in Oujda. Officers seized 556 kilograms of cannabis resin from the second suspect’s house, added DGSN. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation and to determine if there are any possible accomplices. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to combat drug trafficking across Morocco. The DGSN announced in September that security services had arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking from January 1 to September 15. During the same period, police seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives. Police also seized 1,161,000 psychotropic pills.

Pretoria – French prosecutors have handed over the case against a man who killed four people in the police headquarters to the National Anti-Terrorist Prosecutor’s Office. The referral came after initial investigations revealed the man’s connection to radical Islam. On Thursday, October 3, a man who worked in police headquarters in Paris viciously attacked five of his colleagues with knives, killing four before another police officer shot him dead. Originally, police investigated the attack as a criminal offense. Prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard announced in a press conference on Saturday that the attacker, Mickael Harpon, followed “a radical vision of Islam.” The attacker had converted to Islam 10 years ago. Citing altered and radicalized behavior, Ricard explained that there was evidence the Paris knife attack was a terrorist act. In the hours leading up to the attack, the alleged killer had sent his wife multiple religious text messages. Police have detained the man’s wife. The type of fatal wounds on one victim, the man’s connection to radical Salafis, his recent decision to stop wearing Western clothing, and his desire to end contact with women all pointed to a religious motivation for the attack, according to Ricard. Even more telling was that the attacker also defended the Charlie Hebdo attacks of 2015. The man worked for French police since 2003, according to Deutsche Welle. Although he carried out the attack with two metal knives which should have sounded the alarm when he walked through metal detectors, Le Parisien reported that insiders say regular workers at the police headquarters are “less controlled.” The man would have been the subject of a “high level of security screening,” just as everyone else in the intelligence division, Police Chief Didier Lallement said on Friday. The attacker was an IT expert in police headquarters. The headquarters sit on Paris’s famed Ile de la Cite, just a block away from Notre Dame. At lunch time on Thursday, the man went out of his office, bought two knives and returned to commit the attack. In a seven-minute spree, he killed three men who were eating their lunch in their offices and then attacked two women in the stairway and near elevators, according to Le Parisien. One of the women survived the attack. When the man entered the courtyard of the headquarters, a police officer challenged him to put down his weapon. When the attacker advanced, the police officer fatally shot him.

Rabat – A Moroccan delegation has attended the “consistory” ceremony in the Vatican in which Pope Francis made the archbishop of Rabat, Cristobal Lopez Romero, a cardinal. The delegation, led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, delivered a message from King Mohammed VI to the pope during their participation in the consistory on Saturday, October 5. The King said Lopez Romero’s installation as cardinal “enriches in the long term the convergence of [himself and the pope] on the ideals of active faith, living together, compassion, co-knowledge and service to the most deprived.” Bourita added that the “Cardinal will certainly know, within the College of Cardinals, how to carry not only a message of faith, but also a message of openness and co-knowledge.” The Moroccan delegation included Morocco’s Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq and the Moroccan ambassador to the Vatican, Rajaa Naji. The ceremony they attended marked the installation of 13 new cardinals. Pope Francis appointed Lopez Romero, a Spaniard, in December 2018. He was then ordained as the new archbishop of Rabat in March 2018. He succeeded Archbishop Vincent Landel, who retired. Born in 1952, Lopez Romero became a priest in 1979 in Barcelona.  The new archbishop has a vast knowledge of Moroccan culture, having worked in Morocco since 2003. The Spaniard also served in Paraguay from 1984 to 2002. The promotion of the archbishop of Rabat to the honored position of cardinal comes “in the wake of the Pope’s historic visit to the kingdom.” The royal message reiterated the King’s satisfaction with the visit of Pope Francis to Morocco in March. Bourita described the visit as historic by its “symbolism, its course, and its results.” Pope Francis has issued several statements to express gratitude for the warm welcome he received in Morocco. A week after his visit, Pope Francis said, “Last Saturday and Sunday [March 30-31], I completed an Apostolic Journey to Morocco, and I thank His Majesty King Mohammed VI and the other authorities, for their warm welcome.”

Rabat – Saudi Arabia will now allow unmarried foreign couples to share hotel rooms as part of its reforms to boost tourism. Traditionally, foreign couples had to prove their marriage through a document in order to get a hotel room.  However, with the new reforms under the leadership of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, couples are no longer in need of a document to prove they are married to stay in a hotel room. The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage said in a statement that only Saudi nationals are “asked to show family ID or proof of relationship when checking into hotels.” The statement added  that all women including Saudis “can book and stay in hotels alone, providing ID at check-in.”  On September 27, Saudi Arabia announced updates on its visa regulations, allowing  the entry of travelers from 52 countries and territories. The new visa regulations came into effect on September 28. In addition, female foreign tourists are not required to comply with the Saudi dress code if they dress up modestly.

Rabat – Egypt’s Arab Spring “Facebook Revolution” in 2011 popularized a modern era mobilization tactic. Social media expanded from a casual networking tool to a means for mass mobilization against oppressive regimes. Online platforms still play a central role for protesters, from Sudan to Venezuela to South Africa.  Masses possess a powerful tool to mobilize. At the same time, governments possess a powerful tool to manipulate public opinion. State-backed influence operations are on the rise, often marked by propaganda posts masquerading as news, and the use of bots to spam social media with retweets and Facebook likes.   Twitter suspended or removed thousands of accounts linked to Middle-Eastern governments, the company reported in a blog post September 20.  Six of these accounts were directly linked to Saudi Arabia’s state-run media. The accounts masqueraded as “independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favourable to the Saudi government,” according to Twitter.  Twitter also permanently suspended the account of Saud Al-Qahtani for violations of Twitter’s platform manipulation policies, in a “separate” move. The former Saudi royal adviser was fired last year after suspected involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, though sources say Al-Qahtani was not among those arrested and continued to advise Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after his dismissal.  Al-Qahtani ran the royal media center and reportedly strategized a state-run troll farm in Riyadh, which employed hundreds to spam social media with pro-Saudi messages, as well as attacks on rivals such as Qatar and Iran. The adviser initiated a blacklist on Twitter during the Persian Gulf crisis in 2017 that named, shamed, and endangered alleged Qatari sympathizers. Twitter’s account suspensions are little more than a symbolic move, according to Marc Owen Jones, an assistant professor in Middle East studies and digital humanities at Doha’s Hamad bin Khalifa University. “Like a game of whack-a-mole, suspended fake accounts will be replaced by more sophisticated efforts at deception,” Owen Jones explained. Twitter’s actions follow a Facebook move in August removing over 350 accounts linked to the Saudi government. Facebook’s announcement was the first time the Saudi state was officially tied to such influence operations. Saudi Arabia is not the only country to come under fire for such activity. Facebook has removed activity tied to Iran three times in 2019 alone.  Iran “has always had this contradictory position in relation to established media and emerging media. It has always expressed concerns from the outset that these media can be used as a form of cultural invasion from abroad, from Iran’s enemies…. But it has also always recognized the power of media to push forward its own agenda,” explained Niki Akhavan, chair of the Media and Communication Studies Department at the Catholic University of America. Facebook and Twitter have both suspended or removed thousands of accounts linked to the UAE and Egypt and operated by private third parties. A common thread in such influence operations is attacks on Qatar.  The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic and trade ties with Doha. They imposed a blockade on Qatar which has remained in place since June 2017. State social media operations aim to legitimize the blockade with domestic constituents. “The use of such trends as an indicator of public opinion all point to the ability of gulf regimes to co-opt social media as part of their control and censorship apparatus,” according to Owen Jones. “Perhaps more than anywhere, the gulf shows us how social media is being weaponized as a crucial delivery system for fake news, hate speech and propaganda.” Information wars are key in an era when social media gives public opinion a direct outlet and provides a direct channel to those forming opinions. The growing pattern shows the power of online platforms as new battlegrounds for regional rivalries with a history of proxy conflicts. Troll armies may rival military armies in strategic significance. “This is almost becoming normalized,” explained Ben Nimmo, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “Where you get geopolitical tensions, you get stuff like this going on, and we’re moving into a space where the platforms are dealing with this almost as routine.” Social media can empower individuals and masses. But this power is subject to manipulation. Influence campaigns continue to grow in frequency and complexity. Private social media companies struggle to root out and remove covert behavior. Experts estimate that the actual number of regional influence accounts may be in the millions.  ”It doesn’t matter how many of these accounts we delete, they’re just going to keep cropping back up,” said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute in Washington, D.C. Few approaches to managing online disinformation are on the public horizon.

Rabat – The father of Moroccan football player, Mohamed Ihattaren, died from cancer on  Sunday, October 6. Dutch football club  PSV expressed condolences to Ihattaren and his family.  “PSV mourns the loss of Mohamed Ihattaren’s father. PSV would like to send their thoughts and condolences to Mohamed and his relatives after today’s sad news,” the statement said. The 17-year old has cited his father’s illness several times when he was asked which national football team he would represent: Morocco or the Netherlands. Goal.com reported that the football player delayed making a decision as his father was fighting cancer. “My father is seriously ill. He suffers from cancer since a few months,” he said last time he was interviewed. Iharraten is expected make a decision by the end of the year, according the fo Football Oranje. Both the Moroccan national team and the Netherlands are interested in the football player, owing to his spectacular performances with PSV. Ihattaren  played seven games with his Dutch club so far this season.

Rabat – While oil tankers entering the Persian Gulf have sparked diplomatic crises, one Emirati entrepreneur would like to offer a warm welcome to a colossus. Abdullah Mohammed Salaiman Al Shehi is funding efforts to tow an Antarctic iceberg to the Gulf for freshwater harvesting.  The director of Abu Dhabi firm National Advisor Bureau, Al Shehi, has publicly pursued the idea since 2015. The UAE’s aquifers will run dry by 2030 at current rates, and around 90% of Earth’s surface freshwater resources are stored in the Antarctic ice shelf.  Critics have raised the point that the project’s enormous financial investment could be successfully applied to improved water management techniques.  Criticism also highlights the iceberg’s potential to dramatically alter the Gulf’s marine ecosystem and to shift weather patterns for the UAE and its neighbors. The plan may sound far-fetched, but Cape Town considered it last year as residents approached “Day Zero” for fresh water access. The plan was deemed inappropriate for Cape Town, although proximity to Antarctica and water stress were much greater for the South African city than in today’s UAE.  Instead of towing a 100-million-ton iceberg, South African authorities focused on reusing waste water and requiring residents to adopt less water-intensive lifestyles. The crisis led to water-saving agriculture techniques, such as nighttime irrigation. Al Shehi’s plan may reach South Africa. The entrepreneur hopes to execute a trial run in 2021 that would deliver an iceberg either to South Africa or Australia. If the test run succeeds, an iceberg’s nine-month journey to the UAE would follow. The test run alone would cost an estimated $80 million to $100 million.  If Al Shehi does succeed, it will not necessarily spell victory for water security. An average iceberg contains about 75 billion liters of fresh water. With per capita consumption at 40 liters per day, Al Shehi argues, an average iceberg could theoretically supply water to 1 million people for more than five years.  These calculations require a look at Emirati water consumption. Daily water consumption in the UAE approaches 500 liters per capita, more than 10 times the figure Al Shehi cites in his math. In reality, Emirati water consumption is about 80% higher than the global average. To put these figures into perspective, $90 million would cover a Palestinian funding proposal to the Green Climate Fund, which would treat wastewater for agricultural irrigation and directly benefit 200,000 Gaza residents with water resources, two times over.  Palestinian water consumption is well below the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended minimum of 100 liters per capita per day. Towing an iceberg across equatorial waters would be vastly more expensive than conventional projects to address water scarcity. So is there a reason to take the self-proclaimed environmentalist and innovator from the Emirates seriously? Al Shehi’s firm released a promotional video for the project in 2017. The animation paints the iceberg’s potential for fresh water access and for tourism.  In the video, polar bears and penguins ride atop the iceberg to a warm Gulf welcome. The bears seem to enjoy the coastal nation’s beach.  There are no polar bears in Antarctica. The video is engaging on YouTube, but the faulty tourist promotion casts doubt on the entire project’s credibility.  In the UAE, irrigation for agriculture consumes most of the area’s water while droughts and desertification increase. The threat of water scarcity increases as the effects of climate change grow stronger. Oil wealth can delay a crisis, but it cannot erase the looming threat of water insecurity. The UAE relies on expensive desalination plants for potable water, and “desal” dependency is a real concern.  The energy-intensive process produces salty brine waste that is pumped back into the ocean. The technology is not environmentally sustainable, but it serves an important short-term need.  Energy intensity and waste aside, coastal desalination infrastructure faces serious climate change threats with rising sea levels and extreme weather.  The iceberg’s infrastructure would face these threats, too. People say “the tip of the iceberg” because that is exactly what it is: About 90% of an iceberg’s mass is underwater. Maneuvering the water source to the coast of Furaijah would be difficult, but pulling it to shore would be impossible.  Al Shehi’s project would mean building an offshore processing plant to collect and purify glacial melt before routing it to the mainland.  Al Shehi would privately fund the venture because the government is not on board. When Al Shehi’s firm first announced the idea, the UAE Ministry of Energy issued a statement that “as the authority in charge of water affairs, it would like to confirm that such news is just a rumour.”  The ministry gently urged citizens to shun the project. All the same, Al Shehi welcomed future government involvement: “It is a private venture. It is nothing to do with the government,” the businessman told the National newspaper. “We are working on getting them involved. The government being involved would support the project very much.” The UAE’s Saudi neighbor expressed interest in 1977. Saudi Prince Mohammed Al Faisal sponsored the world’s first International Conference on Iceberg Utilisation for Fresh Water Production, hosted at the University of Iowa.  Al Faisal explained that the conference’s purpose was “to confirm our opinion that [icebergs] can be transported and that it can be done without any ecological difficulties at costs that are reasonable and in quantities that make a difference.”  The first International Conference on Iceberg Utilisation for Fresh Water Production also turned out to be the last. More than 40 years later, the idea has resurfaced. Hundreds of millions of dollars could make Al Shehi’s dream a reality, and the businessman is determined to follow through for declared commercial and humanitarian concerns. Al Shehi has lamented the fact that “1.2 billion people around the world don’t have access to clean water,” though the WHO estimates the figure at 2.1 billion. Al Shehi aims to combat growing water scarcity and is determined to address the problem with a far-fetched solution. “People before were skeptical that people would fly in the sky, now it is a reality, they were skeptical people would visit the moon. Science has advanced and knowledge has advanced tremendously,” said Al Shehi.

Rabat – The Dutch Eduardo Frei Foundation (EFF) has wrapped up its “school of democracy” program, teaching students practical skills for initiating democratic projects of their own in Rabat.  The program aims to instruct Moroccan students who aspire to actively take part in politics and civil society and to engage in socio-economic issues from a democratic perspective. EFF concluded the three sessions of 2019 at the end of September. Founded after the fall of the Berlin Wall by the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the EFF sets out to promote the development of democracy, based on international solidarity. With over 10 years of experience as a trainer at the EFF and recently welcomed as a new MP on behalf of the CDA in the Dutch Parliament, Wytske de Pater-Postma sat down with Morocco World News to talk about the development of democracy in Morocco.  “Having lived in five countries myself, I do not believe that some cultures are superior to others. This relates to the courses that I give as a trainer at the EFF, since students here in Morocco provide me with a whole new perspective on Moroccan society. It’s genuinely a process of reciprocity where I as a teacher educate and learn,” de Pater-Postma told MWN. Throughout the program, trainers teach practical skills to the students to boost their self-determination and project planning skills so they can initiate their own projects aimed at further developing democracy.  “Students that are selected to partake in the program have projects of their own. Throughout the program, they get taught how to convince potential stakeholders, overcome obstacles, and to achieve their goals,” she explained. As a strident young woman from Fez, Amina Attar participated in the program with one clear goal in mind: Make a stand against sexual harassment in Morocco by launching her own campaign. “In Morocco we have deeply ingrained gender roles that dictate everyday life for both men and women. Whenever I leave my front door, tiresome ‘compliments’ ensue that goes unpunished,” expresses Attar. “Girls should be taught at a young age it is okay to say ‘no’ and young boys should be taught it is not a sign of asserting masculinity by harassing young women.” Personal frustration fuels Attar’s awareness campaign to alter the mindset of young men and women. “What you have to realize is that I am harassed by boys as young as 12, and it infuriates myself and many other women.” But personal frustration is not the only reason Attar takes it upon herself to lead her own campaign. “Sexual harassment limits the freedom of women and thereby limits their ability to properly participate in a democracy. Democracy and equality between men and women therefore go hand in hand,” Attar concludes. However, promoting democracy in Morocco can be a contentious subject. One student who participated in the program agreed to speak with Morocco World News, provided it would be completely anonymous to account for his own safety.  After learning a friend of his fell prey to the preachings of radical imams on the internet, he switched from a promising education in science to religious studies. “It was shocking to learn how vulnerable he was to incitements of radical imams on the internet. I’ve always cherished Islam as my personal faith, but when a friend of mine radicalized because of misinterpreted verses of the Quran, I wanted to do more.” By switching to religious studies, he hopes to become a scholar on religion and thereby further prevent young Moroccans from radicalizing. “Hundreds of young Moroccans have fallen prey to misinterpreted verses of the Quran, and as a result turned their backs to modern society. Teaching the verses of the Quran in the right context is therefore crucial to safeguard democracy.” “But,” he underlined, “what we should strive for above all, is to make sure young Moroccans have access to education. Without the prospect of valuable education, young Moroccans will remain prone to the allure of a radical, fundamentalist way of life.” In 1989 the world watched on as the overjoyed citizens of Berlin hacked their way to freedom after having lived for four decades under socialist oppression. Moroccan academic Fatima Mernissi described it as the “crumbling of Berlin’s hijab” and underlined how shopkeepers in North African medinas and peasants in the Atlas mountains had no trouble identifying themselves with seemingly different Germans. Everybody can relate to the notion of freedom, in particular those who are deprived of it. For a brief moment, people in the Arab region looked up to the West as a worthy source of inspiration to promote enshrined values such as civil discourse, nonviolence and the rule of law. Yet, as the West has militarily intervened in many countries throughout the MENA region, ranging from the Iraq war in 2003 to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, what credibility concerning civil discourse, nonviolence, and the rule of law is there left for the West to teach the rest? De Pater-Postma understands the criticism against well-intentioned projects initiated by Western countries as “paternal” and “hypocritical.”  “I don’t hold to the notion of one country claiming the right to educate another. There is no such thing as a perfect democracy. However, asking yourself the question ‘What constitutes a perfect democracy?’ is a very worthwhile question to ensure the people within a democracy have a voice.” “The reason why the EFF has a long-standing tradition with Central and Eastern European countries is because they express the desire to host our workshops and programs aimed at improving democratic values such as freedom of speech. You can’t expect countries who have lived under authoritarianism for decades, to embrace democratic values overnight. It takes time and patience.” In more recent years, other countries throughout the MENA region have approached the EFF, expressing their desire to work with the organization, too.  “The EFF is not only working together with Morocco, but we are collaborating with other countries such as Tunisia and Lebanon as well. Ultimately, it is up to each country to decide for themselves at what pace and in which direction they wish to tread on the road of democracy.”

Amsterdam – The Read My World, Netherlands international literary festival has chosen to focus on Moroccan writers this year. An annual three-day international literature festival, the event focuses on a certain region of the world each year. This year celebrates Moroccan literature through its novelists, storytellers, writers, poets, journalists, playwrights, spoken word artists, singer-songwriters, academics, and bloggers. The October 10-12 festival will take place at the Tolhuistuin in Amsterdam. The journalist Fedwa Misk and novelist Mahi Binebine, as “curators” of the festival, have chosen a variety of writers to represent Morocco, creating the program together with a Dutch team. The festival, now in its seventh year, sheds light on topics such as feminism in Morocco and female voices in literature and arts. In addition, sessions that focus on poetry translation, intimate mother tongues, food stories, the language of the body, and roots, will all bring along authors’ personal stories and narratives about social life and culture in Morocco. Morocco World News spoke with the festival’s artistic director, Willemijn Lamp, about the story behind the festival. MWN: What inspired you to create Read My World Festival, and what is the story behind it? Willemijn Lamp: In 2010 I celebrated New Year’s Eve in Ramallah, Palestine. There I met Asmaa Azaizeh, back then a young, award-winning poet, who taught me a lot about the function and role of literature and poetry in Palestine. Although I thought I was quite well-informed, she introduced me to so many insights, so many new voices, that I started to question my frame on how we here in the West are informed about and introduced to writers and poets from the “Global South.” For instance: whenever in the West poetry from Palestine is discussed, it often comes with the preconceived idea that a lot of the poets address the occupation, that the language is very rich and colorful, but obviously there is much more to it than this. Asmaa taught me that so called “resistance poetry” of course is very important, but yes, “we also write about love, about daily life issues, we have dreams and we experiment with ‘street slang’ etc., etc.” It occurred to me that so many talented young storytellers, writers and poets who are not yet translated are still invisible in the West, whereas their stories could add so many different layers to how we look at each other. So, I thought: How great would it be if people here could get introduced to her specific vision and insights, instead of us here in Amsterdam just inviting people from abroad that we already know? Instead of us here in Amsterdam setting the agenda for the kind of themes and topics that we want to discuss, wouldn’t it be more challenging and fascinating to actually invite people from abroad to set the agenda and choose the themes themselves? So from there on I started dreaming of a festival that would each year invite people from different regions in the world and give them “carte-blanche” in terms of introducing us to themes and voices that THEY would like to address in Amsterdam. This way, so I thought, we would have the best of both worlds: We introduce writers from the Netherlands to writers from the specific region and vice versa, we invite them to really engage with each other in preparation [for] the festival and of course on stage. This way, I hope, we are able to open up new insights in the current role of literature here and there…. I want to create a space for truthful encounters, where it’s safe to be confronted with new ideas and get inspired by different languages. In the previous years we had writers coming from Palestine, Egypt (2013); Surinam, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Haiti, Trinidad [and] Tobago (2014); Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore (2015); Poland, Ukraine (2016); Black USA (2017); [and] Turkey (2018). MWN: The festival is in its seventh year now. Where did you get the inspiration to pick Morocco as a theme for this year? Willemijn Lamp: Actually, I wanted to address Morocco already in 2013, during the first edition of the festival, together with the writers from Palestine and Egypt, but it turned out too complicated to achieve this on relatively short notice. In the Netherlands we have approximately 400,000 people with roots in Morocco; we have a few very excellent Moroccan Dutch writers in the Netherlands as well…. So, it was through them that I got inspired to dive deeper into the literature of Morocco today, and the deeper I dove into it, the more complex it got, which I like. Since I believe that we need this complexity to gain a better understanding of current day literary Morocco and the Netherlands: The diversity in terms of people and languages are unfortunately all too often simplified for the sake of clickbait or rising populism. MWN:  In the past and for this year you chose curators local to the theme region of the festival. How and why did you select the curator team for this year? Willemijn Lamp: The way we find curators is different each year, but the most important thing is that there needs to be first and foremost a personal “click” with the curators. Of course, we have a profile in mind for ‘the type’ of curator: For each edition we look for someone who’s very independent in terms of thinking and creating…. We search for people who are outspoken on issues that matter to them and are generous towards their colleagues, people who have a genuine conviction that words do matter, that the need for sharing stories is universal and is just as important as the air we breathe. All these characteristics (and so much more!) we found in the encounter with the curators of this year, Mahi Binebine and Fedwa Misk, and we are extremely honored that they accepted our invitation to be part of the Read My World 2019 team. MWN: What are some of the topics that will be discussed at the festival, and can you tell me a little about the authors and speakers that will attend this year? Willemijn Lamp: We have approximately 10 authors coming from Morocco (from the north to the south); writers, actors, and musicians with Moroccan roots who are living in France and Belgium; and approximately 60 writers, poets, thinkers, and creators from the Netherlands, some of them with Moroccan roots, but also writers who have no Moroccan roots at all…. This year we have many people involved who care deeply about the role that women have in both our societies, Dutch and Moroccan. So, a large theme this year is feminism, womanhood, the body, motherhoods, and how this resonates in our stories and literature. But next to that we also celebrate multilingualism by all sort of poetry readings and spoken word performances. On our website www.readmyworld.nl you can check the full line-up which is quite impressive, if I may say so! MWN: I noticed for this year you added a special element, performative translation, to the festival. Why did you choose to do so? Willemijn Lamp: Here I would like to quote my colleague Canan Marasligil, who created this workshop. “The idea for this pilot project on ‘performative translation’ came from an urge to change the narrative of how stories are told on stage at literary festivals. And quite simply: We are thinking that everyone has the right to express themselves freely on a stage, no matter where they come from, and that language barriers many times prevent such freedom in expression. Festivals and programmers often lack the resources to organize multilingual events and are therefore pushed into thinking of language knowledge as a barrier. This pilot seeks to create a methodology that could later be used by festivals and cultural organizers of literary events across the globe…. Our ambition is to show programmers across literary festivals that it is possible to move beyond the barriers of language knowledge.” MWN: If people would like to learn more about the Read My World Festival, the performers, and future Read My World events, where can they find more information? Willemijn Lamp: They can go to our website, or check our social media [Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter].

Rabat – The US State Department has put a $5 million price on the head of a former Polisario armed unit ringleader for his involvement in the death of four American soldiers, a statement from the US State Department has confirmed. The statement comes as the US seeks justice for the October 4 2017 Tongo Tongo terrorist ambush. The ambush resulted in the death of four American and four Nigerien soldiers who were patrolling the Nigerian village as part of the US’ counterterrorism efforts in Niger and the Sahel region in general. The US Department of State’s announcement of the $5 million bounty is part of its “Rewards for Justice” program designed for capturing and convicting terrorists. The release says the $5 million bounty is for any information that could lead to “the arrest or conviction in any country of any individual who bears responsibility” for the Tongo Tongo ambush. Meanwhile, the US is specifically putting $5 million additionally on the head of Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, most commonly known as Abu Walid. A former Polisario Front-affiliated “soldier” who led a unit of the separatist front’s Sahrawi People’s Liberation Army prior to pledging allegiance to Al-Qaeda and then to ISIS in May 2015. Abu Walid is believed to have been the leader of the ISIS-affiliate group responsible for the ambush of the American-Nigerien counter-terrorism patrol in the village of Tongo Tongo in Niger. “Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi (Abu Walid) is the leader of the designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) ISIS in the Greater Sahara (also known as ISIS-GS). ISIS-GS emerged when Abu Walid and his followers split from al-Qa’ida splinter group Al-Mourabitoun,” the State Department detailed in another, Abu Walid-focused release. He reportedly left the separatist front at the most heated period of the war in Northern Mali, joining the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in Western Africa (MUJAO), where he served as a spokesperson in the most heated period of the Malian crisis. Since pledging allegiance to ISIS in May 2015, Abu Walid has been the mastermind of many terrorist attacks in the Sahel. “Based primarily in Mali along the Mali-Niger border, ISIS-GS has claimed responsibility for several attacks under Abu Walid’s leadership,” according to the US State Department.

Rabat – The kingdom of Lesotho is joining the growing cohort of formerly pro-Polisario countries poised to revise their stance on the Western Sahara territorial dispute, buttressing the reigning suggestion of a pro-Rabat momentum in the latest developments. In a Note Verbale (verbal note) published on Friday, October 4, the Southern African kingdom announced the “suspension” of all its former “declarations and decisions” in relation to the Western Sahara question. Lesotho, which had recognized the Polisario-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in October 1985, was until recently one of Africa’s few pro-Polisario voices. The country’s “suspension” of its previous declarations and decisions on Western Sahara is therefore set to be interpreted as yet another blow to the separatist front’s statehood claims. “The publication of this Note Verbale… follows today’s telephone conversation between Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco, Nasser Bourita, and minister of Foreign Affairs and International Relations of the Kingdom of Lesotho, Lesego Makgothi,” reads the declaration from the Lesotho government. The statement detailed that, during their conversation, the two foreign ministers stressed both their countries’ desire to rekindle their bilateral relations by “removing obstacles,” mostly including their disagreement on Western Sahara, which may have negatively affected the quality of their cooperation. With Lesotho’s decision coming after a conversation between its foreign affairs minister and Morocco’s Nasser Bourita, some may credit the news with what has been described in the past months as Morocco’s increasingly proactive-looking diplomacy. In recent years, especially since its readmission to the African Union, Morocco seems to have redoubled its diplomatic arsenal in convincing governments of the historical, legal legitimacy, as well as the “seriousness” and “pragmatism” of its Western Sahara autonomy proposal. Rabat has also underlined the socio-economic benefits that come with its proposal. The notion of “proactive” or “constructive” diplomacy has since been used to point to Morocco’s shift from reactive behavior towards pro-Polisario countries to more conciliatory, long-term-oriented diplomatic efforts aimed with the goal of eventually succeeding in having them accept the point that its proposal is the most viable means to end the Western Sahara stalemate. Lesotho’s move comes amidst a perceived pro-Morocco momentum in UN-led political process to broker lasting peace in Western Sahara. Most recently, the overwhelming majority of UN member countries renewed their commitment to the body’s agenda of pushing for a politically negotiated, compromise-based political solution. In the meantime, some countries— mostly in Africa but increasingly in other regions, too —have consistently lauded Morocco’s proposal, saying it is the only viable way out of the Western Sahara diplomatic, political deadlock.

Rabat – Moroccan steeplechase runner Soufiane El Bakkali came in third during the 3000m men’s steeplechase final at the IAAF World Athletics Championships on Friday. With a time of 8:03:76, El Bakkali was close behind Keynan athlete Conseslus Kipruto and Ethiopian athlete Lamecha Girma, who came in first and second. Despite only winning a bronze medal in this race, 23-year-old El Bakkali is ranked first in the world in the men’s 3000m steeplechase by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). El Bakkali made his senior debut as a steeplechase runner at the 2014 African Championships in Athletics, and represented Morocco at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. He earned a silver medal in the 2017 World Championships in London. On August 25, 2019, El Bakkali won the Paris Diamond League’s 3000m steeplechase despite an injured foot. He even beat Lamecha Girma, who came in second during yesterday’s championship race with a time of 8:01:36. 17 Moroccans participated in the World Athletic Championships in Doha, Qatar, but El Bakkali was the first to register his country’s name on the medal board on the eighth day of the competition.

Rabat – Despite leaving the office 6 months ago, former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is still living in the presidential palace in Zeralda, west of Algiers, as reported by Algerian news outlet Shihab press. The news comes as Algerians continue to protest for the removal of the Bouteflika era political elite. The ousted president was incumbent from 1999 until April 2019 when mass protests calling for a complete political overhaul ousted him from power.  The former president suffered a debilitating stroke in 2013 which left him in need of comprehensive healthcare at his residence.   Said Bouteflika, the former president’s brother, was rumored to have been the power behind the presidency since the 2013 health scare.  Though ex-president Bouteflika’s residence in the presidential palace is still under guard, Shihab press reports that the security presence is much weaker than during his years in power. Bouteflika reportedly owns an apartment and a villa in the Bashir Brahimi neighborhood. General Gaid Salah remains the de facto head of state while the country prepares for the upcoming presidential elections set for December 2019. Protests in Algeria started in February of this year. Throughout 2019,  Algerians have denounced the corruption in the country, calling for accountability and for an end to the impunity enjoyed by elites.  Algeria’s security services arrested several officials including Algeria’s two former prime ministers, Ahmed Ouyahia and Abdelmalek Sellal.  Meanwhile, the former president’s brother, Said Bouteflika, was charged with “conspiracy against the state.” The court handed him a 15-year prison sentence in September.

Rabat – Moroccans consumed an average of 17.3 kilograms of red meat per person in 2018, according to Aziz Akhannouch, Minister of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries. Akhannouch announced the statistics on October 3 at the inauguration of the second Trade Fair for Livestock in Sidi Bennour. In 2018, red meat production reached approximately 603,000 tons. The 2014-2020 National Industrial Growth Plan aims to improve the national production of red meat. Morocco’s red meat production in 2018 was just shy of the 2014-2020 program’s goal for the year, which was set at 612,000 tons. However, production is up from 2016, when Morocco produced only 550,000 tons of red meat. Since 2014, Morocco has significantly increased its red meat production by importing young bulls and frozen bull semen, which introduced the Charolais and Limousin beef breeds to Morocco’s red meat industry. Morocco’s national herd is currently composed of 3.5 million cattle, 20.6 million sheep, 6.5 million goats, and 180,000 camels. The industry brings in MAD 26 million annually and accounts for 98% of the country’s red meat demand. The 2008 Green Morocco Plan aimed to increase the annual per capita red meat consumption from 14.2 to 20 kilograms, in accordance with the nutritional standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Since then, studies have revealed links between red meat intake and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. In 2015, WHO classified processed meats as carcinogens, or substances capable of causing cancer. However, there is still no consensus on the relationship between meat and mortality.

Rabat – The regional services of Morocco’s National Office for Food Safety (ONSSA) of the Eastern region destroyed a total of 136 tons of potatoes in Berkane. Potato producers had treated the crop with illegal amounts of pesticides, said ONSSA on Friday, September 4. The office added that it has prepared offense reports accordingly and forwarded them to the relevant authorities. The royal gendarmerie and ONSSA destroyed the potato crops after samples stored outside ONSSA compliant warehouses failed a compliance test. The analysis showed that the potatoes stored in the approved warehouses complied with the registered pesticide residue levels, while those stored elsewhere have been treated with unapproved pesticides. The operation falls within the framework of monitoring and control plans for the use of pesticides in fruits and vegetables, added ONSSA. ONSSA reassured the public that fruits and vegetable monitoring are being strengthened and that “this action will not be limited to the Eastern region but to all regions.” The office is part of the ministry of agriculture and is charged with the protection of consumers’ health and ensuring the safety of animals, plants, and food products.

Rabat – Ever since my first high school prom in 2014, I knew I would not fare well in situations that required me to dress up, get my hair and makeup done, take pictures, dance, and socialize.   I remember crying in my bedroom that brisk spring afternoon while my date for the dance waited downstairs, making awkward small talk with my mom and step-dad.  I stared at my 16-year-old self in the mirror, hating what I saw. I looked like I hadn’t put any effort into my appearance, but I was too insecure to make any noticeable changes with my hair or makeup. I dreaded going to the group photoshoot at my friend’s house, knowing that I would hate every single picture of myself. “My wedding is going to be a nightmare,” I declared on May 2, 2014.  Disclaimer  Despite how I might describe it, my Moroccan wedding ceremony was not the worst experience of my life. Not by any means.  It was, however, one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life thus far. And that’s not because it was colored by a different religion or culture than my own. It was because I had absolutely no idea what was going on. I can blame myself and my linguistic deficiencies. But I can also blame my wonderful husband, Amine, who did not adequately prepare me for this day.  When we first began discussing marriage, Amine and I agreed that we wanted a winter wedding. We both get hot easily, and we both hate sweating.  Well, sometimes things just don’t go as planned. The dog days of August So here we were, on the day of our wedding ceremony, which had been planned by his parents just a few days prior.  It was August 30, 2019. The hottest day of the summer. Look it up, I’m not kidding. We were supposed to have a “small” ceremony at his parents’ apartment in Temara, a suburb of Rabat. I was expecting to see his parents, his brother, a couple of cousins, and a few aunts—15 people at most.  After climbing four flights of stairs, sweating buckets, I approached the door to the apartment. The door was open, but there was barely any noise coming from inside. Imagine my surprise when I walked in, glanced to the right, and saw about 20 women sitting in silence.    I smiled awkwardly, and they stared back. I gave a little wave, and they did their high-pitched ululations. The first of many more to come.  “Am I supposed to know these women?” I whispered to my husband, as I didn’t recognize any of them. “No,” he replied simply.  He then ushered me into a bedroom, where I found my Aunt Saida and her two sons, my Aunt Bouchra and her two sons, and my brother-in-law. After greeting everyone, all I could do was stand there and smile while Amine interacted with his family.  When it was about time to eat, I learned that there were another 20 guests, all men, waiting for my husband in a neighbor’s apartment downstairs. Apparently, a “small” Moroccan gathering includes 50 plus people. Who knew? I was on my own for the next 45 minutes, though it felt like hours.  I sat at one of the round tables and smiled at the women who were already there, trying to figure out if I knew any of them. I didn’t. I was dripping sweat and fanning myself profusely—so profusely that the fan actually broke, and I needed to borrow another from one of my aunts.   The food was delicious, although I struggled to eat with my hands and made a mess. Nothing new there.  After finishing the meal, I stared at the door, pining for my husband. I was relieved when he finally arrived and we sat together in another room with his best friend, brother, and cousins. My brother-in-law, Aymane, put on some traditional music and started to dance. Some of my aunts and cousins joined him. It was lovely until they insisted Amine and I dance, too.  I am a very bad dancer, and so is my husband. I won’t go into detail. Just know we did our best.  Now what? The woman who was supposed to do everyone’s henna, who I will henceforth refer to as “the henna lady,” was more than an hour late. After my mother-in-law ripped her a new one over the phone, she finally showed up, which meant it was time to put on my kaftan.  The henna lady and my two aunts escorted me into a bedroom and told me to undress. They helped me put on the garment, which was a beautiful jade green color with gold details, but I felt sad that I didn’t have a say in choosing it. Even though it was huge, they remarked that it fit me perfectly. The instant I looked at myself in the mirror, I began having flashbacks to my high school prom.  I had already sweat nearly all of my makeup off, and my hair had gone flat. My aunts tried to give my hair a half-up, half-down type of look. It didn’t work, and I ended up leaving my hair as it was.  Just like my first prom, I looked like I didn’t put any effort into my appearance. Stumbling around in my giant sparkly frock, I felt like a little girl playing dress-up.      The bedroom door opened and I was greeted by a blur of ululations and loud music. I smiled and waved to the 30 people who faced me. Now what?  I looked back at my aunts, hoping for some instruction. All they offered was ululations. Perhaps they thought I knew what to do next. I didn’t.  Nervous thoughts swirled around in my head. Where am I supposed to go? Should I just stand here? Do they want me to dance? Are we doing something? Why didn’t Amine tell me what to do? I cautiously walked down the aisle of trilling women until I entered another room. I looked back for assistance, and the henna lady pointed to a couch that had been adorned with a blanket and pillows that resembled my kaftan.  Fair enough. I shuffled over and sat down, and the guests filled in the couches around me.  My husband finally joined me, and I felt relieved again. But the embarrassment didn’t stop here.  The henna lady did my henna, which was great, except I could no longer move my hair out of my face, adjust my kaftan, or wipe the sweat off my face. Did I mention how hot it was that day?  There was also some confusion regarding where I was supposed to get henna, since I couldn’t communicate with the henna lady and my husband was too distracted to translate for me. I’m sure I offended her when I said I didn’t want it on the palms of my hands or on my feet. In my defense, I didn’t know what was expected of me.  I did end up getting henna on my feet, so everyone got a good look at—and pictures of—my weird-looking, un-pedicured toes.    Smile, you’re married! I spent the next two hours sitting on that couch and smiling for pictures. Oh, and sweating.  This was probably the worst part of the entire experience. I didn’t feel beautiful, I couldn’t fix my unstyled hair, I was stiff from having my henna’d feet elevated, and I didn’t understand the instructions people were giving me for poses.  To be honest, I really don’t care that the ceremony was uncomfortable for me or that none of my family were present. Everyone else had a good time, and I think that’s more important. If anything, it’s a funny story to tell.  What I do care about, though, is those damn pictures and how underwhelming I look in them. I’m a bride, for goodness sake! I should look like a princess, not a child performing in a school play.   Your wedding pictures are supposed to help you remember one of the most important and happiest days of your life. As much as it hurts to say, I absolutely hate mine. I don’t want to show my future children my wedding photos. I’m even reluctant to show them to my family and friends. I posted one on Instagram, but I feel embarrassed every time I look at it.  I want to reflect on my wedding and smile. Instead, I think about it and cringe.  Are there bigger problems in the world? Yes. Do I have more important things to care about? Absolutely. Are my wedding pictures really that bad? Probably not.  But am I allowed to be sad that I hate them? Yes, and I will not be told otherwise. What really matters Despite my frustration and embarrassment, I do not resent anyone for my flop of a wedding. My personal regrets are no one’s responsibility but my own.  Sure, I would have appreciated having a say in the dress, the date, or the guest list, but ultimately my fairytale experience was ruined by my own unpreparedness and insecurities. But I have to remind myself that disappointing pictures are not the end of the world. They can be redone.   Wedding photos, no matter how special they are, will never be able to capture the love I feel from my husband and his family. The memories I make with them will always be more valuable than my memories of the ceremony, and I am eternally grateful for this truth.  As my father-in-law would say, “Alhamdulillah.” Photo Credit: Morgan Hekking/MWN

Rabat – Residents of Sefrou, in the Fes-Meknes region, gathered for a demonstration against the Regional Directorate of Waters and Forests on October 2, as reported by the Arabic-language daily “Al Massae.” The protest was organized in response to residents’ issues with organized hunting in the area. The directorate has been granting hunting licenses to associations and authorizing them to hunt on residents’ land without prior notice. Hunting on private property is not an anomaly in Sefrou, the protestors say. The practice has been ongoing for more than 50 years.  The protestors traveled by bus through Ribat El Kheir (Ahermoumou), Azzaba, and El Menzel before staging a sit-in outside the directorate’s headquarters in Sefrou. Protestors demanded that the regional director be dismissed.  The protestors believe that the regional director authorized a local hunting association to take over an individual’s land, which is reserved for agriculture, and make it into a hunting club. The owner of the property asserted his right over the land during the protest.  As a result of the protest, the governor of Sefrou, the president of the El Menzel district, and representatives of Aghzlan met with demonstrators.  During the meeting, residents demanded that hunting on private property be prohibited and that all authorizations currently allowing hunters to do so be revoked.  Game hunting generates MAD 1.2 million per year, with 80,000 Moroccan and 3,000 tourists participating annually. Although Morocco is hoping to strengthen its market for game tourism, recreational hunting in Morocco has stirred some controversy in the past.  In August, a hunting group from the Gulf killed more than 1,400 quails near Marrakech, sparking outrage across social media. The Ministry of Agriculture revoked the tourist company’s hunting license and seized 36 weapons used in the hunt.  Hunting activities have also decimated Morocco’s native population of Barbary Macaques, or Magot monkeys. The Middle Atlas is home to 67% of the species’ population, but in the last three decades, numbers have dropped from 15,000 to 5,000 as of 2018. Reasons for the monkeys’ recent shift to “vulnerable species” status include habitat loss, poaching (illegal hunting), and illegal trade.   The mountainous region surrounding Sefrou is a popular spot among hunters. The area is lush, fertile, and teeming with non-human life. However, if hunters continue to violate the rights of property owners in the area, local residents may push for a total ban on the sport.

Rabat – Nine months after the horrific Imlil murders which claimed the lives of two Scandinavian women who had been hiking Morocco’s famous Mount Toubkal, the kingdom has begun to recover from the shock of the unprecedented atrocity.  Despite heightened safety concerns, Morocco has continued to welcome tourists, thanks to the renowned efficiency of the country’s national security forces.  However, female tourists, in particular, may still wonder if Morocco is a safe place to visit. To determine this, one should consider the likelihood of experiencing violence, theft, or harassment while traveling in Morocco.  First and foremost, it is extremely unlikely that someone will physically assault a female tourist for any reason. Moroccans are famously hospitable, and tourists are well-received throughout the kingdom.  A recent example is a British woman in Tangier who aggressively berated a chicken vendor in the souk of Sidi Bouabid. She threw herself onto the cages containing live chickens, attempted to break open the lid, and bit and punched the vendor. None of the dozens of bystanders, male or female, harmed her, though her behavior clearly enraged and astounded them.  The fact that she made it out of that altercation physically unscathed is telling: Moroccans are generally not combative, especially towards foreign women.  Although multiple governments have issued travel warnings to Morocco due to anticipated threats of terrorist attacks against foreigners, such threats are not palpable on the ground.  The absence of terror threats in Morocco is corroborated by the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), which has been described as “the most authoritative data source on terrorism today.” Every year, the GTI ranks 163 of the world’s 195 countries according to how much they are impacted by terrorism.  First on the list for 2018 is Iraq, while 25 countries tie for the lowest ranking, which stands at 138.  The US scored “high,” earning the 20th position on the list. The UK (28), France (30), and Germany (39) all scored “medium.” In contrast, Morocco scored “very low” on the 2018 report. With a ranking of 132, Morocco placed better than Norway (123), Switzerland (124), and Iceland (130).  Despite negative media portrayals of Morocco and its regional neighbors, Morocco’s security forces are world leaders in counterterrorism.  In Morocco, vendors can act aggressively with tourists in certain areas. While some travelers may enjoy the hustle and bustle of traditional open-air bazaars, others can find these crowded and noisy spaces overwhelming. There is a myriad of reports to consult on shopping as a tourist in Morocco, and the reviews of major souks—while often positive—can be mixed. Most of the negative reviews come from Marrakech, which has a reputation as a “tourist trap.”  Much of the criticism of Marrakech comes from unpleasant experiences with merchants.  “I didn’t feel safe in this market place,” one Trip Advisor reviewer wrote of the Marrakech medina. “When I didn’t buy a handbag from a stall, the stallholder pushed me and pinched my shoulder!” Other tourists, who visited Morocco expecting the worst, were pleasantly surprised by the kindness of the local people. “I was warned about hawkers/grifters, but everyone we met was extremely friendly—people directed me without asking for anything in return and did not harass me when I chose not to buy,” reads another review of Jemaa el-Fna square in Marrakech.  While aggressive vendors do exist in Morocco, the good news is that these people are not dangerous. They may make you uncomfortable at times, but if you already have some travel experience, you should be well-equipped to fend off their advances.  Morocco is no different from other tourist destinations; thieves can target foreign women, like anyone else. They can pick your pockets, snatch your purse, give you the wrong change, or scam you.  While some of these instances are out of your control, there are plenty of ways to make yourself less appealing to petty thieves in the street.  You can wear whatever you want as a tourist in Morocco, but in the crowded old medinas and souks, there is no need to show off your wealth.   Moroccans sometimes assume that all tourists have plenty of money, so flashy clothes and accessories might only further attract opportunistic criminals such as pickpockets or scammers. If you have a backpack but you are nervous about taking it through a congested marketplace or bustling train station, carrying it on your stomach is a great way to let everyone know you are watching out for thieves. Sure, you might feel a little silly, but Moroccans do this in busy areas, too. The chances of getting mugged as a female tourist in Morocco are quite low, but if you are worried, take the same safety precautions as you would while visiting any other country: Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. Avoid walking alone in empty areas.  If you are certain that someone has touched you or your bag, or if you are outright attacked, make a scene. Moroccans tend to be reactive in these situations and will surely come to your aid or defense.  Finally, Moroccan police tend to be very accommodating and sympathetic towards tourists, so if anything happens, trust that you will be taken care of. North Africa is unfortunately notorious for its high rate of street harassment.  A 2017 survey reported that 73% of women in Morocco experience harassment in public spaces.  Although this is fewer than 81% of women who experience harassment in the United States, the figure is daunting and should be taken seriously.  A female traveler’s experience with harassment in Morocco depends on where she is in the country, who she is traveling with, and how she personally defines harassment—what one woman finds endearing may be insufferable to another.  If you are worried about unwanted male attention, the best way to ensure your personal comfort is to stick to a sizeable group, dress modestly, and travel with a guide as you see fit.  Unfortunately, some women experience harassment in Morocco regardless of the preventive measures they take. However, harassment is a risk in every city in the world, so this is not a good reason to abandon your dreams of visiting Morocco.  On the other hand, some female tourists in Morocco do not experience harassment at all.  Amelia, an American woman in her early twenties, recently visited Morocco with two friends. She traveled throughout the northern city of Tangier with one man and another woman. She told MWN that she felt very safe in Morocco. Although she got some stares due to her “clothing and overall Western appearance,” she stressed that she and her friends were not harassed.  “Some merchants were aggressive, mainly the men in the medina and popular tourist areas trying to give us tours,” she noted.  Amelia added that some shopkeepers relentlessly pushed her to buy things despite her politely declining, but she pointed out that this happens in most areas with a high volume of tourists. She has experienced similar situations while traveling in Europe.  “I was comfortable the entire time in Morocco,” she maintained. “I definitely felt less comfortable in France and Italy.” In short, yes. If Morocco were not safe, it would not receive 1 million tourists every month. Women from all walks of life travel to Morocco for work, leisure, and love.   The chances of female tourists experiencing violence in Morocco are low, and the likelihood of being targeted by petty thieves or street harassers is no greater than in Europe and North America.  Of course, Moroccan criminals do exist, but they tend to be more dishonest than dangerous. It is far more likely that someone will scam or overcharge you than physically harm you.  You may be pushed out of your comfort zone in Morocco, as you would in most foreign cultures, but any feelings of insecurity will be quickly remedied by the country’s famous hospitality.

Rabat – Danish Crown Princess Mary expressed today, October 4, her satisfaction with the partnership and cooperation between Denmark and Morocco in the field of development. The Princess gave a speech on the last day of the Youth Innovation Summit, an event co-organized by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Danish-Arab Partnership Programme. The Princess said that events such as the Youth Innovation Summit are a good example of the fruitful bilateral relations between Morocco and Denmark. Innovation is the key to sustainable development, and the youth play an important role in this matter, according to Princess Mary. The Crown Princess was impressed by the talents of the young Moroccans participating in the event and the quality of their projects. Some of the projects presented innovative solutions for mobilizing youth within the society, according to the speech. Finally, Princess  Mary emphasized the importance of supporting the youth and working with them. She explained that they are tomorrow’s leaders and powerful change-inducing actors. Youth Innovation Summit The Youth Innovation Summit started on Monday, September 30, and ended today, October 4. The five-day event took place in OLM Souissi,  in Rabat. The summit aimed to bring Moroccan youth to the forefront of social innovation, sustainable development, and entrepreneurship in Morocco. More than 30 Moroccan organizations and businesses took part in the summit, and more than 2,500 visitors attended. The Moroccan Ministry of Youth and Sports, the United Nations Development Program, and the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized the summit. Other partners of the event include local and international start-ups, artists, accelerator programs, and international banks. Youth Dialogue Festival The summit concluded with the Youth Dialogue Festival. The festival was open to the public for free, like the rest of the summit’s activities. It started at 9 a.m. with a Zumba session to warm up at the nearby Ibn Sina Park, also known as “Hilton Forest.” The festival officially started at 11 a.m. with speeches from Morocco’s Minister of Youth and Sports, Rachid Talbi Alami, and the Danish Crown Princess Mary. The event’s program included multiple dialogues and debates. Topics varied between the engagement of youth in sustainable development, the future of jobs in Morocco, female empowerment, and even food as a driver for change. More than 30 organizations presented their different services, ideas, and projects. Visitors showed a lot of interest in the stands, especially the ones hosting organizations working against discrimination and violence, in all of their forms. The tent-shaped stands also hosted a large number of workshops. The workshops included CV corrections for the young visitors and job interview simulations. They aimed to pinpoint some problems that a number of young Moroccans face when hunting for a job. The festival also included music performances, theater acts, and a range of other activities. Moroccan music band Hoba Hoba Spirit performed a closing concert that attracted a number of the band’s fusion music genre fans.

Rabat- A unit of the Spanish Guardia Civil, military police has arrested a Moroccan man and his Venezuelan girlfriend for murdering and burying alive a man after beating him and stealing his car. The body of the victim was found on a farm in the vicinity of Zaragoza, northeastern Spain, according to Spanish news reports. Spanish outlet ABC detailed on October 3 that the two suspects, believed to have prior criminal records, seduced their victim on Badoo, a famed dating site in Spain. They then assaulted him, stripped him of his possessions, including his car, and buried him alive. Spanish investigators believe that the victim, “after being assaulted and beaten, was buried alive,” the Spanish outlet reported. Reports also suggest the two suspects have engaged in similar acts in the past months. Two men are said to have reported having been victims of “violent robberies” after being seduced by a woman on the internet. It is understood that the couple’s “modus operandi” consisted in having the “South American woman” bait the victims on social media and seduce them into going to a secluded location. The couple would then assault, beat the victim and take his belongings. Preliminary investigations in the murder of the couple’s last victim, a computer engineer, suggest that the initial plan was not to kill him: They were apparently more interested in stripping him of his car. “Investigators believe they killed him because he resisted the theft of his car,” ABC explained. The Moroccan man and his “South American partner” have been placed into police custody amid ongoing investigations, pending legal procedure in the case. “The first examinations of the body indicate that he was buried alive, because the forensic examination found soil in his lungs,” the news report noted.

Rabat – French security services dismantled a drug trafficking network operating in France and Morocco on the night of Tuesday, October 2. Police seized two vehicles on a highway near Narbonne, in southern France. Police aught three of the suspects in possession of 528 kilograms of cannabis resin and 90 kilograms of cannabis. French police also arrested a fourth suspect in Clermont Ferrand who was in possession of a large sum of cash estimated at €200,000. The police opened an investigation into drug trafficking in the region when they seized 150 kilograms of cannabis resins at an undisclosed, AFP reported on Friday, October 4. The French news agency added that drug trafficking operations in the European country generate a sum of €200,000 per week. The mastermind of the network is reported to be on the run in another foreign country. He is allegedly involved in  “regular smuggling operating of cannabis resin and leaves from Morocco through Spain.” In May, France announced that Morocco and Spain had helped the French security services to seize 11 tons of cannabis in the region of Besancon. France, Morocco, and Spain have cooperated on various criminal investigations, but this latest operation is the biggest operation of its kind that involved tight cooperation between the three allies.

Rabat – The Italian government announced the signing of a new degree regarding asylum seekers. The decree, according to Italian news agency ANSA, allows authorities to reduce the decision-making period for asylum applications from two years to four months. Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed satisfaction with the signing of the decree, emphasizing that it “was a team effort.” “I thank (Justice) Minister (Alfonso), Bonafede, Premier (Giuseppe) Conte and (Interior) Minister (Luciana) Lamorgese because this morning we signed a ministerial decree that enables us to bring down the measures to establish if a migrant can stay in Italy from two years to four months,” he said. Di Mio said that the  13 countries listed in the repatriation program are, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia,  Albania, Bosnia, Cape Verde, Ghana, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Senegal, Serbia, and Ukraine. The countries on the list are deemed safe for repatriation, meaning that deported migrants’ lives will not be at risk. The plan is the “first step of our plan for safe repatriations”, De Mio said. Di Maio explained the motives behind the new legislation; “We are working to avoid the ‘pull factor’ which can be avoided by making the message clear that those who need help are welcomed but those who, based on international rules, cannot stay here will be repatriated.” In February, the Guardian reported that the Italian government rejected 24,800 asylum requests in four months. The decision has angered activists, who view the move as “beginning to have a devastating effect on migrants in the country.” Despite political stability in Morocco, many Moroccans continue to apply for asylum in European countries, including Spain. The Spanish news outlet reported in February that the Spanish government granted asylum to 55 Moroccan migrants. The government, however, denied 595 other requests as it does not usually class Moroccan applicants as refugees.

Rabat – Casablanca’s mayor, Abdelaziz El Omari, announced on Wednesday, October 2, the selection of the Spanish company Alsa to manage urban buses in Casablanca. The city council chose the Spanish company after a call for bids was announced earlier this year. The Spanish company will replace M’dina Bus, the company that has managed buses in Casablanca since 2004. The city’s contract with M’dina Bus will expire at the end of October. Alsa is expected to acquire 350 new buses, and double the size of its fleet, to 700 buses, by 2020. Casablanca’s city council and Alsa are still discussing ways to manage the transition period between the end of M’dina Bus contract and Alsa’s contract coming into effect. The city council terminated their contract with M’dina Bus after the company failed to respect their contractual requirements. Casablanca inhabitants also expressed their dissatisfaction with the services provided by the company. M’dina Bus fleet was composed of old, poorly maintained buses. In January 2019, a bus belonging to the company burst into flames in the middle of a crowded intersection. Luckily, no human casualties were recorded. Alsa is already operating in Marrakech, Khouribga, Tangier, Agadir, and most recently the region of Rabat-Temara-Sale. The Spanish multinational started operating in Morocco in 1999, in Marrakech.

Rabat – The recently concluded UN General Assembly was a success story for Morocco’s Western Sahara stance, with many voices in the international community renewing their commitment to the UN-led process or their support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. In an article summarizing the most salient points about Western-Sahara raised at the 74th UN General Assembly, the New York correspondent of Moroccan state-owned news outlet, MAP, asserted that the general mood at the UN event was one of unwavering support for the UN-led process. There is an unfailing consensus that the UN Security Council-moderated process represents the sole legitimate means to end the decades-long conflict in Western Sahara. Between diplomatically-toned support for the UN efforts and outright identification with Morocco’s proposal for a politically negotiated settlement, the MAP article argued, the overwhelming majority of UN member countries—especially African governments—handed  Morocco’s Western Sahara stance a much-needed boost. While some called for the prevalence of the UN-led process—a devastating blow to the African governments still seeking an alternative route to settlement in Western Sahara—others profusely lauded “Morocco’s perceptible efforts” to secure peace and stability not only in the Western Sahara dossier but also in Africa in general. Evaristo Do Espirito Santo Carvalho, the president of Sao Tome and Principe, called, for example, for a UN-brokered settlement on the basis of Morocco’s “effective” and “serious” autonomy proposal. The governments of Burkina Faso, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Comoros, among many others, spoke of the merits of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. In Europe, Spain’s Pedro Sanchez, who had appeared to drift in a pro-Polisario direction as he courted the support of Polisario-supporting Podemos, used his UN General Assembly speech to “reiterate Spain’s commitment to the UN-led process.” While not as overtly pro-Rabat as most African leaders present at the UN event, the Spanish head of government was crystal clear about Spain’s unwavering commitment to the UN Security Council’s agenda. Central in the suggestion was the feeling that, if anything, the perceived consensus in the international community about the promotion of compromise and political feasibility constitutes a tacit validation of Morocco’s autonomy proposal. This also backs the notion, growing among Western Sahara observers, that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is more reflective of the UN’s agenda (a politically negotiated settlement) than the Polisario Front’s insistent claims of separatism and statehood. Meanwhile, with the Moroccan diplomacy appearing to enjoy a cycle of encouraging prospects, morale-boosting endorsements, the past months have been marked by a climate of worry and apprehension in pro-Polisario circles. In response to the notable gains Moroccan diplomacy has made over the months, the separatist front has claimed that the whole UN-led process is set to be skewed in Morocco’s favor. Most recently, President Trump’s sacking of John Bolton, who had been crystal clear about using his position as US national security adviser to bring self-determination and referendum back on the negotiation table in the Western Sahara case, has strengthened the perception of Morocco having the upper hand in the diplomatic behind-the-scenes. But with the UN set to decide on its next move in the intricate Sahara dossier by the end of this month, it remains to be seen how consolidated, real Morocco’s perceived momentum actually is.

Rabat – US company Spirit AeroSystems Holdings is in talks with Bombardier to purchase the company’s facilities in Belfast and Morocco, Reuters reported on Thursday, October 3.  The news outlet quoted two sources familiar with the case, emphasizing that the company has emerged in the front “ has emerged as the front-runner” to acquire the two aeronautics facilities in Morocco and Belfast. The US company has not yet reached an agreement with Bombardier for the facilities. Bombardier announced its decision to sell its facilities in May. BNN Bloomberg reported that the Canadian aerospace giant intends to place its focus on private jets and trains. The company decided to create a new division of the company, Bombardier Aviation. Bombardier Aviation is set to bring together “all aerospace assets into a single, streamlined and fully integrated business.” The company recognized the significant work done in its two facilities in Morocco and Belfast. “We are recognized as a global leader in aerostructures, with unique end-to-end capabilities – through design and development, testing and manufacture, to aftermarket support.” The Bombadier’s facility in Morocco employs at least 300 people, while 3,600 more work in the Belfast factory. If the agreement is concluded,  Spirit AeroSystems Holdings will join other important aeronautics companies operating in Morocco, such as Boing, Safran, and others. Morocco’s foreign exchange office announced in 2018 that the Moroccan aviation industry earned more than MAD 9.78 billion ($1 billion) in the first 11 months of 2017, compared to MAD 8.42 billion ($870 million) in 2016, an increase of 16%. Morocco sees the aeronautics industry as one of its key economic pillars that could curb unemployment. Several recent reports extolled the industry of aeronautics, including Oxford Business Group. The group forecasted a flourishing future in Morocco’s economy, thanks to aeronautics and the automotive sector. Spirit already has facilities in Tulsa, McAlester, Oklahoma, Kinston, North Carolina, Malaysia, and France. The company’s key products include, “fuselages, pylons, nacelles, and wing components,” Spirit Aero said. The US company also provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services.

Rabat – Morocco’s Customs officers at Tangier port have seized optics such as telescopes used by bird watchers visiting Morocco. Some of the tourists affected by the seizures have reported the issue to Morocco’s Customs and Excise Administration. The seizures happened between June and September 2019. Tourists were told that their bird-watching equipment would be kept at the port and will be returned when leaving Morocco. Bird watchers said that authorities had to comply with new rules set by the Customs administration. MaghrebOrnitho, a blogger dedicated to birds in the Maghreb, visited two Customs offices, one located in the north and the other in the center of Morocco to find out more.  Officials at both offices told the blogger that they are not aware of any new rules regarding a ban on telescopes. The blogger added that there are no rules on telescopes on the Moroccan Customs administration website. Telescopes and other bird watching equipment (cameras and binoculars) are only subject to taxes. The president of the Andalucia Bird Society, Peter Jones, even sent a letter on September 2 to the minister of tourism regarding the confiscations.  According to MaghrebOrnitho, this is not the first time bird watchers found themselves in such situations.  In 2017, Swedish bird watchers of the ‘Big Year WP 2017’ had their telescopes confiscated at Rabat airport. Officials thought that the equipment was used for professional filming which requires a permit from the Ministry of Communication. A second incident happened to a German bird watcher at Casablanca’s International Airport in 2018. Authorities kept his equipment until he left Morocco. The tourist had to borrow binoculars and a telescope from GREPOM in Rabat to continue his bird watching trip. The most recent case was in late August 2018 when two bird watching brothers from the UK with members of the Andalucia Bird Society had their telescopes confiscated at Tangier port. We arrived in Morocco by ferry this morning with friends from #AndaluciaBirdingSociety to have our telescopes confiscated by Customs! Told it is a new rule. We are not allowed to bring them into the country and can pick up on way out. News to us! Has anyone else experienced this? — WildAlmeria (@wildalmeria) August 31, 2019  Bird tourists strongly condemned Moroccan customs officials’ practices and warned that the alleged new rule may negatively impact ecotourism in Morocco. Some said on Twitter that they will not visit Morocco under such circumstances.  The official twitter account of the Moroccan tourism office was also mentioned in the Tweets, calling it to intervene to end the problem. While many had their equipment confiscated and informed other fellow birders about it, others who entered Morocco from the same port in Tangier said on Twitter, on September 30, that they did not experience any problem or had any questions asked regarding their bird equipment. They took to Twitter to report about the settlement of the problem, saying that it was just a misunderstanding. I came from Morocco this Saturday, in the same Tanger ville port, and we didn’t even hade any question about the optics. This is not a rule, neither new or old, it’s just a missunderstanding. — Jorge F. Orueta (@jorge_seo) September 30, 2019  @MoroccanBirds Currently birding #Morocco. Arrived at Tangier airport. Hand luggage scanned on arrival containing telescope and bins. No problems encountered. As always, birding here welcomed by all curious and friendly local people. @StephenMenzie https://t.co/lcJhDbuNqg — Shaun Robson (@NarwhalSh) September 30, 2019

Rabat – The delegation of Raja Athletic Club (RCA) who traveled to Palestine to attend the game against Hilal al-Quds, has taken the opportunity to perform Friday prayer at Al Aqsa mosque. The news was reported by Hilal Al-Quds on its Facebook page.  RCA won the game (2-0) to qualify for the round of 16 of Mohammed VI cup. The game took place yesterday, September 3, at Faisal al-Husseini International Stadium at 5 pm Moroccan time. A group of Raja supporters traveled to occupied Palestine to attend the game but Israeli authorities denied them entry following confusion over entry requirements. The Moroccan embassy in Amman came to the aid of the 28 fans by facilitating their transport from the Jordanian-Palestinian borders to a hotel in Amman.

Rabat – Moroccan security services continue to search for possible boat-wreck victims on Morocco’s coast following the tragic end to an irregular migration attempt. The incident dates back to September 28 when security services found the bodies of seven Moroccan irregular migrants, who had been onboard an inflatable boat to reach Europe from Morocco. As searches continue, authorities retrieved five more bodies on the morning of September  30 on Ennahla beach in Znata near Casablanca. With the latest discovery, the body count reached 12. Moroccan television channel 2M reported on Friday, October 4  that the death toll from the inflatable boat accident has so far reached 18. Searches are still underway to find possible bodies as at least 56 people were on board the same inflatable boat, the AFP reported. 2M reported that Moroccan authorities arrested seven suspects involved in a migration network. Police are still looking for more possible accomplices with links to the irregular migration network. On August 29, the Moroccan government said that security services dismantled more than 11 irregular migration networks. The authorities also aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. Faced with the pressure due to irregular migration, Morocco’s government has called for a shared responsibility similar to the Moroccan-Spanish partnership to face the challenges of undocumented migration. Morocco is both a transit country and a destination for irregular migrants, especially from sub-Saharan countries. In 2018, the government announced that it regularized the status of 50,000 migrants in four years. The government also believes that migration is a normal phenomenon that the world should accept. Director of migration and border surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali told Italian news agency LaPressa in an interview that King Mohammed VI has instructed the government to adopt a humanist strategy to respect human rights. “We believe that immigration is wealth for our society, we are not afraid of it,” said Zerouali. In his message to the African Union (AU) Summit in 2018, King Mohammed VI said that migration should be seen as a “natural phenomenon” and should be celebrated.

Rabat – Women can now serve as lance corporals, corporals, sergeants, and staff sergeants in Saudi Arabia’s military.  Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat was the first to report the announcement yesterday. The news came in a statement from the Ministry General Directorate of Admission and Recruitment in the Armed Forces.  The new rule applies to Saudi Arabia’s land, air, and naval forces, as well as missile forces, and medical services.  The move is part of the Kingdom’s “Vision 2030,” which aims to empower women and increase their active participation at all levels of society.  “Women’s admission into the most important ministry in the kingdom is a major step in the right direction,” Hassan al-Shihiri, a former official at the Saudi Defense Ministry, told Asharq Al-Awsat.   In an effort to reduce Saudi Arabia’s dependency on oil, the monarchy is implementing various social and economic reforms to modernize the country and attract more foreign investment.  The evolution of Saudi women’s rights Until quite recently, the women of Saudi Arabia were limited in mobility, economic opportunity, and rights. The Kingdom has slowly been granting women more freedoms in an effort to improve its image in the international community.  In 2012 and 2013, Saudi women were granted the right to ride bicycles in public, compete in the Olympics, practice law, and pass citizenship onto their children.  Saudi women were allowed into football stadiums for the first time in September 2017.  As of August 2019, Saudi women over the age of 21 can apply for a passport and travel without a male guardian’s permission.  Even more recently, the Kingdom opened its doors to tourists from 52 countries and territories and relaxed dress-code requirements for foreign women. Women are now also permitted to visit the country without a man to accompany them.  Last year, Saudi women earned the right to drive after decades of campaigns and protests. However, many of the women’s rights activists who fought this battle for years are still imprisoned.  Critics of the Kingdom denounce these new freedoms for Saudi women as a smokescreen meant to distract from the ongoing human rights violations in the country.   Vision 2030 In early 2018, Saudi Arabia first allowed women to apply for military service but their ranks were limited to positions in public security, customs, criminal investigations, and drug combat. Now, women will be able to achieve senior positions in the Saudi Armed Forces.  Empowering women has become an important aspect of the country’s economy, according to Shura Council Member Haya al-Maneea. Al-Maneea spoke to Asharq Al-Awsat saying that believes the Kingdom’s national vision emphasizes equality between men and women.  “I will not say the ball is now in the women’s court, but I am confident that women’s achievements can soon happen.”

Rabat – Deputy Secretary-General of the Justice and Development Party (PJD), Slimane El Omrani, said that his party regretted the decision of the Party of Progress and Socialism (PPS) to withdraw from the Moroccan government. In a statement published on the night of October 1, the PPS declared its decision to leave the coalition. The statement of the PPS cited several reasons that motivated the party to withdraw, including the “lack of cohesion and solidarity” among the parties. El Omrani said on his Facebook, that the PJD’s members have “esteem for the PPS and we are proud of the relationship that unites us.” He added that the collaboration between the two parties served for the interest of the nation.  “The party, its   Secretary-General and Head of Government [Saad Eddine El Othmani] has always expressed its will to maintain the PPS within the current government majority,” he said. Denying rumors on the possible rift between the parties, El Omrani cited his party’s determination to continue to work with the PPS. The withdrawing party said in its stateùent on October 1 that the decision will be ratified on Friday, October 4  at a special session of its central committee. The decision comes a few weeks after King Mohammed VI met with Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani on September 21 ahead of the expected government reshuffle under royal instruction. On July 29, the King on his Throne Day speech called on the government to consider a reshuffle to inject “new blood” into the cabinet. “I ask the Head of Government to submit to me, after the summer break, proposals to fill executive posts in the Government and the civil service with high-level national elites chosen on merit and competence,” the King. It remains to be seen when El Othmani will present his shortlist for the reshuffle.

Rabat – Africa is the lowest ranked continent on cybersecurity, internet-based attacks, experts and digital security practitioners have said. According to some experts, the shortage, lack, or dilapidated conditions of high tech infrastructure, as well as the lack of well thought-out government policies for cybersecurity make Africa both the most exposed continent to cyber threats, and yet the least equipped to deal with the high and growing rate of cyber threats. Speaking on Thursday, September 3, at the 4th Africa Cybersecurity conference in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, James Claude, CEO of Global Voice Group, lamented the lack of a sophisticated digital network to counter the growing number of threats registered in Africa over the past months and years. “Africa is the most exposed continent,” Claude told AFP on the sidelines of the Abidjan meeting. He went ton to provide figures highlighting the concerning state of cybersecurity on the continent. “The vulnerability of digital infrastructure is of 83%, leaving the doors wide open to cyber attacks.” Claude also asserted that mastering the digital revolution has become an integral part of economic development and prosperity for countries. The suggestion, he detailed, is that Africa’s high vulnerability and lack of investment in the high tech sector will not only provide easy prey to hackers—individuals or institutions—worldwide, but would also negatively impact the continent’s development aspirations. “Africa must take cybersecurity seriously and invest a lot in the field, if it wants to take part in the fourth industrial revolution. Cybersecurity is vital for the 400 million people using mobile phones in the continent,” he said. “It is a very important phenomenon,” he added, speaking of the proliferation of cyber attacks worldwide and the concerns regarding Africa’s easily exploitable vulnerability. “It is a threat that can hold back the development of digital economy in Africa.” The bleak assessment of Africa’s digital sector comes amid worldwide concerns of internet-based political manipulation. In May, Facebook banned an Israeli PR company for engaging in “illegal,” “inauthentic behavior” while attempting to influence elections and public discourse in many countries in Africa and Asia. At the time, Facebook engineers warned against the exploitation of users’ personal data for political gains, as well as online Fake news campaigns to either tarnish or help the reputation of politicians.

Rabat – Africa Youth Awards announced, on October 2, its 2019 ranking of the 100 Most Influential Young Africans.  Among the diverse crowd of 52 women and 48 men, from 32 countries, the ranking recognizes two Moroccan women for their achievements.   Lamia Bazir Lamia Bazir, 27, is a government officer, humanitarian, and advocate for youth and women.  Born in El Jadida, on Morocco’s west coast, Bazir has dedicated her life to making a positive impact on her community’s most disadvantaged people.  Bazir earned her Baccalaureate in economic and social sciences with the highest honors from the Lycee Jean Charcot in El Jadida. She went on to specialize in political science and women’s studies at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane. Bazir graduated summa cum laude as the student valedictorian and class speaker in 2014. Bazir also earned a Master’s degree in International Development from Sciences Po in Paris, and she worked for a second Master’s degree in International Affairs at Columbia University in New York.  During her studies in 2012, Bazir met the women of an impoverished rural village. She was inspired to establish the social venture “Empowering Women in the Atlas.”    “These women often depicted as poor, needy, and marginalized had it all! The solutions were in them,” reads a statement on Bazir’s official website. “They just needed connections, expertise, and true commitment.”  Her mission is to support rural women in gaining local leadership positions in order to promote community development in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. The non-profit has three ongoing projects: a  community center in Adghagh, an exchange program with Norway, and an entrepreneurship program.  Although Bazir’s commitments are multidimensional, she dedicates much of her energy and work towards education, gender equality and women’s empowerment.  “She is rising as a promising figure in the Moroccan civil society,” Africa Youth Awards stated.  Salma Rachid  Salma Rachid, 25, is a Moroccan singer from the oasis of Tafilalt in south east Morocco. From an early age, Rachid was passionate about music, drawing, and fashion. She grew up in Casablanca and began studying economics after graduating from high school in 2012.  Rachid rose to fame at just 18 years old when she auditioned for the second season of Arab Idol in 2013. She performed the popular Yemeni song “Ya Moniyati” in her audition and was accepted by the judges into casting. Rachid made it through several rounds of the talent competition until she was voted off in the seventh prime. She earned fifth place in the competition and was the youngest contestant. Upon leaving the show, she signed a ten-year contract with MBC-affiliated Platinum Records.   Rachid considers Umm Kulthum to be her main inspiration. She was nicknamed El Sultana by her fans and is known for her ability to master various music styles, her charisma, and the strength of her voice.  The global impact of Moroccan women Lamir Bazir and Salma Rachid are certainly not the first Moroccan women to be recognized for their personal achievements and global contributions.  In late September, Moroccan athlete Rabab Arafi qualified for the 800 meter race at the IAAF World Championship.  Moroccan activist Karima Rhanem has won more than 22 awards for her engagement in civil society and development. On September 28, she was named among the 30 most influential young leaders in Africa and Europe by the Governing Council of the Pan African Youth Leadership Foundation.  Meanwhile, Moroccan TV host Leila Ghandi won the “Who is Who” International Women Leaders Award on October 2.  These women are among the dozens of Moroccans who have won praise for their achievements in arts, sciences, civil society, development, and sports in 2019.

Rabat – The Moroccan embassy in Jordan has taken the necessary measures to accommodate football fans of the Moroccan club Raja of Casablanca (RCA) after Israeli authorities refused them entry to Palestine. The 28 Rajawi supporters were denied entry for not meeting specific entry requirements for access to the Palestinian territories. The Moroccan embassy in Amman has provided assistance to the fans by facilitating their transportation from the Jordanian-Palestinian borders to a hotel in Amman. In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the supporters said that they were thankful to the Moroccan officials in the embassy for accommodating them. They said that “they have started all the necessary procedures to obtain entry permits the Palestinian territories to follow up the game between RCA and Hilal Al Qods by placing a request at the Embassy of Palestine in Morocco.” Supporters added that the delay in response and the approaching date of the game led them to reach out directly to Jordan, believing that acquiring entry permits could be from Jordan. The supporters had followed the steps of RCA players who were granted entry permits after their arrival in Jordan. They confirmed that they have now complied with the Israeli police instructions. The stranded supporters stayed at the Israeli authorities checkpoint for hours hoping to find a solution to their situation before the Israeli police told them that it was impossible for them to enter the Palestinian territories. Officials at the Moroccan embassy were waiting for the supporters at King Hussein Bridge.around midnight to accompany them to the hotel.  RCA will face Hilal Al-Qods on Thursday, at 5 p.m (Moroccan time) in the second leg of the Mohammed VI Cup. RCA won the first leg by scoring a penalty kick at the first minutes of play.

Rabat – “The issues pertaining to the environment and to sustainable development are among the major challenges the world is facing today,” King Mohammed VI wrote in an address to the participants in the 8th Islamic Conference of Environment Ministers.  The Minister of Culture and Communication, Mohamed Laaraj, read out the King’s statement at the conference in Rabat.   “Many international studies point to an unprecedented depletion of natural resources, to a dramatic rise in pollution levels as well as to a major disruption of the global environmental balance,” the King’s statement continues.  “This situation has serious and alarming consequences for our planet today.” The King noted that under-developed countries, in particular, are at risk. Environmental problems and their adverse effects, the King continued, can only be solved by close cooperation between states. The King added that no country, regardless of its individual capacities or resources, can handle these matters single-handed.  The King praised the conference as an essential opportunity for attendees to advance their efforts in tackling these issues and to facilitate effective cooperation between countries.  The Sovereign also declared that Morocco “has been pursuing a proactive policy for the preservation of the environment.” “Environmental preservation is mainstreamed in all development plans and sectoral development strategies. Enshrining the right to a safe environment in the Constitution was one more step that established Morocco’s resolute commitment to environmental conservation.” The King praised his country’s involvement in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030 and its adoption of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development. Under this strategy, Morocco aims to transition to a “green economy” by 2030. However, successfully implementing the strategy requires the involvement of all stakeholders concerned, the King said. Morocco can achieve this by promoting a culture of environmental awareness and by incorporating environmental education into school curricula.  The King also underlined Morocco’s goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 42% under the National Energy Strategy. This strategy aims to increase the consumption of electricity generated from renewable energy sources.  Morocco is committed to establishing the Islamic Academy for the Environment and Sustainable Development, which ideally help determine solutions to environmental and sustainability issues. The academy will use Islamic culture as inspiration.  King Mohammed VI concluded the address by expressing his faith in the conference’s ability to have “a positive impact on the promotion of environmental and sustainable development issues in the Muslim world.”

Rabat – Morocco’s own version of the Arab Spring came with the 20th February Movement.  Morocco’s Mild Arab Spring The movement did not call for an end to monarchy but a phased devolution of power and the systematic elimination of such national “headaches” as: corruption, nepotism, embezzlement, abuse of power, and patron-client system. The monarchy responded promptly by putting forward a new constitution in 2011, in which the monarch gave up, symbolically, some of his extensive powers to the elected head of government. This allowed the moderate Islamists of PJD(Parti de la Justice et du Développement) to grab power and serve as a “mule” during the transitional period. But, as the “20th of February Movement” withered away due to fierce co-optation attrition, the monarchy went back on its implicit promise of incremental democracy. This left the above–mentioned national “headaches” to grow in intensity and power. Meanwhile, the Islamists of the PJD, proved to be ineffectual, once in power. They did not have any acceptable economic program, so to speak, but just an anthology of eloquent religious rhetoric that does not guarantee, in the least, jobs and dignity for unemployed youth, let alone much-needed economic growth and development. Actually, the Islamists not only failed economically speaking but failed miserably, too, on the moral level. Prominent members became involved in sex scandals, corruption, nepotism, abuse of power and, as a result, their reputation paled in the eyes of the general public. It is true that the monarchy enjoys tremendous public support for the sake of stability and peace of mind. But, it would be a grave mistake to take this for granted. If the establishment continues to emasculate the youth through patriarchal tactics and tribal manipulation, there might be a change of heart and a revolution could, ultimately, happen at any time without warning.  A good example of this is that of neighboring Algeria where a peaceful revolution known as Hirak against the military regime has been in place since independence in 1962. The real problem in Morocco is that the country is split in the middle. There are the “haves” and the “have nots” and there is nothing in between them to absorb the terrible head-on shock that could occur at any time. Besides the “headaches” of corruption and greed, the problem is that there is no equal opportunity in the country. As a matter of fact, there is an endemic problem known among Moroccans as: “parachutage” (parachuting). “Parachutage” is when a given individual lands himself a well-paying job or a powerful position in the state system for the following reasons: known generally as “Makhzen families”; Many people who occupy senior positions landed there with the help of a “parachute” and not merit. when in place these people perpetuate the system and block the advance of democracy, meritocracy, and accountability. The practice of “parachutage” (parachuting) has increased the brain-drain whereby Moroccan talent, snubbed at home, flees the country to democratic environments where their worth is recognized fully. As of today, Moroccan talent is legion in Europe and in America and, as a result, the economy of Morocco itself is unproductive because of this self-inflicted harm. In the 60s, and the 70s of the last century, political parties were very active and very effective especially on the opposition side and, as such, they proved to be quite a healthy challenge to the monarchy. The  monarchy was, therefore, indirectly accountable to them. But, annoyed by this incessant challenge to his autocratic power, the late King Hassan II disrupted the political scene by: As such, coopted leaders were gratified with privileges and ministerial or senior jobs and political power. This massive exercise of co-optation killed politics and, consequently, political parties became tribal businesses (called in Arabic dakakin siyasiya (political shops) that guaranteed money and powerful jobs and the benediction of the monarchy to their members. ith time, political parties lost their credibility and, today, they are considered by the majority of Moroccans as being more functionaries of the establishment and they are called “3ayasha” (people who are obsequious to the state and say all the time “long live…”). The fact that political parties have been ineffectual in defending the interests of the population has led to three prominent uprisings in the periphery, known as “hirak,” especially in the traditional rebellious and recalcitrant Rif, in the southeastern city of Zagora and in the ex-mining city of Jerada. The leaders of these movements were arrested and put in prison to serve as an example to future uprisings and rebels. In the 60s, 70s and 80s of the last century political parties that were in the opposition had powerful newspapers that reflected the viewpoint of the party and criticized the establishment. They acted as strong and powerful agents of accountability that reviewed and controlled the work of the government and that of the monarchy, as well. Also, in the 90s of the last century, independent journalism came into view and the majority of people welcomed this new addition with the hope that it will wield more needed pressure on the government and it, actually, did until the establishment decided, in the middle of the first decade of this century, to opt for the devastating weapon of cooptation. Today, all print and online publications sing melodiously the praise of the establishment in varying degrees and are paid handsomely for it. As a result, people no longer buy print newspapers and some of them are disappearing. As for online newspapers, nobody pays attention to them with the exception of the popular “Hespress.” The online publication voices criticism of the government and its institutions and allows people to voice their discontent freely. Since time immemorial religion has been co-opted by the establishment in so much as the monarch is the sole representative of the Islamic religion in the country: amir al-mu’minin “Commander of the Faithful.” In the 19th century, there was so much dissension in Morocco. Indeed, the country was divided into: Bled al-Makhzen (land controlled by the government) and Bled as-Siba (land of dissent). In Bled as-Siba, which was mostly the periphery inhabited by the Amazigh (Berber) people, the population recognized the religions mantle of the monarch and conducted prayers in his name, but not his temporal status and, consequently refused to pay him taxes. Moulay Slimane, Sultan of Morocco from 1792-1822, waged a war against the Amazigh in the Meknes region. They defeated his army and imprisoned him. He thought they would definitely kill him, but actually, instead, they took off his clothes and gave him new ones, cut his old clothes into hundreds of pieces and distributed them among the tribesmen as a symbol of religious grace (baraka). He was seen as a representative of Allah in his land. Then, they accompanied him to the gates of his capital city Fes and released him unharmed. Back on the throne, he decided to put an end to any military actions against the rebellious Amazigh of Morocco. Traditionally, the Ministry of Islamic Waqf and Religious Affairs has always been located in the palace precinct (mechouar) so that the monarch can walk to its building on foot to check on the religious affairs of the nation. In addition, the sovereign has in the past and still today made annual money gifts to the religious lodges of moderate Sufi Islam located all over the country to secure their infallible support. Today, the strong Sufi lodge of the Boutchichiya Tariqa, located in the environs of the city of Berkane, in eastern Morocco, has millions of followers in Morocco and abroad, and they are, too, all staunch followers of the monarchy. Indeed, during the Arab Spring in 2011, they staged a monster demonstration in Casablanca, with millions of participants, in support of the monarchy. Civil society is thriving in Morocco; its number is estimated at approximately 80,000 associations and, most importantly, it is very credible in the eyes of the people for a number of reasons, chief among them are the following: But, alas, in spite of its success in alleviating poverty, providing much-needed help in education, health and many other areas to the “have nots,” yet civil society’s work could certainly be better and achieve more if it is provided with the necessary support in the areas of: Nevertheless, what is needed urgently in Morocco is to conduct a field study to determine the nature of civil society, its scope of work, its philosophy, its strengths and weaknesses, its successes and its impact on society at large. This study could take between 9 and 12 months and ought to be directed by sociologists, economists, and civil society experts. Once the survey is completed, its results could be quantified and analyzed to produce a National Strategy for Moroccan Civil Society Fieldwork that could enhance positively: Civil society is, without any shadow of doubt, the future of a stable, egalitarian, and democratic Morocco. Its work is needed to empower the poor and give the needy a voice and hope in the future and keep them away from extremism and violence. Moroccan people do not reject the monarchy’s cooptation of the religious field because it is synonymous with stability, tolerance, and moderation and, actually, when it comes to religion, most Moroccans are believers in the wasatiyya or middle of the road religious approach, which calls for brotherhood of men, tolerance and rejects religious violence and extremism. However, they reject the massive cooptation of the political field because it enhances corruption, nepotism, tribalism, patriarchy, and abuse of power. They strongly reject also, the cooptation of the press because it stifles free expression. Moroccans want, today, a constitutional monarchy and want all political actors to be fully accountable. Arabic Spring 2.0 is around the corner in Algeria where it is paving the way to democracy and surely Moroccans would not want to be the undemocratic neighbor of a democratic country.

Rabat – The squad of Raja Casablanca footballers arrived on October 2 to the Palestinian territories, ahead of the Moroccan club’s match against the Palestinian team Hilal Al-Quds.  Four Rajawi players were initially denied visas by Israeli authorities, causing the team to postpone their arrival in Jerusalem.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) has begun to fill the void left by the shutdown of major British tour operator Thomas Cook. ONMT has closed its first deal with NG Travel, a French tour operator. The Moroccan government dispatched a crisis unit to handle the repatriation of Thomas Cook customers on September 23, the day of the company’s collapse. Now, ONMT is working on a long-term solution. The global tourism expo Top Resa took place in Paris one week after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, which was a key player in Morocco’s international tourism sector. ONMT used the opportunity to attract another tour operator, and secured a deal with NG Travel. The head of ONMT signed a contract with the French company on October 1, with the aim of increasing tourism in the winter months by 35% with the company. NG Travel is France’s sixth largest tour operator and has been active in Morocco for three years. The chair of the company, Olivier Kervella, blames Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy on poor debt management and risk taking. He argues that digital channels like NG Travel require less commitment with airlines and hotels and therefore come with less risk and fewer expenses. Although not nearly as large an operation as Thomas Cook, NG Travel was responsible for 30,000 tourist arrivals in 2018. It is now the second largest tour operator in Morocco after the German travel company TUI. The agreement between ONMT and NG Travel will initially focus on ushering in 16,200 tourists for the upcoming winter season. Since the collapse of Thomas Cook, Morocco has been left with MAD 200 million ($20 million) in unpaid bills, with hotel owners bearing the burden of this debt.

Rabat – UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is cautiously optimistic about the ongoing UN-led process to broker the longstanding territorial dispute in Western Sahara. With the UN set to discuss the dossier later this month, Guterres, who was commenting yesterday on the UN schedule for Western Sahara, insisted that the UN’s priority is to “maintain the momentum achieved last year.” A blend of optimism and caution after months of inactivity and perceived stasis in the Western Sahara dossier, Guterres’s statement comes as the UN struggles to find a suitable replacement for Host Kohler, the latest and arguably the most effective UN envoy for Western Sahara in recent years. Kohler, who was appointed in 2017 as the UN Secretary General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, breathed new life into a halting resolution process in the intricate Western Sahara question. In just two years, the German diplomat produced unprecedented diplomatic breakthroughs, including the inclusion of Algeria and Mauritania as full-fledged participants in the political resolution talks alongside Morocco and the Polisario Front. Since his resignation in May, however, the momentum he helped build seemed to have given space to an extended period of hesitation, stagnation, and uncertainty. But Guterres is hopeful. As he sees it, the long period of silence that followed Kohler’s resignation was necessary for seriously thinking about the best replacement for the German diplomat. While Guterres did not say whether a suitable replacement has been found yet, he insisted that the main challenge of the next personal envoy is keeping alive the hope and diplomatic efficiency that Kohler helped rekindle in his two-year tenure. “It is essential that the momentum is maintained,” he declared. Guterres asserted, however, that the climate of suspicion and mistrust persisting in the relationship between conflicting parties may still be a major obstacle for a lasting, politically negotiated resolution. In addition to maintaining the momentum achieved under Kohler, the next envoy should also invest in robust trust-building initiatives, he noted. Meanwhile, the prevailing sentiment among UN diplomats is that it will be particularly hard to find a suitable replacement for Kohler. Evoking the complexity of the Western Sahara question, one unnamed UN diplomat hinted at, according to Moroccan outlet H24, the difficulty of finding a diplomat with the same profile as Kohler. “We need someone with the right skills and experience… and willing to be involved in this whole thing,” the diplomat said.

Rabat – Rwandan President Paul Kagami is expected to arrive in Morocco on October 12 to take part in the World Policy Conference in Marrakech, African Intelligence reported. Marrakech will host the symposium on October 12-14, convening top-level decision-makers, academics, and international experts. The French Institute of International Relations( IFRI) will organize the symposium in partnership with the Policy Center for the New South and Morocco’s Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP). Kagame’s visit will be the first of its kind since  June 2016 when he met with King Mohammed VI. The monarch then visited Rwanda in October of the same year. Kagame is among the African leaders who strongly welcomed Morocco’s return to the African Union in 2017. Morocco and Rwanda decided to strengthen their diplomatic ties after the exchange of visits between King Mohammed VI and Kagame. The two countries established diplomatic ties following the royal visit to Rwanda in 2016. During the King’s visit, senior officials from Rabat and Kigali signed several bilateral agreements. In March 2019, both countries signed further 12 agreements during the first session of the High Joint Committee between the two countries. The two countries reinforced their partnership through the signing of a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the poultry industry in Kigali,  on October 2. Mohamed Youssef Alaoui, President of Moroccan Poultry Inter-Professional Federation (FISA) and Andrew Buatre, President of Rwandan Poultry Industry Association (RPIA). Rwandan Minister of Agriculture Gerardine Mukeshimana and Moroccan Ambassador to Rwanda Youssef Imani attendee the signing ceremony. Maghreb Arab Press(MAP) reported that the singing of this memorandum “stems from the importance given by the two countries to bilateral cooperation in the field of agriculture, which witnessed a turning point since the launch of the agricultural partnership program between Morocco and Rwanda during the visit HM King Mohammed VI to Rwanda in 2016.”

Rabat – Hours before the second leg match with Palestinian club Hilal Al-Quds in the Arab Club Championships, Morocco’s Raja of Casablanca found itself at the heart of a highly political, contentious topic. As Raja prepared to travel to Jerusalem for the match, debates of “diplomatic normalization” between Morocco and Israel have occupied the background of the difficulties recently experienced by some players and technical staff of the Moroccan club. Reports have so far confirmed that four Rajawi players—Hamid Ahddad, Omar Boutayeb Abderrazzak Ghazout, and Sanad El Ouarfalli—were denied visas by Israeli authorities. It is also understood that some other members of the club’s technical staff faced the same issue. “Raja Casablanca football team was forced to postpone its travel to Jerusalem until Wednesday after it was rescheduled on Tuesday because of delay in obtaining… visas” for the four players, Ahdath.info reported.
The Israeli authorities have not provided details about the problem with the Rajawi players’ visa applications. The issue, however, is reported to have been successfully dealt with, and the Raja Casablanca-Hilal Al-Quds game is set to be played today as planned, at 5 p.m. (Moroccan time). Raja won the first-leg in Casablanca by 1-0. Meanwhile, the visa incident has stirred “normalization” debates, with some voices finding connections between the Raja players’ problems with Israeli security officials and Morocco’s stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Fans of the Moroccan club who plan to travel to Jerusalem to watch the match have been accused of “normalizing” Israel’s claims on Palestinian territories, reports have indicated. The main point in such suggestions is that traveling to Jerusalem and having one’s passports stamped by Israeli officials amounts to a “betrayal” of the fight to delegitimize Israel’s authority on Al Quds, Jerusalem. Critics, mostly from the ranks of anti-normalization activists, have called on Raja fans to not have their passports “stamped by the Zionists,” a Moroccan newspaper recently reported. In response, a spokesperson for the Palestinian club told the same newspaper that the game has nothing to do with “normalizing Israel.” Instead, argued Tamer Obeidat, Hilal Al-Quds’s spokesperson, a football match with international exposure is much-needed for giving more visibility and legitimacy to the Palestinian cause. “The Moroccan team will play on the Palestinian, in Al Quds, the capital of Palestine in accordance with the international law,” he said. “Raja will play with a Palestinian team that has an audience and a managing team, it will not play in Tel Aviv and players and fans’ passports will not be stamped by Israel. “We desperately need to visit our Arab brothers in order to strengthen our ties, and to feel that there is an Arab body standing with us and supporting us.” The news comes on the heels of a politically sensitive period in the Morocco-Israel relations. A series of news reports recently speculated about sings of potential “diplomatic normalization” between Morocco and Israel. There were suggestions that Moroccan and Israeli governments were working on laying the groundwork of a meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and King Mohammed VI. In the past months, however, Morocco has adamantly dismissed any suggestions of normalization with Israel. In addition to King Mohammed’s repeated calls against the move to make Jerusalem the de jure capital of Israel, Morocco has unrelentingly reiterated its “principled” and “firm” commitment to the Palestinian cause. Most recently, the Moroccan government “firmly condemned” Israel’s expansionist ambitions in the Jordan Valley, citing its concern with safeguarding the “inalienable rights of Palestinians.”

Rabat – Local authorities in Mediouna province, near Casablanca, dismantled two illegal workshops manufacturing banned plastic bags. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced the September 27 operation in a press release. During the operation, authorities seized more than 1.5 tonnes of banned plastic bags, 888 kg of plastic waste, 100 kg of raw material, and nine machines and tools used for manufacturing plastic bags. The authorities also shut down the two workshops, and opened an investigation. Police had previously carried out a similar operation in Mohammedia. The operation led to seizing 490 kg of plastic bags, along with machines and tools used in the manufacture. DGSN has launched more than five operations in the region in recent weeks as part of a campaign against illegal plastic bags manufacturers. In 2016, the Moroccan government banned the use of single-use plastic bags. The prohibition campaign was named “Zero Mika.” It was implemented through a new law. Article 2 of Law 77-15 in Morocco’s penal code prohibits the production, import, export, marketing, use, and even free distribution of plastic bags. The ban applies only to single-use bags known as “suspenders,” usually given to customers at local markets or grocery stores.

Rabat – Hirak Rif (Rif Movement) leader Nasser Zefzafi, serving to 20 years in prison, has called for a march to honor the 3rd-anniversary of Mouhcine Fikri’s death. Zefzafi’s call for march came in a letter he dictated to his father on the phone. He addressed the letter to all Rifians living in Europe, calling on them to gather in Paris, on October 26. In his letter, Zefzafi told the Rifians to not let “despair control them and obstruct their way. Our path to freedom is long and difficult.”  He added that “patience and hope is the weapon to fight their struggles until achieving their purpose.” “Our people (Rifians) are going through difficult times which can be overcome and fought by leaving aside all that leads to division and discord,” Zefzafi wrote. The Hirak Rif leader, who is serving time in Ras Lma prison in Fez, recalled that “the victory of their ancestors over colonialism started from leaving tribal conflicts and uniting ranks because the interest of the Rif region is above everything else.” The death of Mouhcine Fikri was the catalyst for the Hirak Rif movement. Fikri, an informal sector fishmonger, was crushed to death in a garbage truck in October 2016 while attempting to retrieve his goods. Local authorities had seized and disposed of his merchandise in the truck. Many activists, led by Nasser Zefzafi, were arrested for conspiracy against the security of the state after they protested the living conditions in Al Hoceima in 2016 and 2017. Fikri’s death caused a surge in protests in Al Hoceima and the surrounding areas. Chanting social slogans, the protesters decried social disparities in the region and called on the government to establish infrastructures such as roads, universities, and hospitals. The sentencing of the activists also prompted protests. The Hirak movement came to Rabat, with protests outside parliament calling for the immediate release of the activists.

Raba – International experts were amazed to find the first skeletal remains of a Phoebodus, an ancient shark in the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Phys.org announced the discovery on October 2, announcing that expert researchers working in the field were stunned to find the remains of several prehistoric creatures. The experts found skulls and a complete skeleton from a Phoeboous, an ancient shark that lived 350 million years ago. Researchers believe that the discovery is “unprecedented.” Researchers often find shark teeth, including those of the Phoeboduss, which are “the most common fossils discovered on the planet,” Fox News reported. The researchers say the latest discovery is unprecedented as the body of the Phoebodus is “primarily made of cartilage, a complete skeleton has never been found, until recently.” The researchers found the shark fossil in a mountainous region which used to be a shallow sea basin, according to Phys.org. “Testing of the material in which the shark remains were fossilized revealed that the specimens were approximately 370 million years old,” the statement added. When researchers studied the discovery, they found that the shark had a “long, think body” and a “flat skull and a long jaw.” This is not the first time experts have made important discoveries in Morocco. In August, paleontologists from the UK, in collaboration with researchers from Morocco, discovered a species of stegosaurian dinosaur. The species estimated to be 168 million years old. The landmark discovery, according to researchers, could possibly lead to further revelations.

Presentation themes include, but are not limited to, forensic medicine, cybercrime, and human rights.  Under the theme “serving the citizen, honor, and responsibility,” these days intend to strengthen the DGSN’s policy of openness with the general public. The DGSN is also using the event as an opportunity to inform citizens about modern initiatives to preserve public order while ensuring the safety of people and property.   In a statement to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), Tangier’s police chief, Mohamed Ouhtit, said that the culture of the Open Days underscores King Mohammed VI’s belief that citizen security is the “cornerstone of wise and enlightened policies.”  “DGSN’s Open Days are aimed at consolidating the feeling of security among citizens, to present the different missions of the police and security units, and to enshrine community policing,” according to Mr. Ouhtit’s statement.  Mr. Ouhtit also noted the advancement in the DGSN’s communication approach since the first and second JPO events in Casablanca and Marrakech, and praised the JPO as “an annual meeting of institutional communication with the citizens.”

Rabat – More than 300 people rallied today in front of the Moroccan parliament in protest against the verdict of Rabat’s Court of First Instance in the case of journalist Hajar Raissouni. Both Raissouni, 28, and her fiance received a sentence of one year in prison on September 30 for illegal abortion and sex outside marriage. The police arrested the journalist and her fiance on August 31 for “illegal abortion and premarital sexual relations.” The journalist writes for the Arabic-language daily Akhbar Al Youm. The court’s decision divided public opinion and stirred a backlash, with activists and human rights NGOs calling on the judiciary system to repeal laws against abortion. Activists,- women and men – of all ages, held banners protesting the verdict. The banners were similar to theslogans chanted during the protest, said “Freedom for Hajar,” and “freedom for Rifaa al-Amine,” Raissouni’s fiance of a Sudanese nationality. Other protesters held banners calling for the release of Raissouni’s doctor,who received a two year prison sentence for conducting her alleged abortion. Both Raissouni and the doctor denied the abortion charges against them. Other slogans that protesters chanted during the protest suggest that the journalist’s arrest is a political move due to her writing, an accusation that the public prosecutor at the first instance court denied. On September 5, the prosecutor said that Raissouni was arrested due to illegal abortion and not for journalism. The journalist is known for her interviews with parents of Hirak Rif detained activists, such as the prominent leader of the social movement, Nasser Zefafi. Activists at the protest also condemn the defamation of her case on social media. Individualism At the protest, feminists and activists shouted their prepared slogans with cracked voices. While solidarity motivated some of the activists to go out to express support for Raissouni, others seized the protest as an opportunity to decry the lack of individualism in Morocco. “We came here to express our anger against the verdict Hajar Raissouni received,”deputy president of Federal Association for Women Rights Samira Muheya told Morocco World News. The activist added that the verdict and the crimes attributed to Raissouni should be retracted. Muheya called on the government to amend and repeal the laws in place with new ones that keep pace with our era. Article 453 in Morocco’s penal code stipulates that abortion is not punishable if it is practiced to preserve the mother’s physical health in case of a medical threat. In this case, abortion can be openly practiced with the spouse’s authorization. It is both punishable for the doctor and the patient. Sex outside marriage is also a crime in Morocco, according to Article 16 of the Family Code. The article clarifies that a legal contract is the only document accepted to prove a marriage. Abortion “should not be illegal,” a protester said. “What if a woman was raped? Abortion save souls and lives of children. It is better than throwing children in the street,” he added. Days after the arrest of Raissouni, feminists and activists signed a manifesto to criticize Morocco’s laws criminalzing sexual abo relations outside marriage and abortion.
Raissouni and all other defendants prosecuted in the case will appeal the verdict.

Rabat – Moroccan recruitment website ReKrute published a survey on the pros and cons of call center work. The survey, published on Tuesday, October 1, studied a sample of 1359 Moroccans who currently work in or have previously worked in a call center.  ReKrute carried out the survey to analyze whether call center jobs are a life-changing opportunity when it comes to looking for a future job and developing soft-skills. The survey also revealed the negative aspects of call center jobs. Around 54% responded positively to questions about the benefits of call center experience for future jobs. The study subjects said that their experience in call centers helped them to develop their skills and find a future job. “Call centers allow employees to acquire new key skills to help them develop their career,” said ReKrute. However, a further 46% stated that their experience in call centers did not help them to get another job. Meanwhile, 35% of call center employees declared that call centers are an opportunity-rich environment and helped them to learn good manners in business. The positive impact on employees’ lives is attributed to the large teams, the objectives, and workflow which requires psychological and interpersonal skills, and a good stress-resistance. While the survey found that call center work can be career-boosting, it also found some more negative aspects.  Call center workers reported feeling stressed and nervous following the pressure of the work environment. Around 72% of the respondents said they suffered from stress. The survey report linked the stress levels to handling customer calls, in addition to pressure to meet the team goals. To ensure a smooth workflow, some call centers managers pay as much attention to work as they do to the workplace by creating entertainment spaces such as video games room, restrooms, pool rooms, and relaxation days. Around 35% consider that the remuneration is ‘moderate’ while 41% think that it is attractive.

Rabat – In a special 75th edition of l’Essentiel des Relations Internationales, the French magazine devoted more than 100 pages to Morocco. The publication focused particularly on King Mohammed VI and his 20 years of rule. “In two decades of rule, His Majesty King Mohammed VI has irreversibly committed his country to progress, development and democracy,” the editorial begins. The King’s reign “is part of the continuity of the reforms initiated by the late King Hassan II, and is based on a vision and visionary approach,” the magazine continues. Since his ascension to the throne in 1999, King Mohammed VI fashioned his royal vision around investments in infrastructure, “which are essential for strengthening interconnections and providing the foundation for economic and social development.” The magazine applauds Morocco’s ports, roads, high-speed trains, airports, and energy production. The port of Tangier Med, an “undeniable success,” is just one example of the region’s growing “attractiveness and dynamism.” Additionally, Morocco’s reintegration in the African Union in early 2017, after 33 years of absence, highlighted African leaders’ renewed confidence in Morocco under King Mohammed VI. Morocco’s “unfailing commitment to peace and development [has been] welcomed by the leaders of African countries, who also see in Morocco a major lever for stability and prosperity.” The Kingdom “spares no effort to help its African neighbors through cooperation agreements or sharing of expertise: emergency assistance, investments, security, education and training, environment and sustainable development.” Morocco’s continental investment The economic news outlet African Business reported that 85% of Morocco’s foreign direct investment was channelled to sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, and has only increased since. Morocco has invested in sectors such as phosphates, banking, telecoms, and consumer goods. King Mohammed VI’s diplomatic and economic initiatives in West Africa and the Sahel began in 2010, according to the Carnegie Middle East Center. Morocco also established a bilateral security cooperation with Chad in 2013, which lead to cooperation in other areas such as water scarcity, sanitation, and management. The Kingdom is also an active investor in the banking and telecom sectors for Burkina Faso and reached a military cooperation agreement with Mali in March 2018. Morocco partnered with Niger in July 2018 to confront issues such as youth employment and climate change. Although historical relations with Mauritania have fluctuated, Morocco is currently a key investor in the Mauritanian mining industry. Morocco and Mauritania have worked together to secure border zones and plan to advance cooperation in other sectors, such as renewable energy and health, in the future. Morocco: a strategic player in African development The 75 edition of l’Essentiel des Relations Internationales notes Morocco’s role in continental development. The editorial’s introduction is followed by a brief prologue by l’Essentiel contributor Laurent Taieb, who lauds Morocco as a “strategic player in African development.” “We wanted to show through these pages how Morocco has developed, to the point of becoming an example of African emergence, thanks to the profoundly pan-African vision and action of its King,” Taieb writes. “Mohammed VI is acclaimed by his people, but also abroad, as evidenced by the testimony of his peers and foreign ministers of the continent.”
