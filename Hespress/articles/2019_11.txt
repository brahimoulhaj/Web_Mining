Rabat – The city of Ouazzane, 70 kilometers south of Chefchaouen in northern Morocco, will receive MAD 42 million to enhance its tourism potential. A special council session of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region approved a draft convention to make Ouazzane a primary destination for both domestic and international tourists.  Ouazzane, known as Dar Dmana, is considered to be a holy place by both Muslim and Jewish communities. This spiritual center at the edge of the Rif Mountains is set to become a hub for religious pilgrims with the new investment in the city’s tourism sector.     A post shared by Ouezzane Dardmana 🇲🇦 (@ouezzanedardmana) on Mar 9, 2019 at 6:45am PST  The program should be carried out within a maximum period of 36 months, according to Moroccan news outlet Aujourdhui.  All contracting parties are responsible for contributing their share to the program’s financing in accordance with a pre-established agenda. The parties involved include Ouazzane’s Department of Culture and the Council of the Commune of Ouazzane. Each must allocate MAD 3 million to the project for a total of MAD 6 million.  Morocco’s Ministry of Tourism, Air Transport, Handicrafts, and Social Economy is set to devote around MAD 16 million to develop Ouazzane’s tourism. Meanwhile, the Regional Tourist Council of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (CRT-TTA) must set aside MAD 7 million for the initiative.  The tourism development program is set to provide support for the city’s tourist accommodation, facilitate Ouazzane’s involvement in tourism circuits, and enhance Ouazzane’s tourist sites along with the city’s public squares and historic monuments.

Rabat – The man who stabbed multiple people in a London Bridge knife attack on Friday, November 29 was known to authorities, reports say. Usman Khan, 28, served prison time for plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange in an al-Qaeda inspired terrorist attack. The London Bridge terrorist attack began at 1:58 GMT on Friday at the north end of the bridge. Khan stabbed multiple people, killing two and injuring three others.  Before police arrived, members of the public worked to restrain the suspect.  Social media footage from people at the scene shows an armed officer gesturing for the group to move away from Khan. The officer then fired a shot, killing the assailant.  Khan appeared to have been wearing a hoax explosive device, prompting the officer to shoot.   A convicted terrorist released after rehabilitation BBC News reported that police initially arrested Khan and eight others in 2010 for terrorism offenses.  MI5, the UK’s domestic counterintelligence and security agency, had been surveilling the group’s terrorist plot. The group members were from Stoke-on-Trent, England; London, England; and Cardiff, Wales.   The group, inspired by al-Qaeda, plotted to attack the London Stock Exchange and pubs in Stoke-on-Trent. The group also discussed setting up a jihadist training camp in Pakistan.  A judge sentenced Khan in 2012 with a minimum jail term of eight years. In 2013, the Court of Appeal replaced the original sentence with a 16-year jail term. The UK native only served half of the term in prison under the UK’s early release laws. Khan was released from prison in December 2018 after taking part in the government’s desistance and disengagement program, according to London’s Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu. The program aims to rehabilitate people who have been involved in terrorism.  After leaving prison, Khan agreed to wear an electronic tag. The GPS device allowed police to monitor his movements. He was wearing the tag at the time of the attack. Leading up to the Friday terrorist attack, Khan had been attending a Cambridge University conference on prisoner rehabilitation at Fishmongers’ Hall. The conference was part of an initiative that allows university students and prisoners to study alongside each other.  The London Bridge was the scene of another terrorist attack just two years ago. On June 3, 2017, a terrorist killed eight people were killed and injured many more after deliberately ramming a van into pedestrians.  MI5 maintains that the general threat of terrorism to the UK is substantial, meaning a terrorist attack is likely.

Rabat – The eighth International Dakhla Film Festival wrapped up on Friday, November 29 after nearly a week of festivities, featuring Cuban cinema as the guest of honor. The event in Dakhla, a peninsula in southern Morocco, began on November 24 under the patronage of King Mohammed VI. The 2019 Dakhla Film Festival invited international celebrities, artists, filmmakers, and personalities to honor four Cuban filmmakers and pay homage to Cuban cinema. The festival honored Cuban actress Mirtha Ibarra and Cuban directors Arturo Infante, Sebastian Milo, and Ever Miranda Palacio. According to Moroccan news outlet Labass, the festival also paid tribute to Moroccan actress Fatima Zahra Bennacer, Moroccan director Kamal Hachkar, and Lebanese journalist Jamal Fayad. The cultural event is held as part of the 44th anniversary of the Green March, the source added.  The festival’s president, Zine El Abidine Charafeddine, referred to the eighth installment of the event as a turning point. Morocco and Cuba re-established diplomatic relations and exchanged ambassadors in 2017. By electing Cuba as the guest of honor, the 2019 Dakhla Film Festival sought to strengthen relations between Morocco and Cuba.  Cuban cinema emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. About 80 full-length films, primarily melodramas, were produced in Cuba by the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Cuba was a pioneer in the cinematic atmosphere of Latin America. These glory days, however, have since passed due to lack of funding for cinema. Only 19 movie theaters remain in Cuba today, compared to the nearly 700 in 1953—more than New York City or Paris at the time.

Rabat- Morocco’s National Meteorological Directorate’s (NMD) forecast for the coming  week shows mild snowfall in several provinces around the country on Monday and Tuesday. The statement says next week’s wave of cold weather and mild snowfall will mostly hit in the provinces of Al Haouz, Azilal, Béni Mellal, Midelt, Ifrane, Boulemane, Sefrou, Khenifra, Taza, Guercif, and Tinghir. Snowfall is traditionally received with mixed emotions in Morocco, with the beauty of snow-capped landscapes mitigated with safety concerns associated with heavy snowfall. The cold season in Morocco is associated with an increase of domestic tourism to the snowy provinces, with snow lovers flocking to places like Ifrane to experience weekends of snow-covered roads, poplar trees, and other snow-covered landscapes. At the same time, however, heavy snowfall comes with risk and concerns about safety (mostly linked with transport, logistics), as well as health issues. “The story of early snowfalls is not all roses; the charm of a snow-soaked town or city comes with its own risks and challenges for day-to-day life,” an MWN report recently explained. “Despite the natural beauty of wild snow-covered roads, Moroccan authorities have taken precautionary measures to deal with drop in temperatures and heavy snowfalls in Ifrane and other snowy provinces.”

Rabat – The European Parliament on Thursday, November 28, condemned the grim reality of human rights in Algeria, calling on the North African country to end the criminalization of dissent, arbitrary arrests, and violations of minority rights. “MEPs are deeply worried about the state of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Algeria,” read a summary of the EU body’s stance on human rights breaches in Algeria. “[MEPs] strongly condemn the arbitrary and unlawful arrest and detainment of, attacks on and intimidations of journalists, trade unionists, lawyers, students, human rights defenders and civil society and all peaceful protesters taking part in the Hirak demonstrations.” The statement comes as post-Bouteflika Algeria grapples with the widening lack of trust between the political elite and masses of protesting Algerians. When Algerians took to the streets in February in a burst of anti-Bouteflika protests, the general mood among the political establishment was that the departure of the ailing president would ease tensions and satisfy young protesters. But the anti-Bouteflika movement quickly turned into a demand for a wholesale and radical generational change, with demonstrators demanding the departure of the entire Bouteflika cohort, made up of politicians, military leaders, and technocrats who have led the country for the last two or three decades. This weekend, many in Algiers took to streets to once again express their discontent with the current leadership. They opposed the upcoming presidential elections (scheduled for December 12), with many arguing that the coming elections are part of the establishment’s ploy to hijack the Hirak demonstrations. In addition to the political uncertainty and arbitrary arrests that have characterized post-Bouteflika Algeria, MEPs also mentioned the plight of minorities in Algeria, “calling for an end to violations against the freedom of Christians, Ahmadis and other religious minorities to worship.” They also “urged the Algerian authorities to desist from judicial and legislative harassment, criminalization and arbitrary arrest and detentions.”

Rabat – Since Ivanka Trump’s tweet congratulating Morocco on passing a law to facilitate equal rights in inheritance and her much-publicized visit to the kingdom as part of a “women’s empowerment” initiative, women’s rights in Morocco have been hitting headlines globally.  It cannot be denied that the country has made strides in recent years: Women now have the right to file for divorce and to pass nationality on to their children. Through a recently passed bill, women can more easily and fairly inherit land. There have been changes to the penal code and to the family code. And, while these changes have been called into question by activists and international analysts who see them as merely symbolic, unactionable words, the government maintains that progress is being made. Morocco’s King Mohammed VI has made equal rights a priority in his speeches and in the mandate he gives to Morocco’s government. From the outside, Morocco looks like a country that is aiming to join the front runners in the equalities race.   However, the strides Morocco has made since the 2011 constitutional changes do not hold up in comparison with other countries on the international stage.  The World Economic Forum’s 2018 Global Gender Gap Report placed Morocco 137th out of 149 countries and a disappointing 141st out of 149 in terms of economic participation, meaning that every effort in this area is worth noting and celebrating to create more impetus in empowering women.  Ivanka Trump’s visit to the rural women of Morocco earlier this month and the White House’s well-meaning Women’s Global Prosperity and Development Initiative for the empowerment of women in “developing countries” are not the first agencies or individuals to intervene in Moroccan women’s uphill struggle towards equality. However, while these token initiatives, interventions, and investments come with the best intentions, what needs to change in Morocco can only change from within.  Gender equality can only come from an overhaul in attitudes and culture from inside Morocco, and from efforts made in education and public institutions. These efforts must come from both genders. One such endeavor is already in action. Morocco’s judiciary, a body that actively promotes equal rights and opportunities for women in the workplace, hopes to engender a culture of non-discrimination within its ranks by encouraging women to reach leadership positions.  “With social changes over the past few years, women have an important place in the Moroccan judiciary,” Jemaa Ighuiouane from Ksar El Kebir’s Court of First Instance told Morocco World News.  However, she went on, “although women occupy important decision-making posts there is still a lot to do to address gender disparities and the challenges women face at work.”  “Women represent 50% of the Moroccan judiciary,” Abdessadeck Saaidi told Liberation, a Moroccan news outlet. Saaidi is the president of the Friends of the Judiciary, a national union that supports public servants in the Moroccan justice sector. He went on to explain that most of the high level posts in the Ministry of Justice are “monopolized” by men. The union wants to change this. On Friday, November 22, in Essaouira, the Friends of the Judiciary joined public servants from Essaouira’s Court of First Instance, and the American Association for Judges and Lawyers (AAJA) for a women’s empowerment training session. The training session, organized by the Friends of the Judiciary and delivered by the AAJA, is part of a much larger initiative that aims to bring life for public servants within Morocco’s judiciary in line with international human rights laws and regulations.  A key part of this is fighting against all types of gender discrimination in the work place.  “Women still feel a certain level of discrimination at work when compared to their male counterparts,” Ighuiouane shared with MWN.  In her experience as a woman in the Moroccan judiciary, “women’s diplomas and qualifications are often ignored in favor of less qualified male candidates, particularly when talking about higher level jobs and responsibilities.” For the Friends of the Judiciary, stamping out this type of discrimination is a key step towards meeting international human rights regulations and standards.  Said Handaji, the union’s advisor, told MWN that “the training session was a key part of the efforts to stamp out gender discrimination at work. We hope to be able to roll it out nationally after the success of the Essaouira session.” “Women are a vital part of our work force and should be treated with the same respect as their male counterparts at every level,” added the advisor.  Gender discrimination in the work place is prohibited in Morocco under article 9 of the Work Code, adopted in 2003. According to the code, Moroccan employment law does not allow “any discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex or disability” concerning “salary, advancement, the granting of social benefits, disciplinary measures and dismissal.”  The journey to equal rights and equal pay is a long one. In countries like the UK and the US, where laws against gender discrimination in the work place have been in action for considerably longer than Morocco’s 2003 addition to its employment law, women and men are still struggling to wipe out a deeply ingrained culture of gender disparity and discrimination.  According to the UK government’s national statistics office: “The gender pay gap among full-time employees stands at 8.9%, little changed from 2018, and a decline of only 0.6 percentage points since 2012.” This means that women in full time employment in the UK are earning, on average, nearly 10% less than men. The statistics office stipulates that the gender pay gap is calculated “as the difference between average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men and women as a proportion of average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men’s earnings.” The website adds that the percentage “is a measure across all jobs in the UK, not of the difference in pay between men and women for doing the same job.” Morocco’s gender pay gap currently stands at 17%, according to 2017 statistics from a Ministry of Finance study. The study also showed that “the participation of Moroccan women in working life remains limited.”  Taking the UK’s 0.6% of progress in seven years as an example, it will be decades before Morocco closes up the gender pay gap and stamps out gender discrimination once and for all.  However, if such discrimination remains rife within the judiciary, the body responsible for enforcing and interpreting employment law in the kingdom, how can Morocco’s work force expect to see the code’s stipulations in action? The first step must be wiping out gender based discrimination within the Ministry of Justice itself, and education and training is a key part of changing the ingrained culture of unconcious gender disparities.  The Friends of the Judiciary, through their initiatives and collaborations with the AAJA, are prioritizing education and training in an effort to develop a culture of equality within the judiciary.  “The project begins with the development of educational programs,” Lahcen Bouhamou, a representative from the AAJA, told Liberation.  If these educational programs and training sessions can spread through Morocco’s judiciary and engender a culture of equality among those responsible for dispensing justice, Morocco’s employment law has a good chance of making that much-needed difference in the long term.

Rabat – African scientists have gathered in Casablanca for the One Planet Fellowship Science week, an event running from November 25 to December 1. The week-long event aims to promote the fellowship, form partnerships, and create advocacy networks, as well as host a roundtable discussion regarding strategies to help African smallholder farmers deal with climate change.  “The continent contributes less than 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but stands on the frontline of the economic and social consequences of climate change while receiving just 5% of climate funding … In North Africa, yields from farming are expected to fall as a result of reduced rainfall and declining water availability for irrigated agricultural production,” announced the organization in a recent press release. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation launched the One Planet Fellowship in 2017, with aims to utilize $19.2 million to innovate and develop climate research throughout Africa. The 45 scientists attending the Casablanca meeting are the first to be accepted into the program; however, more are soon to join. In a press release, the One Planet Fellowship organizers unveiled their goal to fund a total of 630 scientists from Africa and Europe over the next 4 years. The One Planet Fellowship has opened a call for applications targeting scientists under the age of 40 who have achieved a master’s degree or higher. Both Morocco and Algeria have qualified as eligible countries. According to the press release, “the three-year Fellowship pairs early-career scientists with senior African research mentors, who support them in progressing their careers. In the second year, Laureate Candidates then have the opportunity to participate in research placements at leading European institutions, where they receive expert supervision on a mutually agreed climate research project.” Not only do researchers have the opportunity to learn from an experienced guide, but also the chance to become one themselves. “In the final year of the Fellowship, the Laureate Candidates select emerging African and European scientists to mentor, creating an intergenerational mentorship chain.” “The mentoring and support I have received through the Fellowship so far have been invaluable for my work,” said Dr. Austin Phiri, chief agricultural scientist at the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water in Malawi and laureate candidate for the One Planet Fellowship.  “Carrying out research that will directly help farmers to deal with the impacts of climate change in my own country is truly rewarding, and I would definitely encourage other scientists to apply.”

If you’ve ever entertained any interest in making a trip to Morocco, you’ve undoubtedly encountered the name “Chefchaouen.” Whether you’ve seen pictures on travel blogs or your friend’s Instagram, this beautiful city proudly claims worldwide fame.  Known for its striking azure medina (old city) and cobbled streets, the Blue Pearl of Morocco definitely needs to be at the top of your travel bucket list.  Chefchaouen is nestled in Morocco’s northern Rif Mountains. Its weather patterns are comparable to other popular Moroccan destinations, but the city may feel colder than average in the winter due to more frequent rain and cloudy skies.  You can reach Chefchaouen by bus, car, or taxi. The closest major cities are Tangier and Tetouan to the north and Fez to the south, so flying into one of these airports is a good option if the blue city is your first stop. If you’re doing a circuit of Morocco, plan to spend a day in Chefchaouen while traveling from Fez to Tetouan or Tangier.  There are many theories that seek to explain the city’s remarkable blue buildings. One explanation is that the color keeps away mosquitos; another is that Jewish refugees painted the city in the 1930s to symbolize the sky, heaven, and spirituality. Another theory is that authorities commissioned locals to paint the city to attract tourists.  Regardless of the initial reason, the buildings receive regular touch-ups to preserve the Blue Pearl’s signature shade.  The blue city is full of guesthouses and hotels that can accommodate travelers. Most have beautiful decor and rich histories, especially those inside the medina. Many travelers report fewer instances of harassment, scams, and theft in Chefchaouen than compared to other Moroccan cities. The blue city is quite safe and visitors should have no qualms about going out at night. The souk is one of the city’s main tourist attractions. Visitors who have braved the busy markets of Fez and Marrakech will notice a stark change in atmosphere while shopping in Chefchaouen. Despite being one of Morocco’s most popular tourist destinations, Chefchaouen is considerably more calm than other hotspots such as Fez and Marrakech. Whether it be due to the soothing shades of blue or the crisp mountain air, you will feel at peace in Chefchaouen.

Rabat – Before Salman Rushdie published The Satanic Verses in 1990; before the Twin Towers were struck by a terrorist attack on 9/11; and before the polemic, Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, related to the acclaimed Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, was gruesomely murdered by a radical Salafi on the streets of Amsterdam in 2004, people in the Netherlands paid little attention to the “exotic,” recently arrived newcomers from Morocco. In the late 1960s, a vicar by the name of Rolf Boiten noticed this particular mutual indifference when he saw a small group of Moroccan children wandering the streets around Amsterdam’s red light district.  “Guest workers,” that is what their fathers were called. They worked in factories, shipyards, and assembly lines throughout the day to earn money for the lives they planned to return to in Morocco, while their children had nowhere to go to school. Boiten and his wife decided to start a school for these children; children needed to be prepared for their journey back to Morocco.  “What on earth compels a vicar to start a school for the children of Moroccan guest workers?” Nadia Bouras, a well-known Dutch-Moroccan historian and former pupil of the Bouchra school, asked herself in the recently released film “Class of ‘94,” based on her historical research. Neighborly love “There was always something about the school, something elusive. I never could quite put my finger on it when I spent my time there as a young girl. Only later did I realize how special the school really was. It was a one-of-a-kind type of school, meant for the children of Moroccan guest workers and founded by Boiten based on the Christian value of ‘neighborly love,’” Bouras told Morocco World News. “The Bouchra school was quite a trailblazer in the late ’70s and fitted the narrative of back then, since it was expected Moroccans would eventually go back to Morocco. At the same time, public schools in the Netherlands simply did not know what to do with Moroccan attendees and [were] unable to provide proper education,” Bouras explained. “Bear in mind, unlike religious schools in modern society, the Bouchra school was not denominated as Islamic, but had an Arab profile. This meant we were taught about the history of Morocco as part of the Arab region, the cultural role of Islam, but we also celebrated Christmas and Saint Nicholas Day.”  Nevertheless, a school only meant for children of Moroccan guest workers? It raised more than one eyebrow in Amsterdam.  “The charge was levied against the school of ghettoizing the children and subsequently secluding them from Dutch society. At the official opening in 1982 the so-called ‘Komitee Marokkaanse Arbeiders in Nederland’ or Committee for Moroccan Workers in the Netherlands (KMAN) were even protesting in the presence of the Moroccan ambassador to the Netherlands, Hassan Fassi Fihri, outside the school gates, fearing the long arm of Hassan II,” Bouras explained.  The KMAN was a left-wing, activist group largely comprised of working-class Moroccans, advocating for the rights of Moroccan guest workers.  The KMAN regarded the Bouchra school as a tool of the Moroccan government to influence their subjects in the Netherlands. They were strongly opposed to this influence, in particular by the “Amicales,” an organization comprised of royalist, working-class Moroccans and known for reporting on “undesirable actions” by Moroccans who were living and working abroad.  “We weren’t actually all that busy with ‘going back to Morocco,’ it was much more about which teacher are we going to tease today?” Fatima Elatik told MWN. As the most well-known pupil of the Bouchra school, Elatik finds it hard to imagine a better place where she crafted her identity as a child other than the Bouchra school.  “The school was invaluable for shaping my Moroccan and Dutch identity. Unlike the never-ending song of the last twenty years, in which Dutch-Moroccans are told their Moroccan culture is backward and are better off to discard their Moroccan identity, we were taught in a safe environment there is nothing wrong with cherishing your Moroccan roots. It instilled me with a strong sense of citizenhood and shaped my self-confidence as a Dutch-Moroccan.”  Submission  In the years following the founding of the Bouchra school, objections to religious education, in particular Islamic education, and the role Islam plays within secular society became the subject of a more contentious debate in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, filmmaker and journalist Theo van Gogh spearheaded this debate by saying the multicultural society had failed and described Islam as a “backward culture.” Growing up as one of the most outspoken Dutch-Moroccans in the Netherlands, Elatik served as a councilor in Amsterdam for several years and as a self-described “enfant terrible” of the Social Democratic party, found herself in a polemic stand-off with Van Gogh on numerous occasions before his death in 2004.  Along with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born member of parliament from right-wing liberal party (VVD) and vocal critic of Islam, Van Gogh made a controversial film about the submission of women within Islam, featuring several actresses with verses of the Qur’an painted on their bodies.  Three months after the release of the film, Mohammed Bouyeri, a radical Salafi, murdered Van Gogh by shooting him with a pistol and stuck a knife in his corpse with a death threat directed at Hirsi Ali.  In the wake of Van Gogh’s death, the Netherlands saw the rise of far-right politician Geert Wilders with his Party for Freedom (PVV) in 2006; the intelligence service drastically changed its strategy concerning radical Islam; and Muslims were increasingly seen as unreliable, second-class citizens in the Netherlands.  Contrary to the tone of public opinion that followed the death of Van Gogh, Elatik underlines the value of her time at the Bouchra school, particularly being taught Arabic and getting to learn about the history of Morocco and Islam.  “The debate has radicalized tremendously since 9/11 and the death of Van Gogh. Personally, I was never susceptible to the whispers of Salafi preachers, because I knew my history and who I was. If I noticed so much as a whiff of corporal punishment in a mosque, I nipped it in the bud when I worked as a councilor at Amsterdam,” Elatik concluded.  Mint tea and cookies  Nevertheless, almost 20 years after the death of Van Gogh, Salafism still poses a threat to Dutch society.  In the week that marked 18 years since 9/11, the Dutch news outlets Nieuwsuur and NRC-Handelsblad published an ominous report about the growing influence of Salafism on Islamic weekend schools. Among other things, the extensive report details how children are being taught that “nonbelievers” deserve capital punishment.  “The revelations about the weekend schools are worrisome. Everyone has the freedom to shape his or her own identity, as far as the law allows,” Hassnae Bouazza told MWN.  As director of “Class of ’94,” Bouazza is known for making an acclaimed documentary about the position of women in the Arab region, titled “Sex and Sins,” featuring well-known Moroccan feminist Latifa Jbabdi. More recently, Bouazza wrote the preface of the Dutch translation of Leila Slimani’s book “Sex and Lies.” “‘Class of ‘94’ portrays a time in which it was expected we would eventually go back to Morocco. Though politicians and journalists are still stuck thinking of Dutch-Moroccans as strangers, I did not want to cater to the cliche image there is of Dutch-Moroccans. No mint tea and cookies in this film. It is redundant and devoid of love.” “I’m fed up with the worn-out debate we have. People are so much more layered and diverse than simply that ‘Moroccan’ or that ‘Muslim.’ More than anything else, I wanted to tell a story of mutual interest and shared humanity, hoping people take the effort and time to listen to ‘the other,’” Bouazza concluded.      A post shared by Morocco World News (@moroccoworldnews) on Dec 9, 2019 at 7:40am PST

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani officially launched Morocco’s campaign against the “scourge” of violence against women on Friday, November 29, in Rabat. In his speech, El Othmani noted that the issue “is not only a women’s affair, but [the problem] of all actors in society.” El Othmani welcomed the participation of NGOs and called for dialogue and preventive measures to tackle gender-based violence. In 2018, Morocco passed Law 103.13 on the elimination of violence against women. The law greatly increased the penalties for those caught harassing or assaulting women. However, El Othmani emphasized, “Repressive measures alone can not solve the problem.” While women’s rights activists have complained of the law’s vagueness and brevity, El Othmani asserted that it clearly defines gender-based violence and methods to eradicate it, MAP reports. Two Moroccan organizations working with women who have been victims of violence recently reported that they saw an increase in cases between 2017 and 2018. Moroccan civil society organizations are also highlighting violence against women as part of the international “16 days of activism against gender-based violence” campaign. The Tahadi Association for Equality and Citizenship (ATEC) is focusing especially on digital forms of abuse and harassment. In a press release shared with Morocco World News, ATEC noted that one in four Moroccan women are victims of “online violence.” The government’s project, its 17th annual campaign on the issue, will continue for several weeks under the theme “All young people united against violence against women” until December 20. Minister of Solidarity and Family Jamila Moussali also attended the campaign’s launch on Friday.

Rabat – “Since the establishment of our diplomatic relations, Morocco has attached great importance to education cooperation with Ghana, and that has become a very important part of our relations,” announced Imane Ouadiil, Moroccan ambassador to Ghana, at a soiree at the Moroccan embassy in Accra in honor of former and current participants of a scholarship program funded by Morocco. The Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation started the Ghanaian scholarship program in 2002 as a part of the initiative to provide opportunities for students across the continent.  On the morning of Friday, November 29th, the embassy announced that scholarships will this year be awarded to 106 students from Ghana to study at Moroccan universities. The scholarship beneficiaries are set to  travel to Morocco on December 10 to begin their studies at university.  Seventy students are slated to study undergraduate courses, 16 will undertake postgraduate courses and the remaining 20 are set to partake in vocational studies. This will be the largest Ghanaian group set to study in Morocco in the history of the program. Ghanaian student Emmanuel, a current recipient of the scholarship, told Morocco World News that “qualifying for this scholarship … after a lot of ups and downs … felt great … at least changing the environment, and at least to a comparably developed nation than my country.”  However, he described his studies as, “very stressful for Anglophones … we might be struggling to understand the French but … some profs (sic) might even be teaching in Arabic which you know nothing about … There’s no board/association in the schools to seek the needs of foreign students, No special treatment.” Another Ghanaian scholarship recipient, Judith, told Morocco World News, “as an anglophone student in a francophone country, it wasn’t easy integrating into the Moroccan system of education as well as their culture.” She stated, “Though education is free, their education system is particularly focused on marks and demotivates students who think outside the box. However, the large amount of pressure coming from professors puts students at (sic) the spot, where they master (sic) up courage to study even harder than they have ever studied in their entire lives.” With a focus on pan-African unity, Ouadiil stated at the soiree that “this cooperation scheme is meant to be a proactive, youth-oriented policy … for the achievement of our continent’s development.”  Peter Panyin Anaman, president of the Ghana Morocco Old Students Association, a club composed of former scholarship recipients, expressed pleasure at celebrating the 17th year of the scholarship program with the awardees. “I hope you will study hard and come back to contribute to Ghana’s prosperity and development and to the enhancement of friendship and mutual understanding between our two countries,” he said. Ouadiil stressed Morocco’s status as an African hub of education, stating, “the Kingdom is now the top African provider of study grants targeting African students … Morocco has trained over 25,000 graduates from 47 African countries including Ghana.”  Moroccan scholarship programs are not new, as programs for students from Africa and Carribbean countries such as Antigua and Barbuda alongside Jamaica have existed for years and continue to gain support.  Lavinia, an Antiguan student awarded a scholarship several years ago to study in Morocco, told Morocco World News, “It has been amazing to experience a new culture and educational environment, and also to meet so many people whom have become dear friends to me.”

Rabat – The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) approved on Thursday, November 28, a €100 million credit line for the Municipal Equipment Fund (FEC) to finance new projects of investment and utilities in Morocco.   With the decentralization, Morocco aims to transfer key powers and resources to local officials, and enable the regional authorities to have greater control of local economic development. Through the projects, local authorities aim to improve the quality of public services, particularly in rural areas, and to develop new economic and industrial activities at the local level, the AfDB said a statement.  “We are pleased with this first partnership with the FEC,” AfDB’s director general for the North Africa region, Mohamed El Azizi, said in a statement. He added that, with the bank’s investment in the initiative, “this operation will enable local authorities to increase the attractiveness of their territories to support, more globally, the dynamic of Morocco’s industrial acceleration.” By mobilizing funding to support Morocco’s decentralization plan, the FEC wants to strengthen and diversify the country’s production capacity and support growth in various sectors of the economy.  More broadly, the FEC aims to contribute to improving the country’s competitiveness, creating new employment opportunities, especially for youth and women, as well as generating significant tax revenue for the state, the AfDB pointed out in the statement.  The AfDB’s Country Manager for Morocco, Leila Farah Moukaddem, emphasized that “the credit line will foster an inclusive growth dynamic where the territories will increase their capacity even more to become real development hubs and industrial competitiveness.” She noted that the inclusive growth dynamic will benefit local people and industries. The funding is in line with the AfDB’s five strategic priorities called “High 5”.  It meets Morocco’s objectives in terms of supporting industrialization and improving the quality of life of its population. “With this operation, we are consolidating the resources available to local authorities. This means more investment opportunities and job creation at the local level, which is set to become a real platform for development, ” said Stefan Nalletamby, the AfDB’s director of the financial sector development department. AfDB provided funding for 35 projects in Morocco for a total investment of about $3 billion in 2019, making Morocco its top funding recipient, according to the latest synthetic review of the bank’s results, unveiled Thursday, September 26, in Rabat.  The funding covered the sectors of energy (31.5%), transportation (19.8%), water and sanitation (15.5%), and multi-sectoral and social development operations (12.7%).  AfDB’s funding also focused on the private sector (11.2) and agriculture (9.4%).

Rabat – Turkey and Morocco appear to have launched negotiations to maintain their in-question Free Trade Agreement with the aim of “rebalancing” trade terms and satisfying both parties. Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Morocco’s Minister of Industry, Trade, and New Technologies, met  with his Turkish counterpart, Minister of Trade Ruhsar Pekcan on November 28, to discuss the future of the Morocco-Turkey free trade deal. Meeting in Istanbul at the 34th session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation (COMCEC), the two officials seized the opportunity to address their countries’ fragile Free Trade Agreement. The two ministers suggested the creation of a joint Morocco-Turkey “technical commission” which will be charged with investigating “means of rebalancing the commercial relations between the two countries,” Moroccan outlet Medias 24 reported on November 28. According to the report, the two parties are keen to maintain their bilateral and commercial ties. In the meantime, however, Morocco is understood to have insisted that continuation of the bilateral agreement would require greater and more genuine involvement from Turkey. During the meeting, Elalamy, while reaffirming Morocco’s belief in open markets and its readiness to strengthen its commercial ties with all its partners, including Turkey, insisted that it is necessary that free trade agreements benefit Morocco’s economy. According to Medias 24, Elalamy was notably adamant that Rabat would not hesitate to walk out of its deal with Ankara if its Turkish partner does not, as has been mentioned in recent reports, hold its end of the bargain. A key reason behind Morocco’s recent threats to walk out of its agreement was the fact, according to reports, that Turkish products have massively entered into Moroccan markets while Ankara continues to submit Turkey-bound Moroccan products to rigid customs obstacles. Elalamy said last week that Morocco would walk out of all the “agreements that do not benefit our economy and our country.” That statement was later confirmed to have been especially aimed at the bilateral deal with Turkey. This brought to light old concerns over the profitability of the Turkey-Morocco deal for the Moroccan economy, suggesting that it was only a matter of time before Rabat ends its 2006 agreement with Ankara. At the end of their meeting in Istanbul, both ministers agreed that the soon-to-be-expected joint technical commission will work, among other things, on identifying investment and exports ventures in both countries. The goal is to equip Moroccan exporters with firsthand information on export products that may interest—and do well in—Turkish markets, while providing the same for Turkish investors interested in Morocco’s rising industrial sector.

Rabat – The Technical Committee of the Association of Citrus Producers (Regional ASPAM of Souss Massa) has said that Citrus fruit production has significantly declined, impacting negatively on the 2018-2019 citrus exports campaign.  ASPAM made the remarks at a meeting examining the situation of citrus fruits’ exports as of November 23, 2019.  The 2018-2019 season was characterized by a 50% drop in citrus production on average, and a drop of 75% in regions such as Souss Massa. Field professionals are estimating an export loss of MAD 2 billion.  Professionals explained that the decline is mainly due to high temperatures during the month of August. The ASPAM pointed out that the significant decline will also impact the export of small citrus fruits, as seen at the beginning of the season for different varieties of mandarins and clementines. In Souss Massa region, where 30% of the region is reserved for growing citrus fruits, professionals projected that the volume of exports of clementines will not exceed 42,000 tons compared to 187,000 tons in the 2017-2018 campaign. As of November 23, 2019, Morocco exported only 8000 tonnes out of the planned 42,000. The Russian market received 50% of the exports while the North American countries received 30% and only 12% went to the European Union markets. By type, the ASPAM Souss estimates that total exports of the Nour clementine will not exceed 10,000 tons in 2019 compared to 90,000 tons in 2018. Meanwhile, professionals are expecting a slight decline of the Nadorcott clementine exports, with a total of around 35,000 tonnes. To limit the damage, many producers have decided to give up  on exports during the 2018-2019 campaign and focus instead on the domestic market.  While Morocco’s main citrus-producing regions are experiencing a serious drop in production, the Berkane region remains less affected.  In addition to Souss Massa, Morocco’s main citrus growing regions include the Gharb regions where 19% of the total area is reserved for growing citrus fruits, the Oriental with 15%, and the Tadla and Haouz regions with 13% each.

Rabat – Moroccan rapper French Montana has left an intensive care unit or ICU after spending more than a week under medical care for increased heart rate. Last week, international reports said that police in Los Angeles made a medical call for the rapper, who had suffered stomach pain, exhaustion, and dehydration after his trips to four countries in six days. Karim Kharbouch, better known by his stage name French Montana, posted the first photo since his hospitalization yesterday, November 28, to thank his fans for their support. The photo shows French Montana at the hospital wearing heart rate monitors. “Thank you Everyone for all of the prayers, love and support. I’m finally out of ICU and am getting better one day at a time !!!,” wrote the rapper. French Montana emigrated to the US from Rabat at age 13.  He is among the biggest names in hip-hop. The rapper has always been vocal about his Moroccan roots and Muslim upbringing, making it a focal point of his public image.

Rabat – Khalid Ait Taleb, the newly appointed Moroccan Minister of Health, has “firmly instructed” hospitals around the country to change the way they treat patients in need of urgent medical care. In a “circular note” addressed to directors and presidents of regional and provincial hospitals and health centers across Morocco, Taleb urged Moroccan health practitioners to only charge patients in emergency situations after providing  medical treatment. In his note, the minister insisted on the “ethical necessity” for Moroccan hospitals to respect that fundamental medical rule of putting the patient’s life before any other considerations. While the minister’s “firm instructions” are set to be welcomed in some quarters as a breath of fresh air for Morocco’s roundly criticized medical sector, the point raised in the circular note is neither new nor radical, Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported on November 28. The minister’s note came with a reminder that Article 42 of the status of hospitals in Morocco, which has been around for decades, is all about putting patients first. The article speaks of doctors’ and hospitals’ ethical obligation to “receive any patient, injured or a pregnant woman in emergency situations.” The article adds, “[Patients] should be hospitalized when their cases so require, and even when there are not enough hospital beds. Payment can only be discussed following provision of the necessary medical care.” To avoid misunderstandings, however, the note emphasized that the insistence on only paying after all medical assistance has been provided does not “exonerate” patients from paying their medical bills. The news follows reports of the health ministry’s plans to address Morocco’s persisting public health issues. Earlier this month, Minister Taleb, while presenting his department’s budget and capacity building projects for next year, was clear that the resources available are not enough to tackle the country’s numerous and increasing public health issues. He however promised an “optimal use” of resources to reasonably address some of the priorities in the sector, including capacity building and renovation works, as well as updating emergency services in hospitals across the country.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has reiterated Morocco’s steadfast position in favor of Palestine and the legitimate rights of its people in a message addressed to celebrate the annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, November 29. The King addressed the message to the chairman of the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Cheikh Niang. The monarch opened his message by reaffirming Morocco’s unwavering position of solidarity with the Palestinian people and an independent Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. “I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate our solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and reaffirm the Kingdom of Morocco’s immutable position and unwavering support for the Palestinians.” He said that Palestine and its people should enjoy their legitimate rights and should have the right to establish their “independent state along the lines of 4 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital. These rights are in accordance with international legitimacy and the relevant UN resolutions.” The monarch also spoke about the effectiveness of the two-state solution, saying that without it there will be no end to one of the longest territorial disputes in the world. The King remarked that the two-state solution should end the conflict in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. He also acknowledged that the peace process has stalled. “Negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis have come to a standstill, and illegal, unilateral measures have been taken in the occupied Palestinian territories, we are entitled to wonder about the fate of the two-State solution,” the monarch said. The King warned that Israeli violations in the region will lead to greater tension, violence, and instability, “prompting forebodings of a future of religious conflict and hatred.” He emphasized that Morocco believes the two-state solution remains the only possible basis for ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and achieving a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The sovereign said that all efforts put in place will come to nothing unless moves are made to end the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territories. The King also reiterated that East Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state. “Therefore, this is one [of] the final status issues which must be resolved through negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides. It is also a critical part in the conflict in the entire Middle East and a core element of the political solution in any settlement between the parties,” he said. The King is among the world leaders who continue to condemn Israeli actions against the legitimate rights of Palestinians. It has been just four days since Morocco renewed its steadfast support for Palestine through its Moroccan ambassador to Cairo, Ahmed Tazi. On November 25, Tazi said in an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers that Morocco stands with “our Palestinian brothers in their distress and support all their rights, especially the right to establish an independent and viable state of Palestine.”  This month saw one of the most deadly escalations in the region in recent years, with hundreds of Palestinians sustaining injuries. The Palestinian death toll in Gaza rose to 32 on November 13  after Israeli forces targeted the “Islamic Jihad” armed group in the region. Israeli airstrikes killed men and women as well as a 7-year-old boy and two other minors.

Rabat – Morocco’s central bank, Bank al-Maghrib, has for the first time met the standard to earn ISO 37001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its Anti-Corruption Management System (SMAC) after an audit by EuroCompliance, Moroccan news outlet 2M reports. The bank received the certification on Thursday, November 28, at an award ceremony celebrating 60 years since Bank al-Maghrib’s foundation. Bank al-Maghrib began the process to earn the international standard certificate in May 2017, according to L’Economiste. But Morocco’s BMCE Bank obtained the certification first, becoming one of the first entities to earn the certification in Africa. Having the ISO 37001 certification gives a guarantee to customers, insurance companies, and rating agencies of the “maturity and rigours of the anti-corruption programme in place” at the bank, EuroCompliance explains. To receive certification, a certified auditing group checks to see that the bank or company has sufficient measures to combat corruption. At the Bank al-Maghrib ceremony, the bank’s governor, Abdellatif Jouahri, spoke of the institution’s strong commitment against corruption. He said that the bank has “an anti-corruption policy advocating zero tolerance for all forms of corruption.” Minister of Labor Mohamed Amkraz noted Morocco’s efforts against corruption, especially in establishing the National Anti-Corruption Commission and the opening of a hotline (08 00 00 47 47) to call out corruption. The ISO 37001 is a single international standard to “normalize the wide variety of competing and overlapping guidance from international regulators and agencies.” Entities receive a new audit every three years to update their certification. In 2016, representatives from Morocco helped craft the current ISO 37001 standard along with participants from other countries. Experts and businesspeople’s perceptions of public sector corruption in Morocco improved by three points out of 100 in the latest Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International. Morocco’s 2018 score of 43 corresponds exactly with the global average, and Morocco ranked as the 73rd least perceptibly corrupt country out of 180 countries.

Rabat – UK-based digital bank Starling has released a study listing the city of Marrakech, Morocco among the world’s cheapest cities. The study ranked the red-washed city seventh on the list of 35 countries, placing it among the top ten cheapest cities in the world.  The study finds that an average day can in Marrakech cost tourists as little as £43.96 or MAD 546.52. The city of Marrakech is known as the ochre of the red city for its red washed buildings. The city continues to attract millions of tourists each year, with travellers seeking to explore the wonders and cultural experiences of the city and the country in general. New Delhi, India tops Starling’s list with an average cost of £28.22 per day, followed by Egypt’s Cairo £29.22, and Istanbul £35.51. Los Angeles and New York are at the bottom of the list with an average cost of £168.95 and £179.15, respectively. The digital bank made its study, relying on several criteria. The bank combined the total cost of meals, a night stay in a hotel, public transport, and an average attraction ticket. Several magazines and reports have listed Marrakech among its top cities, including Forbes.  In October, the US-based Magazine tasked Ovation Travel Group’s team to prepare an exclusive list of top 2020 destinations. The list featured Morocco’s Marrakech. For the Ovation Travel Group, the city offers “one-of-a-kind experiences such as a candlelit dinner in the middle of the desert replete with camel rides, belly dancers and fire eaters.” In September, Morocco’s Tourism Observatory said in September that 7.544 million tourists visited Morocco by the end of July 2019. The statistics show that the “two tourist destinations of Marrakech and Agadir generated 57% of hotel nights in the first seven months of 2019.” In addition to Forbes, Flight Network also named Marrakech as one of the top 50 most beautiful cities in the world. “You’ll feel like you’ve been transported into a movie while you walk through the Old City, and then feel transported back to today when stepping into the New City,” Flight Network states.

Rabat – Amsterdam’s Blue Mosque recited the call to prayer over loudspeakers on Friday, November 15, for the first time in the Dutch city’s history.  Nourdeen Wildeman, a spokesperson for the Blue Mosque, told Dutch news outlet Anadolu Agency that they were happy and honored to finally hear the Adhaan (call to prayer) after a failed attempt the week before. The Blue Mosque planned to recite the call to prayer on Friday, November 8, but a sabotage operation left one of the audio system’s cables mysteriously cut.  While 7% of mosques in the Netherlands have been projecting the call to prayer on loudspeakers for several years, the Blue Mosque produced the first public call to prayer in the capital city of Amsterdam.  Wildeman noted that some locals have been unhappy about hearing the Adhaan but the reaction has generally been positive.  The Blue Mosque will now recite the call to prayer every Friday. The decision comes after careful deliberation with the surrounding neighborhood’s residents as well as city officials.

Rabat – Spain has warned Spanish citizens active in the Polisario-run Tindouf camps in Algeria of the high risks of terrorist attacks. In a radio interview earlier today, Margarita Robles, the Spanish Interior Minister, urged Spanish citizens already in the camps to be vigilant, saying that the region is the target of “serious” terrorist threats. “This is about a real threat, confirmed by foreign secret services working in the region,” the Spanish minister said in the interview with Cadena Ser, a private radio channel in Spain. “The risk of terror strikers is imminent in these camps and we are very preoccupied by this alarming situation.” The statements are a follow-up to an earlier message from the Spanish foreign affairs ministry. That message, issued on a day before Robles’ interview, on November 27, called on Spanish citizens to refrain from travelling to the camps “because of heightened instability in Northern Mali and an increase in terrorist activities in the region.” Rising levels of insurgencies and combat in the Sahel region, added the statement from the Spanish foreign ministry, have resulted in extremely “high risks of kidnappings and terrorist strikes in the region.” These alarm ringing statements come as terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS promise to use Africa—especially the extremely fragile Sahel region— as a rear base to rise from the crushing territorial and personnel losses they have recently sustained in the Middle East, where the most recent blow for international jihadism was the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a raid by US forces. “Experts feel that Spanish citizens are a preferred target for jihadists, who consider Spain one of their biggest enemies after France and the United States.,” Spanish outlet El Pais reported earlier today. But the security warnings also come as suspicions mount about the probable links between the Polisario leadership international terrorist groups with aims of wreaking havoc in North Africa. Last month, international security experts and governments representatives, speaking at the UN 4th Committee, raised concerns about Polisario’s links to various terrorist groups, most notably ISIS, Hezbollah, and Al Qaeda. “In December 2018, I interviewed several former Polisario prisoners and relatives of former inmates based in Dakhla. Through their accounts, I learned not only about the extreme abuses they had endured during their imprisonment, notably brutal torture, but also about the security problems associated with collusion between the Polisario and the main international terrorist organizations,,” one expert said. Meanwhile, Polisario has been quick to respond to Spain. Polisario “regretted” Spain’s move, dismissing its warnings as politically motivated and done in collusion with Morocco to tarnish the breakaway movement’s reputation.  “The Government of the Sahrawi Republic and the Frente POLISARIO express their deep regret and astonishment at this suspicious statement because warning against visiting the Sahrawi refugee camps is not justified, and considers the move to be motivated by political motives emanating from the blatant complicity that seeks to harm not only the refugees themselves but also the host country,” read the Polisario statement.

Algeria (35th globally) is fourth on the list, followed by Morocco.   At the confederation level, FIFA listed the Belgian national team first, followed by France, Brazil, and the UK. Morocco’s lower position on th ranking comes after weak performances in their recent friendlies and qualifier matches for the African Cup of Nations (CAN).  Morocco finished its qualifier match against Mauritania on November 15 with a 0-0 result. The Atlas Lions, however, won their second qualifier match against Burundi with a scoreline of 3-0.

Rabat – The spiritual heart of Morocco, Fez, is inviting locals and tourists to attend the first annual National Festival of Heritage and Aissaoui Art from December 5 to 7. The festival seeks to take attendees of all nationalities and religions on a mystical journey into the world and rhythms of Aissawa, a type of Moroccan spiritual music. The art, commonly rooted in the ancient cities of Morocco, especially in Fez, Meknes, and Sale, is known as Aissaoua, Issawa, or Aissawa. The upcoming festival is set to feature a lineup of Aissawa bands from across Morocco, including the Fassi (meaning from Fez) Issaoui Community. The grand complex of the Fez Commune in the Ville Nouvelle will serve as a stage for the event. The festival will take place in collaboration with several passionate associations involved in the art of Aissawa, including Fez Association of Issawa, Isawi Association of Folklore, and the Association of Authentic Art of Issawa. Imad Oudghiri, the leader of the Fassi Issaoui Community, told Morocco World News that with the festival, the three associations seek to revive the pure “Aissawa art, without adding any grainy” material. He said that there are several other festivals that feature the art in Casablanca, Rabat, and Meknes, but they have not succeeded in preserving the authentic Aissawa style. Oudghirir also emphasized the importance of “the participation of the former well-known ‘mqadmins’ [leaders of Aissawi bands] to pay tribute and homage” to the people who contribute to keeping that kind of art alive,” he told MWN. Oudghiri added that if this year’s event goes well, the city of Fez will host a second festival a year later. Whatever the level of your dancing skills, Aissawa’s rhythms stir you into movement and can even make the most reluctant dancer bust a move. Aissawa is one of the most eminent Sufi brotherhoods in the North African country. The mystical art emerged during the 16th century with the prominent Sufi master Mohamed El Hadi Ben Aissa, otherwise known as Sheikh al-Kamel, in Meknes. The music relies on spiritual lyrics to glorify God and the perfection of the prophet of Islam, Muhammad. A lack of primary sources makes it difficult to learn more about al-Kamel’s “tariqa,” or the Issawi approach to Islam. However, international media interested in Morocco’s heritage represent al-Kamel as a Sufi master and a “great and wise scholar who influenced entire generations.” Born in 1467, the scholar’s influence travelled beyond Morocco’s border to reach other countries in the Maghreb, as well as Egypt. The scholar reportedly studied at Morocco’s renowned university of Al Qaraouiyine in Fez. In addition to the music and the spiritual atmosphere Issawa creates, the rhythms would be incomplete without the traditional appearances that perfect the experience. Traditionally, members of an Issawi band wear white jellabas, representing purity and spirituality. Some of them, however, wear colorful jellabas with red and white stripes. Instruments are also important to complete the rhythms. Drums and horns are some of the most important instruments used during the religious chants.  While Aissawa are common in festivals and ceremonies, many families host an evening or “lila” of Aissawa without a particular event in mind. The host of the event usually makes it public, with neighbors and even strangers invited to take part in the religious feast. The host family traditionally serves mint tea and Moroccan cookies to welcome guests.

Rabat – Morocco’s phosphates and fertilizer company OCP has signed an agreement with Spanish company Fertinagro Biotech, part of the Térvalis Group, and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. The agreement aims to endow the university to fund professors who will train researchers. The goal is that the graduates will subsequently enter the agricultural research field. Fertinagro Biotech has already provided for professorships at two Spanish universities and hopes to grow the project with academic support of the Mohammed VI Polytechnic and opportunities for field work and practical testing with OCP. Through the training provision, the deal seeks to develop sustainable research and development (R&amp;D) solutions for the  agricultural sector through the training of researchers “from companies that stand out for developing sustainable solutions for Africa, Europe and for the world.”  Under the agreement, the parties aim to train researchers in order to develop sustainable solutions to “promote the development of African and world agriculture and livestock,” a joint statement said. Among the aims of the training is for the researchers to develop innovative projects“based on actions that promote the [reusable and recycling] economy,” the statement added. The agreement also seeks to “to promote knowledge without barriers for agriculture.”  OCP support the agreement with a commitment to provide “the expertise and technicity (sic) of its teams in order to conduct practical tests on the field and measure their concrete implications on the ground.” The collaboration between these institutions will also include connections with Spain’s leading universities in the fields of agriculture, recycling economy and agro-biosciences. Under the agreement, OCP will support the project by providing opportunities for practical experience and on the ground testing. The training will include Agro-biosciences, “proving access and transfer of solutions for farmers and ranchers, educational exchanges between Spain and Morocco and research and development programs in fields.” Director of strategic development of the Térvalis Group Sergio Atares expressed satisfaction with the agreement. “In Spain and in Morocco there is very good research, they are characterized by developing projects based on a guarantee of the excellence of a whole team of professionals who seek solutions to the current problems of society, promoting the development of our countries, and allowing better quality of life for everyone,” said the director. UM6P secretary-general Hicham El Habti explained that university’s pioneering role among world-renowned universities in the field. “Our objective is to consolidate Morocco’s frontline position in R&amp;D, in a unique partnership-based approach and boosting skills training, relevant for the future of Africa,”he said.

Rabat – Morocco’s central bank, Bank al-Maghrib, hosted a workshop with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to discuss making the dirham exchange rate more flexible. Morocco may take the next step in its gradual liberalization of the dirham in January 2020, reported Info Mediaire. Bank officials met to discuss the move at a workshop in Rabat on Wednesday, November 27. The reform would be “an important step towards enhancing transparency,” said Abderrahim Bouazza, CEO of Bank al-Maghrib. EBRD Vice President Alain Pilloux also viewed it positively, saying that he was “delighted to welcome Morocco to this small club of countries that have already developed risk-free, robust and transparent [exchange] rate benchmarks. This is an important step towards the development of an exchange rate market in Morocco.” The Moroccan dirham is pegged to a “currency basket” of the euro and US dollar, weighted 60% to the euro and 40% to the US dollar.  Some of the world’s strongest currencies, such as the US dollar and euro, are traded openly in the market: If a buyer and seller agree on the exchange rate, they are free to exchange money at whatever rate they choose.  Other currencies, such as the Emirati dirham, have a “fixed exchange rate,” meaning that it is illegal to trade them for another currency unless using the established rate. Sometimes fixed rates lead to a vastly different black market rate when the central bank declares the currency’s worth to be different than sellers or buyers consider it. Since 2018, Morocco has taken a middle of the road approach, allowing the dirham to be traded for international currencies within a certain range of exchange rates. On January 15, 2018, the central bank began a process of liberalizing the Moroccan exchange rate so that it could be more flexible in the face of external market shocks, such as the 2008 global recession. Before the process began, the dirham could only be traded within a range of 0.03% above and below the established exchange rate. In 2018, Morocco widened the range of the flexible exchange rate to 2.5% above and below the set rate. The workshop’s purpose was to discuss the possible effects of further reform in the dirham’s monetary index, according to statements from EBRD and the Moroccan central bank, as quoted by Info Mediaire. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) worked with Morocco to gradually introduce a more flexible exchange rate. In July 2019, the IMF again encouraged Morocco to “use the current window of opportunity” to expand its exchange rate flexibility. Last month, the governor of Bank al-Maghrib, Abdellatif Jouahri, announced that Morocco would soon take the next step in currency liberalization. “For us, the reform aims to absorb external shocks and boost Morocco’s competitiveness,” Jouahri said in a statement.

Rabat – On the condition of anonymity, a senior US official has reiterated the US’ support for Morocco’s position on the Western Sahara conflict, supporting the kingdom’s Autonomy Plan initiative submitted to the UN in 2007 as a political solution to end the conflict in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions. Moroccan state media Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) quoted the senior official from the US State Department on November 27 who outlined the US position on the conflict. The source emphasized that the issue of Western Sahara is a “priority for Moroccans and we are engaged with the United Nations in order to advance a political solution.” Washington’s policy, according to the official, “remains the same.” “Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is serious, realistic, and credible,” the US official explained. The US official also commented on the recent extension of the MINURSO mandate in October, saying that the US supports the MINURSO mandate as “recently renewed by the Security Council for a period of 12 months.” The statement comes just one day after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced his decision to visit Morocco in early December, describing the north African country as “one of the strongest partners” for the US. The visit comes after  regular exchanges of visits from officials of both countries in order to strengthen diplomatic relations and collaboration in different fields, including trade and security. The statement reiterating the US’ support for Morocco’s position followed a report by the Wall Street Journal. The report stipulated that Washington’s position on the Western Sahara conflict is clear. In the report, the WSJ said that the US is firm that independence for the region will never work as a solution to end the dispute. The WSJ also quoted officials who emphasized that the US opposes the creation of “an independent state in Western Sahara.” “Officials involved in the talks said the U.S. have made it clear that Washington won’t support a plan that leads to a new African nation,” the WSJ said. Breakaway group the Polisario Front were not happy with the WSJ report.

Rabat  – US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to post a photoshopped image showing his head on the fit and muscular body of the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa. Trump posted the edited image at 10:54 a.m. on November 27 with no caption to explain the post. The photo has stirred mockery on social media, especially on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/11nzKwOCtU — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 27 novembre 2019  The photo garnered hundreds of thousands of likes, shares, and comments from his 67 million followers. Jamelle Bouie, a columnist at the New York Times suggested that whoever “created this meme image of Trump as Rocky just wanted to show him as a powerful man.” He added that Trump wanted to “present himself as such. But when you consider the racial politics of the film itself, it’s hard to imagine a more appropriate piece of political symbolism.” Adam writes that “The Rocky films are a product of a sense of white pride and humiliation, and the desire to overcome it by restoring the proper order of things.” You can say exactly the same for Trump himself. (end thread) — b-boy bouiebaisse (@jbouie) 27 novembre 2019  In  another tweet Bouie said, “Adam writes that ‘The Rocky films are a product of a sense of white pride and humiliation, and the desire to overcome it by restoring the proper order of things.’ You can say exactly the same for Trump himself.” There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s favorite social network is Twitter with the US president posting numerous tweets per day.

Rabat – Moroccan police arrested a 27-year old man in possession of 50,013 tablets of psychotropic pills on November 26. The judicial police arrested the suspect in collaboration with the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). Security services arrested the suspect when he was driving a car in Tafrisst, a rural area in Driouch province, 70 kilometers from Al Hoceima. The psychotropic tablets included ecstasy pills, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has reported. The police found the psychotropic tablets carefully wrapped and concealed inside the suspect’s car. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to combat drug smuggling across the country. Police have carried out several anti-drug operations in recent months, leading to the seizure of thousands of psychotropic pills. One of the recent operations took place on November 27 at the Tangier-Med Port.  Police seized 85,650  pills on board a Spain-registered car. The police stopped the car as it was about to enter Morocco through the northern port. Police arrested two women aged 25 and 38 involved in the case. Investigations are ongoing to determine the ramifications and circumstances of the case. On November 25, police also seized  2,980 ecstasy tablets in Fez. The recent seizures add up to the huge number of psychotropic pills police seized in the first nine months of this year. According to the DGSN, security services  seized 1,161,000 psychotropic from January to September. Police arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking during the same period.

Rabat – Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale has extended a Moroccan welcome to asylum seekers and “foreigners wishing to find refuge.” Hilale spoke on Wednesday, November 27, at a conference in Rabat on the “Challenges to Humanitarian Law” in honor of the 70th anniversary of the ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Hilale reminded attendees of Moroccan hospitality to refugees in the past, reported Maghreb Arab Press, highlighting the time when Morocco welcomed the hundreds of thousands of Jews and Muslims whom Spain had expelled in the 15th and 16th centuries. Today, the ambassador noted, Morocco welcomes its “African brothers” who are “in search of a better life in Europe.” For centuries the kingdom has cultivated its culture of humanism and hospitality, Hilale said. The UN assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Ursula Mueller, came to Rabat to deliver the keynote speech at the conference. In a tweet, she said she was “honored to participate” in the event, but she deplored the continued “unacceptable targeting of civilians, schools &amp; hospitals” in global conflicts. Both the national army and rebels have targeted hospitals in the conflict in Syria, and medical centers have been bombed in Yemen. At the opening of the Rabat conference, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani remarked that Morocco is making efforts to “harmonize” national law with its international obligations by revising the penal code. El Othmani also highlighted Morocco’s national commission for international humanitarian law, established in 2008 as one of the first of its kind in the world. The Moroccan government and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) jointly hosted the conference. The ICRC has been active in Morocco since World War I, attending to German prisoners of war. The ICRC works with the Moroccan Red Crescent today with migrants, connecting Moroccans detained abroad with their families at home, and providing training on forensic medicine to Moroccan personnel. Morocco ratified the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of wounded soldiers, prisoners of war, and civilians in armed conflict and the 1951 convention on the status of refugees shortly after its independence in 1956.

Rabat – Moroccan director Meryem Benm’barek won the best narrative film prize for her feature film “Sofia” at the 41st International Women’s Film Festival in Florence, Italy. The event took place from November 20 to 24 under the theme “Mother’s Stories.”  “Sofia” follows a 20-year-old woman who has a baby out of wedlock, something that is highly frowned upon in Moroccan society and in violation of the Moroccan criminal code due to the illegality of sex outside of marriage. Sofia finds support from her cousin Lena. After Sofia gives birth, the two women have 24 hours to find the father of Sofia’s child before the hospital alerts the authorities.  The film stars Maha Alemi, known for her role in Nabil Ayouch’s “Much Loved,” and Sara Perles of Nour-Eddine Lakhmari’s “Burnout.” According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the film festival’s director Paola Paoli praised Benm’barek’s courageous and intelligent approach to the subject matter.  Paoli added that the film offers a critical look at the situation of women’s rights in Morocco and presents a commentary on the dynamics of women’s issues in Moroccan cinema. She also noted the film’s superior technical quality. “Sofia” also received the screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018 in addition to awards at various other international festivals.

Rabat – Thanks to the global success of “Straight Outta Compton,” “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and “Rocketman,” the music biopic trend is stronger than ever, and Michael Jackson is next in line.  According to Deadline, the family of the late king of pop has permitted Oscar-winning American producer Graham King to take charge of the biographical film about Michael Jackson. King, who will have access to Jackson’s entire musical catalog for the film, is no stranger to biopics. He produced “Bohemian Rhapsody” in 2018, a biographical drama film about the late Freddie Mercury, the frontman of the British rock band Queen.  King will reportedly work alongside three-time Academy Award nominee John Logan of “The Aviator” fame.  No other details of the production have been announced, but the complexity of Jackson’s life will not be ignored, Deadline reports. Despite the controversy that erupted after the release of “Leaving Neverland,” an Emmy-winning HBO documentary, the public still shows interest in MJ’s story and music. A Broadway musical is currently in the works, the source added.    In 2017, Dianne Houston directed a made-for-tv movie about Jackson for the American television network Lifetime. Navi, a well-known MJ impersonator who served as the star’s body double for 17 years, took the leading role in the film. Although considered a biopic, “Searching for Neverland” never appeared on the big screen.

Rabat – The global migration crisis claimed at least four more lives today, November 27 after a rubber patera, or dingy, capsized 50 kilometers north of Moroccan shores in the westernmost portion of the Mediterranean Sea.  The Spanish coast guard rescued several dozen people, including three children, after receiving an alert from an NGO.  The boat left the Moroccan beach of Charrana and was on its way to Spain when the tragedy occurred.  The Spanish coast guard brought the surviving passengers to Melilla, a Spanish enclave in Morocco, along with the bodies of three people who died during the journey. A fourth person died shortly after arriving at the port.  16 passengers from the 78-person vessel are still missing, the Spanish coast guard reported. A boat and two planes are currently conducting a search for the missing migrants.  Nearly 80,000 migrants reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2019, with more than 27,000 arriving in Spain. Well over a thousand people have died during migration attempts from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe this year.

Rabat – The assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs at the UN, Ursula Mueller, shared her pleasure in discussing “global humanitarian challenges” with Moroccan Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani in a tweet on Wednesday, November 27. Mueller tweeted an image of herself meeting El Othmani and Omar Hilale, Morocco’s permanent representative at the UN, in Rabat. Mueller said she discussed Morocco’s “important role” in responding to global challenges with El Othmani. Also present at the meeting were the Moroccan President of the National Commission on International Law, Farida Khamlichi, and the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation in Morocco, Rania Machlab, according to Maghreb Arab Press. The under-secretary is in Morocco to give a speech at a conference commemorating the 1949 Geneva Conventions today. Mueller is set to be the keynote speaker at the “Challenges to Humanitarian Law” conference in Rabat. The Moroccan government and the ICRC are jointly hosting the conference in honor of the 70 years since more than 50 countries adopted four Geneva Conventions. At the opening of the conference, El Othmani noted the importance of international humanitarian law. He remarked that Morocco is making efforts to “harmonize” national law with its international obligations by revising the penal code. El Othmani also highlighted Morocco’s national commission for international humanitarian law, established in 2008 as one of the first of its kind in the world. The four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949 apply to the humane treatment of wounded soldiers, prisoners of war, and civilians. Morocco ratified the conventions at the time of its independence in 1956.  In 2011, Morocco signed on to two 1977 protocols attached to the conventions that covered additional protections for victims of international conflict and non-international armed conflict. In 2005, a third protocol was added to the Conventions, recognizing the “red crystal” as a third protected emblem, after the red cross and red crescent, but Morocco has not signed on to it. Mueller began her three-day visit to Morocco on Tuesday, November 26.

Rabat – Hussein Bashir Brahim, a pro-Polisario activist, received a 12 year prison sentence for murder at the Court of Appeal in Marrakech on Tuesday, November 26, Spanish news outlet El Espanol reported. The court charged the defendant for his involvement in the murder of Amazigh (Berber) student Omar Khaleq in 2016 in Marrakech. Around 16 Sahrawis received sentences ranging from 3 to 10 years in prison in 2017 for their involvement in the killing of Omar “Izem” Khaleq during clashes between Sahrawi and Amazigh students at the Faculty of Literature and Human Sciences in Marrakech on January 23, 2016.  Bachir denied his involvement in the killing of the Moroccan student. As well as Khaleq’s death, the clashes resulted in five injuries. In January, having reached the Canary Islands in a “patera,” a small boat, the student applied for asylum. Within a week, Spain rejected his asylum request and deported him to Rabat on January 27. Morocco had also issued an arrest warrant for Brahim for his alleged involvement in the killing of Khaleq. Spain is among the countries that deny asylum for Moroccan citizens because it classes the North African country as stable and safe for returning asylum seekers. The European country has an agreement with Morocco to repatriate unsuccessful asylum seekers and undocumented migrants.

Rabat – A new report by Morocco’s health ministry has unveiled the dire prospects of the country’s health sector, with projections from the ministry vastly inferior to what the sector actually needs to effectively operate. In a holistic appraisal of Morocco’s persisting public health issues, presented earlier this month as part of his department’s plans for the 2020 fiscal year, the new Minister for Health, Khalid Ait Taleb, painted a rather grim picture of the sector. Among the many concerns stressed in the report is the marked lack of hospital personnel and equipment. The figures Taleb presented spoke of a worrying deficit in medical personnel, with Morocco’s deficit in personnel said to be standing at 97,161 (32,387 medical doctors and 64,774 nurses and other medical practitioners). To solve this “concerning” deficit, a reasonable policy would be to recruit 62,000 new employees (12,000 doctors and 50,000 nurses and medical technicians), the report found. However, because of budgetary constraints, the ministry’s total budget for the 2020 fiscal year being MAD 18.68 billion, the ministry plans to recruit only 4,000 new employees. While Taleb acknowledged that that number is not even close to the efforts needed to tackle his sector’s persisting issues, he suggested that additional steps will be taken to incrementally address the country’s public health concerns. The goal in the short and medium terms, he argued, is to find ways of “attenuating”—rather than definitely eliminating—the personnel and equipment deficits ailing Morocco’s health sector. As part of its efforts to improve the sector, the ministry seeks to “optimally” use its limited budget. On the equipment front, next year will see the start of construction projects for 28 new hospitals across the kingdom, especially in regions—mostly rural, remote areas—where the medical shortage has been more acutely felt. Also on the agenda are investments in maintenance, extension and renovation works in places—like Rabat and Oujda—where the existing equipment (mostly including hospital beds) do not even come close to meeting the minimum requirements for the number of patients in these regions. Another important project in the ministry’s projections is the upgrading or modernization of emergency services at hospitals across the kingdom. This will include, among other projects, the extension of parking areas at hospitals, the rehabilitation of emergency medical services in the Souss-Massa and Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra regions. While the ministry’s budget for next year is set to increase by 14.5%, compared to its budget this year, the department’s numerous challenges suggest the budget can only solve about a quarter of the concerns. In addition, employee’s wages and maintenance constraints mean that only a very limited portion of the ministry’s already insufficient budget can be allocated to investments in capacity building, renovation, or construction. Namely, the ministry estimates that only MAD 3.35 billion of its more than MAD 18 billion budget will go into investments. The bulk—all the remaining 15.33 billion will be used as working or operational budget, including more 10.9 billion for wages. In terms of human resources, the ministry plans on a bit of an outside-the-box thinking to meet Moroccan citizens’ demands in medical personnel. As its own projected personnel increase will still not be enough to considerably address the country’s medical personnel and equipment shortages, the ministry suggested it is ready to enter into “contractual relations” with doctors from the private sector and “external expertise” or foreign investors, who will be “encouraged” to invest and work in Morocco’s health sector.

Rabat – Moroccan inventor Majid El Bouazzaoui shone again at a global inventions competition. El Bouazzaoui won a gold medal at the 16th International Exhibition of Inventions (INFOINVENT-2019).  The competition took place from November 20-23 in Moldova. “Very proud to grab #Gold for #Morocco in #Moldova #Infoinvent 2019,” Moroccan Association OFEED said in a post on Facebook. El Bouazzaoui chairs the association. El Bouazzaoui’s award-winning invention is an “analog to digital converter.” It changes the sights and sounds in the real world that are captured in videos, pictures, audio, etc. into digital information. The invention helps telecom networks use 5G and other technologies more effectively. The invention removes a bottleneck for consumers using 5G, when their devices are digitizing data to send to other devices. For example, the invention would speed up the video in a streaming video call. “The process is the first step in the telecommunication process between two users,” a statement from Moroccan association OFEED quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has said. OFEED said that until the data is digitized, no information is “available in digital format in the real environment,” for consumers to be able to see and hear voice messages, images, and videos. Explaining why invention is useful, the association added that the scanning step “has a direct impact on the transmission speed, whatever the technology used on the telecommunication network.” The speed of the 5G telecom network is “of no interest if the data to be transmitted is not available at the same pace,” OFEED explained. Current analog to digital converters are “no longer [fast] enough to reach the required speed level with 5G,” the statement added. The Moroccan invention, therefore, can “digitize information to be transmitted much faster by reducing the number of transistors used.” The invention has already swiped other gold medals at the International Competition of Invention iCan-2019 in Canada and the International Fair of Inventions in Istanbul (ISIF-2019). El Bouazzaoui also won a gold medal for Morocco at IIIC in November 2018. OFEED, under El Bouazzaoui’s leadership, received four separate awards at four international innovation fairs for the “automatic orientation system of photovoltaic panels” invention for solar power last year. El Bouazzaoui is among the inventors who received the Wissam Al Istihkak Al Watani (medal of national merit) of 2nd Rank on Throne Day in 2016. King Mohammed VI awarded the medal to the inventor.

Rabat – A second shocking crime has stirred nationwide uproar this week in Morocco when a 33-year old man slaughtered a five-year old boy in Sale, Rabat’s twin city, on Tuesday, November 26. The man, in an “abnormal” mental state, killed the boy on Tuesday night. Witnesses said that the child was playing next to his house in El Baraka district in Sale’s Kariat Ouled Moussa neighborhood. When the attacker, carrying a large knife, attempted to run away, citizens managed to stop him. Police then arrested him The victim’s father told the press that, despite the man’s unstable mental state, he “will never forgive him” for murdering his son. “He should be punished. He should receive death penalty. Please nobody ask me to forgive him because I will not,” he added. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the suspect is a 33-year old. He used a retractable knife to commit the murder. The DGSN said that the murder is “linked to illogical reasons that the investigation is trying to clarify.” Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation to shed more light on the incident. The crime is the second shocking incident to cause nationwide uproar in recent weeks. The first happened three days ago when a stepmother murdered  her husband’s seven year old child. The biological mother of the child was searching for her son after he vanished. She said that she has been looking for her son for three days. “I met with his stepmother and said that she had not seen him,”  the mother said.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Office of Railways (ONCF) is adopting the American sales technique of offering special deals for “Black Friday.” ONCF is offering deals on its monthly subscription pass and three-month subscription pass. If customers buy a new monthly subscription on Friday, November 29, they will only have to pay half price. The deal is only for passengers who have never bought a monthly pass before. The rail company will also give a free month of passes for anyone who buys a three-month subscription during the week of November 22 to 29.  The cost of the monthly pass will be reduced from MAD 1,200 ($125) to MAD 600 ($62) for the Casablanca to Rabat pass. The cost for the monthly pass from Tangier to Rabat will sell for MAD 2,290 ($238) instead of MAD 4,580 ($476). The deals target daily commuters who use the train to get to work. Black Friday is an American phenomenon that is increasingly making a presence in Morocco, as the ONCF deal shows. Stores in major Moroccan cities often advertise their Black Friday sales in the days and weeks leading up to it. Black Friday comes one day after the American Thanksgiving holiday and traditionally kicks off the Christmas shopping season in the US. Stores hope to make enough sales on this day to get out of the “red” and into the “black,” meaning to have a net positive revenue for the year.

Rabat – The Moroccan-Spanish football player Achraf Hakimi has spoken to Spanish news outlet El Pais in an interview about racism in football, his transition to playing in the German Bundesliga, and his childhood. The 21-year-old said he has not experienced racist insults himself, but he spoke up for those who have. Just last month, in a Bulgaria-England match, Bulgarian fans disrupted play with racist taunts and Nazi salutes, earning sanctions and fines for Bulgarian football.  “It is not pleasant,” Hakimi said of racism on the pitch. “Hopefully it’s over now.” The defender also told El Pais about his transition into playing for Borussia Dortmund in Germany’s Bundesliga. Hakimi joined the team on a two-year loan from Real Madrid in 2018. “I think it has helped me to mature and grow.” He explained that he was intrigued to learn about a new culture as it was the first time he left home. “I didn’t know what I was going to find.” While Hakimi suggested he would be interested in coming back to Madrid, he had subtle criticism for Spanish football. Spanish teams, he said, played with a “leisurely” style and focused on possession. But “soccer is based on scoring goals, not possession,” Hakimi said. However, when the Atlas Lion struggled at his new club, he looked to Spanish football players Borja Mayoral and Dani Carvajal for inspiration. Ultimately, the young football player “wanted to feel important.” Now, Achraf Hakimi said in the interview, he has gained that sense of being valuable to his team, and, even though he plays defense, he has been able to come through at decisive moments to change the game. In his 12 games in the Bundesliga in the 2019-2020 football year, Hakimi has scored two goals, played for 83% of the minutes on average in a game, and been selected for the starting 11 three out of four times.  Growing up south of Madrid, Hakimi narrated how he spent all day playing “behind the ball” with his friends, painting goals onto houses. Born to Moroccan parents in Spain, Hakimi chose to represent Morocco instead of Spain in international football.

Rabat – Citic Dicastal, a global company specializing in manufacturing aluminum alloy parts for wheels inaugurated its second plant in Kenitra, north of Rabat, on Monday, November 25. The group invested €350 million to complete the 30,000-square-meter project. The project seeks to create over 1,200 job opportunities. The new plant will feature “advanced technology,” enabling it to produce “premium products, as well as a range of larger rims,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Having attended the inauguration ceremony, Morocco’s Minister of Trade and Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy said that the plant positions Morocco in a “high-tech industry.” Citic Dicastal’s new plant is the second of its kind after it inaugurated one in June in Kenitra. The second plant, for Elalamy, “is an example of the successful Moroccan-Chinese cooperation in the industrial field and is part of the implementation of the Chinese government’s initiative called ‘One Road, One Belt.’” The plant is also part of Morocco’s industrial acceleration plan to promote its domestic industry. Commenting on the investment, the Moroccan official emphasized that the Chinese company is one of the “largest state-owned industrial groups in China.” He remarked that the first plant of the company is operational and serving customers in Morocco, the US, and Europe. The ambassador of China to Morocco, Li Li, said that Citic’s project in the North African country is one of the largest investments of Sino-Moroccan cooperation. Dicastal Morocco Africa General Manager Badr Lahmoudi also commented on the inauguration of the new plant, stating that the group “aims to consolidate its achievements and implement a human development strategy, in close collaboration with teams in China, to support Moroccan talents and skills.” He said that the company will launch the recruitment phase “as soon as possible.” The company has several key customers, including Volkswagen, BMW, Renault-Nissan, Chrysler Automotive, Peugeot, and Toyota. It has 30 production units in Europe, North America, and China, with an annual production capacity of 60 million wheels and 110,000 tons of engine and chassis components.

Rabat – A Moroccan MP believes that Morocco has made noticeable advances on gender issues, especially gender equality, in recent years. The MP cited the number of political reforms initiated since the change of constitution in 2011, saying that while there is still much to improve, what has been achieved is “commendable.” Allal Amraoui, an MP from the Istiqlal (Independence) Party, made his remarks at a recent conference in Lisbon, Portugal. Amraoui, who sits on the Moroccan House of Representatives’ foreign affairs and national defense committee, led the Moroccan delegation at the Lisbon conference, where he put forth the well-established idea that Morocco is a regional exception or trendsetter on multiple fronts. Discussing gender relations in “contemporary Morocco,” the Istiqlal MP seemed to take pride in the “notable advances” that have been made in relation with the King’s insistence on inclusiveness and equality as pillars of the much-reported new development model. Amraoui illustrated his central thesis—that Moroccan women have made notable gains in recent years—by providing examples of legislative amendments and political reforms witnessed in the past eight years. He said that legislative texts such as the family code, the penal code, labor law, regulations on nationality and naturalization, as well as the electoral code have all gone through some modifications to make them more reflective of, or compatible with, emerging social trends and political realities in “today’s Morocco.” Amraoui’s main points underline the broad agreement surrounding Mohammed VI’s Morocco. In recent years and months, both Moroccan and international observers have made the case that Morocco has vastly changed under the current King. Writing in late July on the occasion of the two-decade anniversary of King Mohammed VI’s ascension to the throne, one Moroccan columnist argued that political reforms and development projects—mainly state-of-the-art infrastructure, advances on human rights and gender equality, investing in reducing social inequalities and socio-economic disparities—have become the distinguishing marks of Mohammed VI’s Morocco. “As it would not be possible to make an exhaustive assessment, let’s simply say that Morocco in 2019 has absolutely nothing in common with the Morocco of 1999,” the columnist said. This, he went on, has been possible because of the political will and availability of a King who “listens to his people.” Writing in the same week, in commemoration of the Throne Day, Moroccan journalist Zineb Ibnouzahir, whose columns have a distinctly feminist feel, conceded that, in 20 years under Mohammed VI, Morocco has considerably improved the status of its women. “In the past 20 years,” she wrote, “[Moroccan women] have made some gains.” She cited the “right not to be repudiated, to ask for divorce;” “the right to transfer our nationality to our children;” and “the right to be treated as an adult and autonomous being, not an eternal minor in need of [male] tutelage…” While the overall sentiment in such assessments is pertinent, verifiable even, recent weeks have seen a resurgence of demands for Moroccan society to fully embrace its changing socio-political realities. In the wake of a scandal involving Hajar Raissouni, a female journalist who was jailed (she has since been granted royal pardon) for “illegal sex” and abortion, Moroccan human rights activists took to the streets in waves to denounce what they saw as the social and political hegemony of Moroccan conservatives, including some religious and cultural puritans, who they said want the country to remain “stuck in the middle ages.” “I think that Moroccans, mostly the youth and women, have had enough. For their sake, we will not give up,” said Sonia Terrab, one of the forerunners of individual freedoms activists in the wake of the “illegal sex” and abortion scandal. Meanwhile, recent reports have suggested that gendered violence continues to be part of the daily life of many Moroccan women. The underlying assumption is that the country’s intrinsically patriarchal cultural codes and mores are an impediment to female freedom and unencumbered expression of femininity in public space. As a result, one recent study concluded, even when the law is on their side, Moroccan women still feel subsumed by a culture that demands that they be silent and docile. Stephanie Willman Bordat, an international human rights lawyer, recently told Morocco World News that recent reforms have not sufficiently dealt with Morocco’s lingering issue of sex-based violence. While there have been changes and a noticeable political will to go forward, to secure women’s rights, most of the legal reforms have been either vague or not effectively implemented, Bordat argued. She took the example of Law 103-13 on combating violence against women. For Bordat, while Law 103-13 is a welcome change to Morocco’s relatively toxic legal atmosphere for women, it has not lived up to the expectations of women and women’s rights activists. The law “is really extremely short and it did not address any of the issues related to gender-based violence that Moroccan women and NGOs have been advocating for ten years,” she said.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) has arrested an “extremist” suspect for promoting ISIS destructive ideology on social media. The BCIJ arrested the suspect on Tuesday, November 26 in Rabat’s twin city, Sale, a statement from the counterterrorism bureau has said. Preliminary investigations show that the 33-year old suspect was promoting and glorifying  the extremist ideology of ISIS through apps and social networks. The suspect, who was also inciting terror acts by ISIS “lone wolves,” recorded an audio in which he explained “the methods of manufacturing explosives and explosive belts,” the statement said. The BCIJ  investigations also revealed that the suspect was preparing to commit a suicide bombing in Morocco. He was also in contact with “media leaders” of ISIS abroad.  The counter-terrorism bureau staff seized several electronic devices, mobile phones, and knives during the operation. The security unit put the suspect in custody for further investigation.  The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to combat ISIS fighters and terrorist groups. Morocco’s BCIJ has conducted several similar operations throughout the year. The latest was on November 17, when the BCIJ arrested two ISIS-linked suspects in Rabat.  The suspects, aged 30 and 34, had plotted to carry out terror attacks across Morocco, a statement from the BCIJ said.

Rabat – Two French military helicopters crashed into each other in Mali Monday evening, November 25, killing 13 soldiers. The helicopters were engaged in an operation against jihadi militants, helping to track a group of militants who were in small trucks and motorcycles. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office issued a statement, expressing his “deep sadness” about the soldiers who “died for France in the hard fight against terrorism in the Sahel.” Macron also tweeted his sorrow over the accident. Treize de nos militaires sont morts hier au Mali. Ils étaient engagés dans une opération de combat contre des terroristes. Ces treize héros n’avaient qu’un seul but : nous protéger. Je m’incline devant la douleur de leurs proches et de leurs camarades. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 26, 2019  The French Ministry of Armed Forces expressed its condolences for the loss of the 13 soldiers. French troops deployed to Mali six years ago to combat Islamist militants who took power in parts of Mali. The mission became known as “Operation Barkhane.” According to French news outlet Le Monde, the helicopters were operating in the Liptako border region, covering parts of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. Troops on the ground were tracking a group of jihadists that they “detected a few hours earlier” according to French General Francois Lecointre, and the helicopters approached as backup assistance. The two helicopters crashed into each other at 7:40 p.m. One helicopter was a Cougar transport aircraft and the other a Tiger attack helicopter. France has thousands of troops stationed in the Sahel region as part of its Operation Barkhane. Morocco has frequently brought up instability in the Sahel region as a matter of international concern. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, has said that criminals and terrorists consider the Sahel a safe zone. He also said that lack of security cooperation was exacerbating the instability.

Rabat – The Court of First Instance in Sale near Rabat sentenced Moroccan rapper Mohamed Mounir, better known as Gnawi, to one year in prison on Monday, November 25. The court convicted the rapper, who will also pay a fine of MAD 1,000, on charges of insulting security services in a video posted on social media. In a live video in early October, the rapper strongly criticized Morocco’s police. Police later arrested him on October 31. Some rights activists claimed that the police targeted the rapper for a music video, featuring two other rappers.  The song, titled “Long Live the People,” is described as controversial. Released on October 29, the track shows Gnawi with two other rappers strongly criticizing the government for corruption and poverty, saying that it leads to “drug abuse” among young people. The song garnered 16 million views on YouTube and went viral since its release. Amnesty International issued a statement to condemn the court’s ruling, calling for Gnawi’s immediate release. “This is a disgraceful verdict. There can be no justification for imprisoning the Moroccan rapper Gnawi for a year simply because he exercised his right to freedom of expression,” Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Director Heba Morayef said yesterday. In response, the lawyer representing police, Abdelfattah Yatribi, told the press that the trial has “nothing to do withfreedom of expression.” He described the case as a “penal code” issue. Police argued that the arrest has nothing to do with the song, explaining that they did not arrest the two other rappers. Selmali, who appears alongside Gnawi in the song, told the AP that the musicians did not want to create controversy but to speak up against major challenges citizens face. Yahia Semlali, otherwise known as Lz3er, also appeared in the music video. Gnawi’s case gained international media coverage. It was also the main topic during the Moroccan government’s weekly press conference when the spokesperson of the Moroccan government criticized the track. Hassan Abyaba said at the press conference that all songs “must respect the citizens, the constancy of the nation and the principles and values that are part of the Moroccans’ education. It remains to be seen whether Gnawi will appeal the sentence.

Rabat – Jordanian television channel Roya has issued an apology after one of its television shows displayed the flag of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). In the statement published on November 24, the satellite channel said that the television program was investigating Palestinians’ knowledge of international flags. The flag of the Polisario Front appeared due to “an unintentional mistake,” the press release added. The channel emphasized that Roya’s position on the Western Sahara conflict is in line with the position of the Jordan. The kingdom supports Morocco’s territorial integrity and  its sovereignty over the region. “Solidarity is a strong feature of the fraternal and historical relations between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Kingdom of Morocco,” the statement added. The channel concluded its statement, expressing its apologies over the “unintentional mistake.” Morocco and Jordan maintain strong diplomatic relations that are marked by the exchange of visits from representatives of the two countries. Jordan is among the Arab countries that continue to reiterate support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The latest statement confirming Jordan’s position came during the 4th Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York in October. During the meeting, the representative of Jordan at the UN, Sima Sami Bahous, said that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, submitted to the UN in 2007, is a “serious and realistic mechanism that takes into account the specificities of the region, the territorial integrity and the full sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over its territory.” The diplomat added that her country welcomes the “positive engagement of the Kingdom in the search for a definitive political solution to the question of the Moroccan Sahara.”

Rabat – Why did Mohamed Ihattaren ditch Morocco in favor of the Netherlands? Many fans of Morocco’s Atlas Lions have recently asked, rather chagrined that Morocco had lost its battle to lure one of the most promising young players that could add more depth and attacking urgency to the Moroccan national team. According to recent reports, citing both the player himself and some members of the Ihattaren family, Morocco’s footballing authorities abrasively and aggressively played their recruitment card in the Ihattaren affair. As a result, instead of winning the player’s sympathy, they repulsed both him and his family. Twice, Ihattaren, the rising Dutch-Moroccan star of the Dutch football league, had told both his countries—Morocco and the Netherlands— that he needed more time to think about his international career. Insisting he had been “happy and much honored” by the interest from Morocco and the Netherlands, Ihattaren said he needed some breathing space “to reflect on my career as an international.” While this temporarily calmed the ardor of both the Moroccan and Dutch football federations as they competed to win over the player, Morocco felt especially invigorated. As Ihattaren’s statement came directly in response to calls that he represents the Dutch U21 team, Morocco took the move as a subtle shift in its favor. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) saw in the move an invitation to push a little bit more, to go the extra mile to convince the player and his family. Then came the final announcement that shocked in Morocco and caused delight in the Netherlands: The adoptive country, rather than the fatherland, had finally convinced the young player that they were the best choice for him. Chief in Ihattaren’s final decision, at least from his statement explaining his motivations, was the point that familiarity (with a group of players with whom he has a history of playing for youth squads) and continuity (playing to honor that history at the elite level) meant that his personal fulfillment dictated that he chose the Dutch team. “I played for the Netherlands for the under 14s [team] and I won the European Championship with the Under-17 team with the Oranje. It’s good that I can continue,” he explained. But, as is often the case in such cases, there were whispers that the official explanation was a tree that hid a much bigger, unexplored forest; that many things had been left out, unsaid; that, somehow, something was amiss. There was more to the story or, some simply insisted in Morocco, something may have gone wrong with Morocco’s strong-looking bid to secure the Ihattaren deal. Morocco’s footballing authorities had capitalized on patriotism and Europe’s mounting Islamophobia, two particularly compelling selling points, to lure the PSV Eindhoven prodigy away from the Oranje, as the Dutch national team is called. The Dutch, meanwhile, had insisted on gratitude and continuity, subtly reminding the young player what his choice of national team would mean for a country that adopted him, invested in his talents, and helped him hone his skills and live his dream. In response, the young player insisted he needed time to think, to assess, to listen to his parents and entourage; but mostly to his heart. According to a recent family revelation, however, a faux pas from the Moroccan federation was the final straw. In its strong desire to recruit the young player, family sources have insisted, the FRMF went too far, doing more than it should have to broadcast its selling points to the Ihattaren family. “It was unbelievable,” Yassine Ihattaren, the player’s big brother, told Dutch outlet AD on November 33. The brother was speaking about FRMF’s “instrumentalization” of a family issue, the death of Ihattaren’s father, to convince the player of how deadly serious they were about having him play for Morocco. FRMF may have thought this—massive financial investments in, and notable presence at the funeral of the player’s father— was a good move. As far as FRMF saw it, the gesture highlighted the human dimension of their interest in securing the services of “a son of the fatherland.” To the Ihattaren family, however, it was “unbelievable” that FMRF had no qualms in “instrumentalizing” that episode. “They came at my father’s funerals to discuss my brother’s national team choice. This was a sad day reserved for condolences. That is why we chose to distance ourselves from these people,” Yassine, the player’s big brother, insisted in his AD interview. Worse still, some Moroccan outlets have cited Ihattaren himself as saying that FRMF’s massive presence at his father’s funerals especially raised eye-brows in his family because they had never been contacted by FRMF before that funeral day. FRMF had showed up to the funeral out of nowhere, hoping for the better to come out of what Ihattaren and his family now considered as “too much interest.” “They tried to use my father’s death to influence my decision. This led me to make another choice,” Ihattaren has been quoted as saying. He is also said to have insisted that another FRMF faux pas was that they selected him as part of a long list of players to represent Morocco in qualifying games for the CAN 2021 and the 2022 World Cup without even informing him. These revelations are set to elicit mixed, conflicting reactions among Atlas Lions fans. For those who have been critical of FRMF management since extravagant spending failed to buy success at the recent CAN, the Ihattaren family revelations constitute a vindication of what critics see as the failed leadership running Moroccan football. For other, more nationalism-inclined Atlas Lions fans, however, the revelations may come across as yet another tired excuse by a dual citizen who, having chosen to play for a country other than the “motherland,” now finds lame pretexts to explain his “betrayal.” When Ihattaren announced his final decision weeks ago, some said that this was further proof that Morocco should focus on homegrown talents rather than diaspora players that only choose Morocco when they have scant prospects of playing for their other country. Without taking sides in the debate over who Morocco’s footballing authorities should focus on or how to best convince dual citizenship players, the loss of Ihattaren was a serious blow to a Moroccan squad struggling to add more creative vigor and urgency in its attacking buildup.

Rabat – Moroccan police in Sale, Rabat’s twin city arrested three suspects for their involvement in drug trafficking on November 24. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the suspects also smuggle psychotropic tablets. Police arrested the suspects, who were in a car and showed “fierce resistance” to police intervention. National police already had an arrest warrant out on one of the suspects, police said in a statement. Police seized 2.25 kilograms of cannabis resin, 2.2 kilograms of kif (a type of drugs) and 3 kilograms of countreift tobacco. Security services in Sale put the suspects in custody for further investigation in order to shed more light on the case. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to fight drug trafficking and criminal acts across Morocco. Moroccan security services arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking from January 1 to September 15. The police also seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives during the same period. In October, Moroccan customs announced that they had seized a total of 8,342 kilograms of cannabis since October 22.

Rabat – The Legatum Institute, a London-based think-tank, published its 2019 Prosperity Index today, November 25. With a ranking of 100 out of 167, Morocco scored slightly below average on the index and just five places behind its North African neighbor Tunisia.  The index analyzes the performance of 167 nations across 65 policy-focused elements. The Legatum Institute aims to enable leaders around the world to set their agendas for growth and development and to create pathways from poverty to prosperity.   The Prosperity Index ranks countries according to three domains: Inclusive societies, open economies, and empowered people. Each domain includes four sub-categories such as security, investment, market access, personal freedom, health, education, social capital, and nature.  How did Morocco do? Morocco fared especially well in the safety and security category with a score of 57, higher than that of the US.  The kingdom also placed average in the investment environment category and the market access and infrastructure category. However, Morocco received low scores in the categories of personal freedom, health, education, and the natural environment. Morocco’s lowest score is in social capital due to the country’s poor civic participation and low institutional trust.  Overall, Morocco has declined since the 2018 Prosperity Index. This makes it one of only 19 countries to decline in the last decade.  How does MENA rank as a region? As a region, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has the second-lowest prosperity rank, scoring poorly in most categories of consideration.  Seven MENA countries received average scores, while the remaining 13 scored below average or poor. The index does not include Palestine.  Safety and security, personal freedom, social capital, and natural environment are the weakest pillars in the region, according to the report.  Although the economic environment and education have improved in the region, MENA has suffered the greatest deterioration of safety and security in the world over the last decade. In addition, more than half of the region’s countries have seen a decline in personal freedoms.  The top-ranked country in MENA is Israel with a score of 31. According to the index, Morocco is safer than Israel and has a better natural environment. The second-highest-ranking country in MENA is the UAE, which has the best social capital, market access and infrastructure, and economic quality in the region. However, Morocco’s natural environment and level of personal freedoms trump those of the UAE.   Overall findings The top-ranked country on the Prosperity Index is Denmark, followed by Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland. The weakest-performing country in the index is South Sudan, also ranking last in security, health, and education.  North America is the most prosperous region in the world, while the majority of deteriorating countries are in sub-Saharan Africa and MENA.  Overall, the Prosperity Index reports that global prosperity has improved, but the gap between the strongest and weakest performing countries has continued to widen.  The index celebrates this year’s global improvements in safety and security and social tolerance, but not all findings in the index are positive.  “It is concerning to see personal freedoms and governance deteriorating,” the report says.  “Although the rise in social capital is partially counterbalancing the failings of institutions, much more needs to be done to . . . drive greater levels of prosperity around the world.”

Rabat – The Court of Appeals in Meknes, a city 100 kilometers west of Fez, has reduced the prison sentence of a woman who used false documents to begin a second marriage before the divorce in her first marriage was final. The Moroccan judge has ordered the woman convicted of polygamy to serve a one year sentence instead of her original two year sentence from the Court of First Instance. When her first husband finished a jail sentence last year, he sought to put his “polygamous” wife in prison for taking a second husband, an officer in the army. Although the woman had begun divorce proceedings, Le Site Info explained that she did not legally request the divorce from her husband and instead falsified documents to get married a second time. The woman’s case made headlines in August 2018 when her first husband brought a complaint. She told interrogators that she had a child with her second husband, but prosecutors did not charge him with adultery because they believe he was unaware of the first marriage. Moroccan law allows women to request the court for a divorce while men have the right to demand a divorce. Men are also allowed to be married to up to four women at the same time, but they must obtain the permission of their current wives first.

Rabat – Morocco’s flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) has won two awards at the 51st annual meeting of the Association of African Airlines (AFRAA) in Mauritius. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the company won two awards as the best company in two categories, “Global Operations” and “Best Improved financial results.” The staff at Royal Air Maroc are pleased with the symbol of international recognition. CEO of RAM Hamid Addou said, “We are extremely proud of this international recognition, especially as the jury is made up of professionals from the air transport sectors.” Such recognition is encouraging the company to “redouble” its efforts to “achieve a single African air transport market that will make it possible to remove barriers of protectionism in order to achieve a growth in air traffic on our continent, driven mainly by African airlines and in the interests of the economies of our countries and our fellow citizens,” he added. The annual AFRAA meeting convened experts from the air transport sectors from African airlines from November 10-12. The meeting was held under the theme “Success in an integrated and interconnected Africa.” During the meeting, experts in the field discussed challenges related to air transport in Africa. Founded in 1967 in Accra, Ghana, AFRAA has its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. It seeks to establish collaboration and partnership among African airlines. It also lobbies for “market access to increase revenues and enhance connectivity for the aviation sector in Africa” and to promote the “industry best practices to support safe, secure and reliable air transport” in the continent.

Rabat – Morocco renewed its steadfast support for the Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of Palestinian people on Monday, November 25. Moroccan ambassador to Cairo Ahmed Tazi affirmed Morocco’s position during his speech at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers. The ministers held the extraordinary meeting to discuss the US position on the illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied lands of Palestine. In his speech, the Moroccan diplomat said that Morocco “confirms its firm position on all issues related to the just Palestinian cause.” He added that all Israeli settlements on Palestinian lands, including East Jerusalem, are illegal and undermine the two-state peace process. “We stand with our Palestinian brothers in their distress and support all their rights, especially the right to establish an independent and viable state of Palestine,” he said. Tazi also spoke about Morocco’s determination to encourage any “sincere effort that would give dynamism to the Palestinian cause.” The government of Morocco, through its diplomat, emphasized that Israel should respond to efforts towards achieving  “serious and fruitful peace negotiations with our Palestinian brothers.” The extraordinary meeting also seeks to discuss a response to the US administration’s position on Israeli settlements. US State Secretary has backed Israeli’s settlement, stating that “Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law has not advanced the cause of peace.” Several countries, including Jordan, slammed the US for supporting Israel’s illegal settlements. The UN Security Council also condemned the move.

Rabat – Spanish police have arrested Nourdine Chikar, a Moroccan-Spanish businessman, after his conviction on charges of “economic crimes” related to ISIS. Police picked up Chikar at his residence near Alicante in southeast Spain on Wednesday, November 20, according to El Espanol. Along with a Syrian named Ammar Termanini, Chikar provided ISIS with uniforms. Using his business that recycled used clothes, Chikar helped to smooth out obstacles related to shipping containers of clothes to Syria and Iraq. Termanini also created a company for the export and import of textiles. Chikar will go to jail for the economic crimes of money laundering, embezzlement, tax offenses, document forgery, and fraudulent money transfers, El Espanol reported. Chikar is still facing charges of being part of a Jihadi cell based in Alicante, Valencia, and Ceuta that Spain dismantled in February 2016. After his arrest, police transferred Chikar to Madrid so that he can be “available to the National Court.” Police also arrested Chikar’s wife as an accessory to his crimes but released her after questioning. Termanini, who collaborated with Chikar, sent clothes to terrorist groups in Syria under the guise of humanitarian aid. Chikar also sought funding using his role as businessman, president of the local Concentaina mosque, and secretary of the Concentaina Islamic community. For the first time in Spain, according to El Espanol, prosecutors brought the charge of committing a “crime against protected cultural property in armed conflict.” The charge relates to the trafficking of historical artefacts from Syrian museums to raise money for ISIS. Three years ago, Spanish police seized three containers in Cadiz and Valencia, packed with 10 tons of military uniforms and on their way to Turkey, according to the Spanish news outlet.  Spain arrested Nourdine Chikar in 2016, but he paid €60,000 in bail to be released. At the time, Chikar’s three companies in southeast Spain, Melilla, and the Canary Islands ceased operations, although it is not clear if the government closed them. However, Morocco did not close Chikar’s €10,000 textile company in Tangier. After he paid bail, El Espanol details, Chikar traveled to Morocco in December 2018 and signed business deals with local authorities in the north. In Nador, Chikar agreed to set up the “Karama Textile” company for import and export of textiles. And in Oujda, the regional assembly granted him €1 million for the company.

Rabat – Dozens of human rights activists and supporters of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan took to the street in Northern Spain on Saturday, November 24, to call Polisario out for “war crimes” and human rights violations in the Tindouf camps, Algeria. Organized in Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital of the Basque autonomous region in Northern Spain, the sit-in coincided with the visit to the Spanish region of a delegation of elected Sahrawi officials and civil society representatives from Moroccan Sahara. According to a Maghreb Arab Press report, the Sahrawi delegation’s visit to the Spanish region came within the broader context of bringing Polisario’s human rights breaches, including torture and violent crackdowns on dissidence, to the attention of the international community. Ait Oukdim Mustapha, the president of the Association of Moroccan Residents in the Basque Country, said that the mini-protest was part of efforts to not only condemn Polisario-sponsored violence and human rights abuses against dissident Sahrawis, but also to support Morocco’s autonomy proposal. The role of such an event outside of Morocco, he argued, is to confront the international community with the daily struggles and “inhumane” living conditions in the Polisario-run camps. Life in the camps is especially “unbearable” for dissidents, he stressed. Present at the event were many victims—directly or through relatives—of the militant group’s abuses. “We are here to give voice to the Polisario victims and raise awareness in the international community, especially here in the Basque region, about Polisario’s abuses and crimes,” said Dahi Aguai, who is said to have survived torture in Polisario prisons and is now a vehement critic of the movement. As the president of an association for relatives of the “missing” or “disappeared” of Polisario’s “terror,” Aguai said it is necessary that the world know about the dark side that Polisario conceals as it successfully portrays itself as a victim and legitimate representative of the “Sahrawi cause.” These Polisario-damning messages come as the group continues to register reputation-damaging blows. Several critical reports and condemnatory calls have piled up in recent months, demanding“justice” and “accountability” for the militant group’s reported abuses and human rights breaches. Most recent reports have pointed out torture, arbitrary arrests and embezzling of humanitarian aid to distressed residents in the Tindouf camps. The Vitoria-Gasteiz sit-in also comes as many voices urge for more action against reported war crimes and related exactions committed by the Polisario leadership. Meanwhile, other critical voices have complained about “war crimes” committed by the Polisario leadership at the height of the Western Sahara conflict in the 1970s and 1980s. Last month, the Sahrawi Association for the Defense of Human Rights (ASADEDH), a Spanish human rights group active on the Western Sahara question, took issue with the presence of a Polisario leader at a high-profile conference in Madrid. “We denounce the presence in the capital of Spain, Madrid, of Bachir Mustafa Sayed, one of the main accused or investigated by the Spanish National Court in the serious violations of human rights, such as kidnapping, torture, murder, etc. committed in the Sahara between 1974 and 1988,” ASADEDH said in a statement.

Rabat – Algerian presidential candidate Abdelmadjid Tebboune has asked Morocco to apologize for closing the border with Algeria after the Atlas Asni hotel attack in Marrakech in August 1994. In 2010 a former Algerian agent revealed to  The National, part of the London based Quds Press International News Agency, that the Algerian intelligence services were allegedly behind the “planning and execution of the attack.” Karim Moulay told the press agency that he was “dispatched by Algerian intelligence to Morocco in April 1994 with the mission of initiating some security breaches in order to foment instability in the country.”  In the wake of the attack, Morocco imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens, and Algeria closed the border. Tebboune, a former prime minister, spoke about the frozen relations between Algiers and Rabat during a press conference on Sunday, November 24, as part of his election campaign. Tebboune argued that Morocco should issue a “formal apology” to Algiers as a condition for reopening its borders with Morocco. For Tebboune, Algeria’s decision to close the border was not due to the Western Sahara conflict. Algeria publicly supports, finances, and arms the Polisario Front, a breakaway group, and backs its independence claims. Tebboune said that Algeria rejects the claims of its “involvement in the case of the Atlas Asni bombings in Marrakech.” He also condemned Morocco’s decision to impose visa regulations on Algerian citizens. He claimed that “Algerians have been stranded in the Moroccan territories and visa  regulations were imposed on Algerians of French origin.” The candidate emphasized, however, that the country has respect for the Moroccan people. Tebboune added that “Algeria has dignity and cannot accept anyone who tramples on its dignity.” In contrast to what Tebboune said during the conference, Morocco has expressed its willingness to restore diplomatic relations with Algeria several times. On November 6, 2018, King Mohammed VI made an unprecedented call, inviting Algeria to engage in a frank and direct dialogue with Morocco to break the stalemate. “I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries,” said King Mohammed VI in his speech. Algeria, however, opposes Morocco’s policy positions, especially its sovereignty over Western Sahara. Tebboune is not the only candidate who has put the spotlight on Morocco as part of their election campaigns. Abdelkader Bengrina, a former tourism minister and now a contender for the country’s presidential seat, also made a controversial statement about Morocco. He accused Morocco of being a “major drug exporter.” “All I can tell you is that [Morocco’s] drug exports are estimated in billions and not in millions of dollars,” Bengrina said.

Rabat – Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced the details of the disorder that accompanied the Casablanca derby in a press release on Sunday, November 24.  Fans of Wydad Athletic Club and Raja Casablanca put on a spectacular display in the stands of the Mohammed V Stadium during the match on Saturday, November 23. The colorful smoke shows, flags, well-choreographed tifos, and chants were almost as captivating as the game itself.  The match that ended in a 4-4 draw after an impressive comeback by Raja, however, did not come without its fair share of turbulence.  Casablanca police mobilized 3,595 agents to maintain peace at the derby, a game that welcomed more than 50,000 spectators.  #مباراة_الديربي_البيضاوي
تغطية أمنية مكثفة، تشارك فيها جميع التشكيلات والوحدات الأمنية، لضمان الأجواء الآمنة لمباراة الديربي البيضاوي. pic.twitter.com/1qvwxABt4M — DGSN MAROC (@DGSN_MAROC) November 23, 2019  DGSN reported that police apprehended 782 unaccompanied minors who were trying to illegally enter the stadium. Police also arrested 36 people for their alleged involvement in vandalism, stone-throwing, and destruction of public and private property. Police placed 15 minors under surveillance for the same charges.  Casablanca’s security services took nine people into custody for various offenses such as possession of drugs, theft, indecent assault, and public drunkenness. Police also seized several knives, stones, and smoke bombs during arrests at the derby.  According to the DGSN statement, officers also seized a bottle of sulfuric acid during the arrests. Sulfuric acid is a corrosive acid and causes severe burns, scarring, tissue damage, and even death when it comes in contact with human skin. Contact with the eyes can cause permanent blindness.  Five police officers sustained minor injuries during the derby, and one senior peace officer suffered a fracture of the shoulder.  Vandals damaged seven law enforcement vehicles and six privately-owned vehicles.  Fortunately, no serious spectator injuries have been reported.

Essaouira – Morocco has big ambitions for its tourist industry, with China among the sector’s key targets. However, as the Chinese market grows, so too does tension between Moroccan companies and tour companies based in China.  In 2016 Morocco announced a visa exemption for Chinese nationals, the move aimed to facilitate travel between Morocco and China and to develop economic ties.  Since lifting the visa requirement Morocco has seen a massive increase in tourists coming from China, with visits from Chinese nationals reaching 200,000 in 2018—a giant leap from the meager 10,000 travelers in 2015. Hoping to further capitalize on the new market, in September Morocco signed a “co-marketing partnership” agreement with Ctrip, China’s largest online travel agency, to promote China-Morocco trips.  With Chinese tourists spending $120 billion on travel in 2018, the market is one Morocco is keen to cash in on. The kingdom’s Ministry of Tourism aims to reach 500,000 Chinese visitors annually.  However, Morocco’s chances of reaching the half million mark could come to nothing if the country’s tourist industry does not learn to adapt to the specific needs of the tourists it hopes to attract. With the influx of Chinese tourists to Morocco, the country has also seen a rise in Mandarin-speaking, non-certified tour guides operating within the tourist industry, as well as a tendency for Chinese tourists to book their Moroccan trips through Chinese agencies; meaning that much of the revenue is staying in China.  International agency Tourism Review reported earlier this year that “industry professionals complain about competition from the illegal market (run by the Chinese guides).”  The report added that the lack of depth in the service the Chinese guides offer does not encourage tourists to return or recommend the destination. “The potential is huge. Chinese arrivals are increasing, and their revenues are falling because of the unfair competition that is being made in China is not being tackled by the authorities,” the publication added.  A quick search on Google shows that countless Chinese tour companies are proposing fully guided visits to Morocco. The prices of many of these package tours are all inclusive, meaning that, rather than contributing significantly to Morocco’s tourist revenue, some of the proceeds are transferred from Chinese bank account to Chinese bank account.  Other sites specify that tourists must pay the Chinese tour guide in cash on a day to day basis, as well as covering their lodging and expenses. Morocco World News spoke to a Moroccan tour guide operating in Fez about what Tourism Review called “unfair competition.” Fatima Hassan, 53, has been working as a tour guide in one of Morocco’s most popular cities for three years. She outlined for MWN that in order to gain a guide permit, she took written and spoken exams in French, Arabic, and English.  “It’s a big problem in Fez,” Hassan told MWN, referring to the phenomenon of Chinese tour guides operating without licenses in Moroccan cities.  “Many times I have met groups with just Chinese guides, without local tour guides. They take the business away from the national and local tour guides.” Hassan added that the issue is particularly noticeable in the high season and during Chinese national holidays.  “Recently we [tour guides in Fez] were talking about this.” Hassan shared with MWN how she and many other native tour guides are preoccupied about the ongoing problem as Chinese tourists account for a huge proportion of the visitors to Fez every year.  “I hope that the tour guides do something in the guides’ union meeting.” Fatima Hassan emphasized that she is anxious that the issue does not end in “discussion” and that Morocco’s tourist industry can “find a solution for this problem.” What Hassan did not share with MWN was the fact that Morocco’s tour guides actually make most of their money on commission in the bazaars. Guiding only pays so much, so, like tourist transport services, guides direct the tourists to certain shops and earn money on every penny spent.  Abdelsamad, a leather boutique owner in Essaouira, told MWN that he has deals with tour guides. The guides recommend his shop and “negotiate” sales for their clients, leaving the shop with a 30% commission.  The boutique owner explained that Chinese tourists often have sizeable shopping budgets, meaning that the Moroccan guides are missing out on potentially lucrative, if not transparent, deals. Meanwhile, some Chinese tour companies avoid paying extra on souvenir “commissions” by travelling with a host from the tour company and hiring local tour guides when visiting certain destinations. By travelling in a group led by an experienced agent who speaks both Mandarin and the language of the official  tour guides, the travellers can avoid potential scams. “We use offical (sic) tour guide in all major cities,” Liang from Liang Zhang LLC told MWN. The company is an example of Chinese-Moroccan cooperation, registered in Casablanca, China, and the US. Liang explained that his clients pay “their own hotels and food inside Morocco 100%,” underlining that his company is not among the Chinese tour companies and agents that divert their revenue outside Morocco.  However, the issue is not just a question of “unfair competition.” Olivier Verot, founder and CEO of French-Chinese marketing company the Gentleman Marketing Agency, explained to Morocco World News that Morocco’s inability to increase revenue from the Chinese tourism market has more to do with what Morocco’s tourism sector is not doing than the “problem” posed by Chinese tour guides.  Verot’s agency represents the Royal Mansour Hotel, Marrakech, among other luxury destinations in Morocco and France. According to the tourism marketing expert, it is no surprise that Chinese tourists prefer the guides provided by their tour companies. “Chinese People would like to speak Chinese,” he said simply. Verot went on to explain that very few Moroccan tour guides speak Mandarin and that there needs to be some language teaching provision to avoid undercutting by Chinese companies. However, the bigger problem lies in Morocco’s laid back attitude to marketing itself as a tourist destination. “Moroccan travel agencies are also very passive, and most of the tourists are outbound travel, trips are organized and made by Chinese Tour Operators, that do not match with local companies.”   “Most of them [Moroccan tour companies] rely only on partnership with Chinese Tour Operators that do not need their help.” “Almost no travel agencies, hotel or tourism players have a Chinese Website, or an official WeChat account,” Verot emphasized that Moroccan agencies and tourist destinations need to adapt to the culture and habits of Chinese tourists. “Most Chinese travelers will feel more comfortable reading in their native language, and prefer to use WeChat better than email.” Verot, whose company also represents several regional French tourist boards, emphasized that the Moroccan tourist industry should not be discouraged. “It is normal, Chinese culture takes time to understand.”  While “the feedback of Morocco from Chinese people is excellent,” the marketing CEO told MWN that Morocco’s tourist agencies, and indeed the Ministry of Tourism, “needs to be more active to attract Chinese people.”   In order to make the most of the visa exemption and profit from a potentially huge revenue from Chinese tourism, Morocco needs to understand that “the Chinese Tourism market is specific, they spend more, and expect more, especially the premium Clients.” Verot added that trust is a key issue for Chinese tourists, and that they are very worried about “scams.” Moroccan companies, he said, “need to work on that.” The  Royal Mansour in Marrakech, under the expert leadership of Verot’s agency, has seen a significant increase in Chinese clientele. The PR exert explained that this is down to brand trust. The hotel has invested heavily in actively increasing its online presence, particularly on Chinese social media and Baidu (Chinese Google). Meanwhile, Morocco’s Agency for Tourism Development (SMIT) aims not only to expand the tourist industry by attracting travellers from China, among other new partners, but also to attract foreign investment. The agency’s website describes Morocco as “a renowned tourism destination in Africa and one of the most attractive countries in terms of foreign direct investments on a continental scale.” The sector already accounts, directly and indirectly, for an estimated 25% of Morocco’s total workforce, meaning that its success, or lack thereof, will have a massive impact on the Moroccan population.  In May of this year Imad Bakkad, SMIT’s CEO, told World Finance that “tourism is considered to be a development accelerator, which contributes to reducing income inequalities between regions and provides alternative employment opportunities.”  Having underlined the importance of the sector in terms of its potential as an impetus for national development, as well as its enormous role in national employment, the CEO set out the country’s strategy for attracting both more investors and more tourists. According to Bakkad, and the SMIT website, Morocco’s strategy, or “2020 Vision,” is “structured around eight tourism territories.” Within each of the territories, or regions, SMIT has big plans for development in infrastructure and sustainability.  The agency, however, has even bigger objectives including “Doubling tourist arrivals by doubling the market share on the main European markets as well as attracting 1 million tourists in the emerging markets.” With China already accounting for 200,000 visitors a year, SMIT is making headway to meeting its objective. However, if the strategy is to be successful, changes in infrastructure and “building 160,000 new hotel beds and 40,000 new beds of luxury tourism residences” will not be enough.  SMIT needs a marketing strategy and an in depth analysis of the cultural expectations of the tourists who will be footing Morocco’s bills and, indirectly, paying the wages of the 2.5 million people the industry employs.  In order to bank the revenue potential of a tourism market like China, Morocco’s tourism sector needs to step up its game, and fast—if Moroccan companies are not meeting the needs of its new and deep-pocketed clients, agencies and companies from outside the kingdom will be quick to fill the vacuum.

Rabat – A soon to be opened, an unprecedented project in Morocco is drawing nationwide attention. For the first time in the North African country, women will have a unique space, where both men and cameras are banned. A wave of comments has swept social media since banners advertising the place appeared in public spaces in the city of Tetouan, northern Morocco. Flower Cafe, set to open its doors for the first time next week is a platform where only women and girls are allowed. Oumaima Ahrif, an employee in charge of the coffee shop told Morocco World News, “It is 100% women space.” “Even the staff hired to work at the cafe will be women,” she added. Speaking to MWN about the inspirations and objectives of the cafe, Oumaima said that the cafe’s owner was looking for a unique idea to replace her previous project with. The cafe used to be a wedding venue, but the location failed to attract many people due to its calm location. Ikram Ben El Khalil, the owner of the cafe has been “thinking what project she might replace the wedding venue with for too long before the idea of the only-women coffee shop,” Oumaima told MWN. She had this idea four years ago, but now the time has come to invest in the idea and see it get off the ground. Before its transformation, the place hosted several meetings of Ikram’s friends, and that had inspired her to create a unique platform for women where they can feel “comfortable,” Oumaima said. Positive reactions Although the cafe has not yet opened its doors for customers, the project has already received positive reactions, especially from women. “We received many positive reactions, with several people asking when the opening will take place. We need places like this in Tetouan,” Oumaima added. She said that there will be no cameras in the cafes, enabling women to feel comfortable. “Women with hijab can also remove their headscarves if they feel like it. They can laugh the way they want,  they can feel like themselves and can discuss any kind of topics with their friends at Flower Cafe,” she said. Oumaima does not remember reading any negative comments on the project.  “In contrast, we received good and positive reactions from men too. Some of them said they will take their wives and sisters to the place,” she said. She said she read some comments on some Facebook pages, which spoke about the project. “Some of them really loved the idea and they said they will no longer feel concerned as it will be a space made only for women, who will feel at ease.” Oumaima told MWN that there were a few people who did not like the idea, most of them were young people. Not an ordinary cafe For the owners and managers, the cafe is not just a simple coffee shop. Asked if the idea to create the coffee was due to challenges facing women, including sexual harassment, Oumaima said that the owner “never thought about this before.” “Not at all, I don’t think this was the reason why she thought about this idea. We are not in a dangerous city. It is really normal for women to sit at mixed cafes around the city.”  “It is a special space, we are going to host events to discuss women’s issues here,” she told MWN. Oumaima said that the cafe will invite academics and guests to debate female-led topics. She added that the coffee shop will also have a partnership with an association against cancer. “A specific percentage of the cafes revenues will go to this association.” In Morocco, gender-mixed venues are common in urban cities. However, in rural areas cafes tend to be men only zones.

Rabat – Leaked Communist party documents have revealed China’s policy on detention camps for Uighur Muslims in its western Xinjiang province. The leaked documents include a memo from 2017 giving instructions on how to run the detention camps. In the memo, the deputy Communist party chief in Xinjiang, Zhu Hailun, said camp staff must “strictly manage and control student activities to prevent escapes during class, eating periods, toilet breaks, bath time, medical treatment, family visits, etc.” For the past three years China has been rounding up and detaining hundreds of thousands of its Muslim citizens who are part of the Uighur ethnic minority. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalism received what they are calling “The China Cables” and shared them with the BBC, the Guardian, and 15 other news outlets.  The documents reveal the official policy that detainees were not allowed to leave. Denying the allegations, China calls the detention camps “voluntary” and says they are re-education centers to combat extremism. The Chinese ambassador to the UK said they were merely “vocational education and training centers.” The camps do have an educational component. Zhu Hailun’s memo instructs staff to teach inmates “the national language (Mandarin), law, and skills.” The policy appears to be aimed at reducing Chinese Muslims’ ties with the Uighur language and culture. Indeed, the memo states that Mandarin “should be gradually used in daily life to communicate, to integrate “de-extremification” into national language (Mandarin) teaching.” The memo draws a picture of highly controlled and secure “brainwashing detention centres,” in the Guardian’s words. “There must be full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots, ensuring that guards on duty can monitor in real time, record things in detail, and report suspicious circumstances immediately,” Zhu Hailun dictated. The memo mandates inmates’ “fixed bed position, fixed queue position, fixed classroom seat, and fixed station during skills work, and it is strictly forbidden for this to be changed.”  Staff are also obliged to “implement behavior norms” for everything from eating and sleeping to using the toilet and “closing the door.” Detainees who do not strictly adhere to the norms face consequences, according to the memo. “Increase the discipline and punishment of behavioral violations, and form a serious, standardized and orderly study and living order.” However, the document, which calls the centers’ Muslim Uighurs “students,” also called for inmates to have contact with their family outside the detention camps. Although they were not to be given cell phones, they should call family once a week “to make their family feel at ease and the students feel safe.” Staff, too, are to be careful with electronic devices and aware of the importance of “staying secret, serious political discipline and secrecy discipline.” According to the BBC, detainees can gain release only if they change their “behaviour, beliefs and language.” Even then, four Communist Party committees must review “evidence they have been transformed.” After gaining release, the Uighurs “must not leave the line of sight for one year,” the memo states. Local police and grassroots organizations should “help” and “control” newly-released Muslims to make sure “not even one person leaks out.” Morocco World News contacted the Chinese embassy in Rabat but did not receive a response by the time of publishing. The BBC reports that China’s embassies and consulates are implicated in the China Cables as helping to track Uighurs living outside China. The Chinese ambassador to the UK described the China Cables as “pure fabrication” in a press conference. He insisted that in China, “Religious freedom is truly respected.” China has imprisoned as many as 1 million Muslim Uighurs in the detention centers in the last three years. The Guardian reported that China is also destroying Muslim Uighur burial grounds and that a 2017 law bans “naming of children to exaggerate religious fervour.”

Rabat – A Muslim woman in London intervened when a man verbally attacked a Jewish family who were traveling on the London Underground. A passenger called Chris Atkin took the video documenting the moment and shared it on social media. The footage shows a man targeting two children and their father with anti-Semitic abuse.  The man was reading a passage from the Old Testament of the Bible that criticizes Jews and showing it to a young boy wearing the kippah (Jewish skull cap). When one of the passengers intervened, the man threatened him.  “You need to get out of my face or I will smack you right in your nose, man. Back up from me. I’m not no Christian pastor. Back the f**** up from me,” he said. Subsequently, the Muslim woman intervened, attempting to make him take into account children’s feelings. Around noon I witnessed appalling anti Semitic abuse towards this Jewish Family on the northern line. Fair play to other passengers who stood up to him. If you recognise the guy please report to ⁦@metpoliceuk⁩ pic.twitter.com/YxzwAnDqTJ — Chris Atkins (@scatatkins) November 22, 2019  The woman, who received praise from internet users, commented on her intervention, stating that she would love more people to intervene in such cases. “I would have loved more people to come up and say something because if everyone did, I do not think it would have escalated in the way that it did.” She added that being a mother of two, “I know what it’s like to be in that situation and I would want someone to help if I was in that situation.” The passenger who took the video said that the Muslim woman, who was wearing a Hijab, “didn’t take any s*** from him and really, really took him to task, very firmly and persistently.” “In this day and age we are told how intolerant everyone is and all religions hate each other and there you had a Muslim woman sticking up for some Jewish children,” he added. The Muslim woman, who was not a member on Twitter, created an account specifically to see the reaction of internet users when she realized how much support her actions had gained. “It was so heartwarming to see the responses and see what people were saying,” she said. “I can’t take all the credit because a lot of other people were involved. I would not hesitate to do it again.”

Rabat – The selection process for Moroccan seasonal workers hoping to be taken on for the red fruit harvest in Spain will kick off in early December. The process was due to take place in mid-November, Huelva Informacion reported. However administrative issues on the Moroccan side delayed the campaign launch. The Spanish news outlet said that the aim of delaying the process was to improve the campaign’s management. Every year hundreds of women travel from Morocco to Spain, particularly Huelva, to participate in the red fruit harvest. Several women, however, have reported sexual harassment at the hands of their Spanish employers.  Over the past two years, there have been numerous complaints of sexual abuse, exploitation, and unpaid labor. Earlier this year, several women spoke out about the alleged exploitation they experienced at Huelva’s farms. The New York Times quoted a Moroccan pregnant woman who said that her manager “sexually harassed” her when she arrived in Spain to work. She said that her manager “pressured her to have sex, promising her a better life and working conditions.” When she refused, the pregnant woman said that her manager forced her to work harder. Morocco set up a committee to deal with the recurring exploitation and sexual abuse complaints, vowing to prevent a repeat of previous scandals. About 16,500 Moroccans will participate in the upcoming campaign, the Moroccan Ministry of Employment announced earlier this month. The campaign’s Spanish organizers seek to hire 11,000 Moroccan experienced workers. The other 5,500 will be first-timers. The first group selected will travel to Spain from December 15. The second group will leave in January, while another batch will head to Spain in mid-February. A necessary requirement during the selection process is evidence from the workers that they intend to return to Morocco at the end of the season.

Rabat – Police at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca arrested an Indian traveler in possession of 4 kilograms and 615 grams of cannabis resin on Saturday, November 23. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) reported that the 32-year old Indian man was preparing to leave with the cannabis resin to an Arab country. Police found the drugs concealed in 43 capsules in the backpack of the mant during a search operation. Police put the suspect in custody to shed further light in the case, the DGSN added. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to tackle drug trafficking. Throughout the year, Morocco’s DGSN arrested several nationals from different countries in airports across the country for possessing cannabis and cocaine. One of the latest operations took place on November 18, when police arrested four Tunisian women in possession of 6.485 grams of cannabis resin at the Marrakech-Menara airport. Morocco’s DGSN seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15.

Rabat – Security services in Oujda, eastern Morocco, arrested 11 sub-Saharan nationals for their alleged involvement in  forming an undocumented migration and drug trafficking network. The judicial police in Oujda carried out the  arrest operation based on information provided by the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). During the operation, security services raided five hoses as part of the fight against irregular migration, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) reported in a statement. Police arrested 75 people from different sub-Saharan African countries, including 15 women and 6 minors. Police seized  48 bottles of alcohol and 27 grams of cannabis resin meant for retail sale, the DGSN said. Preliminary investigations identified five sub-Saharans who were active in irregular migration. They were planning to send some of the arrested migrants to Europe for money, the statement added. Six other people were involved in the smuggling of alcohol, while the other arrested people were residing in Morocco illegally. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigations. The would be migrants were subject to legal and regulatory measures relating to the residence of foreigners in Morocco, the DGSN added.

Rabat – A 2018 report on gender-based violence records nearly 12,233 cases of violence against women in 2018 against 10,959 in 2017. “Injad” or rescue and “Femmes solidaires” (Women in solidarity or female solidarity), two networks drop-in centers, recorded a notable increase in reported cases of gendered violence, according to a recent  report on gender-based violence. The report was done in collaboration with the Federation of Women’s Rights League (FLDF). The two networks presented the outcomes of the report at a recent conference held on November 22 in Rabat. The findings show that 48.95 % of the reported cases of violence were psychological, while 24.42% were socio-economic violence. Meanwhile, sexual violence and physical violence represented 4.68% and 5.7 %, respectively. The majority of women victims of violence, according to the report, were housewives with “little education.” In the report, commissions in charge of women victims of violence spoke about the challenges they face to tackle gender-based issues.  The challenges include “poor communication, the impossibility of activating the protection and prevention measures provided for by Law No. 103-13 on violence against women, and delay in enacting laws governing the said commissions,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Morocco officially enacted law 103-13 on fighting violence against women in September 2018. Women activists find the law insufficient, however. Most of them have described it as “not enough” to address Morocco’s lingering violence issues. Stephannie Willman Bordat, an international human rights lawyer, told Morocco World News that because it only “has 17 articles.” The  law “is really extremely short and it did not address any of the issues related to gender-based violence that Moroccan women and NGOs have been advocating for ten years,” she added. For Bordat,  the law is vague and does not put in place any specific measures to actually protect women subject to violence. A government-sponsored survey indicated earlier this year that 93.4% of sexual violence victims have not reported their plight to authorities.  Fear of retribution, as well as entrenched or internalized patriarchal cultural codes and conventions, the study argued, prevent many Moroccan women from opening up about their daily, intimate struggles against sex-based violence.  This implies that the number of women who have suffered gendered violence is often far above the official figures.  The findings of the government-sponsored survey indicate that domestic violence is more pervasive in urban settings, where it stands at 55.8%. The number was 51.6% for women in rural, remote zones. Activists and feminists have long called on women subject of violence to speak up and report any sort of violence.

Rabat – French-Moroccan designer Nora Sahraoui is set to bring her Moroccan flair to Miami Modest Fashion Week. The event’s organizers chose the Xela Fashion founder and CEO as creative director and lead designer at the first modest fashion show to hit the United States.  The three-day event is dedicated to promoting inclusivity and choice in the fashion industry, according to the show’s founder Norsham Mohamed-Garcia.  As the show’s creative director and lead designer, Sahraoui plans to highlight her Moroccan origins and convey her multi-cultural background.  “My Moroccan origins have always influenced me,” she told Morocco World News, adding that she draws inspiration from the colors and beading found in Moroccan attire. Sahraoui also incorporates Moroccan embroidery into her abaya and jellaba designs. “I always open my shows in the US and the UAE with the traditional Sahrawi dress to honor my parents and grandparents,” she continued. “I’m proud of my origins and the beauty of Morrocan Sahara.” “I love the idea of representing the Moroccan woman through my collections,” Sahraoui said, adding that she wants to educate Moroccan women about the industry and use her knowledge and experience in the field to contribute to Morocco’s gross domestic product (GDP). Democratizing Moroccan fashion Through her brand Xela Fashion, Sahraoui wants to expand the international perception of Moroccan fashion. “Moroccan fashion is known for the caftan, which is recognized worldwide,” she said. “I do not like to limit the Moroccan style to the caftan but to democratize it.” She does not want her styles to be exclusive to consumers of a single ethnicity, religion, or culture—her designs are made for women around the world.  Sahraoui has plans to launch collections that will attract American and international consumers. Evening dresses, spring styles, and ready-to-wear pieces with a Moroccan touch make the designs more popular, she added.   Her designs already have a far-reach, with admirers such as American actresses Holly Robinson Peete and Kelsey Scott. American models Jaslene Gonzalez and Rocsi Diaz have styled pieces from Xela, along with American TV personality and entrepreneur Lori Greiner.  Leila Lopes, the winner of Miss Universe 2011, is also a fan of Sahraoui’s creations. Bringing Modest Fashion Week to Morocco An installment of Modest Fashion Week may be on the Maghrebi horizon.  “Morocco is a very rich country with beautiful craftsmanship in textiles,” Sahraoui said. “However, there is no Modest Fashion Week presence in Morocco or in Africa.”   “In the near future, we would like to make our next stop Morocco, which will be the first African country to host an international modest fashion week.” Sahraoui has already made a name for herself on the international stage, and her major role in Miami Modest Fashion Week will only expand her reach.

Rabat – Visit any of Morocco’s rural or urban cities and you will notice the same trends in men’s fashion.  Some Moroccan men simply wear whatever fits, while others don traditional cultural or religious attire. What has become increasingly common among Moroccan men under the age of 30, however, is an eclectic mix that draws inspiration from international football stars and hip-hop artists.  These trends have come to define the Moroccan “metrosexual” look: Well-groomed beards, heavily styled hair, and carefully chosen accessories.  I, for one, commend this normalization of men putting effort into their appearance, and I want to do my part to encourage the evolution of Morocco’s fashion scene.  An often-overlooked aspect of men’s style is bags. I know how much my fellow Moroccans love their tiny Louis Vuitton and Gucci backpacks, but I believe that there is more to a stylish bag than a top-tier name brand or gaudy pattern.  Ian Taylor, a writer for the style blog Fashion Beans, argues that every occasion deserves its own bag. And he’s not wrong—your bag can really make or break your look.  Of course, I know it’s not feasible for every man to have a complete arsenal of bags. But for those who are interested in adding a new piece to your collection, let me introduce you to one of my new favorite brands: Picard. I had the chance to try some of their products over here at Morocco World News. From the top quality craftsmanship to the profound integrity of the brand, you can’t go wrong with a bag from Picard.  Picard Leather Goods Picard Leather Goods, a family-owned brand from Germany, began crafting bags in 1928. Picard’s carefully hand-crafted products are fashion-conscious and always stylish. With natural materials and meticulous craftsmanship, their unique designs are unmatched by fast-fashion giants.  Each model is devoted to a single theme, whether it be an eye-catching metallic, a playful floral print, or a shimmering satin. Picard’s contemporary designs always take on classic forms. The icing on the cake? Picard’s commitment to economic, ecological, and social sustainability.  The German fashion brand complies with the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) agreement. This means that the processed leather Picard uses is tested for its risks to human and environmental health. Additionally, Picard relies on renewable energy where possible.  Stand out with a burgundy briefcase Every working man needs a briefcase, and Picard makes some of the best on the market. You’d be surprised at how many different ways you can craft a briefcase—Picard has a huge variety of styles, each with unique stitching patterns.  This warm-toned option may push some men out of their comfort zone, but a stand-out color such as burgundy is the perfect way to spice up your drab business attire.  The best way to make this bold color business-ready is to match it to a single aspect of your outfit, such as your coat, watch, scarf, or tie.  The essential double-pocket shoulder bag The brand’s take on the latest trends in men’s fashion are wrapped in naturally beautiful leather and muted tones.  A neutral, double-pocket leather crossbody is a no-brainer for casual outings or quick business meetings. It has just enough room for your on-the-go essentials without adding unnecessary bulk to your look. A business-ready travel bag A gentleman on the go needs a classy travel bag. Whether you’re going on a business trip or heading to a conference, it’s best to avoid showing up with the old, tattered duffle you’ve had since university.  This natural calf leather option with advanced fastening features and a secure lock is perfect for weekends away from home.  So, what’s the verdict? Having a rotation of stylish bags has been associated with femininity for far too long, and there is more to men’s fashion than a basic brown or black briefcase. It’s time to democratize this accessory across all genders and encourage men to get comfortable with looking their best.  If you’re ready to elevate your casual, business, or black-tie style, check out the world of Picard. From wallets and handbags to backpacks and duffels, this German brand has something for everyone.   With handcrafted pieces in every style imaginable and a proud commitment to sustainable production methods, you can’t go wrong with Picard Leather Goods.

Stuffed batbout starts with the bread. A fluffy, pan-cooked round bread, batbout can be served alone with olive oil and honey or as the perfect partner to a tagine. However, smaller discs of batbout are perfect for stuffing.  Stuffed batbout are usually savoury, and a very common option during Ramadan. A bite size sandwich, stuffed batbout is often seen on the iftaar (the meal to break the fast) table in Moroccan homes.  Cooked vegetables, salad, tuna, and cheese are all common fillings for stuffed batbout, but today we’re going to fill the fluffy, warm bread discs with chicken. So, it is time to get cooking! Batbout is easy if you follow these simple steps.  250 grams of white flour 250 grams of wheat flour 1 tablespoon of baking yeast 1 tablespoon of sugar 1 teaspoon of salt 2 tablespoon of olive oil Enough water for kneading (about 300ml) Now for the stuffing you will need a few more things: 500 grams of chicken or turkey chest cut into small pieces 1 medium onion cut into pieces 1 small green bell pepper, diced 1 small red bell pepper, diced 1 small yellow bell pepper, diced 1 tablespoon of butter 2 tablespoon of olive oil 2 tablespoon of soy sauce Salt to taste Black pepper to taste Unsweetened yogurt ½ teaspoon salt juice from 1 lemon In a large bowl, mix the ingredients well, add water and knead for 5 to 10 minutes by hand or using a stand mixer until you get a soft and cohesive dough. Cover the dough with a clean cloth and let rest for 30 to 40 minutes. After the dough has rested and its volume doubled, make two big balls and leave them to rest for another 5 minutes. On a working surface, sprinkle some flour, take one ball, and flatten it with your hands then roll it with a rolling pin into a medium thin layer. Using a circular cookie cutter or glass, cut discs out of the flattened dough. Put the discs on a towel and cover them, then let them rise for 1 hour or more until puffy. Heat a heavy pan on a medium heat. When the pan is hot, place the batbout and cook. Cook the batbout on each side, turning several times until golden brown. Remove the cooked batbout to a tray or basket to cool. Melt butter in a skillet or pan over a low heat, add olive oil and let heat for 2 minutes. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes. Now add the peppers and cook for another 10 minutes. Add chicken, salt, black pepper, and soy sauce than mix well. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until all the ingredients are mixed together. The sauce is very easy: Mix the yogurt, salt, and lemon juice to make a sauce. Make a cut in the edge of batbout and fill it with 2 to 3 tablespoon of the stuffing and add some yogurt sauce. Fill all the batbout and serve for a perfect snack or lunch.

Moroccan spicy bread is exactly what it says on the tin. It is also simple to make and does not rely on a tagine or main dish for its strong, tangy flavor. This kind of bread works very well as an appetizer, you can dip it in olive oil or argan oil, or use it as a partner for zaalouk, or Moroccan eggplant salad. My children like to melt cheese on this lovely, spicy bread as an afternoon snack. Today I will share with you an easy and delicious way to spice up a basic bread recipe. So, let’s get cooking! 300 grams of wheat flour 150 grams of white flour 1 teaspoon of baking yeast Salt to taste Enough water for kneading 3 bell peppers (green or red) 1 small onion 1 or two chili peppers (optional) 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon of cumin1teaspoon of paprika 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (optional) 1 tablespoon of soft butter 4 tablespoon of oil In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast, and salt.

Meanwhile, grate all the vegetables finely using a grater or food processor. Strain and squeeze the grated vegetables to get rid of excess moisture. Place the grated vegetables in a bowl and add all the spices, butter, and oil. Put a pan on the stove to heat up and add some oil before baking the bread (there is a special pan for making this bread). Form small balls from the dough. On a working surface, dust some flour and pat the balls to form a thin discs. Spread some stuffing on top then cover with a second disc. Press the sides firmly then pat the disc until thin. Spray some oil on the dough and place cook well on both sides over a medium heat. This bread can also be baked in the oven, just put it on a baking sheet and let the volume to double for 20 minutes.

Rabat – Precise links between climate change and conflict are complex and difficult to pinpoint. Climate change is often labeled a “threat multiplier” in already fragile situations. Resource scarcity from shifting weather patterns and extreme climate events threaten water and food security.  Countries facing these resource problems, existing sectarian strife, and state capacity failures to support citizens in need are increasingly vulnerable to non-state armed group (NSAG) activity.  Drought accelerated Syria’s 2011 descent into civil war and pursuant ISIS occupation. Resource shortages, economic devastation, and political fragility framed “a perfect breeding ground for jihadist extremists who both benefit from livelihood insecurity and water shortages to mobilize combatants,” according to a 2016 report commissioned by the German government. Water remains a strategic weapon in this fighting today. NSAG propaganda tactics have a long history of falsely co-opting the environmental agenda. The move can garner support from people in desperate need, especially given environmental degradation. NSAGs also adopt environmentalism to incite animosity towards their enemies who contribute to climate change. Osama Bin Laden called out Western carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as unequivocal attacks on lives and livelihoods.  One such message came in a 2007 video to the American people: “The life of all mankind is in danger because of the global warming, which is largely due to emissions of the factories of the major companies; nonetheless, the representatives of those companies in the White House insist on not observing the Kyoto Accord, notwithstanding … the death and displacement of millions of people.”  The Taliban sent Afghans a social media blast to support reforestation in 2017. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid explained the rationale to a Vice reporter: “The US invasion destroyed many sectors of Afghanistan, including the environment, in a very bad way and for the long term…. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has the perfect plan for environmental protection through planting trees. Every citizen of the country should plant at least one tree a year.” In light of environmentally-destructive terrorist activity, the messages can only be seen as propagandist public relations. Al-Shabaab banned single-use plastic bags in July 2018, labeling them “a serious threat to the wellbeing of humans and animals alike.” Yet the group is known for profiting from high-polluting charcoal sales and illegal trafficking in ivory. Aside from a public relations boost, the campaign also served to save the group’s livestock tax revenues. Despite the Taliban’s calls for tree-planting, the insurgents have deforested huge swaths of Afghan land to profit from timber and charcoal sales. Again moving beyond a public relations boost to combat strategy, reforestation can help insurgents escape drones under cover of trees. Terrorist groups may call themselves eco-defenders. But, ultimately, NSAG bombs destroy infrastructure and the natural environment to a devastating degree. Climate denier US President Trump has been quick to condemn climate activism. The president is infamous for calling global warming a Chinese hoax to undermine American industry.  President Trump dismantled several Obama-era climate policies to curb fossil fuel emissions. He also announced intent to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement and disavowed the US’s 1,500-page National Climate Assessment, compiled and released by his own administration in November 2018.  Divisive campaign rhetoric labeled climate concerns as attacks on American workers and jobs. Promises to “bring back big coal” and mining jobs helped Trump win states such as West Virginia and Kentucky. Yet coal plants have continued to close under his presidency, and mining jobs have stagnated.  Energy Information Agency projections show that coal use will decline under Trump’s presidency more than it would have declined under Obama’s Clean Power Plan.  Many US states who will suffer the greatest economic losses from climate change voted for Trump in 2016, according to a January report from the Brookings Institution. Trump’s fight against climate justice is propaganda because it does not produce legitimate results in the way it produces votes.  The president’s newly appointed head of a committee aiming to discredit climate science, William Happer, has spewed climate propaganda on a staggering scale. The denier argued that carbon dioxide is important for the atmosphere and compared the climate justice movement to the Holocaust. William Happer is set to lead a Trump panel on climate change: https://t.co/KNJKpO4A4t Happer has previously argued that “the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler” pic.twitter.com/RzI4794alt — John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) February 20, 2019  There is an argument for Trump’s climate policy as criminal action. Ruth McKie, lecturer in criminology at De Montfort University, recently explained how Trump’s anti-environmental tactics mirror criminal behavior. This follows years of debate on how misrepresenting climate science could constitute criminal negligence. But does criminal negligence go so far as to sponsor terrorism? A Middle East Eye contributor shared a stronger view: “Should Trump break his country’s promise to cut greenhouse gases, he will go down as the world’s greatest single sponsor of global terrorism,” wrote CJ Werleman.  Like climate change itself, at the very least Trump’s climate policies and rhetoric serve as a threat multiplier.  Some political actors are eager to manipulate the facts about climate change. But, no matter how much propaganda is spewed, the facts remain the same. Greta Thunberg is famous for holding fast to science in her climate activism. The Swedish teen addressed a US Senate climate task force in September.  On behalf of young activists, she told the attendant lawmakers to listen to scientists in addressing a scientific issue: “Please save your praise. We don’t want it … If you want advice for what you should do, invite scientists, ask scientists for their expertise. We don’t want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.”  Thunberg’s amplified voice calls for an end to the propagandist approach to climate change. Taking a vastly different tactic than NSAG leaders or President Trump, it may be young people that give climate change the legitimate spotlight it deserves.

Casablanca – “One small step for man, one giant step for mankind.”  Fifty years since Neil Armstrong took that giant step of walking on the moon, astrophysicists, engineers, programmers, and other technocrats joined together to inspire young Moroccans to work towards more “giant leaps,” by providing new perspectives on leadership, dedication, and hard work.  The US Embassy hosted a capstone festival, Moonshot Morocco, over the weekend of November 16-18. The embassy welcomed NGOs, government agencies, and professionals to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.  The Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences served as a perfect setting for the festival and the eager university and high school students on the guest lists. The university’s fantastic facilities provided an ideal space for the speeches and workshops that took place over the weekend. The speakers presented in English, French and Darija, while English language events provided translation devices. “You have to have a reason to do something… find your why,” stressed Katie Schneider, project manager of the Inter-House team who competed in the first African Solar Decathlon.  Schneider chronicled her love of designing homes on the computer game “Sims,” and how this merged with her engineering and physics studies to inspire her to join Inter-House, an international group led by Moroccan students from Ecole National D’Architecture Marrakech and Universite Cadi Ayyad, in collaboration with American students from Colorado School of Mines.  Competing teams had 1.5 years to work on designs for a sustainable home and turn these into full scale projects in the solar village of Ben Guerir. Inter-House, who led a climate march around the solar village during their 21 day construction phase, placed first out of 20 competing teams.  At the end of her presentation, Schneider explained that the competition was not the end of the line for their project. “We’re going to have a meeting with sponsors in a couple weeks to discuss commercialization.”  The meeting will focus on strategies to make the team’s winning solar home more affordable and utilize more locally sourced materials. Through their development that has the capacity to go off the grid, sustainable living becomes reality rather than aspiration. “We will see a person on Mars in the next 8-20 years,” said NASA Jet Propulsion Lab manager Kamal Oudrhiri who presented every day of the festival. A Moroccan, he was born and raised in Fez but went on to work for NASA. Kamal explained to the audience that his original inspiration to pursue a career in science was his older brother, who had a subscription to Science &amp; Vie magazine.  Kamal also cited Amelia Earhart, Edmund Hillary, and Morocco’s Ibn Batuta as figures who inspired him to become an explorer. He explained that everyone at NASA sees themselves as explorers. Of course, students were eager to ask him questions about his journey to his current position in NASA.  “Learn from your failures… stay on course doing all you can, and you will succeed,” Kamal told the would-be space explorers.  Talking about his work on the Cassini mission to send a satellite to Saturn, Kamal explained that, “sometimes when you recalibrate and change your plans, you’ll discover new things.” When a transmitter separated from the satellite early in the mission and malfunctioned, Cassini was forced to change course and repair the transmitter before returning to its original path. In order to complete the derailed mission after having lost a valuable propellant, Kamal was forced to recalibrate and find a new solution. Using his knowledge of astrophysics, he convinced the team to harness the gravity of Venus and Jupiter as sling shots to pull Cassini towards Saturn, while saving propellant for its final maneuvers.  With this new plan, the team was not only able to reach Saturn but also analyze Venus and Jupiter along the way. Oudrhiri also narrated to a rapt audience his experiences leading landing operations for the Curiosity mission, which sent a rover to Mars, and how he designed a sky crane to drop the rover to the Martian surface safely.  He recounted the story of the SOL200 anomaly, when the main computer of the rover experienced a bug and malfunctioned, preventing the backup computer from turning on.  The team was forced to hard reset the rover and search for a weak backup signal. When recalling his team’s loss of confidence in his calculations to find the rover, Kamal reminded the audience,  “Rely on your instincts… Rely on yourself even when others doubt your work.”  With patience, the team was able to relocate the rover through following Kamal’s instructions. Oudrhiri reminded the audience that “our mindset, how we think in the face of challenge, how we limit or do not limit ourselves in the belief of what we can achieve, guides us as we forge our way in this world.” “This young generation will be the ones to make the next Glovo, Facebook or even change the world!” exclaimed Oumaima Achour, president of nonprofit Jossour Forum Des Femmes Marocaines. She was one of four female leaders showcased during this event with the goal of inspiring young women to become the change the world needs. The leaders answered questions regarding role models, grit, leadership, and making a difference. Lisette Titre-Montgomery, video game designer, represented the artistic side of the panel. She currently works at Doublefine coordinating artists and programmers for visual creation. She wants creative young people to know that they can use their artistic skills to interact with technology as “Technology includes everyone, not just coders and programmers.” “We’re special as human beings because of our brain. It’s a waste not to use your mind,” stated Kawtar Hafidi, division director of physics for the Argonne National Laboratory in the US. She grew up in the old medina of Rabat before earning her PhD in electromagnetic structure from the University of Paris-Sud. Her goal is to “give opportunities for people to do the best science,” regardless of where they were born.  “What is your personal legacy going to be?” asked Maryam Montague, founder and director of project SOAR. She talked to the audience about her humanitarian organization’s goal to uplift underprivileged girls throughout the developing world and promoted her program with a short film. While stressing the limited time people have in their lives, she exclaimed, “Everyone has great ideas, but you need the bravery and courage to act on them.” Coordinating a festival dedicated to inspiring the youth could pay off in important ways. The students who attended gained access to different organizations willing to provide opportunities in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM). They saw the speakers as role models and asked for strategies to achieve similar success.  Festival speakers emphasized the importance of pursuing knowledge and education, and, with maintained support by sponsors, governments and NGOs, Moroccan youth will continue to have access to opportunities for career development.  Although the festival was a capstone event, Moonshot Morocco hosted events throughout the year to further their initiatives of STEAM and spur collaboration between Moroccans and Americans.

Rabat – As Leganes’s and Morocco’s En-Nesyri’s beautifully curved strike made its way into the Barcelona net, barely 12 minutes into the game, the defenders’ and goalkeeper’s shocked facial expressions were the loudest compliment to the Moroccan player. “What on earth!” their chagrined faces appeared to let out. En-Nesryi’s direct opponents were angry for not stopping the action that led to the brilliant goal, and the goalkeeper seemed to be asking himself whether he could do anything to stop a strike whose angle had left him no chance, confounding even the basic goalkeeping instinct of knowing whether or when to dive or not. Their collective dejection was an accolade, and a recognition of the brilliance of a goal that may have shocked everyone, even En-Nesyri himself. On few occasions can Ter Stegen, the magisterial Barcelona goalkeeper, look irretrievably defeated, utterly powerless as he gazes, shocked, a  strike lodges itself inside his net. In defense of the brilliant German keeper, however, there was nothing he could do against that missile strike from a goal-hungry En-Nesyri. The Moroccan had been hungry to prove himself—both to club and country. Hungry to boost his standing in both of his teams. Most of all, perhaps, hungry to shine against an opposition of the caliber of a Messi-led Barcelona. Mundo Deportivo called the strike a “golazo” (or a serious goal), the Spanish superlative for goals of exquisite technique and power. That description said it all, and even though Barcelona went on to equalize and ultimately win 2-1, the goal is sure to remain one of En-Nesyri’s most remarkable footballing moments this season. The incredible strike was a confidence and morale boost that the Moroccan player really needed. Not only to establish himself in the Leganes squad as the club took one of the most dominant—if not the most dominant—forces of Spanish football, but also to fuel his own self-confidence as the Moroccan striker battles to win over the new coach and frustrated fans of an in-transition Moroccan national team.

Rabat – Morocco’s ministry for agriculture, maritime fishing, and rural development has reassured citizens that it has mobilized all the necessary rescue personnel after a medium-sized fishing trawler sank off the coast of Tan-Tan in Morocco in southwestern Morocco. In its statement, the ministry said it was mobilizing “maximum” efforts to retrieve the bodies of the trawler’s crew who are believed to have died in the tragedy. On the afternoon of November 22, two rescue ships operating near the incident area discovered two bodies, with identification later establishing that the bodies were of two of the 16 people registered to have been onboard the trawler before it left Tan Tan’s fishing port. The two bodies were then transferred to the Sidi Ifni provincial hospital in southwestern Morocco to “determine” the circumstances that led to their tragic deaths. Further searches are ongoing thanks to joint efforts from the Royal Gendarmerie and provincial maritime rescue teams, the statement noted. After identity verification, rescue operations established the presence of 11 of the initial 16-crew members have been reported to have boarded the trawler. Meanwhile, another crew member believed to have survived the tragedy, “remains unreachable,” according to authorities. Searches continue to locate crew members who have not been identified among the survivors or remain “unreachable.” “For the moment, there are several hypotheses as to the causes of this tragedy,” said the ministry, adding that only at the end of the ongoing investigations will authorities be able to put a finger on what really caused the incident. In the statement, the ministry presented its “heartfelt condolences” to the families of deceased crew members, promising to do the necessary to shed light on the tragedy. The statement noted that the Trawler left Tan Tan on Thursday evening under favorable weather conditions and did not appear to have emitted distress alert before it sank.

Rabat – Yesterday the Dutch deputy minister of justice informed the lower house that diplomatic channels  had said there was no one available from Morocco to speak to her about the repatriation of failed Moroccan asylum seekers. “That is incorrect. (…) We have no idea where this information came from. Neither our Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rabat, nor us [the Moroccan embassy] have been approached by the Dutch government for a request to talk about this,” a spokesperson of the Moroccan embassy to the Netherlands told the Dutch news outlet RTL Nieuws. Deputy Minister of Justice, Broekers-Knol, was unable to clarify the issue yesterday and referred it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The move drew criticism from other members of Dutch parliament. A miscommunication Following the weekly meeting of the council of ministers, Sigrid Kaag, minister of foreign trade and development cooperation stated, “it is out of the question that the Dutch government would not be welcomed by Morocco. It’s an agenda matter that has resulted in a misunderstanding of words,” reported by the Dutch news outlet NOS. Kaag did underline, however, that the topic is sensitive: ”The deputy minister would like to discuss the matter in person, or at a different location. Right now it is a question of finding the right moment, with the right people.” In his weekly press conference, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that the misunderstanding has been resolved but did not elaborate further, stating that “a meeting will take place as soon as possible, but international diplomacy is a poor subject for press conferences.”

Rabat – The Arab Club Championship match between Wydad Athletic Club and Raja Casablanca, known as the Casablanca derby, should be avoided by American personnel living in Morocco, according to a security alert from the US Embassy and Consulate in Morocco.  The match, scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday, November 23, is expected to draw a large turnout of fans. The US consulate alert warned of large crowds, heavy traffic, and street closures that may result in congestion and delays in the area around Casablanca’s Mohammed V Stadium and the Arab League Park tram stop.  “In the past, some fans of these teams also engaged in unruly behavior,” the alert states. “The US Mission is recommending that its personnel avoid the area.”  The alert advises American personnel to keep a low profile and be aware of their surroundings.  The feud between Wydad and Raja fans is well-known, and matches between the two popular teams have sparked violent clashes in the past.  Riots and fights have occurred at previous Casablanca derbies. On October 20, 2007, a 17-year-old Wydad fan named Hamza Eddali died during an encounter between the rival teams’ supporters. Police arrested more than 100 people after the Casablanca derby on April 18, 2010. A fight broke out between Wydad and Raja fans, injuring several people and resulting in substantial property damage.   Violent clashes between football fans, sometimes resulting in death or injury, are not uncommon in Morocco, nor are they exclusive to major matches such as the Casablanca derby.   In March 2016, two people died and 49 sustained injuries during a fight between Raja fans and Chabab Rif Al Hoceima supporters. The fans threw flares and destroyed parts of the stadium. Police arrested 31 people for acts of vandalism.   One year later, a riot broke out in the streets of Al Hoceima following a football match between the Chabab Rif Al Hoceima and Wydad Athletic Club. The crowd began looting shops, breaking out into fistfights, and overturning cars. Most recently on September 25, 2019, a row between fans killed one young fan and injured five after a match between Wydad and AS FAR Rabat. Police arrested 22 people after the clashes.

Rabat – The hearing of members of a document falsification network who police arrested earlier this year has provided some details about the business of counterfeit Moroccan documents. The group sold Moroccan IDs and passports for fees varying between $5,000 and $7,000. The issue of counterfeit Moroccan documents has been a recurring social theme in recent months and years, with the Moroccan police arresting a number of foreign suspects carrying fake Moroccan documents, mostly passports and national ID cards. In March of this year, Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) arrested five Israeli nationals for collaborating with a network who forged Moroccan IDs. A statement from Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) later indicated that two of the five suspects, believed to be the masterminds behind the document falsification network, were veteran members of transnational criminal networks involved in, among other crimes, human trafficking and drug smuggling. Police placed the five suspects into custody, pending further investigations into the case. Appearing in court this week, Moroccan Arabic news outlet Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported, one of the suspects provided further details of the affair. The suspect disclosed that he and some others were promised Moroccan citizenship and fake Moroccan IDs in return for a considerable fee. He said he met his Moroccan “contact,” Ali M., during a trip (he did not specify where) and the “contact” told him he could sell him authentic Moroccan documents for as much as $7,000. The “contact” then showed him copies of documents he had helped arrange for some of his previous “clients.” The price of the fake documents was the limit of the hearing’s revelations, however. One of the suspects who was also due to appear in court declined to speak, claiming he did not understand Arabic. Al Ahdath Al Maghribia’s report noted that the court was obliged to postpone the hearing while authorities find a qualified translator.

Rabat – This year marks exactly 50 years since Morocco and the Netherlands signed the so-called ‘recruitment treaty’, officially sealing labor migration of Moroccans to the Netherlands.  With FATIMA, Raja Felgata and Fatimzahra Baba wish to give a face to the often overlooked Dutch-Moroccan women who moved to, were born in, and are growing up in Amsterdam, by launching a new platform and movement on December 6 at the ‘Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.’ “When we talk about the migration history of Moroccans to Europe, we rarely talk about women. In the Netherlands we had the ‘guest workers’, men who first came from Morocco after the Second World War to do the dirty work in factories, shipyards and assembly lines.” Fatimzahra Baba explained to Morocco World News. “With FATIMA we want to tell the stories of the women in the Netherlands who have an individual, but shared connection with Morocco.”     We are here to stay  FATIMA sets out to inspire a new generation of Dutch-Moroccan women, but also commemorate Dutch-Moroccan women who have contributed to Dutch society over the past decades. To mark 50 years of migration, the association will put 50 photos on display at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam at the December 6 launch, showcasing the many different faces of FATIMA.  Displaying FATIMA’s many faces will serve to change the narrative within the media, as Baba explains. “FATIMA is here to say: We are here to stay and we will not be dismissed. We are fed up with the often-heard song of portraying women with a Moroccan background as oppressed and lacking self-empowerment. We don’t hide or downplay our cultural roots, we are not ashamed of who we are, but take pride in it. This is important, not just for Moroccan women but to everyone one. After all, If you don’t know where you come from, you don’t know where to go.”   Yousra Moussir, aspiring to be prime minister one day. Photo credit – Raja Felgata Female self-empowerment “We consciously thought of FATIMA as a name, since it is very traditional and in line with preconceived notions of what we can expect of women with a Moroccan background.It contributes to the self-awareness that your personal identity has many facets and is constantly evolving.”  The youngest of FATIMA’s faces is Yousra, a girl of nine who is living in Amsterdam and is one day hoping to become prime minister, and Aicha, born in Fez, is now 67 years and has made both Morocco and Amsterdam her home.  FATIMA’s members also represent different sectors of work. From neonatologists to police detectives, from elementary school teachers to trade unionists, all are active and contributing to society in visible and invisible ways.  Though FATIMA kicks-off with 50 years of migration in mind, this does not mean the grass-roots movement is there only for Dutch-Moroccan women. “The exhibition that will be unveiled soon is the start of something that we want to branch out over time. Think of workshops, events, talks and not just in the Netherlands, we are talking Marrakech, New York and other places where we hope to promote female, self-empowerment,” Baba concludes.

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, Nasser Bourita, is currently representing the North African kingdom at the Africa Investment Forum in Cairo, Egypt. The two-day event, organized by the Egyptian foreign affairs ministry under the title “Investments in Africa,” seeks to bring African countries together in thinking about the way forward for the continent as it mobilizes to be an integral part of what has been deemed the fourth industrial revolution. Investing in African connectivity and boosting intra-African exchanges or African interdependence were among the key issues discussed at the Cairo summit. As the sitting chair of the African Union, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi spoke to forum participants about the “mutual responsibility” needed to propel the continent forward. Socio-economic development on the continent, he said, is not up to African governments alone. Other actors—civil society and private (especially banking) sectors—also have an important part to play in helping the continent realize its development potential, the Egyptian president insisted. With continental cooperation as the main forum’s primary topic, the Egyptian leader also spoke about promoting Africa-Africa investments and consolidating trade and other exchanges at the continental level. The newly signed African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), he insisted, is part and parcel of the continental push towards interdependence and heightened cooperation. This year’s Africa Investment Forum comes as Morocco capitalizes on its newfound continental leadership position, constantly highlighting its continental efforts for peace, stability, and socio-economic prosperity Meeting with the Egyptian president at the forum, Bourita expressed Morocco’s readiness to cooperate with Egypt and all other African countries in order to keep peace and stability, and to boost socio-economic prosperity at the continental level. Bourita conveyed a “royal message” to the Egyptian leader, stressing King Mohammed VI’s “personal commitment” to advancing intra-African cooperation, regional security, and continental prosperity.

Fez – Abu Dhabi-based real estate developer IMKAN has announced plans to build a multi-use luxury complex on Rabat’s corniche. The project has a budget of MAD 1.5 billion ($155 million).  The complex is IMKAN’s largest project on the African continent. Known as “The Carrousel,” the project will be spread over an area of 10.5 hectares, half of which will be dedicated to green spaces. The project is set to be completed in five years.  The 10-hectare oceanfront project will include a five-star hotel with 123 rooms, conference rooms, a residential complex, and a 33,000 square meter shopping mall with a capacity of 120 units. The residential complex, called “Le Phare du Carrousel,” will be made up of luxury apartments and penthouses. The hotel, “The Carrousel Business Art,” will boast gourmet restaurants and a spa and wellness center with an ocean view. Rabat’s new dynamic destination is projected to create 1,100 direct and indirect jobs.  Designed by international and national architectural firms, the Carrousel will be only 15 minutes away from the highway.

Rabat – The recent proposal by Morocco’s Ministry of Interior to sterilize rather than shoot stray dogs did not come from nowhere. Moroccan associations have long been pursuing small-scale sterilization and vaccination campaigns, or TNR.  From Agadir’s Le coeur sur la patte to Rabat’s La Tribu des Quat’pattes and Azemmour’s ERHAM, sterilizing Morocco’s strays is not a novel concept. To an outsider, the recently announced reform seems like a no-brainer.  But the road to a country-wide sterilization campaign has been far from easy. Many NGOs in Morocco have faced resistance from local communities and regional authorities, who view sterilization as a way to uphold the stray population rather than reduce it. Although pet dogs are becoming more common in Morocco, many Moroccans see strays as a threat to humans.  Reports of vicious attacks, car accidents caused by roaming packs, and deadly rabies infections have done their part to sour the perception of stray dogs in Morocco. Certainly, the late-night barking doesn’t help, either.    While some dogs in Morocco may pose a threat to humans, killing them en masse is not the way to eliminate this threat. Every dog that is shot or poisoned will be quickly replaced by another so long as strays are able to reproduce.  The clear solution is to sterilize strays, vaccinate them against rabies, and educate Morocco’s population on the importance of animal welfare.  SFT Tangier: A force to be reckoned with Salima “Sally” Kadaoui, founder of SFT Animal Sanctuary in Tangier, launched Project Hayat in 2017 in pursuit of a childhood dream: To end animal suffering in Morocco. Project Hayat catches stray dogs in Tangier and neuters, treats, and vaccinates them. The dogs then return to their territories brandishing a yellow tag on one ear, which designates them as rabies-free. The yellow tag also serves to protect the dogs from culling. Project Hayat teaches Moroccans strategies in responding to potentially dangerous animals while calming locals’ fear of the dogs. SFT’s educational outreach program ultimately aims to encourage compassion for local animal populations, as aggression in dogs is often a response to hostile human behavior.  Project Hayat has educated more than 25,000 students—from primary school to university—about animal welfare. SFT also provides emergency veterinary services and regularly checks on its tagged dogs to see if they have any medical needs. Many of the strays have guardians that look after them, and SFT provides these guardians with dry food for the dogs.        This lovely man is so happy to have his dog back. Thank you Mariam and Maite for all the work you do for our precious dogs in Tangier. Between all of us we are without a doubt making this part of the world a better place for all, humans and animals. We are determined to make Tangier the first city rabies free in Africa. We will reach our goal with your financial support and our determination. Thank you to all of you who help support us and help us. www.sftmorocco.org A post shared by  SFT Animal Sanctuary – Tangier (@animalsanctuary_tangier) on Nov 14, 2019 at 5:22am PST      Isn’t it great our Project Hayat helps all? We protect our precious strays, we help their amazing guardians, we teach love, care and compassion towards all living beings. We simply want to make Tangier an example to follow and protect all. #endrabiesnow #GARC #SFT #dogs #eradicaterabiesnotstraydogs🐕🐕 #projecthayat #morocco #rabies www.sftmorocco.org A post shared by  SFT Animal Sanctuary – Tangier (@animalsanctuary_tangier) on Nov 6, 2019 at 5:53am PST 
The sanctuary is home to over 500 animals, including donkeys, pigs, monkeys, and birds. The organization has rehabilitated a number of disabled dogs, who can now roam happily with specially designed wheelchairs. SFT accepts volunteers year-round. The association also has fostering and adoption programs in Morocco and helps transfer dogs to new homes in Europe, the US, and Canada. SFT is one of many Moroccan animal welfare associations that have catalyzed the government’s move towards sterilization. After years of local, regional, and international pressure, the Moroccan government can finally leave behind its grim history of unethical and ineffective population control.  When the new reforms are enacted, animal rights activists like Sally will be able to rest easier at night knowing that the days of culling are over and that Morocco’s street dogs will be safe from a cruel, painful death.  You can help fund SFT Animal Sanctuary’s veterinary services, food provisions, rehabilitation efforts, and educational outreach programs here.

Rabat – Police arrested a man in Sydney, Australia, on Wednesday, November 20, after he physically assaulted a pregnant Muslim woman at a cafe. Muslim groups are calling the assault an “Islamophobic attack.” The cafe’s disturbing security footage shows the man approaching three women wearing headscarves as they sit at a table. The 43-year-old man then lunges over the table to attack a 31-year-old Muslim woman. The woman is 38 weeks pregnant, according to police.  The man repeatedly punches the woman until she falls to the ground, after which he proceeds to kick her and stomp on her head. Bystanders eventually restrain the assailant. The woman was taken to a hospital and later discharged.  Police charged the man with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and causing an affray. The justice system has denied the man bail.  “This was clearly a racist and Islamophobic attack and we expect it to be treated as such,” said the president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC).  AFIC added that witnesses heard the man yelling anti-Islamic hate speech at the victim and her friends.  While Sydney police did not explicitly classify the attack as a hate crime, they suggested that additional charges may be laid against the assailant after further investigation.

Rabat – As the US faces international backlash over its position on Israeli settlements, the UN’s Security Council has added its voice to the dissenting chorus calling out the US’s support for Israel’s “illegal” and expansionist policies in the West Bank. A recent report from AP recalled the talking points of a UNSC session on the Israel-Palestine conflict as being “dominated by negative reaction to the new American policy from countries representing all regions of the world who said all Israeli settlements are illegal under international law.” Before the UNSC meeting, the report revealed, five EU members of the UN body—Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, and Poland—jointly condemned what they described as “illegal” Israeli expansionism in the West Bank. “All settlement activity is illegal,” the statement said. It also urged Israel to “end all settlement activity,” arguing that Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories “erode the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace.” By the end of the UNSC meeting, 14 of the 15 member countries collectively condemned both Israeli settlements and the US’s standing in support of Israel. They raised concerns over Israel’s annexation of areas in the West Bank and called for more concerted efforts to ensure the rights of Palestinians in the territories. The US, which was the only UNSC member country that did not the support the body’s collective push against Israel’s presence in the West Bank, stood by its unapologetically pro-Israel stance in the lingering territorial issue. In addition to objecting to the UNSC statement on the illegality of Israeli settlements, the Trump administration suggested that the UNSC’s Israel-damning move was ultimately counterproductive. Condemnatory statements from world governments are uncalled for because, as far as the US administration is concerned, solving the deteriorating  situation in the West Bank is up to Israel and Palestine. “The U.S. government is expressing no view on the particular legal status of any individual settlement, nor are we addressing or prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank — that is for Israelis and Palestinians to decide,” said Cherith Norman Chalet, a US deputy ambassador at the UN. The US’s declining status as a world power has been a consistent topic in recent years. The sentiment has grown stronger under President Trump, with many foreign affairs specialists arguing that many foreign policy moves by the Trump presidency, including the unapologetic support for Israel, will further undermine the US’s standing as a serious and reliable interlocutor in global discussions. Meanwhile, even some pro-Israel voices have expressed cautious regret at the US’ support for Israeli settlements. In a recent article for Foreign Policy, Michael Koplow, the policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, suggested that the Trump administration’s stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict is ultimately detrimental to Israeli interests. Koplow’s idea is that if the US and its Israeli ally continue to ignore international consensus, Palestine and its allies will also see no need to abide by those same international norms. “If Israel and the United States successfully argue that international consensus on these matters is irrelevant, there will be nothing left to dissuade countries from unilaterally recognizing a sovereign state of Palestine on the 1949 armistice lines—something that Israeli governments have strenuously sought to avoid,” the article argued.

Rabat – Police in Los Angeles made a medical call for Moroccan rapper French Montana, who was rushed to hospital due to cardiac issues on Thursday, November 21. Police went to French Montana’s house in Calabasas, Los Angeles after being alerted to a possible robbery, however, instead they found the rapper in some distress, TMZ reported. Police made a medical call for French Montana, who was not feeling well. Sources close to French Montana told TMZ that the rapper was suffering “severe stomach pains, nausea and perhaps most alarmingly … an elevated heart rate.” The rapper is reportedly in good shape now. He is receiving treatment that includes “IV fluids.” TMZ said that French Montana might have been exposed to “contaminated food” as he has been traveling a lot over the last few weeks.  French Montana or  Karim Kharbouch, emigrated to the US from Rabat at age 13.  He has since become one of the biggest names in hip-hop. He has always been vocal about his Moroccan roots and Muslim upbringing, making it a focal point of his public image.

Rabat – Morocco’s continentally hailed agriculture continues to inspire many across the African continent, with several African countries pledging to export “Moroccan expertise” to enhance national output. At the Africa Agri Forum held in Libreville, Gabon, on Thursday, November 21, participants spoke generously of Morocco’s “successful” sustainable agriculture model. According to a report from MAP, the Libreville forum’s panels particularly addressed the challenge of financing small farmers and medium-sized agriculture-related companies across the continent. The main challenge of African agriculture is the lack of investments in the sector, most panelists said. While agriculture remains the principal economic sector in many countries across the continent, small farmers, who are the main drivers of the agricultural industry in Africa, do not have access to banking credits or other investments venues that may bring their business to a level where farmers can both feed their families and commercialize another part of their output. On the investments front, MAP reported, one recurring topic at the Africa Agri Forum was “Morocco’s efforts to finance agriculture projects and attract young people” to the sector. In the face of multiple challenges facing national agriculture policies on the continent, and with the challenges mostly stemming from the structural disparities governing an increasingly globalizing economy, Morocco has become a model to emulate for many African countries. El Mostafa Chehhar, a senior official at Credit Agricole du Maroc, one of the main financial pillars of Morocco’s Green Morocco plan to boost sustainable agriculture, explained the different policies, structural reforms, and investment channels Morocco has put in place to alleviate the burden of small scale, rural farmers. Sharing “Moroccan expertise” with African partners, which is often touted as part of “embracing Morocco’s African responsibility,” has been a consistent theme in policy circles in Morocco. Morocco’s OCP, a global leader in the production of fertilizers and related agricultural products, has been at the forefront of Morocco’s Africa outreach. With its OCP Africa subsidiary, created in 2016 as Morocco rose to continental prominence, the Moroccan group has struck of number of deals with many sub-Saharan countries. OCP’s African efforts include establishing fertilizer plants in some countries, accompanying some governments in their bid to adopt sound agricultural policies, and providing training and scholarships to the “future leaders of the continent.” Myriam Ben Saiad, who represented OCP at the Libreville forum, spoke about the Moroccan company’s efforts to make agriculture more appealing to Moroccan—and African—youth. Investing in sustainable agriculture, she said, is among the surest paths towards realizing Africa’s development potential. As the continent’s future leaders, she explained, young people should be at the forefront of the push for prosperity and agricultural self-sufficiency across Africa. She cited the foundation of Mohammed VI Polytechnic University as part and parcel of OCP’s readiness to play its role in radically transforming African agriculture. Morocco wants to lead the way as African governments push for policies to adapt agriculture on the continent to the challenges of a digitized, relentlessly globalizing world economy. As OCP and other Moroccan groups—especially in the banking and telecom sectors—made headway in Africa in recent years, Morocco’s African leadership ambition has not gone unnoticed. “Morocco Inc,” as one report recently put it, is becoming an indispensable player in the emergence of a “genuinely postcolonial order” in Africa. As it insistently recalls the importance of boosting intra-African exchanges, including agricultural cooperation, the report noted, Morocco’s “‘Africa Turn’… cannot be ignored if one is to understand contemporary Africa.”

Rabat – The commercial cooperation between Morocco and Turkey is set to face uncertain, rough times as Moroccan authorities argue for reviewing “some of our Free Trade Agreements.” Recent reports have indicated that Morocco has been “burdened with all sorts of Turkish products” since the 2006 trade deal between Rabat and Ankara. Turkey, meanwhile, has reportedly not held its end of the bargain, with Moroccan products said to still be facing customs obstacles when entering Turkish markets. The news came on Tuesday this week as Moulay Hafid Elalamy, the Moroccan Minister for Trade and Industry, responded to questions from both the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) and the Upper House of the Moroccan parliament. On the issue of the free trade deals Morocco has struck with a number of partners over the years, Elalamy said there was a need for a wholesale “review of all the trade agreements we have signed in recent years.” The main reason for the review, he told CGEM, is to draw a clearer picture of where Morocco stands—in terms of financial advantages and other structural benefits—with regards to its multiple deals with various trading partners. There fundamentally is a need to discard the “agreements that do not benefit our economy and our country,” the Moroccan minister is said to have insisted. Later speaking to Al Akhbar, a Moroccan Arabic news outlet, a source from the industry ministry said that the Morocco-Turkey deal has been more beneficial for the Turkish side. While various Turkish products have made their way into Moroccan markets, the reverse has not been true. According to the source, Turkey-bound Moroccan merchandises continue to face the same customs hurdles as before the establishment of the bilateral agreement between the two countries. As a result, the source added, Morocco’s trade balance with Turkey has been negatively impacted by the overflow of Turkish products in Moroccan markets.  Vis-à-vis Turkey, Morocco’s trade deficit has quadrupled since the 2006 agreement, the source noted. While the deficit was MAD 4.4 billion in 2006 (nearly $416 million), the number jumped in recent years, standing at MAD 16 billion in 2018. A 2009 study by the Moroccan minister of economy and finance had foreseen the bumps on the road of what was then seen as a promising trade agreement between Rabat and Ankara. “The coming into effect of the Free Trade Agreement with Turkey, combined with the consolidated rate of growth of the Turkish economy, should strengthen the potential for bilateral trade between Morocco and Turkey,” said the study. Turning to “potential threats” to the Morocco-Turkey commercial relations, however, it noted, “the agreement also entails some risks for the national economy, even though provisions taking into account the specifics of each economy (notably relating to farming) have been included. “The great similarity between the two economies may turn them into competitors rather than full partners. In such cases, the intended benefit may be unequally shared, with Turkish companies, ahead in terms of competitive edge and advantage, reaping greater benefit.” The news of Morocco planning to abandon its free trade deal with Turkey is set to be well received by Moroccan textile producers, who, over the years, have repeatedly expressed their discontent with what they saw as a relentless flow of Turkish products into Morocco. One big winner of the Morocco-Turkey agreement is LC Waikiki. With its high quality but affordable products, the clothing store has emerged as the go-to place for many Moroccans. Meanwhile, there have been complaints in recent months over the continued flow of Turkish textile products for endangering the entire Moroccan textile industry, and causing the loss of as many as 43,000 jobs between 2013 and 2017. In a statement earlier this year, Rakiya Eddarhem, Morocco’s Secretary of State for Foreign Trade, sounded the alarm bells regarding the future of the Moroccan textile industry. Moroccan textile producers, as Eddarhem sees it, are faced with an unsustainable and unbalanced competition from their more advanced Turkish peers. “The continuous increase in Turkish products has reduced the volume of textile sales of several producers in the local market,” he said.

Rabat – Ernesto Baez, the former leader of Colombia’s now-dissolved paramilitary group, had direct connections with members of the Polisario Front who were active in Latin America, according to one of Baez’s relatives. Baez died at the age of 64 following a heart attack on November 19. The former member of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), served 10 years in prison for committing at least 1,800 crimes of forced displacement, torture, and illegal financing. A relative of Ernesto Baez, who requested anonymity, said that the leader of the dissolved paramilitary group was in “direct and close contact with members of the Polisario who were active in Latin America,” as quoted by Sahel Intelligence. The news outlet said that the “dangerous” activities the Polisario Front members conducted with the Colombian paramilitary leader focused on “drug trafficking between America, the Sahelo-Saharan region and Europe.” The criminal acts allegedly generated millions of dollars. The Polisario Front has long been linked to criminal activities in the Sahel region, a region that top security officials have described as a fertile ground for terror groups. Moroccan officials and security officers have been calling on international allies to reinforce collaboration in order to tackle terror activities in the Sahel. Head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame deplored the situation in the Sahel and lack of cooperation between countries, saying that the lack of action provides terrorist groups a propitious climate to develop terror activities in the region. Khiame said that the Polisario Front “can also be considered as a terrorist organization in this region.” The BCIJ, according to El Khiame, managed to identify more than 100 Polisario Front members who are operating in AQIM “along which they have been involved in attacks in northern Mauritania.”

Rabat – Dutch deputy minister of justice Ankie Broekers-Knol said that she has tried and failed to talk to the Moroccan government regarding Moroccan asylum seekers in Netherland. Dutch news outlet AD reported on November 21 that the Moroccan government refused to talk to the official about failed asylum seekers from Morocco. The official wanted to ask Moroccan officials to repatriate Moroccan undocumented migrants who had failed to gain asylum in the Netherlands. Most countries across the globe, including the Netherlands and Spain, consider Morocco a politically stable country, refusing to grant asylum to Moroccan undocumented migrants. Brokers-Knol said that she wanted to speak to “the right minister (…) but the appropriate minister didn’t want to talk to me.” The official said that Morocco’s response was made through Dutch diplomatic channels. “I have been told that it would make no sense to go there, because I would be denied entrance.” The Dutch lower house discussed Morocco’s decision to refuse dialogue on failed asylum seekers, AD reported. Several MPs condemned Morocco’s alleged refusal. Quoted by Dutch News, MP Jasper van Dijk said the move shows that “Morocco is not taking the problem seriously.” Van Dijk tweeted that he is preparing a motion to discuss the visa requirements for “senior officials,” wanting to travel from Morocco to the Netherlands.  A member of the Green Party (GL) and former diplomat, Bram van Oijk also expressed his frustration. AD reported that Broker-Knol described diplomatic relations with Morocco as cold and complex. The Netherlands and Morocco have traditionally maintained stable diplomatic relations until the Netherlands’ interference in the Hirak Rif movement in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, Morocco’s foreign affairs minister summoned the Dutch ambassador to Morocco over the Netherlands’ criticism of Hirak Rif activists’ prison sentences. Morocco sentenced dozens of activists involved in unauthorized protests to prison terms ranging between 1 to 20 years. Morocco reiterated that the Hirak Rif crisis was an internal issue and not a diplomatic topic, emphasizing that Morocco does not need lessons regarding such issues.

Rabat – Thirty-eight prison directors in Morocco came to Rabat on Thursday, November 21, to receive training on new guidelines to prevent suicide, suicide atttempts, and physical harm among prisoners, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Morocco’s General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) developed the new guidelines in partnership with the Danish Institute Against Torture. Along with the training, DGAPR gave a presentation on the new guidelines. The new regulations will attempt to increase staff’s capabilities to identify at-risk inmates. Prevention measures include enhanced security for eligible prisoners. The Danish institute has been working with Morocco on the project since 2017 as part of a three-year agreement. At the presentation on Thursday, DGAPR renewed the agreement with the Danish institute “for the implementation of the project,” as MAP described it. Treatment of prisoners has been a hot topic in Morocco, especially since the widely publicized and controversial sentencing of the Hirak Rif protest leaders in June 2018. Nasser Zefzafi, a Hirak leader who received a 20-year sentence, has claimed ill treatment at the hands of authorities during his arrest. After his sentencing, he sewed his lips together in protest. Multiple Hirak activists have gone on hunger strikes since their sentencing.

Rabat – As part of its national strategy to promote renewable energy, Morocco has commissioned a new wind farm in Boujdour, southern Morocco.  The kingdom’s National Office of electricity and drinking water (ONEE) and the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), signed the Boujdour Plant building contracts with the Moroccan Nareva Holding and Italy’s Enel Green Power consortium on Tuesday, November 19, in Rabat. With construction work set to begin in 2021, the Boujdour project is the second project out of the five wind farms commissioned under the 850 MW Integrated Wind Energy Project. The project has a budget of over $1.22 billion. The wind projects are located in the city of Midelt (180 MW), Jbel Lahdid in Essaouira (200 MW), Tiskrad in Tarfaya (100 MW), and Tangier II (70 MW). The Boujdour wind farm is located about 7 kilometers northeast of the city of Boujdour (Boujdour Province), and required an investment of MAD 4 billion, said a joint statement from the ONEE and MASEN. The statement noted that the “Nareva Holding – Enel Green Power” consortium, associated with “Siemens Gamesa Renewables”, won the international call for tenders in 2016 for the development, design, financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of the 850 MW Integrated Wind Energy Project.  The 850 MW Integrated Wind Energy Project will save Morocco approximately 2,380,000 tons CO2/year, equivalent to the consumption of a city the size of Casablanca, the statement concluded. Morocco has established a national energy strategy, with the objective of reaching 52% of electricity consumption based on renewable energy by 2030. Morocco’s reliance on foreign countries for electricity reduced from 98% to 92% thanks to the national energy strategy adopted in 2009, the minister of Energy, Mining, and Sustainable Development said at a two-day press conference at Green Park Energy in Benguerir in April. The strategy seeks to reduce the country’s energy consumption levels, currently standing at an estimated at MAD 70 billion per year Morocco aims to generate 42% of its electricity from renewable energies by 2020. To achieve its high aspirations, Morocco has heavily invested in solar energy through the world’s 2nd largest solar plant, the Noor Ouarzazate project and the soon to be constructed Noor Midelt I. The Noor-Ouarzazate complex was built on an area of more than 3,000 hectares with an investment of $400 million loans from the World Bank and an additional $216 million from the Clean Technology Fund.

Rabat – Members of the Human Rights Committee at the Parliament of Spain’s autonomous Basque region, Gloria Sanchez Martin and Miren Gallastegui Oyarzaba, have “vigorously denounced” the serious human rights violations that the Polisario has committed in the Tindouf camps, Algeria, reported Morocco’s state-owned agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The MPs’ reaction came after they met with a delegation of civil society members from Moroccan Sahara on Wednesday, November 20.   The Moroccan delegation included Dahi Aguai, president of the Association of Polisario Missing Persons (APDP), and Jmaiaa Yassine, a member of the association and a victim of the Polisario’s atrocities.  Mohamed Mokhtar Al Alyin also accompanied the delegation, representing the Memory and Justice Association.  During the meeting, the delegation gave the MPs on the committee an evidence file, outlining atrocities carried out by the Polisario Front in the Tindouf camps. The file, according to MAP, included detailed information on forced disappearances, as well as photos that evidence cases of torture. Documents in the case file also listed the names of the perpetrators of human rights violations. Several Polisario leaders featured on the list. The delegation also presented their first-hand experiences of the situation on the ground, outlining serious human rights violations against the Sahrawi population, MAP reported. The testimonies from the delegation included abductions, brutal methods of torture, and the oppressive practices that the Polisario Front exercise on Sahrawis. The delegation also underlined cases of forced disappearance and missing persons.  The meeting served as an occasion for the MPs to directly learn from victims of the Polisario’s atrocities as well as to better understand the conditions of the Sahrawi people living inside the camps.  In a statement to MAP, Sanchez said that the meeting was an opportunity “to understand the realities of the lives of Sahrawis trapped in inhumane conditions in the Tindouf camps.”  She added that the meeting allowed the committee “to understand the various forms of torture [used by the Polisario] and their consequences on the lives of the victims.” The initiative, according to the government, also insists on respecting the cultural identity of the Sahrawi population while also respecting Morocco’s territorial integrity. The Basque Country gained autonomy under Article 2 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution. The region has its own Parliament, language, and distinct culture but remains under the sovereignty of Spain.

Rabat  – King Mohammed VI flew to Cote d’Ivoire on November 20 for a private trip. The King is staying in a “private property,” made available by the Cote d’Ivoirian state for “distinguished guests,” sources told Moroccan French-language news outlet Telquel. It is unlikely that King Mohammed VI met with Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara as the Ivorian leader was taking part in the G20 Compact with Africa summit in Berlin earlier this week. King Mohammed VI’s alleged private visit to Abidjan is the first of its kind since 2017 when he met with Ouattara in February and November. During the visit, both countries expressed their determination to reinforce diplomatic relations.  Trading Economics stipulates that the two countries are also partners in imports and exports. The business outlet cited data from the UN Comtrade on international trade, emphasizing that Ivorian imports from Morocco amounted to $177.28 million in 2017. Cote d’Ivoire is also among the African countries that back the UN-led political process in Western Sahara. The West African country also fully supports Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara.

Rabat – The 2018 murder of two Scandinavian tourists in Imlil in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains has impacted the country’s position on the 2019 Global Terror Index. This year’s report listed Morocco as the 92nd least safe country out of 163 countries, with a score of 1.215. In the 2018 index, Morocco ranked 132nd out of 163 countries. The Imlil murder impacted Morocco’s position in the index notably, with the country dropping 40 places on the index. Despite the change, Morocco appears among the countries with a very low impact from terrorism. “Morocco experienced one terrorist attack last year, its first since 2015. Two tourists were killed by Jihadi-inspired extremists who pledged allegiance to ISIL in a video. Previously ISIL had not been present in Morocco,” the report said. The heinous attack on the two tourists led Morocco to increase efforts to strengthen its counter-terrorism approach. Morocco’s strategy is considered as one of the strongest in the world, with Morocco dismantling several terror cells each year. In 2015, Morocco introduced the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), a unit collaborating with other security services to thwart terror threats across Morocco. Morocco also launched a policy that allowed law enforcement to apprehend ISIS fighters returning from conflict zones in Iraq and Syria for investigation and put them in custody. Terror suspects and returnees typically receive sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. Morocco also put in place a program to counter violent extremism through strict security measures, regional cooperation, intelligence sharing, the promotion of moderate Islam, and democratic reform. The program includes the “Moussalaha” or reconciliation approach. The strategy seeks to reintegrate suspects convicted of terror-related crimes into society. Morocco remains world’s counter-terror leader Despite the deterioration, Morocco remains safer than many international powers, including the US, the UK, Canada, and France. Morocco is also safer than neighboring countries in the ranking, such as Algeria (54th), and Tunisia (51st). Unlike Tunisia, and other countries that have experienced terror threats, the level of terrorism and ISIS activity in Morocco is very limited. Morocco has only experienced a few terrorist attacks. Prior to the Imlil murders, the last incident dates back to 2011 at Argana, a renowned cafe in Marrakech Jemaa El Fna square. The four main perpetrators of the Imlil murder pledged allegiance to ISIS, but the terror group has never claimed responsibility for the attacks. The Moroccan government, however, referred to the crime as a terror attack seeking to create fear and undermine Morocco’s stability and security. Morocco’s BCIJ arrested 24 individuals involved in the terror murders, sentencing three of the main perpetrators to the death penalty. The court confirmed the sentences in an appeal session in October. The Sale Court of Appeal upheld the prison terms ranging from 5 to 30 years for the other defendants and increased the jail term for one of the defendants from 15 to 20 years.

Rabat – Eighty-seven percent Moroccan school-going children from ages 11 to 17 are not engaging in enough physical exercise, according to a study published by the Lancet, a medical journal. The global average of insufficient activity among adolescents was 81% for 2016, the last year that researchers collected data. The study, “Global trends in insufficient physical activity among adolescents,” used available data sets from 146 countries to analyze how many children are not meeting recommendations for physical activity. The World Health Organization suggests children should engage in “60 min or more of daily physical activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity.” While nearly 85% of Moroccan boys were insufficiently active, just over 90% of Moroccan girls also did not engage in enough activity. In all but four countries, the study found that more boys met the activity guidelines than girls did.  Morocco was one of 27 countries where more than 90% of the girls met the criteria for being insufficiently active. The global average for insufficiently active boys was 78% and 85% for girls. The World Health Organization launched an initiative to increase physical activity in 2018 called “More Active People for a Healthier World.” The initiative targeted “a 15% relative reduction of global prevalence of insufficient physical activity by 2030 among adolescents and adults.” If the world meets the goal, less than 70% of the children in the world will be insufficiently active in 2030. However, the Lancet study found that “levels of insufficient activity among adolescents continue to be extremely high,” and the world is not on trend to meet the goal, especially for girls.  The first global estimate of children’s activity levels came in 2008, setting the inactivity rate among adolescents as 80%. The Lancet study’s major drawback is that all its data was self-reported. Yet, the researchers say, their study is evidence that “urgent scaling up of implementation of known effective policies and programmes is needed to increase activity in adolescents.” The researchers used a pooled analysis of available data sets for the study, so that they could predict the trend of children’s activity levels from 2001 to 2016.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Interior has signed an agreement with the agriculture and health sectors, along with the National Veterinarians Authority, to reduce the Kingdom’s stray dog population through sterilization rather than bullets. The new approach will sterilize and vaccinate Morocco’s stray dogs and return them to their territories. This initiative mirrors those taken by various NGOs throughout the country.  Experts have long proposed this method, known by its abbreviation TNR, as an ethical way to gradually reduce the population of stray dogs. Vaccinating Morocco’s stray dogs will effectively decrease the transmission of rabies to humans and eventually eliminate the need for costly preventative treatment, which can range from MAD 600 to MAD 800 ($60 to $80) per person.   Population control: Morocco’s bad reputation Morocco has come under fire in recent years for its method of population control. In cities around the country, Moroccan authorities have used live ammunition and poisoned food to kill stray dogs. Both methods, while inhumane in their own right, also pose a threat to humans and other animals, including household pets.    Moroccan authorities have also allegedly killed dogs that had been sterilized, vaccinated, and tagged by local NGOs. La Tribu des Quat’pattes, a Rabat-based animal shelter, reported that authorities shot several of their tagged dogs in April 2019.   Local initiatives become national reforms Some provincial governors in Morocco have signed agreements with local associations to stop the culling of strays in their respective cities. Tangier is one such example. The mayor of Tangier has collaborated with Salima Kadaoui, the founder of SFT Animal Sanctuary, to sterilize and vaccinate the city’s stray dogs.      Well, not only we had a meeting with the Mayor of Tangier but we also went to the wilaya. The wilaya is the equivalent of the local government. We had the honor to have a meeting with the general secretary. We heard the words we always have been waiting for!!! Yes we did!!! The best thing ever!! The words were: “ We are going to stop the culling of strays!!” OMG I am so so so happy… We are all all so happy. Thank you for all the wonderful humans in the world supporting our cause. My childhood dream is going to come true!!! Humans and animals living in harmony… YES Now let’s turn words into actions. There is still a long way to go. We need your support more than ever! www.sftmorocco.org A post shared by  SFT Animal Sanctuary – Tangier (@animalsanctuary_tangier) on Nov 19, 2019 at 6:00am PST  Salima “Sally” Kadaoui launched Project Hayat in 2017. The initiative aims to catch stray dogs, sterilize and vaccinate them, and then return them to their territory. The treated dogs have a yellow tag on their ear which indicates that they are rabies-free.  “We’re making huge progress, the community is accepting the dogs, it’s amazing,” she told Morocco World News last week outside of the MEDays venue in Tangier.  Local officials had asked her to remove a pack of tagged dogs from the surrounding area before the event began. However, the request had the opposite effect as it allowed new dogs to move into the area. Regardless, Sally said that she was “very, very grateful” for the communication.  In other cities lacking such cooperation between associations and the local government, authorities may have simply killed the dogs to “clean up” the area before a major event like MEDays.  In April 2018, Agadir authorities slaughtered more than 30 dogs ahead of the FIFA commission’s visit to the city. Local residents claimed that the dogs had been treated and tagged by a local association, but were killed nonetheless.    With the new initiative launched by the Ministry of Interior, tagged and untagged dogs alike will be saved from bullets and poison. By sterilizing and vaccinating Morocco’s stray dogs instead of killing them, the Kingdom will finally be able to efficiently reduce the population and eliminate the threat of rabies.

Rabat – Civil Guard in Seville, Spain, seized 5,220 kilograms of Moroccan fish. The driver, according to EFE, did not comply with provisions regulating the first sale of fishery products. The security services seized the fish from a Moroccan truck on November 6 when the driver failed to provide necessary documents for importing the fish load. The cargo included a range of merchandise, including sole, turbot, and wedge sole. Police investigated the driver, who will have to pay a fine of €3,001 or 50,000 for not complying with Royal Decree 418/2015 of May 29. This is not the first time when Spanish police have seized Moroccan fish cargo. In August in Malaga, police, and customs blocked a refrigerated truck because they suspected the driver of smuggling cannabis inside the Sardines coming from Morocco. Police lowered the temperature on the 24,000 kilograms of sardines in the truck.  The change in temperatures meant that sardines became unfit for human consumption.

Rabat – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing charges of corruption, fraud, and breach of trust, Israel’s Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced on November 21. The Israeli official was allegedly involved in three separate cases of bribery and fraud. Netanyahu accepted “gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage,” the BBC reported. The Israeli prime minister denies the allegations against him, claiming that he is the victim of a “witch hunt” by media and left-wing opponents. Netanyahu also refused to resign.

Rabat – Morocco will use “fintech,” financial technology, to give more access to financial services as part of its “financial inclusion” strategy, says central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri. At the Africa Blockchain Summit in Rabat, Jouahri noted that fintech is redefining banking services, reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP).  The summit’s focus, blockchain, refers to an encrypted list of records. The technology has been used in crypto currencies like Bitcoin and to create secure records that are unchangeable. The blockchain summit, whose participants are meeting on Thursday, November 21, is focusing on “Blockchain at the service of the financial sector.” The Bank Al-Maghrib governor hopes to use “fintech” to further Morocco’s goals of giving “all individuals and businesses a fair access to formal financial products and services … in order to promote economic and social inclusion.” Fintech includes a range of services, including mobile apps that customers can use as payment instead of cash or credit cards and innovative money transfer options from phone to phone. Jouahri outlined the two pillars of fintech as developing lower-cost models to reach underserved people and creating conditions for more non-cash payments, particularly between the state and users. Jouahri explained that fintech can help improve financial education and bring about “financial inclusion.” “Blockchain,” MAP quoted Jouahri as saying, “is by far the most disruptive technology of this decade.” Alain Pithon, secretary general of the summit’s co-host Paris Europlace, was optimistic about Morocco’s role in using technology. “Morocco has a good card to play on these technologies,” he said.

Rabat – A 17-year-old girl and her 22-year-old boyfriend may be facing jail time after photos and videos of the Moroccan couple kissing in front of a high school appeared on social media.  Gendarmes took the pair into custody in the rural Moroccan town of Tighirt, in the Sidi Ifni region 263 kilometers east of Marrakech, on Sunday, November 17.  The couple first faced backlash online for their “indecency,” especially because the girl in the photos is wearing a hijab. Now that the police are involved, the students risk prison and fines for violating Morocco’s Criminal Code.  Article 483 of the Criminal Code states that anyone who commits obscene acts in public is liable to imprisonment for up to two years, and a fine of up to MAD 500 ($50). The 17-year-old girl has been released, and the 22-year-old man remains in custody. The investigation is still ongoing under the supervision of the competent public prosecutor’s office.  The incident echoes a similar scandal from May 2018, when police in Morocco’s Guelmim Noun region arrested a young couple for kissing during Ramadan.  The arrests prompted a public outcry from human rights activists around the world. The teenagers were later acquitted by the court.

Rabat – Judicial police arrested two suspects in possession of 3 tons and 657 kilograms of cannabis resin concealed in 70 large packets on the night of Wednesday, November 20. The police seized the drugs from a vehicle in the rural town of Tazarine, 80 kilometers from Nador, Eastern Morocco, the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a statement on November 21. Police put the suspects, aged 37 and 40, in custody for further investigation to identify other possible accomplices in the case, the statement added. Judicial police carried out the operation in coordination with the General Directorate of  Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to combat drug trafficking. On September 19, governor of the judicial police Mohamed Dkhissi said that police seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15. Dkhissi added that police arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking during the same period. In October, Moroccan customs announced that they had seized a total of 8,342 kilograms of cannabis since October 22.

Rabat – Police in Tan-Tan, southern Morocco, have arrested five suspects for their involvement with a criminal network active in drug trafficking.  The arrest operation took place on Thursday, November 21, based on intelligence from the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST).  The judicial security services caught the suspects in a tent located in the desert 70 kilometers northeast of Tan-Tan on the outskirts of Oued Draa, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said. Police seized a range of weapons and other equipment during the arrest, including 2 Kalashnikovs, 48 bullets, 2 hunting rifles loaded with 8 bullets, as well as 3 large motorcycles. A preliminary investigation found that the suspects obtained Kalashnikovs and ammunition for criminal purposes including drug trafficking, with the help of Polisario Front members, the statement added. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation to determine if there are any more accomplices involved in the criminal network. The investigation also seeks to determine possible ramifications with organized crime networks in the Sahel regions, the DGSN added. Morocco has long expressed concerns over the Sahel and considers it a breeding ground for terror suspects and drug trafficking networks. The region has become a safe zone for several terror groups, including AQIM and ISIS. The head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak El Khiame, said last year that breakaway Polisario Front can also be “considered as a terrorist organization in the region.” El Khiame said that the BCIJ managed to identify more than 100 members of the Polisario Front operating in AQIM “along which they have been involved in attacks in northern Mauritania.”

Rabat – Morocco’s high-speed train is on track to having carried 3 million passengers in 2019, said the director general of the National Office of Railways (ONCF), Mohamed Rabie Khlie. Speaking at a press conference in Rabat on Wednesday, November 20, Khlie reported that the high-speed train had already carried 2.5 million passengers from January to the end of October, according to La Nouvelle Tribune. In an interview with CNN at the time of the train’s inauguration, Khlie projected 3 million passengers in the first year and, starting in 2021, 6 million annually. The high-speed train, called Al-Boraq, began running in Morocco just over one year ago. French President Emmanuel Macron travelled to Morocco to inaugurate the train with King Mohammed VI and ride in it for its maiden voyage. The train is Africa’s first high-speed rail. The train makes stops in just four stations in Casablanca, Rabat, Kenitra, and Tangier. A trip from Casablanca to Tangier on Al-Boraq takes only 2 hours and 10 minutes. With an average of 8,250 passengers per day in 2019, the train’s occupancy rate was 68% on average, Khlie said.  For comparison, France’s high-speed train from Paris to Lyon enjoys an 80% occupancy rate while Germany’s ICE high-speed train has only a 50% occupancy rate. According to the European Environment Agency, high-speed trains usually have higher occupancy rates than regular trains, which “are on average 35 % full.” Khlie estimated that one of the train’s contributions is in preventing road accidents. By passengers taking the train instead of cars or buses, Morocco likely saw 150 fewer road accidents this year, Khlie explained. Khlie said the train’s cost per kilometer is “the most competitive in the world.” ONCF sells just 15% of Al-Boraq tickets online, but the percentage has markedly increased since online sales launched. The director general reported that Al-Boraq’s revenues have covered all its operating expenses, saying, “The project is very profitable.”  Morocco borrowed heavily from France to launch the €2 billion high-speed rail project. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE also gave funding for the rail line. While Al-Boraq’s revenue is paying for its operating expenses, it is not clear if it has begun to pay back its large debts. The Moroccan government spent MAD 5.8 billion (€540 million) on the rail’s construction. The Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development also contributed MAD 1 billion (€94 million). Morocco planned the launch of Al-Boraq for December 2015. After years of delays, it made its first journey on November 15, 2018.

Rabat – Herve Renard, the former coach of the Moroccan national football team, appears to be nostalgic for the land of the Atlas Lions—particularly, its cuisine. The Frenchman shared a photo on Instagram today at Bab al Mansour, Dubai’s first gourmet Moroccan restaurant.  The restaurant is owned by Choumicha Chafay, a Moroccan producer and food connoisseur.  Choumicha is famous for her cooking programs on Morocco’s 2M, France’s CuisineTV, and Italy’s Babel TV. She has also published more than 30 successful cookbooks in Arabic and French, and runs a bimonthly magazine dedicated to Moroccan cuisine.  Renard officially resigned from his position as head coach of the Atlas Lions on July 21, 2019 after the Moroccan team’s shock exit from the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.  In a message posted to Instagram, Renard expressed his pride in being given the opportunity to serve as coach of the national team. “For me, Morocco will always remain a country with which I experienced incredible emotions.” Renard also expressed his “sincere” love and respect for the members of the national team. “It was a great adventure,” he added. Just over a month later, Renard reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia’s football federation. The former professional football player now manages the Saudi Arabian national football team.

Rabat – Morocco’s national state-owned railway company ONCF is planning to sell the luxury La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech.

Rabat – A new earthquake with a magnitude of 3.1 on the Richter scale hit the province of Midelt, central Morocco on Thursday, November 21. A statement from the National Institute of Geophysics said that the quake, whose epicenter is located in the municipality of En-Nazla, occurred at 2:16 p.m. The quake depth reached 4 kilometers, 32.581 degrees north and 4.244 west, the statement added.

Rabat – A woman has won a case against budget airline Ryanair in a Spanish court over carry-on fees. The mercantile court ruled that Ryanair could not charge a fee for a carry-on suitcase that would fit in the airplane cabin. The case became public on Wednesday, November 20, but Ryanair is reportedly sticking to its guns. While the company must return the €20 fee it charged the woman with interest, Ryanair says it will continue to charge passengers an additional fee to bring any luggage that does not fit under an airplane seat. In a statement to British news outlet the Telegraph, Ryanair said the Madrid judge “misquoted the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and misinterpreted the airlines’ commercial freedom to determine the size of their cabin baggage.” The budget airline offers cheap tickets to dozens of destinations across Europe and serves the Moroccan cities of Rabat, Agadir, Marrakech, Fez, and Essaouira. The woman who filed the case against Ryanair flew with the airline from Madrid to Brussels in January. She arrived at the airport with a carry-on bag that weighed under 10 kilograms, and the check-in staff charged her €20 for it. The passenger had spent €35.69 on her ticket, making the baggage fee more than a third of the flight’s overall cost. Ryanair started charging passengers an extra fee to bring carry-on luggage onto the plane in 2018. Ryanair’s airfare only includes one small personal item. While the court ruled in the woman’s favor, it said the inconvenience of the fee did not warrant any extra compensation from Ryanair for undue stress. The Telegraph reported that “Spanish transport regulations oblige airlines to include an allowance for cabin baggage within the air fare charged.” According to Spain’s EFE news agency, neither Ryanair nor the passenger can appeal the ruling since the deadline for an appeal has passed. Ryanair made significant revenue, £2.8 billion, from its “supplementary charges” like baggage and seat preference fees in 2018, according to an IdeaWorksCompany study. Although an Italian competition watchdog fined Ryanair millions of euros for deceptive fair advertising related to its baggage fee policy, the airline pointed out that an Italian court annulled the ruling.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Hasnaa, the sister of King Mohammed VI of Morocco, chaired a gala dinner in honor of the Alaouite Dynasty, the current Moroccan royal family. The Em Habanim Sephardic Congregation and Community Center organized the gala dinner in tribute to Morocco’s Alouite royal family, the “Dynasty of Tolerance.” Several diplomats attended the event, including Morocco’s ambassador to the US Lalla Joumala Alaoui, and the King’s roving ambassador Serge Berdugo. The organizing committee played the national anthems of both the US and Morocco at the beginning of the ceremony, followed by a proclamation to announce November 19 in Los Angeles as Morocco Day. The proclamation is in recognition of Morocco’s commitment to tolerance and peace. The text congratulates King Mohammed VI and Morocco for “their unwavering commitment to fighting against anti-Semitism in North Africa through education, and for creating an environment conducive to inclusion, tolerance, and peace,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa read the proclamation to the Moroccan princess and the attendees before handing it to her. The ceremony also marked the decoration of several businessmen, including Maurice Marciano, who received the commander insignia of the Throne Medal, or Wissam al Arch in Arabic. Jack Rimokh, Businessman, Sidney Chriqui, Founding President of the Em Habanim Congregation, and Rabbi Joshua Bitton, Spiritual Leader of the Habanim Sephardic Congregation received Wissam Al Arch of the third class (officer).  The wissam recipients expressed “great pride at being decorated” by King Mohammed VI, lauding the monarch’s crucial role in preserving Morocco’s Jewish community and heritage. Most of the businessmen to win awards were born in Morocco, including Rimokh (Fez), who founded one of the “largest” leather companies in the world, MAP said. Sidney Chriqui was born in Casablanca, while Rabbi Joshua Bittan was born in Ouazzane. During the ceremony, the organizers also presented a “Golden Book” to Lalla Hasnaa, consisting of an album of testimonies from the Moroccan Jewish community that “perpetuates Moroccan heritage” in the US. In addition to Los Angeles, several US states also celebrate Morocco day, including Washington D.C. The mayor of Washington D.C., Muriel Bowser, declared March 29 “Morocco Day” to celebrate the North African country’s culture and diversity. The American city of Alexandria, in the southern state of Virginia, also celebrates Morocco in an event sponsored by the Moroccan American Network every year on June 9.

Rabat – Two years after German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched the G20 Compact with Africa, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita told the group that Morocco is moving forward and making huge investments in Africa. The G20 Compact with Africa met in Berlin for a summit Tuesday, November 19. In a context of the compact having “fallen short of expectations” in the words of German news outlet Deutsche Welle, Bourita touted Morocco’s increased investments in Africa. “To say that Africa is a priority for my country is not just words but a reality. It is at the center of the foreign policy of the kingdom,” Bourita said, as quoted by Maghreb Arab Press. Bourita highlighted that, of African countries, Morocco invests the second most into Africa. Rather than aid, Bourita said, investment is key. He stated that the continent needs to produce its own growth instead of receiving development assistance. The G20 Compact with Africa is an initiative Merkel implemented in the wake of Europe’s refugee and migrant crisis. European countries have proposed that if the economic outlook of developing countries were brighter, fewer people would try to immigrate to Europe irregularly. The compact’s 12 African partners are primarily in Francophone North and West Africa: Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Togo, and Benin. The notable exceptions to the Francophone countries are Egypt, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Ghana. While the compact’s goal is to promote private investment in Africa to encourage economically sustainable growth, it sought to do so by encouraging countries to adopt economic reforms. In her speech at the forum, Merkel noted that German investment, and investment from other G20 countries, tends to go towards places with transparency and good governance. Bourita explained that the developed world should engage with African countries as peers. “The interest of Africa,” he said, is in “the partnership of equals and win-win solutions.”

توقيف شخصين في هذه القضية، والبحث لازال متواصلا من طرف الفرقة الوطنية للشرطة القضائية لتوقيف باقي المشتبه فيهم الرئيسيين. pic.twitter.com/R7uXxGQeNm — DGSN MAROC (@DGSN_MAROC) November 20, 2019  Security services seized other equipment during the raid, including a hunting rifle, 12 expensive hand watches, pieces of jewelry, a tear gas bottle, bank checkbooks,  and travel documents. Analysis by the scientific police laboratory in Casablanca on different samples of seized cocaine shipments confirmed that the “concentration rate [ of the drugs] ranges between 61 and 64 percent,” the DGSN statement added. Investigation showed that the seized cocaine was “ smuggled via the sea routes from a Latin American country, where it was unloaded  in Moroccan coasts.” The smugglers transported the cocaine onboard a “tourist boat before being deposited and stored in [the raided apartment] in Harhoura.” DGSN said that the national police are investigating the case under the supervision of the public prosecution. The security services put the suspects in custody for further investigation to arrest all accomplices involved in the case. From January 1 to September 15, DGSN seized 44 kilograms of cocaine. Today’s seizure is one of the largest since March, when police seized 80 kilograms of cocaine.

Rabat – Algerian army chief Gaid Salah has saluted Algerians “of all categories” who are supporting the army and the election, due to take place on December 12. “We have noted with great admiration and pride the popular wave of support spreading throughout the country, as our people, all categories of people: men, women, young, old and students took to the streets in a beautiful image of cohesiveness of the people and solidarity showing support to the Army,” Gaid Salah said on Tuesday, November 19. The de facto leader also thanked Algerians for chanting slogans, “most of which expressing a willingness to go massively to the polls on December 12, make a success of the presidential election and, consequently, contribute to the building of a promising future.” Salah’s statement comes at a sensitive time that marks continuous demonstrations and protests against the interim government and the upcoming polls. Despite calls from demonstrators for the resignation of all politicians from the era of former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, two of the five presidential candidates are former prime ministers. Both Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune have launched candidacy campaigns. The candidates began their campaigns on November 17. Friday, November 15 marked the 39th week of protests, seeking radical change and the end of the corruption and dysfunctions that characterized the country’s political regime during the Bouteflika years. The nearly 40 weeks of protests that began in February make it clear that protesters do not trust the interim government and the army to organize a fair democratic elections. Demonstrators are threatening to boycott the polls. Salah, in September, vowed that the army would not intervene in the process, threatening anyone who jeopardizes the election process.

Rabat – The Minister Delegate for the National Defense Abdellatif Loudiyi has stated that Morocco is seeking to develop its own military equipment manufacturing and maintenance capabilities, according to a report by the committee of foreign affairs and national defense. The report added that Morocco needs its arms suppliers to share their manufacturing technology and know-how in the field of military equipment with the Royal Armed Forces (FAR). The north African country also aims to start construction on weapons manufacturing plants on its own soil. Morocco is currently the second biggest arms exporter and 7th military power in Africa behind Algeria’s 2nd position, according to the 2019 military strength ranking. Algeria is the fifth largest exporter of arms in the world spending nearly three times Morocco’s annual defense budget for the military every year, according to the 2018 Trends in World Military Expenditure report. King Mohammed VI called for Morocco’s transition to military industrialization during his speech for the 63rd anniversary of FAR’s founding. The King outlined the country’s need for a transition to military industrialization, scientific research, and the self-development of military industries. In the Ministry of Defense statement, Loudiyi added that Morocco needs to collaborate, on a continental and international level, to set up scientific, technological, and engineering research programs.  He added that FAR needs to exchange experiences and skills with international partners to sustain its rapid evolution in the fields of security and defense. Morocco has modest experience in manufacturing certain arms. The Moroccan Arabic newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported on November 20 that Morocco has started manufacturing ammunition and has also set up several military equipment maintenance sites. Morocco’s ambition to develop its own defense industry is supported by several international allies, including Brazil.  During the visit of Morocco’s foreign minister to Latin America, Nasser Bourita met with his Brazilian counterpart, Ernesto Araujo, in the country’s capital.  The meeting resulted in Brazil pledging to back Morocco’s shift toward military industrialization. The two countries signed an agreement on investment cooperation and facilitation in the military industry as well as a Framework Agreement on cooperation and defense. The framework involves promoting knowledge in military science and technology and assisting Moroccan officers by conducting technology-training under the supervision of experienced Brazilian army officers. In addition to Brazil, the United Kingdom has also shown commitment to supporting Morocco’s military material manufacturing ambitions. The UK’s engagement entailed investing in a joint venture with Britain’s Chemical Military Product (CMP), a leader in the production of military explosives and related weaponry. The move is part of Morocco’s five-year plan, established in 2017, to reach “regional supremacy” through modernizing the military equipment of its army, airforce, and navy.  So far, Morocco has devoted $20 billion to the strategic objective. Morocco’s primary arms suppliers include the US with a 53% share, followed by France with 44%, and Italy with 1.4%.

Rabat – Ace Magashule, secretary-general of South Africa’s ruling party African National Congress (ANC) slammed members of his party for “disobeying his instructions” to reject Morocco’s candidacy to chair the United Cities and Local Government (UCLG). Last week in Durban, South Africa, the UCLG-World elected Morocco’s Mohamed Boudra,  mayor of the city of Al Hoceima and chairman of the Moroccan Association of Presidents of Municipal Council, as its chairman for the 2019-2022 term. Boudra’s election took place at the end of the 6th Congress of UCLG and World Summit of Local and Regional leaders in South Africa on November 11-15. In response, the secretary-general of the South African party criticized his fellow ANC members in the strongest terms. Magashule accused politicians who attended the UCLG congress of “insubordination” after they disobeyed his instructions to boycott the Moroccan candidate. He also said that the members will be subject to disciplinary action for defying ANC’s policies. The ANC historically supports the claims of breakaway group the Polisario Fronton Western Sahara. “The conduct of the ANC as an organization, and those of our members who are delegated to represent us at forums and meetings, must always be beyond reproach, principled and informed by our formal policy positions. This must be true, both nationally and internationally,” he said. South Africa is known for its steadfast position in the Western Sahara conflict. Like its ANC party,South Africa supports the Polisario Front’s independence claims, while Morocco considers its sovereignty over the region as uncompromisable. Relations between Pretoria and Rabat have fluctuated since 2004. Morocco recalled its ambassador to South Africa due to Pretoria’s decision to recognize the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). In October of this year, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa received Morocco’s new ambassador in Pretoria, Youssef Amrani, who presented his credentials to take office. Amrani is the first Moroccan ambassador to South Africa in 15 years. The new ambassador shared with Morocco World News his ambition to work to instill Morocco’s “desire to reinforce bonds of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.” With South Africa’s long standing relationship with the Polisario Front, it remains to be seen whether Amrani will be successful in convincing South Africa to shift its position on the conflict.

Rabat – Mount Toubkal in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains boasts the tallest peak in North Africa at 4,167 meters. As one of the world’s top hiking destinations, Mount Toubkal attracts hundreds of tourists to its rocky slopes every year.  While summer hikers report that the ascent is doable even for inexperienced climbers, harsh winter conditions on Mount Toubkal pose a significant challenge—and even risk—to those brave enough to face them.  Reaching the ceiling of North Africa in the winter is not for the faint of heart. But if you’re well-equipped to safely handle the challenge, here are some pictures of Mount Toubkal’s winter beauty to inspire your next adventure.      A post shared by Rebecca Vanhulle (@rebeccavanhulle) on Jun 24, 2019 at 10:41am PDT  Adventurous tourists can reach Mount Toubkal by traveling from Marrakech to the town of Imlil. Imlil is a popular starting point for the climb up Mount Toubkal. In this Amazigh village, hikers can find mountain guides to assist them on their journey.      A post shared by Dune Raider (@duneraidermorocco) on Nov 7, 2019 at 4:18am PST  On the way up, hikers often stop to marvel at the turquoise waters of Ifni Lake.  Ifni Lake is the largest lake in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains and one the highest, with an altitude of 2,295 meters.      A post shared by Yassine (@morocco200pics) on Mar 27, 2019 at 8:08am PDT  Mount Toubkal is prone to blizzards and strong winds in the winter. If you plan to overcome these conditions, make sure you pack your warmest clothes and all the necessary gear.  Winter hikers should plan to stay overnight in one of the mountain’s refuges.      A post shared by Mehdi Zohal (@mehdi.zohal) on Apr 3, 2017 at 11:06am PDT  While summiting Morocco’s Mount Toubkal during the warmer months is rewarding enough, experienced hikers with an appetite for adventure will surely enjoy the satisfaction that comes from a successful winter trek of North Africa’s highest peak.        A post shared by Gemma Lumley (@gemmalouloves) on Nov 19, 2019 at 12:28am PST

Rabat – Minister of Transport and Logistics Abdelkader Amara has revealed that a concerning number of Moroccans living in remote regions are struggling to cope with harsh cold snaps and severe weather every year.  During a recent parliament session, Amara said that around 27 regions in Morocco suffer a  significant drop in temperature. These regions are home to around 736,000 citizens. The minister shared the worrying statistics while responding to a query from Popular Movement MPs about the measures the government is taking to assist people living in inaccessible areas. He added that the number of regions affected by cold snap increased from 17 provinces to 27 regions. The minister also outlined plans to respond to the severe weather. He explained that the government has mobilized 2,480 doctors and nurses who will be dispatched to 36 medical convoys, along with 745 medical units and 465 ambulances. However, the president of the Moroccan Association of Environment and Solidarity Ambassadors, Ikbal Hafidi, does not believe that the measures are sufficient. The activist told Morocco World News that there should be a “shared responsibility” between the government and human rights activists, calling for collaboration to achieve better results in helping people in Atlas regions. “The government cannot do it all,” she said. She called on associations and organizations to help with initiatives and campaigns to assist people in faraway places “who need our help more than ever.” Hafidi said that her association, located in Temara, about 22 kilometers from Rabat, launched the “warmth” campaign to collect “second-hand clothes.” The association will distribute clothes and blankets to people living in the mountainous areas in Midelt, a region between the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountains.   The campaign, the first of its kind for the association, will start from December 13-15.  The initiative on the association’s Facebook page currently has 5,000 reactions, with more than 1,400 people interested. The association also put in place a hotline (0668-815498) for people interested in contributing clothing for children, the elderly, and people suffering from the cold snap in the region.

Rabat – In 2016, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) launched his Vision 2030 plan; a bold reset for Saudi Arabia that would remake the economy and build a new society that was more open to investment and more tolerant in its faith. Like much of the crown prince’s change agenda, it was based on a bold break from the past. The Saudi economy—long dependent on income from petroleum exports—can no longer follow the same path as it has for the past 50 years. Oil will remain king for years to come but the global march toward a post-carbon green economy is well underway. Now, at the end 2019—slightly behind schedule—the desert kingdom is unveiling the Aramco initial public offering (IPO). While the IPO is now much smaller in scope than originally planned three years ago, the Saudis steadfastly refuse to be spectators in the new economy. “As such, we will transform Aramco from an oil producing company into a global industrial conglomerate. We will transform the Public Investment Fund [PIF] into the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund,” states a quote from the deputy crown prince in the introduction to the Vision 2030 plan. Details of the IPO are just now being released, but the kingdom has been actively investing in tomorrow’s economy for several years. For example, the kingdom’s enormous Public Investment Fund (its sovereign wealth fund used for domestic and foreign investment projects) now owns 16% of Uber. Aramco is the most profitable company in the world and, according to Fitch, Aramco income accounts for roughly 70% of the kingdom’s state budget revenue. And Saudi Arabia accounts for about 16% of total global crude oil exports; the influence of Saudi Arabia on global oil prices and production is still enormous. Based on the recently released Aramco IPO prospectus, about 0.5% of total Aramco shares will be available to trade to individual investors (the company has 200 billion total ordinary shares) and an additional 1% of Aramco shares will be available to Saudi and Gulf-based institutions and sovereign wealth investment funds. The planned share value is about $8.00 per share, meaning the Saudis are seeking an Aramco market valuation of $1.6 to $1.7 trillion. Despite painstaking planning for Aramco’s debut—the Saudis have partnered with the world’s leading banks and investment houses including Citigroup, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley—plans to aggressively promote the IPO in New York, Tokyo, London and other investment centers have been scaled back. Buy local, sell local is the current priority. Aramco shares will be trading in the Saudi domestic Tadawul stock exchange next month after share orders are secured. While Aramco will welcome individual stock buyers, the real interest for Saudi leadership is institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds from foreign nations. Listing Aramco in international stock exchanges like New York, Tokyo, Singapore, or London, for example, may or may not happen in the future. The quote from American investment titan Warren Buffet about the stock market’s mental state captures the dilemma of an Aramco IPO in 2019. Tensions in the Gulf region and soft oil demand (and the new-found power of American shale oil production) are meeting youth-led change movements that seek greater transparency. There is a lot to absorb. Markets are fickle, and investors are often weary of risk even when it involves the 18th largest economy in the world. But the crown prince has pushed on with Vision 2030. Following numerous challenges and significant missteps, he is now looking to both East and West for allies and investors. Though a $1 billion deal to build Amazon data centers in the kingdom has stalled, the crown prince has successfully deepened economic and security ties with China, Russia, and Pakistan. Last year, the Saudis formalized agreements with China-based Huawei to jointly develop the kingdom’s 5G network. At a September roundtable with Reuters, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said, “We will continue to support mega projects, increase spending efficiency and empower the private sector to create jobs.” That’s a significant challenge for Saudi leadership as oil prices fall below the optimal level to fund the kingdom’s ambitious plans. Additionally, as a green era unfolds, the role of fossil fuel-based corporations in both the investment world and as a driver of national development is being scrutinized. For example, the European Investment Bank recently decided to phase out financial support for fossil fuel (coal, oil, and gas) projects by the end of 2021. In September, the Financial Times reported a “sharp rise” in the number of institutional investors shedding fossil fuel stocks. What’s that old saying? Winds do not blow as the ships wish. About 70% of Saudi Arabia’s population is under 30 years old. Hungry for change and desiring real economic opportunity at home, the images from inside the kingdom are truly dramatic: Movie cinemas, Western music star concerts, entrepreneurship, Saudi women with the freedom to drive and travel, accessible tourist visas. Transforming hometown pride and optimism into sustained investor confidence is not easy but it is a prerequisite for everything that Aramco’s IPO represents. Yet Aramco is the most profitable company on earth, with a 2018 net profit of more than $111 billion. That kind of success breeds confidence even in turbulent times. Aramco’s sheer size and production capacity make it capable of both underwriting an economic redesign and reordering an entire society. The economy redesign is already underway whether or not the Aramco IPO has the magic to genuinely stir men’s blood. As for the kingdom’s broader domestic reform project? The crown prince himself was unambiguous in his Vision 2030 plan: “We ponder what lies over the horizon rather than worrying about what could be lost.”

Rabat – The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) paid tribute to the late Moroccan intellectual and sociologist Fatima Mernissi on November 11 in Mexico City. Abdelfattah Lebbar, Morocco’s ambassador to Mexico City, attended the ceremony.  The tribute to Mernissi at UNAM will strengthen cultural and academic cooperation between Mexico and Morocco, Lebbar believes.  Mustapha Ouzir, the head of the Spanish Language and Literature Department at Mohammed V University in Rabat, also attended the ceremony. He stated that the goal of the Mexican university’s tribute to Mernissi is to encourage Mexico and Morocco to exchange experiences and collaborate in research.  Ana Buqet Corleto, director of the UNAM Center for Research and Studies on Gender Equality, said that the partnership between the two universities plays an essential role in South-South cooperation. Mernissi was born in Fez on September 27, 1940. She studied at Rabat’s Mohammed V University, Sorbonne University in Paris, and Brandeis University in Massachusetts. As an Islamic feminist, Mernissi analyzed women’s roles in Islam. She studied the relationship between Islam and democracy, the historical development of Islamic thought, and the role of gender in public and private spheres.  Mernissi, a sociologist and writer, conducted much of her fieldwork in Morocco. She produced more than a dozen well-known books in the fields of anthropology, sociology, and feminism.  Mernissi’s upbringing in Fez inspired her various works on the harem, an exclusive section of a Muslim household reserved for women.  Mernissi received the Prince of Asturias Award in 2003 for her notable achievements in the field of humanities. The following year, she received the Erasmus Prize for her exceptional contributions to culture, society, and social science. Mernissi was involved in social and political causes and dedicated her time to promoting the education of rural Moroccan women. The Moroccan intellectual died on November 30, 2015 at the age of 75. She is immortalized by her literary works on feminism and Islam, such as “Beyond the Veil,” “Dreams of Trespass,” and “Scheherazade Goes West.”

Rabat – For the last 24 hours, Moroccan social media has been buzzing after an Arab doctor shared a video denouncing Morocco’s health care system in the strongest terms. The video shows the foreign national from an unidentified Arab country speaking up against the “inferior” treatment he and his daughter experienced at a private clinic in Casablanca. He described the clinic as “unprofessional.” The man, who introduced himself as Dr. Khalid Yassine, said that he took his daughter to Clinique Jerrada Oasis in Casablanca following a fall. He gave no further details about his daughter’s condition. The man filmed himself in front of the clinic, saying that he had never thought he and his daughter would be “victims” of the “unprofessional” health sector in Morocco. He said that such institutions function without any “monitoring” and do not meet basic healthcare standards. “I am myself a doctor and I have been working in this field and I taught doctors, nurses, and technicians but I never imagined that the situation would be as unprofessional as I have seen it today.” The man said that the clinic employees asked him to pay before checking his daughter into the hospital. He said that the health institute staff asked him to pay €250 for a CT scan or computerized tomography. “I never saw something like paying more than €250 for a ct scan without having a specialist to read the report.” He said that no one at the clinic even signed the report after the scan. He said that the clinic’s staff told him that a radiologist checked the report.  “How did she check it? Did she check analyzed it from her phone?” he said angrily. The man added that nobody gave his daughter any painkillers. He went on to denounce Moroccan healthcare more widely, saying: “People’s lives are not a game (….) we have seen several similar incidents due to poor healthcare in Morocco.”   The man concluded his video with a call for the Moroccan health minister to intervene. “Who is responsible for all of that?” he asked rhetorically, emphasizing that the minister of health should be monitoring the situation. The incident comes just weeks after a video of a woman giving birth in the streets of Fez shocked Moroccan social media users. In the video, the woman can be seen giving birth in the street just outside the University Hospital of Fez. Morocco’s healthcare sector is suffering a crisis due to a lack of resources in public institutions and a lack of qualified workers.  During a recent cabinet reshuffle, Morocco’s head of government sacked former health minister Anass Doukkali. Khaled Ait Taib, a surgeon, stepped into the empty cabinet seat. The Jerrada Oasis Clinic in Casablanca did not respond to a request for comment from Morocco World News.

Rabat – The French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, will travel to Morocco on Thursday, November 21, the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs Ministry said. The ministry did not provide further information on the visit. AtlasInfo, however, said that the French Minister of Finance and Economy Bruno Le Maire will accompany Le Drian. During the visit, both officials will meet with senior Moroccan officials, including Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita and Minister of Finance and Economy Mohamed Benchaaboun. The visit comes less than six months after Le Drian’s visit to Morocco from June 7-10, when he met with Bourita. During the meeting in June, the two officials discussed bilateral and regional issues. The parties also discussed the importance of diplomatic relations between Rabat and Paris, emphasizing the need to further reinforce diplomatic relations. Le Drian spoke about the number of Moroccans who received Schengen visas to France from French consulates across Morocco in 2018, saying that 400,000 Moroccans received visas. Le Drian has echoed his country’s determination to preserve diplomatic relations with Morocco on several occasions, including last year during his meeting with Bourita in  La Celle-Saint-Cloud, west of Paris. The two countries share regular cooperation in several fields including security. Last year, Le  Drian said that the Moroccan-French security cooperation “is essential to respond to the threat posed by the return of foreign fighters from the Syrian-Iraqi” conflict zones. He also described the country as a “valuable ally in this common interest.”

Rabat – In a survey of 2,101 Moroccan companies in the formal sector, the High Commission for Planning (HCP) found that financing is a major challenge for the business climate in Morocco. The survey, published on Tuesday, November 19, looked at the demographics of businesses and their perceptions of the economic and social climate for businesses in Morocco. The questionnaire, conducted from January to July 2019, focused on companies’ experiences in the last three years. The survey looked at services, trade, industry, and construction but did not include businesses in the informal sector or in agriculture and financial services. The credit system financial institutions provide was one of the major complaints of companies in Morocco. A majority of companies, 58%, said they were “dissatisfied with the services offered by financial institutions.” Overall, companies said that restrictions on getting loans increased in the three-year period from 2016-2018. Forty percent of business leaders agreed that high interest rates were an obstacle to credit, and 34% said that the amount of collateral banks require were an obstacle. However, some Moroccan companies, 33%, “avoid the use of bank credit for religious reasons,” the HCP survey found. Traditional interpretations of Islamic Sharia law forbid the taking of interest. Morocco’s central bank authorized five banks, called “participatory banks,” to offer Sharia-compliant financial services in 2017. Although only 7% of Morocco’s companies export to other countries, 20% get foreign loans. The survey also highlighted issues companies have with hiring, confusing tax laws, and lack of transparency in government contracts. Along with difficulties getting loans, 51% complained that the business climate in Morocco suffers from lengthy legal disputes. They said that courts take too long to resolve commercial cases. The time spent waiting for courts can limit entrepreneurs. Another key finding of the survey was that 47% of companies struggled to get access to land. The government holds significant power in real estate decisions. Even more business leaders said that the high cost of energy is a limiting factor for their companies. The survey also underlined the evident importance of Morocco’s coastal cities. Most of Morocco’s businesses, 63%, lie within the economic corridor from Casablanca to Tangier. The Casablanca-Settat region has 39% of businesses, the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region 15%, and the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region 9%. Some regions also have proportionately more businesses in different sectors. While Tangier, with its economic free zones, has disproportionately more industrial businesses, Marrakech, with its voluminous tourist traffic, has disproportionately more services companies. Perhaps most surprising in an era of global connectivity was the survey’s finding that most Moroccan businesses cannot be found online. Only 31% of Moroccan companies own websites.

Rabat – Morocco’s King Mohammed VI has nominated the Moroccan ambassador to France, Chakib Benmoussa, to serve as president of the special committee in charge of the kingdom’s new development model. The royal cabinet announced the appointment on Tuesday, November 19. The cabinet announcement added that the King met with the newly nominated committee president at the royal palace in Rabat.   Benmoussa is Morocco’s ambassador to France, the diplomat presented his credentials in Paris in 2012. The new committee chair also served as Morocco’s minister of the interior before becoming the King’s representative in Paris.  The long-awaited appointment comes after King Mohammed VI called for a special committee to be set up in order to address the needs of Morocco’s growing and modernizing population. In his speech on Throne Day, July 30, King Mohammed announced that the committee would be separate from the government. King Mohammed VI stated that the committee would include representatives and experts from a range of fields and industries, including prominent Moroccans from the public and the private sectors. He added that the committee members must be highly competent and impartial in order to meet the needs of the nation that the committee aims to serve. “I should like to emphasize, in this regard, that the said committee will not serve as a second government or be a parallel official institution. This is an advisory body with a specific time-bound mission,’’ King Mohammed VI said. The special committee will, in order to meet the King’s expectations, carefully consider serious reforms in education, health, agriculture, investment, and taxation.  The committee is also expected to make suggestions on how to improve reforms the government has already put into place and increase their effectiveness. Mohammed VI wants the new committee to shake things up in Morocco and to address ongoing issues of social and economic disparity, gaps in the education and health sectors, as well as the business and investment. He believes that to fulfill this role the committee members must be critical and neutral. “I expect the committee to be totally impartial and objective, and to report on facts as they are on the ground, however harsh or painful they may be. And when proposing solutions, I want it to be daring and innovative.’’

Rabat – The Polisario Front has deplored its lack of sovereignty over the Tindouf camps it runs, where thousands of Sahrawis live. Bachir Mustapha Sayed, a senior Polisario “official” and brother of the co-founder of the Polisario Front, El Ouali Mustapha Sayed, complained about the restrictions that the Algerian government put in place in an interview with pro-Polisario news outlet ECSahraui (ECS). While Algeria describes itself as a “hospitable land” for Sahrawis, the leading member of the Polisario Front complained that the seperatist group’s leadership has no sovereignty over the Tindouf camps and almost no access to Algerian institutions, including ports and airports. “The Algerian authorities have given us access only through the port of Oran and informed us about the new measures four months ago,” Sayed said. He claimed that humanitarian caravans destined for Sahrawi camps can only “disembark in the port of Oran, and not in Ghazaouet or Mostaganem.” Sayed added that Algerian port authorities have been holding 16 vans loaded with aid for Sahrawi families for 48 days at a port in Algeria. The “official” complained that Algeria also issued in the last four months a statement that prohibits vans from traveling with packages to Sahrawi camps without a permit from the Algerian foreign affairs ministry. According to the Polisario “official,”the only association to have been granted a permit is the Sahrawi branch of the Red Crescent. Sayed explained that there is an agreement between the Red Crescent, the camp “authorities,” and the Algerian government that allows vehicles carrying aid access to Tindouf via routes approved by Algeria’s foreign ministry.  The “official” told the pro-Polisario news outlet that the aid “trucks have broken the ministry’s rules on various occasions” in order to bring packages into the camps.  Sayed’s statements comes a few months after the secretary-general of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rachid Baladhan, said that Algeria is a “hospitable land” for Sahrawis. He claimed that Algeria is opening its doors to “individuals and groups of women and men seeking freedom and dignity.” A former Polisario member and critic of both the front and Algeria, Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, condemned Baladhan’s statement. In response to the claims, Mustafa Salma argued that “Sahrawis do not have freedom in the Algerian land.” “Their freedom of movement within the Algerian territory is prohibited [unless they have] the permission of the Algerian military,” he said. The activist also spoke about restrictions on Sahrawis, emphasizing that they are denied the right to work in Algerian institutions. Several Sahrawi activists have testified to the inhumane conditions in the camps. The recent report of the United Nations Secretary-General also deplored the situation in the camps. In his report, Antonio Guterres warned the world of the alarming situation in the camps, citing malnutrition and anemia as major sources of concern. The Polisario Front has an unfriendly history with social aid directed to Sahrawis, with several allegations of embezzlement of humanitarian aid.

Rabat – Princess Lalla Hasna celebrates her birthday today, November 19. The princess is the youngest of King Mohammed VI’s three sisters. Born in 1967 to King Hassan II and Lalla Latifa Hammou, the princess fulfills her royal role in Morocco, paying particular attention to the environment. As the president of the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, Lalla Hasna’s portfolio of royal duties in 2019 included giving a speech at the UN in September. Lalla Hasna delivered her royal message to the UN Climate Action Summit. At the same time, she launched the African Youth Climate Hub, “a major initiative to mobilize the voices of the youth of southern countries in the fight against climate change,” as state-owned outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) described it. In June, the princess inaugurated the Hassan II International Environmental Training Center in Bouknadel, north of Rabat, and dedicated it to environmental awareness and education. Last week at the training center, Lalla Hasna distributed Lalla Hasna Sustainable Cast Trophies to initiatives related to ocean and coastal environmentalism. Lalla Hasna earned an honorary doctorate in 2018 from Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan as well as the GOI Peace International Award 2018 for sustainable development and peace. The princess’s activities also involve less scientific endeavors. In April, she opened the highly popular “The Colors of Impressionism: Masterpieces of the Musee d’Orsay” at the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rabat. Lalla Hasna has two daughters, Lalla Oumaima Benharbit and Lalla Oulaya Benharbit.

Rabat – Vahid Halilhodzic, the head coach of the Moroccan national team, was crystal clear about what the stakes were in today’s CAN qualifier against Burundi. “It is a must win,” he had said, his face serious, reflecting the importance of the game for his future as head coach of Morocco. He had said the same thing before the game against Mauritania, only for his lads to put on the kind of shoddy and embarrassing displays that had become typical of the Moroccan team’s performances. Their wastefulness and inefficiency in front of goals, however, is not reflective of the talents in the squad. Today’s game, the second qualifier in an E group where Morocco has been touted the favorite, sounded different. Losing or—not winning, to be more exact—meant the whole series of pre and post-match conferences about rebuilding and changing the team’s morale had so far amounted to nothing of substance. Winning, to put it as bluntly as some rumors from the Moroccan federation had it, was the only option for Halilhodzic if he wanted to continue his coaching journey with the Atlas Lions. The weight of the pressure of expectations was immediately visible in the way Morocco negotiated its way past Burundi’s stubborn defensive architecture in the first minutes of the game. Here, as much as nice passing and mid-field dominance mattered, scoring mattered more. A high stakes game So, from the very beginning, there was a sense of urgency and determination, suggesting the mental state of a group of lads putting everything on the line to redeem themselves. For Morocco, the Burundi game was more an occasion for redemption, for making up with fans who have understandably grown tired of supporting a team that took them for granted. The scoreline, 3-0, said it all. Winning was compulsory, as Halilhozic had insisted. But it was also liberatory. It came with the promise of the big start, the whole new era that Morocco’s Bosnian coach has repeatedly preached. Like against Mauritania, the playmaking in the midfield and on the flanks was close to impeccable, with Hakimi, Ziyech, and Mazraoui doing what they do best. The difference today, however, was perhaps that there was more urge and desire to go forward, to find the little cracks, the midfield-full backs-attack connections capable of making the most of the scoring chances and ball possession. Burundi, although playing on its home soil, would have understandably been content with a draw. So they defended superbly in the first quarter, frustrating Morocco’s every initiative and winning important possession in dangerous, goal-scoring situations. But the Moroccan Lions’ superior quality made things increasingly untenable for Burundi, and made the draw an impossible outcome. Breaking through Burundi’s defense By 1-0 at the 24 minute, courtesy of the brilliant Mazraoui, it was clear—or discernible—that there were goals more to come for Morocco. The Ajax man was one of the best performers in Morocco’s lifeless draw against Mauritania. But his class and hunger to prove himself with the national team made the difference against an hitherto impregnable Burundian defense. Mazraoui’s goal gave Morocco’s Lions the starter they desperately needed to emerge from a series of underwhelming displays since their humiliating CAN exit. As if the goal had freed the Lions from an unbearable load, they started overwhelming Burundi, endlessly pushing forward and forcing the East African side into making mistakes in dangerous areas. The second goal was the culmination of such pressure. Receiving a rebound in the penalty area, En-Nysri sent home Morocco’s second goal just some six minutes before the break. At 2-0, Morocco, assured of its victory, grew more confident. Meanwhile, Burundi, avoiding an emphatic Moroccan victory, which would have been humiliating in front of the home crowd, settled for yet more defense. But with Morocco’s obsession with winning back the hearts of its disheartened fans, or mending the wounds and pain of the disastrous past few months, Burundi had no chance. And so Morocco kept knocking; furious, relentless, and hungry for a third goal. That third goal came at the end, classy and beautiful, courtesy of Achraf Hakimi. The Dortmund right back is a delight to watch and, when running for possession, as he did here to score the third goal, his pace and sense of movement are shrewd, hard for the opponent to read. In fact, Hakimi usually does the thwarting, and he did so at the 82 minute, his direct opponent looking in disbelief and exasperation as the Dortmund man outpaced him to lodge home the third goal. Morocco had not won by such a margin in months. The joy and relief and delight of the Atlas Lions were easily visible at the final whistle. But this, as both Halilhodzic and his lads probably know, is barely a starting point. Emerging from the kind of frustration and pain that the Atlas Lions have inflicted on their fans requires more than an easy tour de force against an opponent of Burundi’s stature. Halilhozic, not one to mince his words, said he was “very happy” with today’s victory. But, he stressed, his team still needs to “do more” to meet the expectations and aspirations that it has set itself, that Moroccans have invested in them. Most Atlas Lions fans, had they been asked, couldn’t agree more: There is still so much more to do, much more to improve. Brilliance against mediocre opposition is not enough.

Rabat – The drivers of Marrakech’s horse-drawn carriages debuted new uniforms on Monday, November 18th, Morocco’s 64th Independence Day. The Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) and the Regional Tourism Council of Marrakech spearheaded the initiative. The wali of Marrakech, Karim Kassi-Lahlou, joined the president of the Communal Council of Marrakech, Mohamed Larbi Belkaid, at the ceremony.  Regional officials launched the uniform initiative in order to maintain a beautiful image across Marrakech and to advance the quality of transportation services for tourists.  The uniforms serve to modernize the profession and make the carriages more attractive to tourists, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported.  Marrakech’s horse carriage drivers will now sport red blazers with ornate detailing and a logo stamped on the left breast and across the upper back. The drivers’ new straw hats feature red banners with the same logo.  The initiative will also provide summer and mid-season uniforms. In addition to the uniforms, officials are enacting new measures to structure the carriage driving sector. Measures include checking the condition of the carriages daily and ensuring that the drivers are licensed. The sector’s horses are to have electronic chips as well as serial numbers. Abdellatif Abouricha, the communications manager at the Regional Council of Tourism of Marrakech, took to Facebook to laud the initiative as an impetus for development. Abouricha hopes that other actors in the tourism sector will pursue similar actions.

Rabat – A new survey by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) has found that 37% of companies in Morocco believe that the country’s education and vocational training centers do not produce enough qualified candidates for the companies’ open positions. The 2019 National Survey of Businesses, released on Tuesday, November 19, questioned 2,101 companies on their experiences and perceptions of the business climate in Morocco over the last three years. HCP did not interview informal businesses or companies in the agricultural and financial sectors. Instead, the commission surveyed organized businesses with formal accounts in the sectors of industry, commerce, services, and trade. The survey’s results revealed companies’ perceptions of recruitment challenges and a dismal outlook on taxes and government administrations. Only half of the companies said they had recruited new employees in the last three years. More than one quarter of companies said that the high cost of labor is an obstacle to their hiring more employees.  More than half of the companies in the industry sector face a lack of qualified applicants. Ninety percent of large companies—defined as having more than 200 employees and revenue of MAD 75 million or more—made new hires in the last three years. But the percentage was lower, 70%, for small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and much lower, 38%, for very small businesses (TPEs). Since TPEs—defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and revenue of less than MAD 3 million per year—make up 64% of companies, their low hiring rate is significant. SMEs account for 29% of businesses, and large businesses for 7%. HCP’s National Survey of Businesses also looked at companies’ perceptions of taxation. Ninety-five percent of companies in Morocco see taxes as preventing them from investing in their companies. Nearly as many, 88%, said they did not trust the tax administration. More than two-thirds thought taxation encourages businessmen to conduct affairs informally. More than half of companies said the taxation system was too complex, and the portion of large companies that said so was higher, 63%. Companies also complained of tax audits and having their tax burden adjusted. In just the last year, 34% of large businesses experienced a tax audit and 73% of those had their tax burden adjusted. Worryingly, 57% of businesses told HCP’s 2019 National Survey of Businesses they have “observed unethical practices in the public administration.” HCP also found that businesses have little trust in the fair tender of government contracts. A majority of SMEs that bid for contracts complained of lack of transparency in the process.  Forty-five percent of all companies argued that monopolies prevented them from getting government contracts. The vast majority, 89%, said that “payment delays after delivery of public contracts are a real obstacle to the development of the company.” Other serious obstacles, they said, are the complexity of government procedures and access to information. Men far outnumber women in business management, especially in the construction industry. Only 3% of leaders in construction are women. Services have the highest representation of women in leadership at 17%. Women lead a higher percentage, 29%, of foreign-run businesses.  HCP revealed that foreigners run 5% of the businesses in Morocco. Foreigners disproportionately lead large businesses, running 15% of them. The survey also showed that the business environment is dynamic. Most companies in Morocco are relatively young. Thirty-five percent of companies were founded in the last 10 years, 40% in the last 20 years, and 25% are older than 20 years.

Rabat – U.S. Army Africa Commanding General (AFRICOM) Major-General Roger Cloutier met with Morocco’s Major General, Inspector of Infantry, and Commander of the South Zone, Belkheir El Farouk as part of the preparations for the 2020 joint Moroccan-American military exercise, “African Lion.” The two senior military figures met on the morning of Tuesday, November 19, in the Southern Military area Command in Agadir. “African Lion,” the joint US-Morocco train exercise, is due to take place in March and April, reported Far-Maroc, a website that specializes in military news. The US major-general and his Moroccan colleague discussed the logistics of the upcoming 2020 “African Lion.” Far-Maroc reported that this year’s exercise is “expected to be the most important in the history of combined American-Moroccan military relations.” The United States Command for Africa (AFRICOM) and the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR) jointly organize “African Lion” in order to consolidate military cooperation and training and exchange experience and expertise. During the 2019 joint exercise, the two militaries used invisible laser-guided bombs, the GBU-24 Paveway III and GBU-12 Paveway II for the first time. Moroccan and US F-16 aircrafts also conducted surface attacks and large-scale operations. As well as the US and Morocco, the 2019 ”African Lion” brought military units and observers from five countries: Canada, Spain, the UK, Senegal, and Tunisia.

Rabat – Moroccan police arrested a French-Algerian national on November 17. The suspect was the subject of an arrest warrant international drug trafficking. French authorities issued an arrest warrant against the 28-year old suspect, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said. The police arrested the suspect when he was preparing to leave Morocco. Having discovered that he was the subject of a red notice from the Interpol for his involvement in an international drug trafficking network, Moroccan police stopped the suspect from leaving the country. Police put the suspect in custody in Tetouan, Northern Morocco for further investigation, pending an extradition procedure. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to combat cross-border crimes.  Morocco shares a regular partnership with France and other European countries, including in the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism. Morocco also has an Interpol office in Rabat.  The North African country has been a member of Interpol since June 17, 1957. Police arrested  420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking from January 1 to September 15, according to the DGSN.  Police also seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives,1,161,000 psychotropic pills, 44 kilograms of cocaine and 6 kilograms of heroin.

Rabat – The Royal Gendarmerie has launched a regional-scale search operation to arrest a drug dealer who was involved in a traffic accident in Casablanca.  Morocco’s gendarmerie reported to a traffic accident in Tit Mellil, on the outskirts of Casablanca on Saturday, November 16. When the officers arrived at the scene they identified one of the drivers as a nationally wanted drug dealer. According to a report in Arabic newspaper Al Akhbar, the suspect is “dangerous.” When the gendarme approached the suspect to make an arrest, the drug dealer reacted “violently,” grabbed the officer’s gun and drove away.   The Royal Gendarmerie of Rabat and the regional Gendarmerie of Casablanca have launched a regional-scale manhunt. Collaborating with the National Brigade of Judiciary Police (BNPJ), the Royal Gendarmerie deployed helicopters and set up checkpoints at the entrance of cities and towns near Casablanca. On Sunday, law enforcement found the fugitive’s car abandoned in Deroua, a town 24 kilometers south of Casablanca. During the search, the Royal Gendarmerie arrested other drug dealers in Casablanca’s surroundings, in Mediouna and Berrechid. The drug dealers are believed to have links with the fugitive.  The Royal Gendarmerie is questioning the suspects who are already in custody in order to determine the whereabouts of the armed drug dealer.

Rabat – The Jordanian government has condemned the US’s position on the Israel-Palestine dispute, particularly slamming Washington for supporting Israel’s “illegal” settlements in Palestinian territories. In a statement responding to US State Secretary Mike Pompeo’s latest statements on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, the Jordanian government said the US’s position undermines peace in the region, supports “illegal” settlements, and “kills” hopes for the two-state solution framework. “Entrenching the occupation and its injustice, and violating the resolutions of international legitimacy will not achieve peace, and will not guarantee security and stability,” said Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s Foreign Affairs Minister. “Nothing changes the illegal reality of settlements that the international community is unanimous in condemning.” The muscular response comes after Washington redoubled its support for Israel, going even as far as making an unprecedented, pro-Israel move on the sensitive issues of Jewish settlements, where the overwhelming international consensus disagrees with Israel’s expansionist tendency. In an unprecedented move on Monday, Mike Pompeo said that the US did not necessarily consider Jewish settlements as illegal, in contrast to international consensus. “Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law has not advanced the cause of peace,” Pompeo said. “The hard truth is that there will never be a judicial resolution to the conflict, and arguments about who is right and who is wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace.” Pompeo’s remarks, coupled with the Trump administration’s “Deal of the Century,” have been largely seen as a dangerous shift, with the US seen to have lost its status as a reliable broker for the most complex dispute in the Middle East. Even as previous US administrations gave a general impression of being pro-Israel, Washington followed the international consensus on topics like the “illegality” of settlements, the special status of Jerusalem, and the two-state solution. But under Trump, analysts and international observers concur that the US has moved from a relatively balanced position to a boldly pro-Israel one. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian diplomat, said the Trump administration was a “threat” to the international order. “Once again, with this announcement, the Trump administration is demonstrating the extent to which it’s threatening the international system with its unceasing attempts to replace international law with the law of the jungle,” he said. With a large section of Palestinian refugees living in Jordan and hoping for the creation of an independent Palestinian state to “go back home,” Jordan continues to push for a two-state solution. In his response to Pompeo’s remarks, Safadi, the Jordanian FM, said that Jewish settlements are not only “illegal,” they are, he insisted, a “flagrant violation” of the international norms and could have “dangerous consequences.” But Israel’s Netanyahu welcomed Trump and Pompeo’s positions on settlements and the broader Israel-Palestine dispute. “Israel is deeply grateful to President Trump, Secretary Pompeo and the entire US administration for their steadfast position supporting truth and justice, and calls upon all responsible countries who hope to advance peace to adopt a similar position,” said the Israeli Prime Minister.

Rabat – Emmanuel Macron‘s former top security aide Alexandre Benalla spoke about Morocco’s security approach during his participation at MEDays symposium in Tangier last week. Benalla, who settled in Morocco after his Elysee exit, said that Morocco is the safest country in Africa.  “In a continent that is still unstable, it is safe and stable like nowhere else,” Benalla said on Saturday, November 16 in MEDays. Benalla made his remarks at a meeting on cybersecurity, robotics and artificial intelligence. The former top aide emphasized that Morocco’s structure is “designed perfectly to ensure the safety of both tourists and citizens.” Benalla also spoke about Morocco’s security approach, a strategy based on cooperation with international partners and intelligence services. He said that Morocco’s intelligence system is “very strong.” Morocco’s security services have also adapted to developments in the field of intelligence, making it possible for Morocco to detect information and share with its partners to help avoid potential terror attacks. The former bodyguard added that Morocco is “more than reliable, and more than a strategic partner and I do not think that Western services can do without security collaboration with the US today.” Since 2015 Morocco has had a strict approach to security. In the wake of terror attacks in Casablanca and Marrakech, the north African country launched its Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), one of the much-lauded security services. The BCIJ has since dismantled dozens of terror cells linked to ISIS. Countries including Spain and the US often express satisfaction with their security collaboration with Morocco. “With its American partners and other European partners, including France, Belgium and Spain, there are no filters.” The security aide recalled Morocco’s assistance in helping other countries arrest terror suspects. In addition to its counterterrorism approach, Morocco is also active in Interpol, regularly participating in the arrest of international wanted criminals. Benalla chose to settle in Morocco after he left the Elysee. The French presidency fired the former bodyguard last year for his involvement in violent attacks against protesters in Paris.

Rabat – Tihad Athletic Sport of Casablanca, or TAS Casablanca, as the Hay Mohammadi (a Casablanca suburb) football team is known, has just made history by winning its first ever trophy. The Casablanca team beat Hassania Agadir 2-1 in the much-anticipated Throne Cup final. In a match whose outcome Moroccan sports commentators had said “was bound to be historic”—neither Hassania nor TAS had won a Throne Cup before–the gods of football sided with the lesser known of the two contenders. The Agadir team is one of the established names of the Botola (Morocco’s first football division), having won the national league twice and maintained its spot in Morocco’s division over the years. TAS, meanwhile, although one of the oldest Moroccan teams,  only had its good old days, the hectic 1970s and 1980s performances to showcase to its most faithful fan base. In the Moroccan footballing world of the past decade, TAS’s stars went from pale to totally absent, as Casablanca’s Raja and Wydad dominated Morocco’s footballing scene and even converted some—or perhaps most—TAS fans in the duo’s race for hearts and minds in Casablanca. But at the Oujda stadium today, hundreds of TAS fans from the Hay Mohammadi neighborhood came to support their “talismanic” team, travelling over 600 km to witness what could be a historic moment for the local team. The gods heard their prayers. In the end, after a tense 1-1 first half draw, a VAR intervention helped the Casablanca team secure a penalty that would allow them to send home the second, winning goal. The Agadir team’s numerous attempts at equalization failed to bear fruit, leaving TAS players, staff, and fans to celebrate the team’s first ever success story. Beyond the symbolic significance for fans and players alike, who now have something to boast with, the importance of the win is immediate. It means great openings and, if the momentum is well used, the opportunity to feature in even bigger, more historic, moments. Having stagnated in the “honorary league” (third division) for decades and only loved by a handful of fans whose sincere affection was not exactly enough to carry their team through years of sporting hardships (including humiliating defeats by superior opponents and the glamour of two other teams from the same city), the Hay Mohammadi club now knows what victory tastes like. Whether this “historic win,” as the club’s management has called it, will serve as a springboard to make other, bigger dreams possible, remains to be seen. If TAS’s last year’s transition to Botola 2 (Morocco’s second football league) announced big things to come, dreams to potentially come true, today’s victory should seal the Casablanca team’s return, however brief, to the restricted circle of Moroccan teams that have won something of significance, something tangible to take pride in. With the MAD 2.5 value of the trophy and the qualifying ticket for the African Confederation Cup, fans of the now little Hay Mohammadi team can be pardoned to dream of seeing their team become one of the big Moroccan teams, rivaling, like with the likes of Wydad and Raja, like in the good old days. Meanwhile, as TAS fans flaunted their satisfaction and delight at the final whistle in Oujda, Hassania of Agadir fans, who had Afriquia, the team’s official sponsor, put buses at their disposal for the final, looked dejected and out of place. The Agadir fans were especially angry as this was the third time that their team lost a Throne Cup final.

Rabat – The regional governor of Midelt, in Central Morocco, was visiting a local school when an earthquake disrupted his tour of the classrooms. It was the second quake to hit the region on Sunday, November 17.  2M, a Moroccan news outlet, was with the governor and Midelt’s regional director of education when tremors from the earthquake forced them to flee the school building.   A video shows dozens of people running away from the school buildings as the second earthquake hit. The footage follows police officers accompanying the officials as they hurried from the classroom. Aftershocks of the 5.3 magnitude earthquake at 9:39 a.m. earthquake likely triggered the second wave of tremors in Midelt, according to Volcano Discovery’s global earthquake monitor. The second quake at 3:39 p.m. ranked 4.3 in magnitude on the Richter scale. The two earthquakes hit several other regions across Morocco yesterday, including Fez, Azrou, and Errachidia.  At the time of writing, no major damages or casualties have been reported.

Rabat – Police at the Marrakech-Menara airport arrested four Tunisian women for drug trafficking on Monday, November 18. The suspects were accompanied by a five-year old child according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). Search operations enabled security services to seize 6.485 grams of cannabis resin that the suspects had carefully concealed in the form of platelets in their personal belts. The suspects, aged between 19 and 45, were preparing to leave Morocco on a flight heading to Tunisia. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation to determine the circumstances of the case. Today’s arrest followed a similar operation at Casablanca’s international airport, where police arrested two Tunisian women in possession of nearly 12 kilograms of cannabis resin on November 8. The operation is part of Morocco’s strategy to combat drug trafficking and cross border crimes. Morocco’s DGSN seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15.

Rabat – The US is currently holding 100,000 children in “migration related detention,” independent expert Manfred Nowak said on Monday, November 18. Governments worldwide are holding 330,000 children in detention centers. Nowak, who authored the United Nations Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty, spoke at a news briefing on the treatment of children that he said violates international law. Over 7 million children and adolescents under 18 are currently in police custody, jail, and immigrant detention centers.  Children who attempt to migrate have also been an issue between Morocco and Spain. Unaccompanied Moroccan minors who crossed the border into the Spanish enclave of Ceuta overwhelmed migrant centers there last year. In 2017, just over 800 unaccompanied minors arrived in Ceuta, but the number swelled to 3,344 in 2018. Most of the minors making the trip were from northern Morocco. On Saturday, November 16, the Association of Moroccan Lawyers Practicing Abroad met in Barcelona to discuss how to defend the rights of unaccompanied minors. They emphasized the need to protect minors’ rights in line with international laws and conventions. Nowak’s study, submitted to the UN in July, recommended that countries “prohibit and end all forms of migration-related detention of children and their families.” The study further argued “Unaccompanied children should be provided with alternative care and accommodation.” US President Donald Trump came under fire for his administration’s handling of migrants and asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border, particularly its separation of children from parents. Nowak decried the policy in his briefing. “The way they were separating infants from families only in order to deter irregular migration from Central America to the United States to me constitutes inhuman treatment.”

Rabat – The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has strongly denounced a serious Israeli attack on a Palestinian journalist in Surif, near  Hebron on Friday, November 15. The federation recalled that Palestinian photojournalist Moath Amarneh lost sight in his left eye after sustaining serious injuries after an Israeli soldier shot him with a rubber bullet. The photojournalist was covering a protest against land confiscation. Dozens of Amarneh’s colleagues protested the attack on the photojournalist on Sunday, November 17. The journalists rallied with one eye covered to show solidarity with their colleagues. IFC secretary general Anthony Bellanger said, “Once again, the IFJ deplores the attacks on Palestinian journalists by the Israeli military.” Prior to the IFJ statement, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate (PSJ)  strongly condemned “tThis deliberate targeting” on the photojournalist who was wearing a bullet-proof vest clearly labelled “Press.” In a statement the PSJ also called on “international institutions to act quickly to stop this violence against the press in Palestine.” Speaking about the incident, the 35-year old photojournalist told AFP that he  was “standing to the side wearing a flak jacket with press marking and a helmet.” He said: “Suddenly I felt something hit my eye, I thought it was a rubber bullet or a stone. I put my hand to my eye and found nothing.” He added that he couldn’t see and his “eye was completely gone.” Israeli forces have killed at least 37 people in Gaza since Tuesday, November 12. At least 100 more Palestinians have sustained injuries.

Rabat – Recent reports indicate that Morocco is set to increase its defense budget by nearly 30% for next year. Explaining the reasons behind the increase in a recent parliamentary session, Morocco’s Defense Minister said that the move is partly to cover the costs of compulsory military service for 2020. Of the MAD 45.438 billion budget projected for next year (up from MAD 35.155 billion in 2019), MAD 700 million will be exclusively allocated to the 2020 military service. The minister said that MAD 61 million will be spent on logistics (medication and transportation), while MAD 288 million is set to be spent on building or rehabilitating training and housing facilities. The lion’s share of the MAD 700 million (421) will serve to pay conscripts’ monthly wages, according to the ministry. The return of national service sparked controversies in some of Morocco’s intellectual circles. A major talking point among critics was that it would be better to invest in raising the standards of Moroccan education at universities or high schools, or do just about anything that could “emancipate” young Moroccans. However, figures from the defense ministry and the command of the Royal Armed Forces (FAR) told a different story, with waves of enthusiastic and patriotic youth enlisting for the 2020 military service. 133,820 young Moroccans, among them 13614 female candidates, enlisted. Only 15,000 (1100 women) made it to the final list, according to FAR. While FAR figures show female candidates were as enthusiastic as their male counterparts, the one-year experience is only “compulsory” for Moroccan men.

Rabat – As severe cold weather hits some of Morocco’s most inaccessible regions, including Al Hoceima province, security services and government representatives have put together an action plan to tackle the impacts of the cold weather on the vulnerable population.  Last week, the governor of the Al Hoceima province, Farid Chourak, chaired a meeting as part of the implementation of the high instructions from King Mohammed VI to give “special attention to citizens in mountainous areas during periods of snowfall, rain and cold,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported.  Under Chourak’s leadership, the local authorities set out  precautionary measures, including the distribution of 1,300 furnaces to the inhabitants of the mountainous areas, as well as firewood for schools.  The measures also includes the distribution of blankets and heating equipment, as well as the mobilization of an awareness campaign to encourage families to take pregnant women to maternity hospitals. Al Hoceima province experienced a wave of protests in 2016 and 2017, with protesters calling for the end of marginalization and social disparities in the region.  Lack of hospitals and universities brought thousands of protesters in the street for  social equality. Since then, the government pledged to take action to ease pressure on citizens and to develop eco-socio projects for the benefit of citizens in the region. A command committee under the supervision of the governor is on standby to respond to citizens’ needs and provide emergency aid. The committee consists of security services and agents from the Ministry of Equipment. Residents in the area can call a hotline number (0539982018) if in need of assistance. The phone line will be open to calls all day.

Rabat – A van loaded with 52 sub-Saharan African passengers rammed a barrier at the Moroccan border with Ceuta between 2 and 3 a.m. on Monday, November 18, according to the Spanish Civil Guard. The van’s front showed the impact of the crash, but none of the passengers sustained serious injuries, El Faro de Ceuta reported. The passengers included 34 men, 16 women, a 6-year-old, and a 5-month-old, mostly from Guinea. A few of the individuals are from Cote d’Ivoire and the Congo. The driver, a Moroccan citizen in his late thirties who lives in France, drove toward the border at full speed, crashing through the barrier.  Once on the Ceuta side, the passengers spilled out of the van and ran. The Civil Guard collected the passengers one by one and brought them back to the border. The police also arrested the driver. Volunteers with the Red Cross set up a temporary station at the border to assess the migrants before Spanish authorities transported them to the Superior Police Headquarters. Four of the migrants went to Ceuta’s University Hospital for minor injuries: One had an asthma attack and others had body aches from the crash. According to El Faro, the van broke a barrier that the Spanish border force had installed only one month ago, on October 17. The Spanish Ministry of the Interior has documented 1,163 arrivals by irregular immigrants into Ceuta so far this year. Many migrants cross into Ceuta by climbing the fence marking the border. Some migrants swim into Ceuta from Moroccan beaches. A few have hidden in vehicles entering the city.

Rabat – November 18 is a national holiday in Morocco, marking the day that the nation celebrates its independence from colonial rule every year.   To celebrate the anniversary, Google has changed its official logo to a “doodle” featuring the Moroccan flag waving high in the sky on its search engine home page. Until the early 1960s, Morocco celebrated Independence Day on March 2. The kingdom gained independence from French colonial rule on March 2, 1956, and from Spain on April 7 of the same year.  However, just two days after his return from forced exile on November 18, 1955, King Mohammed V delivered a speech from Rabat announcing the era of Spanish and French colonialism was coming to an end.   When King Mohammed’s son, King Hassan II, inherited the throne in 1961, he officially changed the date of Morocco’s Independence Day as a tribute to his father. Google’s celebration of Moroccan Independence Day has become a yearly tradition. Google “doodles” are decorative changes made to the Google logo to celebrate holidays, anniversaries, and the lives of famous artists, scientists, and athletes. The Google logo that appears on search pages varies depending on IP address and geographical location.

Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani has criticized organizations that are campaigning for the decriminalization of abortion and other individual rights that Islamic law considers “haram,” or forbidden. At a meeting in Marrakech on Saturday, November 16, El Othmani said that increasing women’s participation in politics does not necessarily mean “moving away from religious givens by banning the ‘halal’ and authorizing the ‘haram.’” The meeting launched the “Tamkin” plan of the women’s organization in the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD). The plan seeks higher representation of women within the party. El Othmani addressed organizations that want consensual sex between adults and abortion—criminal acts under the Moroccan Penal Code—to be legal. Departing from religious givens is a red line, El Othmani said. In an interview this summer with Jeune Afrique, El Othmani explained that the PJD is not Islamist, but it is fundamentally “based on Islamic principles.”  On Saturday, he emphasized that Islamic principles guide the Moroccan government. There is space for understanding or interpreting the principles within an innovative framework, however. In a speech in 2003, King Mohammed VI affirmed the role of Islamic principles in Morocco, saying he could not prohibit what God has authorized or sanction what God has forbidden. “We understand Islamic principles according to an approach that reconciles religion, modernity, and democracy,” El Othmani told Jeune Afrique. He continued, “Moroccan society is currently going through a difficult transition phase between tradition and modernity…. The problem is that traditional values ​​are crumbling.” El Othmani’s remarks in Marrakech come in the wake of several protests calling for the decriminalization of consensual sex between adults as well as abortion. The protests emerged during the highly publicized trial of journalist Hajar Raissouni, who received a prison sentence for having an abortion. Police had arrested Raissouni, her fiance, and her doctor when she was leaving a gynecology clinic. Prosecutors charged the couple with having sex outside of marriage and getting an abortion. Within a few weeks of her sentencing, the King pardoned Raissouni. At the same time, activists questioned if Raissouni’s arrest was politically motivated because she is a journalist and her uncle wrote critically of the government. In 2018, Moroccan police arrested 14,503 individuals for engaging in sex outside of marriage. Police also arrested 3,048 people for committing adultery but made only 73 arrests for people receiving or performing abortions. For El Othmani, the solution to questions of morality and criminality lies in reinforcing “the values ​​necessary for a successful transition to modernity while respecting one’s own traditions and culture.”

Rabat – Morocco’s government is stafisted with its leading role in promoting peace in the Central African Republic (CAR). Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation, and Moroccans residing abroad, Nasser Bourita, has said that Morocco is currently the peacekeeping mission’s “most committed” African partner. Speaking to the press in Rabat on Friday, November 15, following a meeting with the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for the Central African Republic (CAR) and Head of the UN Stabilization Mission in CAR (MINUSCA), Mankeur Ndiaye, Bourita cited Morocco’s peacekeeping and security efforts across the African continent and in UN-led coalitions.  “Morocco pledges its commitment to the efforts of the international community to maintain and consolidate peace, so that the kingdom is today the most committed African partner for peace,” he said. Ndiaye visited Morocco as part of the kingdom’s “multifaceted support” in CAR. Bourita added that Morocco has deployed 762 blue helmets to support MINUSCA. Praising Moroccan Blue helmets on duty in CAR, the Moroccan FM highlighted their success in establishing bonds of trust with local people “regardless of their religious affiliations.” He added that Morocco is not only providing support at the UN level but also at the level of theAfrican Union, recalling Morocco’s membership of the UN Peace and Security Council. Morocco has always been on the side of its “sister” country, CAR, and maintains a “dense and varied cooperation relationship” with the African country, the Moroccan minister added. Ndiaye’s visit comes just a day after MINUSCA paid tribute to three peacekeepers who lost their lives while on duty. The list of the peacekeepers included Moroccan blue helmet Saad Zghari. Zghari was part of the 9th Armored Squadron Group of the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR). He joined the MINUSCA forces on May 24, 2018. The Moroccan soldier died on June 19, 2019, aged just 24. “His contingent commander remembers him as a brilliant soldier, very disciplined, respectful and loyal to his duties to protect civilians,”  MINUSCA said in a statement. Since the founding of the UN, Morocco has sent 60,000 soldiers on peacekeeping missions in 17 operations around the world.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) arrested two ISIS-linked suspects in Rabat on November 17. The suspects, aged 30 and 34, had plotted to carry out terror attacks across Morocco, a statement from the BCIJ said. An investigation into the two suspects revealed that they were promoting ISIS ideology. During the arrest operation, the BCIJ seized several electronic devices as well  knives. The security services put the suspects in custody for further investigation into the suspects’ roles in the preparation and planning of terror acts. The operation is part of Morocco’s approach to combat terrorism, including thethreat posed by ISIS and its supporters, the statement concluded. Morocco’s BCIJ has dismantled several ISIS-linked terror groups throughout the year. Most recently, on November 12, the BCIJ arrested an ISIS-linked extremist on suspicion of prompting ISIS extremist ideology through electronic apps. The arrest operation took place in the city of Guelmim, southern Morocco. The BCIJ  also arrested seven ISIS-linked terror suspects in several regions across Morocco, including  Chefchaouen, Casablanca, Ouazzane, and Dar Bouazza, a coastal town near the city of Casablanca, on October 25. Morocco’s BCIJ are well respected in the international community for their approach to combatting the threat of terrorism. The strategy is based on partnerships with several international partners to fight radicalization and extremism.

Rabat – Today, November 18, Moroccans all over the world are celebrating the 63rd anniversary of Morocco’s independence. The day marks the return of late King Mohammed V from exile in 1955. In August 1953, the colonial rulers decided to send King Mohammed V and the royal family into exile, because of the tension between Moroccan citizens and the occupying powers. However, sending the royal family into exile led to a revolution from the Moroccan resistance and liberation army who struggled against the occupation until they gained their long-awaited independence. While Morocco officially gained its independence from French rule on March 2, 1956, and from Spain on April 7 of the same year, November 18 is the date that Moroccans remember for King Mohammed V’s iconic speech. “We are delighted to announce the end of the trusteeship system and protectorate and the advent of freedom and independence,” said King Mohammed V on November 18, 1955. In the 1950s, Moroccans celebrated the Independence Day on March 2 of every year. However, after the death of King Mohammed V and his son King Hassan II’s ascension to the throne, the new King moved the celebration to November 18 as a tribute to his father. Independence, the First Step Towards a Modern Morocco Morocco’s independence is a landmark event in Morocco’s contemporary history. It symbolizes the triumph of the will of the Moroccan people, and the establishment of a modern and unified Morocco. The Independence Day is also an opportunity to remember the sacrifices of previous generations of Moroccans who did their utmost to defend Morocco’s territorial integrity, and to appreciate their commitment and contribution to independence. Since the reign of King Mohammed V, Morocco has made remarkable strides in numerous fields. The Kingdom, now under the leadership of Mohammed VI, has developed systems of democracy, political pluralism, and economic liberalism. And today, Morocco is still walking the path to fulfilling its potential as a modern country with a competitive and diversified economy and strong values of democracy and citizenship, through far-reaching projects of social and economic development.

Rabat – In comments that have since been described as a bad joke, Mohamed Charfi, the president of Algeria’s National Independent Authority for Elections, described the North African country as “the best democracy” in its region and among the best in the world. Charfi presided over the signing of the “charter of ethical practices in elections” on Saturday, November 16. Only a month ahead of the heavily contested presidential elections scheduled for December 12, the new charter for “ethical practices” has been presented by the authorities as the ultimate guarantor of fairness and transparency in the coming elections. This comes as the North African country battles its way through nearly ten months of uncertainty and unmet popular demands since the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in February. Commenting on the adoption of the new charter, Charfi said that the document seals Algeria’s position in the pantheon of effective, “best democracies in the world.” An essential part of the ongoing protests in Algeria, which have unsettled the country in the past 9-10 months, stemmed from the popular perception that Algeria was anything but a democracy. Over the years, the prevailing idea among analysts and Algeria observers was that the North African country was more of a clan-run property than a well-functioning state, with government rents as the main element of stability. In November last year, just a few weeks before the pro-democracy demonstrations waves that later culminated  in the resignation of Bouteflika, International Crisis Group (ICG) described Algeria as a “paralyzed” country on the verge of profound socio-economic crises. The study described the country’s political elite as “aging and ailing” and unwilling “to pass the torch to a new generation.” There was nothing remotely democratic in the way Algeria has been run for decades, according to the overwhelming consensus among Algeria specialists and international observers. But ICG’s Algeria is by all evidence not the Algeria Charfi was referring to, an Algeria where he once served as Justice Minister before being dismissed for corruption and other scandals. Dubbing the newly-signed elections charter as a “unique” document, Charfi, who happens to be a former Justice Minister and therefore one of the surviving Bouteflika officials whose departure featured on the protesters’ list of demands, argued that the document was the culmination of a rare instance of “dialogue and consultations.” “This is the first time that an electoral ethics charter is based on dialogue and consultations about the principles and content of the electoral process,” he said. Whether Charfi’s comments were half-hearted or a misplaced joke remains to be seen. In the meantime, however, even with the signing of the electoral charter, many in Algeria still want to boycott the upcoming elections. With the names of the 5 presidential candidates (four of whom are former Bouteflika ministers) already known, the popular feeling remains that none of them can be trusted to deliver the radical reforms and generational changes that demonstrators have been demanding for almost a year.

Rabat – Algeria’s presidential candidates began their campaigns for the upcoming elections on Sunday, November 17, despite protesters vowing to boycott the polls. Five candidates have thrown their hats into the ring to replace Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The former president resigned in February of this year, under heavy pressure from unprecedented popular protests.  Nearly ten months after Bouteflika bowed to pressure from the country-wide protests, the demonstrations are still ongoing in Algiers, with protesters calling for a new generation of politicians.  Despite the people’s calls for a radical change, the presidential candidates are not all new faces.  More than one member of the Bouteflika era political elite have announced their candidacy, including former prime ministers Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Thousands of Algerians took to the streets on Friday, November 15, for the 39th week of protests to end the corruption and dysfunctions that have characterized the country’s political regime in recent years. The army have threatened to intervene to end the protests. Protesters do not trust the interim government and the army to organize fair and transparent democratic elections and have threatened to boycott the polls. The Algerian demonstrators will not be satisfied until all of the surviving Bouteflika elites, including army chief Gaid Salah, step down. Seen as the country’s de facto leader, General Salah has been trying to distance himself from the Bouteflika regime. H has also threatened opponents of the presidential elections. Salah warned of harsh punishment for anyone who jeopardizes the election process, all the while vowing not to interfere in the election. In September, Salah said, “We affirm that only the people will pick the next president through ballot boxes, and the army will not support anyone.”

Rabat – Moroccan boxing superstar Mohammed Rabii defeated Mexico’s Jesus Gurrola on Saturday, November 16 in Germany. The victory is Rabii’s tenth pro fight success since he began his professional boxing career in 2017. The 26-year-old former world champion remains undefeated, having impressively outdone all his rivals in the nine professional fights he’s had so far. The win comes nine months after his previous  fight against Polish boxer Rafal Jackiewicz in Germany in March. Rabii or Morocco’s Mohammed Ali, as his fans call him, maintains his momentum in the boxing sport, adding win after win to his professional repertoire of impressive skills and gold medals. International Boxing Association (AIBA) believes that Rabii is one of the biggest worldwide boxing success stories since 2015. “The orthodox Moroccan star has continued to impress by winning gold at the AFBC African Confederation Boxing Championships,” said AIBA.

Rabat – An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.3 degrees on the Richter scale hit the province of Midelt, Central Morocco on Sunday, November 17. According to the National Institute of Geophysics, the quake occurred at 9:39 a.m. Its depth reached 4 kilometers, and  32.570 degrees north and 4.167 west, the statement added. While no damages have been reported, the earthquake reportedly hit several other regions, including Fez, Azrou, and Errachidia.  A number of social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, were this morning inundated with posts and stories from residents from these cities claiming they felt the tremors.  At the moment of writing, however, there have been no mentions of serious damages or human losses.  Midelt experienced an earthquake reaching magnitude of 4.8 degrees on the Richter scale in June 2018.  It followed similar experiences in Southern Morocco.   An earthquake with a magnitude of 3.9 degrees on the Richter scale hit the southern province of Ouarzazate in April of last year. Months earlier, in February, Taroudant, another Southern province, was hit by a quake with a 3.5 magnitude.

Rabat – With an alpine style architecture and Middle Atlas Mountains, Ifrane is celebrating its first snow drops during this year’s winter season. The inhabitants of the city woke up on Saturday, November 16 to find their city covered with snow. Morocco’s weather office had issued a statement earlier this week announcing a cold wave with snowfall in several cities, including Ifrane. Drop in temperatures led to  the first snowfall in the Moroccan town, covering its roads and  poplar trees. With its snow-covered evergreens and steep-peaked houses,  the city traditionally experiences heavy snowfalls in January.  The drop in temperatures, however, made it possible for citizens to celebrate Morocco’s favorite winter wonderland for snow lovers as early as mid-November. But the story of early snowfalls is not all roses; the charm of a snow-soaked town or city comes with its own risks and challenges for day-to-day life. Despite the natural beauty of wild snow-covered roads, Moroccan authorities have taken precautionary measures to deal with drop in temperatures and heavy snowfalls in Ifrane and other snowy provinces. In a recent interview, Younes El Mesini, Irfane’s provincial director of equipment, transport, logistics and water spoke about the region’s reparation to cope with the effects of cold wave, especially in mountainous areas. He told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) hat these operations started recently, “with the maintenance of snow removal equipment and the reinforcement of telecommunication means, as well as the supply of tools for the treatment and acceleration of snowmelt.” The region’s authorities  will mobilize 60 icebreakers, 13 bulldozers and 12 ambulances.

Rabat – Morocco takes center stage in the upcoming Algerian elections as presidential candidates engage in providing a roadmap for what the Algeria-Morocco relations would be under their respective presidential tenures. After a first round of positive comments on the Morocco-Algeria “historical” and “cultural” ties, the second round has been less indicative of promising Morocco-Algerian prospects, with one candidate describing Morocco as a cartel nation thriving on drug exports and other, related illicit activities. Speaking to local channel Ennahar TV, Abdelkader Bengrina, a former tourism minister and now contending for the country’s presidential seat as leader of Al Bina, an Islamist “movement” he created in 2013, was rather dismissive of the positive remarks made earlier this month in some Algerian political circles about Morocco and the prospects of bilateral normalization. When asked to comment on what the Morocco-Algeria ties would be under his tenure as president elect, Bengrina replied by recycling an established Morocco-damning talking point in Algeria’s political establishment. “There is a systemic and worrying degree of drug exports [in Morocco],” he said. When challenged by the interviewer, on the basis that his answer may have inflated the reality of drug cartels in Morocco, the Islamist politician refused to yield. “All I can tell you is that [Morocco’s] drug exports are estimated in billions and not in millions of dollars.” He added, in an even more pointedly provocative comment: “The drug export industry in Morocco, which works through two seasons, is almost equal to Algeria’s oil industry” in terms of revenues generated. Bengrina’s accusing Morocco of being a champion drug exporter is hardly the first time an Algerian official throws the cartel nation card at Morocco. Over the years, the same rhetoric has been peddled in high places in Algiers, used by the country’s political establishment to dismiss Moroccan officials’ point about Rabat doing as well as, and sometimes better than the most natural resources-rich countries in the region. For Moroccan officials, Morocco’s investments in its human resources have been critical in compensating for the country’s lack of raw, natural resources like oil and mining (phosphates being the only exception). In Algiers, meanwhile, the idea has been floated around that drug exports and money laundering, rather than qualified human resources, have accounted for the bulk of Moroccan economic prosperity and influence (in Africa, for example). In October 2017, Abdelkader Messahel, then Algeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister, made the point that much of Morocco’s successful investments in Africa stemmed from money laundering and drug exports. “Many like to speak about the assertive presence of Morocco in Africa. But there is nothing there in reality,” Messahel said. “In reality, Moroccan banks in Africa mostly recycle hashish money.” He added that “Moroccan companies traveling across Africa do not only take passengers with them.” The past months have seen a resurgence of speculations about whether Rabat and Algiers would forgo of decades of hostilities after the election of a civilian president in Algeria. Some commentators have expressed hope about the possibility of normalization between the two neighbors. Among their reasons for hope are the “frank dialogue” offer from Morocco’s Mohammed VI and the perception that a new, mounting cohort of Algerian politicians would be willing to break with many commitments of the military establishment that has ruled Algeria since independence. But with the persistence of such hostile perceptions among leading contenders in the Algerian presidential elections, normalization with Morocco remains an open debate whose resolution may take longer than dovish politicians and analysts in both countries would have hoped for.

I’m on a mission to reshape my perception of restaurants in Morocco. I wholeheartedly believe that Moroccans make some of the best food in the world. If you ever get the chance to eat authentic cuisine prepared by a Moroccan, take it. That being said, I don’t always find what I’m looking for at restaurants in Rabat. The culture of eating out in the US is very different than that of Morocco, and I found it hard to get excited about trying new restaurants in Morocco—until now.  Morocco has some truly fantastic restaurants and eating spaces, you just need to know where to look.  Since my favorite kind of food is Indian, I figured there’s no better way to kick off this mission than with a trip to Clay Oven, an authentic Indian restaurant with locations in Rabat and Casablanca.  With excellent food, service, and prices, you really can’t go wrong with Clay Oven—I have no regrets from my last visit, except that I wasn’t able to eat more.        Location: Privacy, parking, and a relaxed atmosphere Rating: 4 / 5 MWN stars Since I live in Rabat and couldn’t hold off my cravings any longer, I chose the location closest to me. The Rabat venue opened in April 2019, making it younger than its Casablanca counterpart.  The restaurant in Hay Riad, an upscale neighborhood of Rabat, is easily reached by taxi or car and has ample parking options nearby. You can also get there on foot in ten minutes or less from Hay Riad’s iconic Maroc Telecom Museum and Place Mahaj Riad. If you like noisy crowds and people-watching, Clay Oven Rabat is not the place for you. But if you’re looking for privacy, parking, and a relaxed atmosphere, Clay Oven Rabat is the perfect spot for a date or a business meeting.  Service: Attentive and accommodating, but not overbearing Rating: 5 / 5 MWN stars Upon entering the restaurant, we were quickly greeted by the manager, Bipin Negi, who looked sharp and professional in a black tailored suit. He showed us the space and we settled on a back table upstairs.  A waiter quickly brought us menus, and Bipin delivered our drinks right away. Throughout our meal, Bipin and the two waiters were attentive and accommodating, but not overbearing. The excellent service was definitely a highlight of our visit.  The interior: Orange, orange, and more orange Rating: 4 / 5 MWN stars Like the color of clay ovens for which the restaurant is named, Clay Oven Rabat is orange. Very, very orange.  We’re talking orange walls, orange chairs, orange lamps, and orange artwork—but orange is, after all, a color of India. The decor channeled the warm hues of saffron, a color and spice that has come to symbolize the vibrant South Asian nation.  The dark wood ceiling beams and low lighting kept the environment quite moody. This was a bit overwhelming in the dining room upstairs, where the only window was covered by a large poster.  Downstairs, where the massive front doors and high ceilings give the space a more light and open feel, the orange paint and dark wood are significantly less powerful.    At 3 pm on a Sunday before a major holiday, the restaurant was fairly quiet.  While it certainly wasn’t crowded, it wasn’t uncomfortably empty, either. Other diners included a large English-speaking family with several children and a handful of Moroccan adults.  Menu, food, and prices: Unbeatable Rating: 5 / 5 MWN stars The menu has an extensive and well-organized list of options, but an inexperienced patron may not know where to start. If you’re not familiar with Indian food, the staff at Clay Oven Rabat will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.  Bipin first brought us three drinks: Ginger lemonade (a mojito on steroids), indradhanush (a sweet rainbow mocktail), and lassi mango (a thick mango milkshake). All three were delicious, but the refreshing, ice-cold ginger lemonade was my favorite.  In lieu of bread, we snacked on poppadom with two sauces before our starter arrived.  About ten minutes later, after we had time to sample the drinks and get settled, Bipin brought out the first dish: A sizzling platter of vegetables and spicy kebabs.  Not long after we polished off the platter, the stars of the show arrived: Vegetable korma, butter chicken, chicken biryani, and more naan. I’m not exaggerating when I say this was exquisite. From the creamy sauces to the tender chicken and the seasoned rice, everything blended together perfectly.  Even though I was stuffed from the main course, I managed to sample two desserts: Gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream and kulfi.  I wasn’t crazy about the texture of the gulab jamun, but the flavor was amazing and vaguely reminded me of chebakia, my favorite Moroccan dessert.  The kulfi had a sweetness like nothing I’ve ever tasted before. If I hadn’t already reached my dairy limit for the day, I would’ve devoured it in seconds.   The cherry on top? The unbeatable prices.  The most expensive dish on the menu is the Chef’s Special Platter, which goes for MAD 160. Everything else was MAD 130 or less, and the majority of dishes were under MAD 100.  With delicious food, excellent service, and upscale interior, these prices are an absolute steal on a nice night out.   Final rating and recommendation: 5 / 5 MWN stars Our lunch at Clay Oven Rabat was overall an amazing experience. With great service, an extensive menu, and an impeccable environment, I truly can’t think of anything negative to say about this restaurant.  If you live in Rabat or Casablanca and you’re craving Indian cuisine, check out Clay Oven—you won’t be disappointed. My husband and I are already planning our next visit.

Rabat – Popular messaging application WhatsApp banned on Friday, November 15, accounts of hundreds of Palestinian journalists reporting on Israeli violations in Gaza. The decision to block Palestinians’ access to their WhatsApp account comes a few days after Israeli troops launched violent attacks on civilians in Gaza, killing at least 37 people. Palestinian journalists updating on Israelis violations were surprised to find their accounts blocked. The journalists deplored the restrictive move, accusing the social media application of covering up  violations by Isreali troops in occupied territories. Palestinian journalists have also issued a statement to denounce the act, stating that the WhatsApp decision constitutes a “blatant complicity with the [Israeli] occupation.” “The Palestinian Media Group strongly condemns the ferocious attack on social media sites against Palestinian content, especially WhatsApp, which today banned and closed hundreds of Palestinian accounts belonging to fellow journalists and activists on social media,” the group said. This is not the first time when Palestinian journalist face such an issue. In March, Palestinian news agencies reported that  Facebook application defended its “decision to shut down the page of a major Palestinian news outlet, describing the action as a move against ‘hate speech.’” Israeli troops killed at least 37 people during attacks on the Gaza strip, while 111 others were injured. Anadolu Agency reported that Israeli forces injured six Palestinians in a march in the West Bank on Saturday November 16. The victims include a group of students from Birzeit University in Ramallah. Israeli forces threw tear gas and plastic bullets to disperse protesters.

Msemen is a square, crispy Moroccan flatbread made with layers of folded, paper-thin semolina dough and delicious butter. Some people eat it with soft cheese, jam, or dipped in olive oil, but Moroccan msemen needs no accompaniment. These little squares of heaven are popular street snacks but are also popular as part of an indulgent breakfast or an afternoon snack with a cup of tea. My children love to feast on freshly cooked msemen after school.  Once you’ve learned how to make them, I’m sure they will become a staple in your home, too. So let’s get started.   There aren’t many ingredients for this recipe and everything on the list is easy to come by. 500 grams of all-purpose flour 250 grams of fine semolina 1 tablespoon of sugar 1 teaspoon of salt ¼ teaspoon of baking yeast1 ½ cup of water A few handfuls of semolina 1 cup of oil 200 grams of soft butter Mix all the ingredients for the dough in a large bowl, gradually adding water while kneading. Knead for 10 minutes until the dough is very cohesive and soft, but not sticky. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Prepare a large, smooth surface for working with the dough and spread some oil on it to stop the dough from sticking. I like to use a large plastic tray when preparing msemen. Keep your hands and the dough well-oiled and grab a large portion of dough, now squeeze off a ball between your thumb and forefinger and form small balls of nearly equal size. Put the balls on an oiled tray. To keep the dough balls in the right condition spread oil on them and cover them loosely with plastic so they do not dry out. Let the oiled balls rest for ten minutes. Take a ball, dip it in the oil, and then flatten it into a thin disk. Now repeat the process with the rest of the dough balls. Grease the discs with butter and then sprinkle the dough with a little semolina. This will help keep the folded layers separate when the msemen is cooked. Fold the edges of the discs into the center to make a square, and place them aside on an oiled surface. Repeat the process until all the balls have been folded into squares. Heat a frying pan or an iron skillet over medium heat. Work on every square of dough separately by patting it with your fingers or palm of your hand to extend to nearly double size. Place the msemen in the pan and fry it. Flip it regularly until the two sides are well cooked. This should take several minutes. Repeat until you have used all the dough.  Moroccan Msemen is best eaten hot or warm. It’s slightly flaky when warm but chewy when cold. Serve hot with honey, jam, or cheese and enjoy!

Rabat – The Moroccan city of Ben Guerir, in Morocco’s central Rehamna province, is taking on “Rehamna E-Mob,” a sustainable mobility project, in partnership with the city’s Green Energy Park.  The governor of the Rehamna province, Aziz Bouignane, and the co-chair of the Green Energy Park, Badr Ikken, presented local authorities with 30 electric motorcycles. Ikken took to social media to celebrate that the exchange, which occurred on Friday, November 15 during the celebratory launch of “Rehamna E-Mob” at the Rehamna province’s headquarters in Ben Guerir. The electric motorcycles feature electric wheels rather than standard wheels. They are more economical and require almost no maintenance, and have similar prices to their standard counterparts.  Teams of researchers will monitor the 30 motorcycles, in partnership with Ben Guerir’s Green Energy Park. The researchers will examine the motorcycles’ battery performance and social impact. Ikken explained that the researchers aim to use their observations to design more efficient models that can be introduced on a larger scale in more Moroccan cities.  The province of Rehamna hopes to inspire more Moroccans to swap their standard motorcycles for the more sustainable electric motorcycles.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) arrested in Marrakech an Italian national suspected of breaching automatic data processing systems, presumably of a phone company, and hacking international phone calls. The 50-year-old suspect hacked international phone calls and transferred them to national calls without the knowledge of the callers, in order to pocket the difference in the call rate.  He used high resolution electronic equipment for this purpose, reported state-owned Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) quoting a statement of the DGSN. The suspect amassed a large sum of money, presumably from the phone company’s customers, through the fee difference between international and national calls. During a home search operation, police seized computer equipment, wired and wireless communication devices, 22 mobile phones, prepaid recharge cards, and large sums of money. The police placed the Italian national in custody for investigation into the details of the case.

Rabat – After withdrawing its recognition of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 2007, Cape Verde has become one of the champions of Morocco, as well as its African ambitions. Speaking at a press conference on November 15, following a meeting with Morocco’s Nasser Bourita, Luis Felipe Tavarez, Cape Verde’s joint Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense, expressed the “sincerity” of his country’s “strategic relationship” with Morocco. Tavarez said that Cape Verde acknowledges both the “Moroccanness of Western Sahara” and Morocco’s commitment to Africa and African prosperity. “Cape verde seeks a responsible and credible way of solving this regional dispute in line with the UN efforts,” he argued, in a supportive allusion to the Moroccan Autonomy Plan, a proposal that has widely been described as “serious” and “credible.” Beyond the reference to Morocco’s Western Sahara proposal, however, Tavarez spoke at length about Morocco’s leadership status in Africa. He argued that a big part of his country’s support for Morocco and Moroccan initiatives across the continent is the belief that Morocco, which is “on the right path” in terms of stability and socio-economic prosperity, can be both a source of inspiration and a reliable partner for its “African brothers.” Tavarez’s idea, as he went on to stress, is that Rabat can export its experience and expertise to the majority of African countries still struggling to deliver some of the most foundational development requirements. “Cape Verde is a neighbor and brother country [to Morocco]. We share maritime borders, but we mostly share a common cultural heritage; we belong to the same continent… We have common values and converging views on many regional and continental matters,” he said of the bilateral relations between the two countries. On the lingering, yet-to-be-settled Morocco-ECOWAS romance, Tavarez recalled that his country, having been one of the pioneers of Morocco’s return to the AU, has been largely active in convincing the West African bloc to institutionally open its arms to its Moroccan brother and partner. He promised he will continue to work “in sincerity and responsibility” to support and promote Morocco’s ECOWAS ambitions.

Tangier – After gardeners at the Hoummane El Fetouaki school in Safi discovered human remains in the school’s courtyard on Thursday, November 14, local authorities quickly got involved.  Students and teachers were horrified to learn of the human skull and bones.  The Arabic-language daily Al Massae reported that Safi’s provincial director of education and judicial police, accompanied by a scientific and technical division, arrived at the scene soon after the gardeners alerted the school administration.  After a preliminary investigation, authorities alerted the national security services of Safi and transported the remains to a forensic laboratory for further analysis.  Forensic scientists will identify the sex and age of the body, as well as the cause of death.  Police have not ruled out the possibility of homicide, Le360 reported. However, some authorities have pointed out that the schoolyard encompasses a dilapidated cemetery that had been evacuated before the school’s construction.

Rabat – The Moroccan Parliament has passed a controversial new bill to reform the education system. The new law has provoked a political crisis, due to a new language policy called “linguistic alternation,” the tricky shift to teaching scientific and technical courses in foreign languages instead of standard Arabic.  Further revelations about the bill’s contents show that French will indeed be used more in schools, but English, too, has gained ground in the kingdom’s schools. Replacing standard Arabic in teaching scientific courses enraged many members of the ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD), a conservative Islamic political party. The bill has even put the whole coalition government at stake.  The most prominent figure opposing the bill is former Prime Minister Abdelilllah Benkirane, who is still an influential element within the Islamist movement. Despite countless attempts, Benkirane has failed to convince the party to block the new legislation. It is clear that the latest policy is a win for the economic and cultural dominance of French in Morocco, since most science courses are going to be taught in French. Conservatives are saying it is a threat to the Moroccan “Arabo-Islamic” identity.  But the question of the relevance of English within Morocco is still being debated. As a matter of fact, the text of the bill raises the importance of “foreign languages” in teaching scientific and technical courses. Maybe other laws or executive orders will clarify more.  Yet, English is explicitly required, in this piece of legislation, as a mandatory course for vocational schools and universities. Additionally, there is room for university degrees taught entirely in English as professors and researchers are required to master English as essential element in their work. The bill has put in place an optimistic goal that a student with a baccalaureate degree—the diploma that marks the completion of high school—should master standard Arabic and Amazigh (Berber), as the two official languages, in addition to French and English.  The new law’s goal is clearly difficult to achieve, if taking into account the catastrophic situation of the education system. The Moroccan higher council of education, a consultancy body which advises the government in matters related to education, published in 2007 a recommendation to reform the education system in terms of the language of instruction. “To opt for a mastered bilingualism; indeed, in the current situation of resources, it’s difficult, or impossible, for the Moroccan public education system to pretend a mastered multilingualism.” So it is clear that the final decision to opt for multilingualism is a political one. There are several causes to note. First, Morocco is is a former French colony; French is widely spoken among educated people; and cultural ties are maintained by a large network of French cultural centers.  Second, France’s direct investment accounted for 28% of the foreign investments in Morocco in 2018. Third, France is a long term ally of Morocco with a special relationship in areas like security. These facts cannot be changed on short notice. However, Morocco is looking to strengthen its position in the world and within Africa.  Looking for new markets and getting more jobs for the growing numbers of young graduates is an urgent matter for the country. Government officials are aware of the importance of having a workforce trained to communicate in English to enhance foreign investment and to expand the private sector in Anglophone African countries. The latest government reshuffle in October 2019 is another example of how English is going to become more prominent, certainly at the level of higher education.  Driss Ouaouicha, the newly appointed minister of higher education and scientific research, has a PhD in linguistics from the University of Texas and studied teaching languages in the University of Wales in the UK.  Besides his many occupations, Ouaouicha holds the position of the secretary general of the Morocco-British society, an institution for cultural, academic, and economic exchange. He was also the president of Akhawayn University in Ifrane, which is basically an Anglophone university. For the current situation of Morocco, there is no perfect choice in terms of language policy. In the short term, the education system is tied fast to the French language. But the country is heading slowly to giving preference to English.

Rabat – The trial of former director of the Marrakech Urban Agency Khalid Ouaya is set to begin on Thursday, November 21. Police arrested Ouaya on July 4, 2019 on suspicion of corruption. Back in July the Marrakech National Brigade of Judiciary Police (BNPJ)  found a sum of MAD 500,000 in cash and a check for MAD 8,860,000 in the defendant’s car following his arrest. The plaintiff in the case Rachid Hosni, a renowned real-estate developer, testified that he wrote the check out to Ouaya’s wife’s company. The defendant’s wife is also implicated in the case. After searching Ouaya’s house, the BNPJ found a significant sum of money, amounting to MAD 2.5 million, in addition to numerous expensive items, including 42 luxurious watches and bracelet (Rolex, Hublot, Cartier, Bulgari), hundreds of jewellery set with precious stones, and more than 74 luxury handbags (Hermes, Valentino, Ferragamo, Prada, Céline, Christian). The case goes back to July 2019, when Hosni reached out to the police to report an extortion attempt by the director of the Urban Agency. According to the real estate developer’s complaint, Ouaya had demanded a substantial bribe to speed up the authorization process for Hosni’s property development projects. To corroborate the accusation, the Police set a trap for Ouaya, helped by Hosni. The real-estate developer set up a meeting with Ouaya on July 4, at 5 pm to hand over the money the Urban Agency director had demanded. The police, watching the exchange from a distance, caught Ouaya in the act.  After taking the MAD 500,000 bribe from Hosni, Ouaya attempted to avoid arrest by quickly driving away in his official state-owned vehicle. Not far from the scene, Ouaya’s runaway attempt ended when he crashed into a police car. The police opened an investigation to determine the full circumstances of the corruption case.

Rabat – Following multiple problems in the management of the drugs and pharmacy department (DMP) in the Moroccan Ministry of Health, the director of the department, Jamal Taoufik, has lost his position. The Arabic newspaper Assabah reported on Taoufik’s exit from the health ministry in its weekend issue. Taoufik allegedly presided over multiple dysfunctions in the drugs and pharmacy department.  According to a parliamentary report, Taoufik flouted the law when his department procured drugs from companies that did not have any production units within Morocco. The special deals gave the companies access to a lucrative market of MAD 15 billion ($1.6 billion).  Previously, locally-produced medicines supplied 80% of the country’s demand. The report found that in just a short time, the coverage dropped to just 55%. Under his leadership, the department also lost tens of millions of dirhams worth of medicines that had expired and needed to be disposed of. At the same time, pharmacies ran out of stock of other medications, frustrating consumers. Other criticisms of Taoufik ranged from the pricing of drugs to lack of oversight into the importation of medical devices. The first hint of Taoufik’s departure was his lack of appearance at Parliament when other health ministry directors presented the health ministry’s budget proposal. The departure is Taoufik’s second sacking. In 2001, he lost his job at the health ministry due to a conflict of interest. Taoufik’s wife, who owned shares in several pharmaceutical companies, benefited financially when the DMP awarded those companies contracts. However, when health minister Anas Doukkali suggested that the government give Jamal Taoufik the position of director of the DMP, the head of government agreed to reinstate him, according to Assabah.

Fez – Moroccan cuisine varies depending on the region, with some regions using ingredients that are not readily available in other parts of the country. Today’s recipe is traditional in south-eastern Morocco and uses fresh watercress and couscous.  Ifnouzen is a warming dish that also serves as a perfect remedy for winter chills. Watercress, or alfalfa, blossoms from November to the end of March and lends its healthy properties and peppery taste to the traditional couscous dish. Though some people believe that watercress is principally a food for animals and that farmers plant it for livestock, in Morocco it is used in many delicious dishes as well as home remedies for coughs and colds.  As the nights are getting cooler, it is the perfect time to make ifnouzen. 500 grams of couscous, medium caliber 1 kg of fresh watercress 500 grams of green onions 2 bell peppers 2 chili peppers (optional) ½ liters of olive oil Salt to taste 1 tablespoon of ground cumin 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon of salted butter Wash the watercress and make sure it is completely dry before starting. You can leave it to dry overnight or simply pat it dry with some kitchen towel. Using a sharp knife, roughly chop the watercress. Now cut onions and peppers into small cubes, add them to the watercress and put aside for later. Next, pour about 2 liters of water into a couscous pot and place it on the stove over a medium heat. Spread out the couscous on large plate or Gasaa (Moroccan couscous plate). Sprinkle the couscous with 1/4 liter of water and separate the grains by gently rubbing them between your fingers, add two tablespoons of oil. Put couscous inside the steamer and put it on the boiling couscous pot.  The steam will rise from the couscous. Let couscous steam for 30 minutes and then tip it out into a large bowl. Now separate the grains again by rubbing them gently between your palms or with fork. Sprinkle some cold water over the couscous and separate the grains. Now leave it to rest for ten minutes. After a little break, add the watercress mixture, olive oil, butter and spices to the couscous then mix very well. Tip all of it back into the couscous steamer. Steam for another 30 minutes or until the watercress is tender and cooked well. Now, serve the ifnouzen on a Gasaa with some hot Moroccan tea, and let the peppery taste warm you on a winter evening.

Rabat – Over the last few weeks,  young talented Moroccans have risen the Moroccan flag at international events and competitions in a number of fields. Moroccans have won a total of four important awards, three in international events, and one in a regional competition since mid-October. Sim’Cup 2019 On October 14, a group of Moroccan medicine students won the Sim’Cup 2019, an international competition for response to simulated medical emergencies. The finals of the competition took place in the Czech capital, Prague. Four students from Oujda’s Medicine School made up the Moroccan team. They triumphed in the competition despite the use of English as an official language at the event while they study medicine in French. The Moroccan students outperformed teams from Brazil, the Czech Republic, France, Ireland, and the UK. Incredible People In Russia, Moroccan student Lahcen Oulhaj won the international competition called “Incredible People,” on November 4. The Moroccan student mesmerized the jury with his extraordinary talent for memorizing and describing the details of anything he sees. In the final stage of the competition, Oulhaj managed to identify one small egg from 200 others with the same specifications and shape. In an earlier phase, Oulhaj stunned the jury when he was able to put 200 pieces of Matryoshkas, Russian dolls, in order after they were randomly mixed by a jury member. The Fez-native wiped the floor with competitors from all around the world in the skill and talent-based show. Stars of Science On November 8, Moroccan doctor Youssef El Azouzi won the Grand Final of Arab Stars of Science Season 11, becoming the Arab world’s top innovator. Stars of Science is a Qatari TV show dedicated to Arab youth worldwide who can develop technology that will have an impact and improve the lives of their communities. El Azouzi invented a blood flow modulator, a new system to help congestive heart failure patients by ensuring efficient blood flow through the heart. The jury and audience of the competition gave the 27-year-old Moroccan a score of 93.8 out of 100, making him the winner of a $300,000 cash prize. “I am stunned. To be given the opportunity to save lives is a blessing from God. Thank you to every single individual that has believed in me through this journey. I can wholeheartedly say this is just the beginning,” said El Azouzi following his win. El Azouzi graduated from the American School in Rabat, attended Oxford University in the UK and Boston University in the US, before moving to study medicine in Turkey. BIXPO 2019 Fair On November 8 as well, three Moroccan inventors earned medals at the BIXPO 2019 fair for energy transition and digital transformation in Gwangju, South Korea. Inventors Younes Karfa Bekali and Abdallah Ayache won “The best invention” award, while Rachid Oulad Madani earned a bronze medal. Bekali and Ayache won the award for inventing a secure and waterproof rotary electrical socket. The invention had different safety features and consumes less energy than all its marketed counterparts. Oulad Madani invented an educational robot for children with special needs. The Moroccan inventor won a bronze medal despite his invention getting broken during the journey from Morocco to Korea. Oulad Madani also received a decoration from the president of the National University of Callao in Peru. Arab Reading Challenge 2019 Finally, on November 13, Moroccan student Fatima Zahra Akhyar was not able to win the 2019 Arab Reading Challenge. However, the student reached the final stage of the competition after an impressive journey. For being a finalist Akhyar received a full scholarship from the Abu Dhabi University to study in a field of her choice after high school. The 15-year-old student qualified for the 2019 Arab Reading Challenge after winning the national reading contest. Akhyar studies at Cadi Ayyad High School in Tetouan, northern Morocco, and dreams of ‌excel‌ling ‌in‌ ‌both‌ ‌scientific‌ ‌and‌ ‌literary‌ ‌fields.‌ She is also a member of Morocco’s child parliament and she practices Taekwondo. While Morocco gives birth to numerous talents in various scientific and artistic fields, many of them decide to live and work in other countries. Morocco loses young people with great potential every year, especially to European and Gulf countries, for not offering them motivating salaries and good work conditions. Only time will tell if these recently-decorated Moroccans decide to live in Morocco or leave for greener pastures.

Tangier – The First Lady of Sierra Leone delivered a powerful speech at MEDays 2019 on November 15. Fatima Maada Bio, seated at the head of the 15-member roundtable, addressed a crowded room on the third day of the international forum. The First Lady has long been an advocate for women’s rights and empowerment in Sierra Leone, and she attended the roundtable as the guest of honor. After a greeting from Reckya Madougou, the roundtable’s moderator, the First Lady delivered her opening address at the discussion of “African Women: No Parity, No Development.” “How fast can a person run with only one leg?” she asked the audience. “How much work can a person do with only one arm?”  “How much development is possible in Africa, and how fast can we develop in Africa when women are not given opportunities to reach their full potential and contribute equally to national development?” The First Lady challenged political leaders, business leaders, community leaders, and policy-makers in Africa to efficiently address the urgent need to prioritize women throughout the continent.  “If we do not close the disparity in gender, we can not attain inclusive and sustainable development in Africa,” she warned.  Bio praises her country’s progress The First Lady outlined the primary concerns that African leaders must address.  “The first concern is with physical and legal protection,” she began. “We have a duty of care to ensure that our women and girls are protected from child marriage, from sexual exploitation, from rape, and from sexual violence.” She lauded her husband, Julius Maada Bio, the current President of Sierra Leone, for standing up for women in their country and for empowering her to initiate programs that support the women of Sierra Leone.  The President and First Lady of Sierra Leone launched the “Hands Off Our Girls” campaign in December 2018. The project’s goal is to eliminate rape, teenage pregnancy, and all forms of abuse against women and girls.  “With that program, us women in Sierra Leone can smile knowing full well we have a leader that believes in women’s empowerment and is ready to work with us women,” she said. She then called upon Africa’s political leaders and policymakers to take advantage of their capacity to change mindsets and cultural attitudes by enacting legal protections for women and girls. She offered the example of Sierra Leone as an African country that has demonstrated its willingness to take this matter seriously. On February 8, 2019, the President of Sierra Leone declared a rape a national emergency. After a series of sexual assaults involving minors took place in Sierra Leone, the First Lady and activists around the country called for stricter punishment for perpetrators of sexual violence.  The changes enacted following the President’s declaration included “stiffer penalties meant to help men think twice before a woman’s rights are violated,” the First Lady said at the MEDays 2019 roundtable.  Bio: “We cannot financially exclude women” “When women speak for other women, their voices are better informed and more authentic,” the First Lady declared. She emphasized the need to improve women’s involvement in politics and decision-making in Africa. In addition, she urged African governments to prioritize women’s health.   She then described how empowering women through education directly benefits entire nations.   “The more educated a woman is, the more likely she is to take advantage of economic opportunities” that contribute to a country’s economic growth. Even with education, however, women are often financially excluded in most African countries.  Women throughout the continent lack national identity cards and have little access to formal financial institutions—crucial barriers to African women’s innovation, entrepreneurship, financial stability, and independence. “Women are excluded from all opportunities where they are expected to assert their identity,” she argued.  “We cannot financially exclude women. Women must have equal access to financial services if Africa wants to grow.”  “Give women priority in the workspace, and allow women to contribute their 51% to national development,” the First Lady said.  “As we all know, we have more women in Africa than men. If you give us the space, we will use that space and make Africa heaven. Only then can any country claim equal inclusive and sustainable development.” “If you keep all your women in the kitchen, you will only have smoke in Africa,” she warned. “But if you allow your women to be educated and to be empowered, then we will change Africa and the world will come to us, instead of us chasing the world.”

Rabat – One would have expected an emphatic victory of Morocco against a team of Mauritania’s caliber. The Atlas Lions have the class and the numbers that every African team dreams of, while Mauritania is still struggling to have a functional, imposing group of players. But, if anything has been a defining feature of the Moroccan Atlas Lions, it is their propensity to make the mind-bogglingly easy feel astonishingly difficult. And so for most of the first half, there was an unassailable sense of déjà vu as Morocco kept possession and displayed masterful flow in the face of an unenterprising Mauritanian side; as Noussair Mazraoui and Achraf Hakimi thrived on both flanks; as Hakim Ziyech imposed his tempo in the midfield and gave a flavor of the kind of devastation Morocco can bring to opposing teams—especially if they are of Mauritania’s caliber—when they function as the technically gifted unit they are supposed to be. But as the minutes drifted away and the passes and domination failed to translate into something tangible, there seemed to be a recurrence of the “all of this for that?” traditional question of Moroccan fans. For since it unthreateningly impressed at the latest World Cup in Russia, Morocco’s story has mostly been one of laborious, last-minute, and unconvincing wins. Or, as was the case tonight, improbable draws. For 45 minutes of the first half, and despite the utter dominance of the Moroccan side, Mauritania managed not only to neutralize the Lions’ most threatening situations, but the Mauritanians actually succeeded—however spiritedly and sporadically—to create opportunities of their own. Which, then, is why the 0-0 scoreline at the first half was a faithful reflection of what the game had all been about by then: a disparate but equal contest between a talented but uninspired Moroccan squad and a lifeless, tepid, and yet confident and solid Mauritanian group. For Moroccan fans, the texture of the first half raises the question: How, with all the class and talent at its disposal, Morocco failed to break the Mauritanian defense? Visibly unimpressed by their own first-half performance, the Moroccan Lions came from the break more invigorated, hungry for the opener that would have allowed them to impose their rhythm and personality. The sheer, almost unstoppable dominance of Zieych’s creativity in the midfield and Hakimi’s winning presence on the left flank meant that the second half, like the first, was mostly a one-way traffic. Morocco grew more into the game and showed more willingness to go forward and try to unsettle the Mauritanian defensive wall. There were more scoring opportunities for Morocco, causing more panic in the Mauritanian defense. Somehow, though, and sometimes in moments that smelt of defiant wastefulness, Morocco failed to take its chances. By the 80th minute, even as Morocco grew more adventuresome and threatening, and Mauritania barely played, looking instead for a draw, the doubt about whether this would be yet another draw became a certain, gnawing felling that, more than a draw, it would be another worrying instance of Morocco’s unresolved goal-scoring issue. Morocco’s Atlas Lions, for all the post-CAN talks of reconstruction, confidence-building, and prospective glory, do not appear to have developed the mentality they need to have to turn the tide. Most markedly, as the Rabat air simmered with the unwanted promise of yet another lifeless draw from the Atlas Lions, the best thing Moroccan fans can take from tonight’s game is a consolation, sort of: First that this is a team with a new coach that needs some adjusting and adaptation time. Second, that one good thing is that the Lions will not have the misfortune of meeting a strong side in their group, Burundi and the Central African Republic being the group’s other two teams. And third, that perhaps the Ruud van Nistelrooy’s “goals are like ketchup” witty comparison is relevant for Morocco. The hope is that, with the experience and creativity that this Moroccan side boasts, goals may become floodgates when (or if) they finally start scoring. But that is only a hope, meaning that realizing it calls for the type of urgency and efficiency that has left Morocco since their pre-World Cup friendly games.

Tangier – Irene Ochem, founder and CEO of the Africa Women Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum (AWIEF), introduced herself at MEDays 2019 as a representative of Africa’s female entrepreneurs and innovators. Ochem, from Nigeria, participated in a forum on “Enhancing Africa’s Competitiveness: Financing SMEs and Supporting Entrepreneurship.” As one of the esteemed invited speakers at MEDays 2019, Ochem brought the issue of gender to the forefront at the first session of “Africa Business” on November 13. The panel addressed the obstacles faced by Africa’s small and medium enterprises (SMEs) when trying to obtain financing. Some panelists highlighted issues of corruption and poor human capital, while others emphasized how the dominance of the informal sector in Africa adversely affects the prospects of financing for SMEs. Many foreign investors, in particular, view investment in African SMEs as “risky business.” Ochem turns the spotlight on gender Although she was the third woman to speak, Ochem raised a point that had not yet been touched on: The under-resourcing of women entrepreneurs and business owners.  Ochem believes that women are Africa’s most important yet most underutilized resource and that African women entrepreneurs face unique challenges that their male counterparts will never experience.  African women have restricted access to financing due to a variety of cultural and structural barriers. Investors also lack confidence in female African business owners, causing businesswomen to lose confidence in themselves.  Ochem’s non-profit organization, AWIEF, is a highly influential pan-African women’s economic empowerment organization and business network. Seen by many as a visionary, she works tirelessly to facilitate the empowerment of African women and to help them realize their full potential for economic growth.  “Investing in women is more efficient for every society,” she said at the panel, noting some of the crucial sectors in African countries that are dominated by women, such as agriculture.   “At the end of the day, Africa is losing a great deal by not supporting 50% of the population,” she stated during the panel. “We are developing at 50% less than what we should be.” “It is in our best interest to finance women.”

Rabat – Maldivian foreign affairs minister Abdulla Shahid has reiterated his country’s unwavering support for Morocco’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty over Western Sahara. The official stressed his country’s support for Morocco’s position on Friday, November 15, in Rabat. Following a meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, Shahid told the press that his country backs Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. He added that it is the “only political, pragmatic, realistic, and sustainable solution to resolute this regional dispute.” Morocco submitted the Autonomy proposal to the  Security Council in 2007.   The Maldivian official also expressed support for the UN-led political process. Speaking to the press in a joint conference, Bourita said that the meeting with Shahid was an opportunity to express Morocco’s recognition to the Republic of Maldives for  “its clear and consistent stance on the issue of the Moroccan Sahara in all international and regional fora.” Both countries shared their determination to strengthen diplomatic ties at all levels, including fishing, tourism, and agriculture. The two countries signed four agreements during the Maldivian minister’s trip to Morocco, including one agreement on visa exemption. The Maldivian minister said that the visa waiver agreement  will further consolidate the political, economic relations between the two peoples.

Rabat – The public prosecutor in Casablanca has opened an investigation into the alleged corruption of a judge. Police launched the investigation after a video of a conversation between a man and a women negotiating an agreement to reduce the sentence of a defendant went viral on social media. The video shows a man claiming to know the judge ruling on the case of a woman accused of forming a gang. The man appears in the video talking to the judge on the phone to confirm the agreement. He asked the woman in the video footage for MAD 35,000 in exchange for agreeing a sentence reduction for her mother from  8 months to 2 through negotiations with the judge. The investigation led to the arrest of the man in the video, reported Moroccan Arab-speaking news outlet Hespress. After interrogating the suspect, the judicial police found out that he was already known to the police for his involvement in fraud and corruption. He lives in Casablanca’s Korea neighborhood, reported le360. The suspect admitted to receiving a certain amount of money in exchange for his intervention, according to Hespress. In a condemnatory statement to Hespress, the head of the Hassania Association of Judges of Casablanca, Mohamed Redouane, said that “the content of the video reflects the presence of intermediaries extorting citizens and persuading them to get their money illegally, claiming that they have relations within the courts.” “We can only condemn the actions of such people who seek to discredit the judiciary and judges in order to obtain material aims,” added Redouane. The judge stressed that “the suspect should be an example for everyone who entrusts himself to speak on behalf of judges and to fraud litigants.”

Rabat – Through the factory, OCP would send ammonia to Morocco’s plant in Jorf Lasfar, while Morocco will supply the Nigerian plant with phosphoric acid to produce fertilizers. Moroccan leading phosphate producer OCP Group expects its ammonia plant in Nigeria to be operational by late 2023, Reuters quoted a senior OCP official as saying. The head of OCP Nigeria Mohammed Hettiti told Reuters at that OCP is building  the $1.3 billion plant in southeast Nigeria where the group has already identified gas suppliers. The factory is part of OCP’s expansion plan into Africa. The phosphate giant aims to contribute to the sustainable development of African agriculture as well as working towards food security for Africa’s growing population.  The company has also shared plans to set up plants in Ethiopia and Ghana. The Ghana plant will produce customized fertilizers for the African market and will be functional by 2024, with a capacity of 1 million tonnes. Meanwhile, Ethiopia’s plant will have a capacity of 3.8 million tonnes of fertilizers by 2025. Through the factory, projected to have an annual capacity of 750,000 tonnes of ammonia and 1 million tonnes of fertilizers, OCP plans to export ammonia to Morocco’s plant in Jorf Lasfar. Morocco in turn will supply the Nigerian plant with phosphoric acid to produce fertilizers, Hetiti added. OCP provides 90% of Nigeria’s fertilizer demand and inked the plant-building agreement with Nigeria’s Sovereign Investment Authority in June 2018. Hettiti added that fertilizer supply to Nigeria will triple from 1 million tonnes to 3 million in the next five years.

Rabat – Abdelhamid Abdaoui, the new Algerian ambassador to Morocco, has presented his credentials to Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Abdaoui met Bourita in Rabat on Wednesday, November 13, according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Algeria announced Abdaoui’s appointment on September 26. Previously, Algeria’s interim president, Abdelkader Bensalah, had appointed Abdelaziz Benali Cherif. Morocco allegedly rejected Cherif as ambassador. Before Abdaoui, Ahmed Benyamina served as the Algerian ambassador to Morocco. Benyamina arrived in Rabat in 2010. Interim President Bensalah recalled Benyamina earlier this year in a diplomatic shake-up. The new ambassador is a career diplomat, having served in the Algerian foreign ministry. Abdaoui represented Algeria as ambassador to Kuwait from September 2016. The Algerian government has been in turmoil since the protests of hundreds of thousands of Algerians began in February. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned in April, leaving a gap in the presidency that has yet to be filled. While an interim government has called for elections in December, the polls have seen consistent delays since July. Protesters in Algeria argue that any election would be illegitimate until all political leaders who were part of Bouteflika’s administration have resigned. Morocco and Algeria share the world’s longest closed land border. Tensions between the two countries have simmered for decades over Western Sahara and the border demarcation.

Washington DC – Morocco’s lethargic diplomacy is more evident in its strategy dealing with the political upheaval in neighboring Algeria. Conscious of Algeria’s old guard propaganda line accusing foreign hands of being behind all of the countries’ ailments, Moroccans have been overly guarded in their efforts to sidestep the political quagmire in Algiers. While it is wise and understandable for the Moroccan government to stay out of the internal affairs of other countries, Moroccan politicians outside the government, political and human rights activists, and non-government organizations are entitled to discuss, comment and take stands on the situation in other countries including Algeria. Consequently, the Moroccan foreign ministry’s recent attack on its former chief diplomat Mr. Salaheddine Mezouar for applauding the peaceful political movement in Algeria and “imploring” the military to share power with civilians is incomprehensible and unfortunate. Rabat issued a harshly worded statement, as if a major diplomatic incident occurred, calling Mr. Mezouar’s statements “irresponsible, clumsy and ill-considered.” Actually, it is the Moroccan diplomacy’s reaction that is ill-advised, hasty and defeatist. Mr. Mezouar is a citizen who does not represent the positons of any government, and therefore he is entitled to his opinions. He made his comments as The President of the General Confederation of Morocco’s Enterprises (CGEM) and not as a Moroccan diplomat. It is rather a pity to hear Rabat describing Mr. Mezouar’s account as “a meddling in a other nations affairs” when  it is rather  Algeria’s former Prime Minister and current presidential  candidate Abdelmadjid Tebboune declaration describing the Western Sahara conflict is a case of decolonisation that represents a flagrant interference in the businesses of the Kingdom. Mr. Mezouar who was ineffective as foreign minister and uninspiring as a leader of a major political party is the victim of an archaic Moroccan foreign policy based on “hear no evil see no evil speak no evil”. This approach has not succeeded, expectedly so, as the uptake in the hirak (social and political protest movement) has yet to lessen the Algerian military support to the Polisario despite calls from current and former Algerian high-ranking government officials for normalizations of relations with Morocco. Rabat’s docile diplomacy toward Algeria underscores a level of low esteem and a lack of confidence in the legitimate rights of Morocco on the Western Sahara. What make the Moroccan government’s response also egregious are the constant anti-Morocco reports in the official Algerian press that go an answered. The real question is why Rabat feels the need to control the statements of a former diplomat when Algerian official television stations are covering the activities of Saharan separatists calling Moroccans invaders. It is time for Moroccan diplomat to move away from a policy focused on the containment of a  discredited military establishment and move toward drawing a blueprint aimed at  highlighting to the Algerians the truth and cost behind their government policy of support to the Western Saharan separatists. Many aspects of Morocco’s foreign policy have remained the same for years. The dynamics of the hierarchical relationships between the foreign ministry, Royal advisors and the intelligence community have further impeded the elaboration of a multi-faceted diplomacy able to adjust and adapt as fast as development around the world. The Moroccan diplomacy has scored some successes in recent years with more nations supporting its positions in the Sahara conflict, however, Rabat is still in need of a long-run perspective and a core strategy that instill political confidence and diplomatic aggressiveness.

Rabat – The Spanish government has asked the European Union to increase the funding it grants to Morocco to help the kingdom in its fight against irregular migration. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez spoke about the pressure faced by Morocco to combat irregular migration in a joint press conference with the president of the elected  European Council, Charles Michel, in Madrid on Thursday, November 14 Morocco “must be endowed with sufficient resources to deal with illegal immigration,” said the prime minister, quoted in Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). In August Spain approved a €32 million grant to back Morocco’s border control initiatives. The fund is in addition to the €140 million that the EU pledged as part of a program to support Morocco’s efforts to control the flow of undocumented migrants. The Spanish official recalled that Morocco has helped Spain to reduce the number of irregular migrants arriving in Spain by more than 50%. The European country reduced the “arrivals of undocumented migrants arriving by sea in Spain between January 1 and October 30 by more than 53% compared to a year earlier,” according to the Spanish Ministry of Interior. A total of 22,247 irregular migrants reached Spain by the sea in makeshift boats as of October 30, down from 47,684 migrants during the same period in 2018, the ministry added. About 1,030 boats arrived on the Spanish coast from January to October of 2019, compared to 1,775 boats over the same period last year. The difference constitutes a 42% decrease. Last week, Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska described Morocco’s contribution to easing the pressure of irregular migration as “real” cooperation. The minister added, “Now we have more forces, we train them, we give them means and protection and we do investigation work against mafias” involved in human trafficking.

Rabat – The day after the US House of Representatives began public hearings in its impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump seized on the testimony of the Ukrainian foreign minister to assert in his latest tweet: “THE FAKE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS NOW DEAD!” On Wednesday, November 13, the House began hearing testimonies in public hearings from US diplomats. The diplomats gave evidence on allegations that Trump attempted to bribe Ukraine into further investigating Democratic politician Joe Biden’s son. On Thursday, Ukrainian foreign minister Vadim Prystaiko said, “I have never seen a direct relationship between [Ukrainian] investigations and [American] security assistance,” reported Ukrainian outlet Interfax. Trump tweeted that in light of Prystaiko’s statement, “Democrats must apologize to USA.” ….Ambassador Sondland did not tell us, and certainly did not tell me, about a connection between the assistance and the investigation.” THE FAKE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS NOW DEAD! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2019  Trump’s executive branch suspended security funding to Ukraine in the summer. In a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, Trump asked for “a favor.” In August, a whistleblower filed an official complaint, saying Trump wanted Ukraine to publicly announce that it was investigating Joe Biden’s son, who was involved with a Ukrainian company, for corruption. The House of Representatives opened an impeachment inquiry on the issue in September. In public hearings this week, diplomats, including acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, testified to the effect that Trump had conditioned security aid to Ukraine on a public announcement against Biden.  President Trump has called the inquiry a “witch hunt.” In an earlier tweet on Thursday, he complained, “We’ve now had 3 years of the Democrats chasing Donald Trump.”  If the US House of Representatives votes to impeach Trump after its investigation, Congress’s upper chamber, the Senate, will be obliged to begin an impeachment trial. Congress can only remove Trump from the presidency if the Senate votes to convict him.

 Rabat – The Ministry of Justice is hosting a two-day international seminar on child protection across borders. The event started on Thursday, November 14, at the Higher Institute of Law, Rabat. The meeting’s main focus will be on the 1996 Hague Convention on parental responsibility and the protection of children. The convention covers civil measures of protection, including orders concerning parental responsibility, and public measures of protection or care. The agreement also covers measures concerning unaccompanied minors and cross-border placement of children. The objective of the event is to promote the application of the Hague convention through jurisdictions and legislative frameworks. انطلاق أشغال الملتقى الدولي للخبراء حول حماية الأطفال عبر الحدود
14 – 15 نونبر 2019 بالمعهد العالي للقضاء بالرباط
كلمات… Posted by ‎وزارة العدل Ministère de la justice‎ on Thursday, 14 November 2019 “Our debate will mainly focus on the issue of unaccompanied minors who immigrated away from their families in Africa and came to Morocco or Europe looking for a better future,” Philippe Lorti, first secretary of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH), told the press. Participants at the debate have studied real-life cases to determine the best measures to ensure the protection of minors. “The convention allows the judges of the State where the child is present to immediately take protective measures. The most important thing is the appointment of a guardian or a legal representative for the child so they can work with the authorities to determine their best interests,” adds Lorti. Giovanna Barberis, UNICEF’s representative in Morocco, said that the seminar is “extremely important” for “finding ways to improve the application of the 1996 Hague Convention”. Morocco is “the first country in Africa and the MENA region to have ratified this convention,” she told the press. The event brings together delegations from the European Union (EU), and from North and West African countries, including Burkina Faso, Togo, Ivory Coast, Tunisia, Mauritania, and Algeria. HCCH co-organized the event with the Moroccan Ministry of Justice, in collaboration with UNICEF and financial support from the EU. As Morocco is a destination as well as a  transit country for migrants, including unaccompanied children, it is one of the justice ministry’s priorities to build a legal framework that protects and cares for minors.

Rabat – Israeli troops killed a family of eight in an airstrike in Gaza on Thursday, November 14. The two sides agreed on a ceasefire shortly after the attack. Despite having signed the ceasefire agreement in Egypt, Israeli troops continue to launch raids on  individuals “linked to Islamic Jihad” in Gaza. The Israeli Army told the media that the Israeli Defence Force “is currently striking Islamic Jihad terror targets in the Gaza strip.” Al Jazeera reported that the recent announcement from Israeli troops suggested that the ceasefire was breaking down. A reporter from the same news outlet said that Israel had begun “another round of air strikes.” The ceasefire came into effect after deadly attacks killed at least 34 Palestinians, including women and children. Nearly 100 Palestinians sustained injuries during the bombardments. Palestinian rockets allegedly caused injuries among 60 people in Israel.

Rabat – France has announced that in two years applicants for Schengen visas will be able to complete applications and receive a visa online. The French strategic committee for visas made the announcement on Thursday, November 14. The committee, that sat for the first time on November 6, includes representatives from the French Ministry of Interior and from the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs. An inter-ministerial committee for migration and integration decided to create the new committee with the aim of facilitating visa applications and improving policies. The new committee has three main objectives; preventing security threats, controlling the migratory flow, and promoting exchanges. “The strategic committee for visas has decided to put new mechanisms of coordination between the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs in place. [The new mechanisms] will ensure a closer follow-up of visa deliveries, especially in countries where large numbers of visas are delivered,” said a press release from the committee. The committee also announced the upcoming stages of the “France-Visas” project. The project aims to “ensure a paperless process of visa deliveries in two years, leading to better efficiency.” “All the steps of visa application can be done online. The only information that will require the applicant’s physical presence in a consulate or embassy is biometrics,” adds the release. The announcement comes after applicants from different countries, including Morocco, expressed their anger at the delays of visa deliveries and the difficulty of booking appointments. On October 29, Moroccans signed a petition and sent it to France’s ambassador to Morocco, Helene Le Gal, demanding immediate intervention to end the frustrating situation. According to the Consul General of France in Rabat, Florence Causse-Tissier, the French consulate in Morocco issued 315,000 Schengen visas in 2018. The number makes Morocco the country that receives the second most visas from France, after China.

Rabat – Losing members of his family in the devastating battles between Morocco and the Polisario in the 1970s, and his forced relocation to the Tindouf camps lends gravitas to the testimony of former leading Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud.  In an open letter to Morocco, Mustafa Salma told the government Sahrawis trying to come back to Morocco have few options but to return to the Tindouf camps. In his letter, he cites the inhumane conditions and the human rights violations in Tindouf, as well as the obstacles the Sahrawis face in trying to return home. Nearly 40 years after the conflict that killed Mustafa Salma’s family members, among countless others, thousands of desperate refugees are still living in muddy camps in the desert, away from civilization and modernity. The camps are in a desert town called Tindouf, in Algeria, close to the Mauritania border.  Mustafa Salma, who has been a critic of the Polisario leadership since his self-imposed exile in 2010, uses his writings to depict “the nightmare” he experienced in the camps.  He recalls the killing of his two little sisters in the 1970s war and the forced displacement of thousands of Sahrawis from Morocco’s southern provinces to the Tindouf camps. He says that with the exile of the Sahrawi population, the Polisario intended to gain sympathy in the international community in order to fulfill its separatism claims. After many social media posts, Mustafa Salma’s open letter is, he says, a cry for help from thousands of Sahrawis stranded in Nouadhibou, Mauritania, “waiting for the possibility to return to their homeland.” Mustafa Salma shared the open letter with Morocco World News. In the document, he denounces the world’s silence on the situation of innocent Sahrawis, both in Tindouf and Mauritania, who seek to return home. “The official speech of Morocco has long described the Tindouf population as detainees, a description that did not come out of the blue.” Mustafa Salma elaborated his argument, condemning the lack of freedom of movement that detains Sahrawis in the camps of Tindouf. “Everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own, and to return,” he said. The former Polisario member emphasized that the UNHCR also considers the right of voluntary repatriation as a “durable and most desirable solution, as it ideally allows refugees to resume their normal lives in their homeland and to restore their cultural and ethnic ties within their country.” Despite all [UN] provisions that prove freedom of movement should be legal, the Polisario Front finds the return of any Sahrawi from the camps to their homeland a “betrayal” and criminalizes the act. Mustafa Salma recalled that Sahrawis caught trying to leave the camps get sentences of 10 years in prison or more. The former Polisario member believes that Algeria is solely responsible for limiting the UNHCR’s work by putting in place “obstacles” for Sahrawi refugees. “Its role is limited to assisting Sahrawis without legal protection and without being able to protect refugees from prosecution and violations,” Mustafa Salma said in his open letter. Merciful land The activist recalled an extract from a much-lauded speech by the late King Hassan II of Morocco, when he vowed that Sahrawis wishing to return to their homeland would not be prosecuted. The “homeland is merciful and forgiving,” said King Hassan II in 1988 to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the Green March. The statement encouraged Sahrawis to walk in their thousands away from Polisario-controlled territory and towards the defensive wall Morocco built, seeking a peaceful return through UN-organized trips. Morocco, however, decided in the early 2000s that its consulate in Nouadhibou, Mauritania, 1,500 kilometers from Tindouf, was the only legitimate crossing point for Sahrawis seeking a return to their homeland, according to the activist. Sahrawis did not complain, however, because the procedure was smooth and quick with applicants waiting for a maximum of 20 days to receive a response. Mustafa Salma regretted that the procedure is now slower, and people seeking to return home have to wait several months “without a response.” Putting their lives in danger to seek a chance Without directly asking for a solution from Morocco, Mustafa Salma explained the challenges Sahrawis undertake to make it to Nouadhibou, Mauritania. “It is no secret” that Sahrawis receive serious penalties if they come back to the camps after traveling from Tindouf to the Mauritanian city. The Polisario Front considers such an act as “fleeing.” He said that Sahrawis cannot afford to keep living in Mauritania, as they cannot pay expenses, including rent. The only solution for them is to return to the camps if their situation has not been resolved. “The longer the wait, the greater the pressure.” Mustafa Salma wrote the open letter to call on Moroccan authorities to assist Sahrawis seeking return. He argued that all royal speeches refer to Sahrawis held in Tindouf camps “our sons and Moroccan nationals held on Algerian soil.” The speeches also emphasize the right of return in accordance with the principles of human rights, according to Mustafa Salma. “We hope and wish that Moroccan authorities resolve this issue and take the necessary measures to accelerate the access of Sahrawis returning from the camps to their homeland to restore their normal lives and dignity.” He said that it is “unfair” for Sahrawis who meet all the legal requirements to wait for months. Mustafa Salma argued that denying Sahrawis the right to return only serves the interests of Polisario and Algeria and their wish to prolong the conflict.

Rabat – Customs officers in Oujda, north-eastern Morocco, thwarted the attempted smuggling of 1,680 goldfinches on Thursday, November 14. The breed of bird is a protected species.  The Moroccan customs issued a statement indicating that the Oujda brigade’s customs officers intercepted a tourist transport vehicle carrying 28 wooden boxes. Customs officers found 60 birds in each box. The statement added that the officers intercepted the vehicle while conducting a routine control operation on the rural road N.6, leading to the entrance of the city. The driver of the vehicle managed to escape. The protected birds have a market value estimated at MAD 840,000.  Customs officers have handed over the birds to the Oujda province  Department for Water, Forest, and the Fight Against Desertification. In early August, a group of tourists from the Gulf traveled to Marrakech and hunted more than 1.400 quails in just one day. One of the tourists recorded the hunting expedition and posted a video on Facebook showing dozens of dead birds. The National Society for Hunting released a condemnatory statement, describing the hunt as a “massacre.” The organization also called for opening an investigation into the case. The investigation, ordered by the water and forests department under the Ministry of Agriculture,  found that the area where the hunting took place had been leased to a hunting tourism company. The company was found responsible for the hunt. The investigation also revealed that the number of birds the tourists shot was triple the quota of birds specified in the company’s hunting license. In addition to suspending its license, the ministry said in a statement that the tourism company would be prosecuted. Further investigation revealed that another illegal hunt was carried out by the same company.

Washington DC – In the recent Spanish elections, the far-right Vox party surprised international observers and analysts with its unprecedented success. Last Sunday, Vox won 52 seats in the Congress of Deputies after gaining only 24 in the April parliamentary elections. The right-wing party’s newfound popularity has given them the third most parliamentary seats in Spain. In the wake of the elections, observers in Morocco are questioning how, and to what extent, the new political climate with a stronger far-right parliamentary element will affect relations between Rabat and Madrid.  The dramatic rise of the far-right party in Spain is likely to disrupt the relations between the two countries, especially with controversial issues like Ceuta and Melilla lurking in the background. An impossible coalition For one thing, although Vox will have an impact, it was never going to control Parliament’s agenda. Even before the two leftist parties formed a coalition, it was impossible to conceive of Vox participating in any government coalition for two key reasons. As the party is the third-largest in Spain’s Parliament, it did not hold a sufficient number of seats to lead a government coalition.  Vox’s participation in any government coalition depended on the political willingness of the socialist party (PSOE) or the People’s Party to welcome it into a coalition.  The second key obstacle keeping Vox from taking part in a coalition stems from its political rhetoric. The party’s platform is not in line with the political rhetoric Spain uses with its partners and allies, including Morocco, one of Spain’s most important strategic partners.  Given the two countries’ shared interests, over the past four decades Spanish governments—with the exception of former Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar’s time in office—have been clear on the importance of adopting a respectful political discourse with Morocco as an equal partner. Even during periods when relations between Rabat and Madrid were strained, Spanish officials and politicians have tried to de-escalate tensions and showed eagerness to appreciate the solid bilateral ties and Morocco’s contribution to Spain’s security by fighting illegal immigration and terrorism.  Given the populist, misleading, anti-Moroccan, and anti-Islamic rhetoric on which Vox relies, it was impossible to imagine that either of Spain’s two main parties (the socialist party and the People’s Party) would enter into a coalition with Vox. Were the two parties to even hint at forming an alliance with Vox, bilateral cooperation with Morocco would be put in jeopardy.  Vox’s anti-Morocco rhetoric is based on the premise that Morocco is responsible for Spain’s illegal migration woes. The party has gained popularity by demonizing Morocco’s institutions, accusing them of collusion with human trafficking networks and criminal rings.  Meanwhile, the party also hopes to revive old, dormant tensions over Spain’s enclaves in Morocco: Ceuta and Melilla. The populist demonization of Morocco Still, Vox’s increased numbers in Spain’s Parliament and its victory at the polls in Ceuta may well unsettle relations between the two countries.  Vox’s position on a host of issues related to Morocco, particularly with regard to undocumented migration, Spain’s contested sovereignty over Ceuta and Melilla, and its threats to cut off Madrid’s financial support to Rabat, could cause serious embarassment to the Spanish government.  To avoid any negative impact of Vox’s presence in the Parliament on Morocco-Spain relations, the new coalition headed by Pedro Sanchez will have to strive more than ever before to curb any denigration of Morocco in the Spanish Parliament, as well as to educate the Spanish populace about the pivotal role Morocco has played in recent years in helping Spain manage undocomunted immigration and extremism. The Spanish government will also need to avoid adopting populist rhetoric to cater to the mass of Spanish voters who expressed their disgruntlement with the system by voting for Vox.  Where do Ceuta and Melilla come into play? Vox’s rhetoric could resuscitate the Moroccan voices who want Rabat to break its 15 years of silence on the question of Ceuta and Melilla.  Since 2004, when the socialist party returned to the government, Morocco has sidelined its demands for sovereignty over Ceuta and Melilla and has focused, instead, on improving relations with Spain. Over the past 15 years, Morocco has endeavored to ensure that Spain adopt a position of positive neutrality on the issue of Western Sahara. During the reign of the late King Hassan II and in the early years of the reign of King Mohammed VI, Ceuta and Melilla were a constant topic in Morocco’s rhetoric towards Spain. During that period, Morocco questioned Spain’s sovereignty over the two enclaves not only in bilateral meetings but also in multilateral settings such as the United Nations.   Since 2004, Morocco has, however, put the issue on the back burner. The question of Ceuta and Melilla has been conspicuously absent from King Mohammed VI’s speeches to the nation on the Green March, the Revolution of the King and the People, and Throne Day since then. Moroccan officials also did not include it in the agendas of regular meetings with their Spanish counterparts. However, should the far-right party continue to demonize Morocco, the Moroccan government might find itself under pressure from the people and Moroccan media to officially question Spain’s sovereignty over Ceuta and Melilla.  Such a scenario would adversely affect Morocco-Spain relations and risk undoing the efforts officials of both countries have made over the past 15 years to strengthen their strategic partnership.  A surge in Vox’s provocative rhetoric against Morocco, especially regarding Ceuta and Melilla, is likely to cause Rabat to take retaliatory measures to isolate the cities and cripple their shaky economies.  Ceuta and Melilla’s shaky economies  It is an open secret that Ceuta and Melilla thrive economically thanks to the smuggling of goods into Morocco. The illegal activity is harmful to the Moroccan economy and deprives the state of significant revenue, estimated at €540 million annually in customs’ rights and taxes. A move from Morocco could harm the economies of Ceuta and Melilla. Morocco’s decision in July last year to close customs with Melilla and divert importation operations to the port of Beni Nassar seriously damaged Melilla’s economy and deprived it of an estimated €47 million in revenue.  Morocco’s decision prompted officials in Melilla to call on the central government in Madrid to intercede with the Moroccan government to reopen the border. However, the border remains closed.  Even before Vox’s emergence and its callous use of anti-Moroccan sentiment, the Moroccan government had taken incremental measures to curb the illegal economy that has thrived between northern Morocco and Ceuta and Melilla, which amounts to over €2 billion every year.  In January, Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit told the Moroccan Parliament that Morocco must end smuggling. He said the issue is a burden on the national economy, despite the fact that tens of thousands of people in northern Morocco rely on it financially. Morocco has sought in recent years to gradually end smuggling and strangle Ceuta and Melilla’s shaky economies in the long run. In recent months, Morocco has made several decisions designed to minimize the impact of smuggling on the national economy.  For example, the Moroccan government recently suspended the movement of goods between Ceuta and northern Morocco for 42 days. It also imposes restrictions on goods that can enter Morocco through the city’s borders. And in June, Morocco displayed its political will by ordering Moroccan diplomats and civil servants not to use the two cities to enter Spain. The smuggling of goods from Ceuta and Melilla has bogged down the Moroccan economy for several decades and doomed any government attempt to create a strong and resilient economy in the region and provide sustainable job opportunities.  Smuggled goods can also be a health risk since the goods are not controlled or monitored by authorities. There have been several cases of poisoning among Moroccans because they ate expired goods smuggled into Morocco. Ceuta and Melilla have lived off smuggling and kept their economic viability as long as Morocco has turned a blind eye to the illegal trade. The enclaves should be cautious of full-throated support for Vox. Vox’s anti-Morocco rhetoric and its provocative calls on Morocco to recognize Spain’s sovereignty over Ceuta and Melilla will eventually backfire, harming far-right Spanish voters and the status of Ceuta and Melilla under Spanish sovereignty.    Samir Bennis is the co-founder of Morocco World News.

Rabat – Scientists have discovered dinosaur tracks in Morocco that prove some dinosaur species used migratory routes between Morocco and Europe. An article published in October’s issue of the Journal of African Earth Sciences explains the findings. The study reveals that researchers found identical footprints of Theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs, from the Late Jurassic period (between 163 and 145 million years ago) in Morocco, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland. The findings prove that Theropods were globetrotters, following migratory routes between the supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia, specifically between today’s North Africa and Europe. “How did the dinosaurs pass between Laurasia and Gondwana? The answer is problematic because there was a deep sea between the two continents,” explained the article’s co-author Diego Castanera from the Miquel Crusafont Catalan Institute of Palaeontology in Barcelona. The study calls into question accepted geographical theories that there was a sea between Gondwana and Laurasia in the Jurassic period. The recently discovered tracks belonged to two species; “Megalosauripus transjuranicus” and “Jurabrontes curtedulensis” “On the one hand, we have identified a type of large and slender footprints with a size of 30-50 cm and, on the other hand, other gigantic and robust footprints measuring more than 50 cm,” said Castanera. Researchers used a type of software called DigTrace to study the different footprints. “We can’t determine with certainty what animal left a particular footstep since different related dinosaurs could leave very similar footprints. However, our findings indicate that the fossilized footprints belonged to Allosaurus and Torvosaurus,” added Castanera. In recent years, a number of studies have shown that today’s Morocco was a habitat for some of the most ancient species. In March 2018, researchers found the oldest nuclear DNA from Africa, dating to approximately 15,000 years ago in eastern Morocco. Just two months ago, paleontologists discovered bones of a Stegosaurus dinosaur in Morocco’s Middle Atlas mountains. The findings were the oldest Stegosaurus bones ever found, estimated to be around 168 million years old. Researchers also made an “unprecedented” discovery in Morocco’s Anti-Atlas mountains this month. The paleontologists found skulls and a complete skeleton from a Phoebodus, an ancient shark that lived 350 million years ago.

Rabat – Police in the city of Guelmim, Southern Morocco arrested three suspects for their alleged involvement in drug trafficking. The arrest took place on Wednesday, November 13. The suspects are also linked to the organization of irregular migration networks, and fraud. Initial investigations revealed that one of the three suspects was wanted at the national level for his involvement in a drug smuggling case in Guelmim involving eight tons of cannabis resin. A second suspect is also subject to a national arrest warrant for issuing bad checks, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said. Police investigations led to the arrest of a third suspect on suspicion of human trafficking and irregular migration. The three suspects had planned to purchase an inflatable boat and navigation equipment to facilitate irregular immigration to the Canary Islands. The suspects are aged 30, 33, and 40, the DGSN statement added. The police put the suspects in custody for further investigation to determine the severity of the charges against them. The operation is part of Morocco’s efforts to fight irregular migration and drug trafficking.

Rabat – The Syndicate of Public Sector Doctors in Morocco has warned of the “dangerous situation” in the maternity ward at Mohammed V Hospital in Tangier. The department suffers from overcrowding and has only four doctors on staff. The human resources at the hospital face a lot of pressure, according to Choukri Mesrar, the syndicate’s regional secretary. The hospital receives patients from all of the surrounding cities and towns; Asilah, Larache, Ksr Kebir, Chefchaouen, and Ouezzane. “Pregnant women lay down in the corridors of the hospital, and those lucky enough to find a bed share it with one or two more women,” Mesrar said in an official statement. The situation is caused by a lack of strategy from the Ministry of Health to recruit new doctors and to provide good working conditions for them, added the secretary. In the last year, eight doctors have resigned from working at the hospital, angry at the working conditions. There are only four doctors left in the department, and three of them are not even from Mohammed V Hospital. Two of the doctors are from Asilah, and one is from Tangier’s Mohammed VI Hospital. The syndicate demanded that the Ministry of Health provides both human and material resources in order to improve the conditions of the hospital. According to the organization, the resignations will continue if the ministry takes no measures to improve work conditions at the hospital. The maternity ward at Tangier’s Mohammed V Hospital receives more than 15,500 women every year. Around 13,000 patients give normal birth, while 2,500 receive Cesarean section operations. The call for improvement of the maternity ward comes only a few days after a video of a woman giving birth in the streets of Fez shocked Moroccan social media users. The video shows a woman giving birth in the street just outside of Fez University Hospital. The woman and her husband are from Sefrou, a small town about 30 kilometers south of Fez. The couple first went to Sefrou’s maternity ward, where medical staff sent them to Fez. The hospital in Fez then denied the woman entry, and she went into labor near the hospital’s main entrance. On November 7, Morocco’s Minister of Health Khaled Ait Taleb sent a letter to the Regional Director of Health in Fez. The letter states that Abdeslam El Bekkali, a gynecologist-obstetrician practicing at Mohammed V hospital in Sefrou, will be temporarily suspended from his position while continuing to receive his salary. The latest call from the syndicate is not alone: throughout 2019, doctors and hospital employees organized numerous protests to improve their work conditions and the quality of hospitals. On October 23, doctors and employees at Rabat’s University Hospital went on a two-day strike. Previously, on October 7, the syndicate organized a national strike covering all Moroccan public hospitals.

Rabat – The Union of Arab Football Associations has named controversial Egyptian referee Gehad Grisha as the official referee for the upcoming match between the Moroccan club Olympic Club de Safi (OCS) and Esperance de Tunis (EST). The game is part of the knockout stages of the Arab Club Champions Cup. Grisha’s questionable performance in the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League final led to an ongoing dispute between EST and Moroccan team Wydad Athletic Club (WAC).  During the first leg of the final the referee appeared to favor the Tunisian side and overlooked several score-affecting mistakes from Tunsian players. On May 24, the Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat was hosting the final game where the main referee chose to discount a legitimate goal by WAC and did not give them a penalty kick that the club’s fans believe they deserved. The referee also served WAC captain Brahim Nakkach with a red card. WAC sent an official letter of complaint to the CAF president, Ahmad Ahmad, denouncing the biased rulings and emphasizing that they changed the course of the match. Following complaints from both the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and WAC, CAF handed a six-month suspension to the Egyptian referee. On June 14, CAF lifted Grisha’s suspension. The Egyptian federation announced on the same day that Grisha would officiate games during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN).  Following his reinstatement Grisha acted as the main referee for  the CAN group stage games between Kenya and Senegal.

Rabat – The president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa, has spoken out about Moroccan football player Abderrazak Hamdallah’s retirement announcement. On November 11, the football player announced his international retirement in an Instagram post. In response, Lekjaa said that the FRMF has not yet received any official notice about the football player’s retirement. Cited by Saudi sports news outlet Arriyadiyah, Lekjaa said that it is important for the players to respect the choices of Morocco’s head coach Vahid Halilhodzic in terms of his selection of players to participate in qualifier games for the Africa Cup of Nations 2021. Hamdallah made his last appearance with the Atlas Lions in a friendly match with Gambia in June. The football player left the training camp a day after the match, allegedly due to a rift between him and his teammates. Hamdallah’s decision to announce his international retirement came just three days after Halilhodzic unveiled his 24 player list for the Moroccan squad set to take part in the qualifier games. Hamdallah’s name did not appear on the list. In addition to Hamdallah, the Bosnian coach also did not call up Moroccan international football player Amine Harit. Despite having had an outstanding season with his German football club Schalke 04, the Bosnian coach was not satisfied with Harit’s latest performance with the Atlas Lions and so did not list him for the upcoming games. The international football player spoke about not being called up for the upcoming matches in a televised broadcast last week. “He [Halilhodzic] told me that there were things he did not appreciate from both my club and myself, about the fact that I had some pain and my club asked me to be careful,” Harit said. He added that the Bosnian coach also told him that he doesn’t “appreciate” his performance.

The Department of Sciences in El Jadida earned a trophy for its research on the Japanese sargassum algae. In the “education and youth” category, Cadi Ayyad University’s campus in the coastal city of Safi won a trophy for organizing an “Ocean Sciences Forum.”  Recognizing how many youth educate themselves, the Sustainable Coast jury also awarded an “education and youth” trophy to a YouTube channel, “The Protectors of Nature” by Soufiane Hafidi. Municipalities were also eligible to receive prizes, but Agadir was the only municipality to receive a trophy. Agadir’s awareness-raising and environmental education activities earned a trophy in the environmental responsibility category. One entity outshone its competition by winning two trophies. The Association of Champions of Fnideq for underwater sports and the protection of the environment won an “environmental responsibility” prize for its “Our Cleanest Beach” initiative. It also won a prize under the “living environment” category for its “Everyone protect our maritime heritage” project. Princess Lalla Hasna called for Morocco to mobilize against the plastic garbage that has accumulated in Earth’s oceans. The ceremony marked the third year that the princess has awarded the Lalla Hasna Sustainable Coasts trophies. The jury awarded trophies not only to projects that benefit the environment, but also those that enable society to appreciate the environment. In Laayoune, the Association in Support of Disabled People won an award for its project “Foum El Oued Beach is Open for All.”  At the trophy ceremony, attendees watched a documentary about the ocean and plastic waste. The Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment Protection, under the chairmanship of Lalla Hasna, has promoted the hashtag “b7arblaplastic” (Ocean Without plastic), and the documentary narrated the hashtag’s impact. With 3,500 kilometers of coastline, Morocco’s future is entwined with the ocean.

Rabat – The Moroccan Association for the Fight Against AIDS (ALCS) published a document calling the Ministry of Health to facilitate access to Hepatitis C medication in Morocco, especially for those living in precarious situations. ALCS released the statement today, November 14. The organization called for including all Moroccans in the medical assistance plan RAMED. According to the press release, the majority of Moroccans live in precarious conditions and “do not have health insurance.” ALCS decided to publish the release after the new Minister of Health, Khaled Ait Taleb, canceled a call for bids concerning providers of Hepatitis C medication. The decision would mean a rise in price for this type of medication from MAD 2,660 per box to MAD 4,950, according to the association. For ALCS, it is crucial that the Ministry of Health launches a new call for bids to provide the Moroccan market with Hepatitis C medication at the lowest prices as soon as possible. “Every delay would lead people’s conditions to worsen, and it would increase the risk of developing other complications requiring even more expensive treatment, including cirrhosis and liver cancer,” adds the organization. ALCS also recalled the Ministry of Health’s goal of eliminating Hepatitis C in Morocco by the year 2030. In July 2019, the association shared alarming numbers about Hepatitis C in Morocco. Around 5,000 Moroccans die every year from this disease, averaging 15 deaths per day. There are also 400,000 Moroccans who suffer from Hepatitis C, and around 16 new victims catch the disease every day. Hepatitis C is a disease that causes inflammation and infection of the liver. This condition develops after being infected with the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can be either acute or chronic. It is also highly contagious. ALCS began in 1988. It was the first association for the fight against HIV/AIDS in the MENA region. At first, its main focus was supporting AIDS patients financially, socially, and psychologically. However, as the organization developed it started supporting patients suffering from other diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases and Hepatitis.

Rabat – The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) paid tribute to three peacekeepers who lost their lives while performing their duty, including Moroccan blue helmet, Saad Zghari.  On Thursday, November 7, the MINUSCA held a memorial ceremony for three of their Blue Helmets; Sergeant Alex Mudenda from Zambia, who died after a short illness. The ceremony also honored 1st Class soldier Saad Zghari from Morocco, and Atiqul Islam from Bangladesh, reported Far-Maroc, a website specialized in military activities. Zghari was part of the 9th Armored Squadron Group of the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces (FAR). He had been working for MINUSCA since May 24, 2018. The Moroccan soldier died on June 19, 2019, at just 24 years of age. “His contingent commander remembers him as a brilliant soldier, very disciplined, respectful and loyal to his duties to protect civilians,” says MINUSCA. The UN peacekeeping mission started on April 10, 2014, and is charged with establishing lasting peace in the Central African Republic. The conflict in the Central African Republic started on December 10, 2012, when civil war broke out between the government, rebels from the Seleka coalition, and anti-balaka militias. MINUSCA has full authorization from the UN to take all necessary action to  stabilize the situation in the country’s principal cities and to restore the authority of the state.

Rabat – Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister Riyad El Malki has taken the opportunity to condemn the Israeli violations against Palestinians in Gaza whilst participating at the MEDays symposium in Tangier. On Wednesday, November 13, the official said that the Palestinian people in Gaza have witnessed “assassinations since Tuesday, amounting to 23 deaths.” He emphasized that Israeli troops killed women and children during the attacks, while others destroyed dozens of houses. “These crimes unequivocally confirm that the Palestinian people need international protection from the brutality and crimes of the Israeli occupation,” he added. El Malki called on the international community to “condemn” the Israeli crimes. “The silence of the international community [for Israeli crimes] makes it bear indirect responsibility for the consequences.” So far, Israeli attacks have killed 36 Palestinians, including children and a woman. Israeli violations against Palestinians in the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip have also injured 70 more Palestinians, including 30 children and 13 women. Several countries condemned the attacks, including Turkey. On November 13, Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement “strongly” condemning the attacks. “The Israeli Government should end its aggressive attitude and occupation,” the statement said. Turkey also asked the international community to stop closing “its eyes to this tragedy in Palestine,” calling on countries to act “quickly against Israeli occupation policy and aggression.”

Rabat – Aicha Ech-chenna, Moroccan human rights activist and founder of the Feminine Solidarity Association in Casablanca, shared alarming figures about abandoned children in Morocco. Quoted by Spanish news outlet Mujerhoy, the activist said that “50,000 children are abandoned each year,” with an average of 24 babies are thrown in the trash per day. She added  that “there is no official number of single mothers, but 10 years ago, there were already more than half a million.” Ech-chenna runs the Association Solidarity Feminine, a charity for female solidarity and women’s rights. She founded the association in 1985 to help single mothers. Speaking about the NGO’s  mission, Ech-chenna said that when they started the project it was with the aim to stop single mothers from taking to the streets and living “in inhumane conditions” She said that what is important is to teach women to be “independent, to regain self-esteem, to be responsible because another life depends on them.” Solidarite Feminine houses 7,000 mothers and has branches in Marrakech, Fez, and Tangier. Earlier this month, Morocco’s Minister of Human Rights Mustapha Ramid spoke about the alarming number of undocumented children in Morocco. He said that the number of children who do not have proof of identity in Morocco reached 91,747 by the end of 2018. Undocumented children cannot benefit from basic rights such as education. The minister cited undocumented marriages, non-declared births, or parental negligence as the main reasons behind the high number of undocumented children. In 2018, the Moroccan government launched two national campaigns to urge parents to register their children in the social records. In October, Morocco’s Ministry of Interior called on national administrations to simplify the parental recognition procedures for children born from undocumented marriages. Article 16 of the Family Code considers the marriage certificate as the only legal and official proof of marriage.  Couples without a marriage certificate face administrative obstacles when trying to register their children in civil records.

Rabat – Spanish news outlet El Espanol cited an investigation that reveals the ethnic origins of the leader of Spain’s VOX political party. According to the investigation, Santiago Abascal is the direct descendant of an Arab leader who lived in Spain in the thirteenth century. El Espanol quoted Filomeno Rubia, the author of the investigation that dates back to a year earlier. “Ab-Hascal died in the battle of Cuenca in the year 1234”  Rubia told El Espanol. “After his death, his son decided to embrace Christianity in order to avoid execution. For this reason, he changed his name to Abascal. However, he continued to follow the Muslim faith in secret” Ab-Hascal’s son then faced arrest a few years later for “participating in conspiracy” to burn the Cathedral of Santiago. Rubia said that the charges against Ab-Hascal’s son were “ a bit exaggerated.” The historian suggested that another son of Ab-Hascal fled Spain to Morocco. While tracking his descendants, the historian stated that there is a biological ties between the Vox leader and Moroccan-French football player Adil Rami. “Maybe that explains the amazing resemblance between the politician and the former [football player] from Seville and Valencia.” “The branch of the family that remained in Spain has given us a lot of significant figures. For example, Bartolo Abascal who participated in the Cuban war,” the historian narrated. “Right at the beginning of the conflict, he became friends with an American soldier destined for the USS Maine.” Adil Rami, however, was born in France to Moroccan parents. El Espanol also spoke with Santiago Abascal in December. In the interview, he said that he had entered politics “because they told me that I would get loads of likes on Instagram. The truth is that I have no idea what I am doing.” Abascal has been the leader of the far-right party since September 2014. The party is seen as an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party.  It called on the government to close down “fundamentalist. He also vowed to build a wall around the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla to, due to a high number of irregular migrants attempting to scale the fences. Abascal said   Morocco to pay for the construction of the wall. He also called for deporting all irregular migrants and as well as legal residents of non-Spanish origin who have committed crimes.

Rabat – The National Council of Human Rights (CNDH) has conducted an exclusive investigation into torture claims made by several Hirak Rif activists, who are subject to disciplinary measures for refusing to comply with prison orders. The prison administration placed the prisoners, including Nasser Zefzafi, in solitary confinement and removed privileges like family visits and telephone communications for a period of 45 days, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported on November 4. The decision comes after a recording activist Nasser Zefzafi made went viral on social media.  In the recording, Zefzafi claimed he experienced “torture” and inhumane conditions during his arrest. The General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) denied that prisoners were subjected to “any ill-treatment.” The office of Morocco’s public prosecutor also issued a statement on Tuesday, November 5, expressing readiness to re-investigate the case if Zefzafi has new evidence about torture claims. In response to the situation, the CNDH also made its exclusive investigation through sending a delegation to several prisons where Hirak Rif prisoners are held. The delegation visited on November 7-8 two prisons in Meknes, Ras al Ma prison in Fez, and three others in Taounate, near Fez, and Taza and Guercif. During the visit, the members of the delegation were able to visit the cells where the six activists subject to disciplinary measures are held. The delegation also had access to surveillance videos to check whether the prisoners were subjected to any kind of torture. The delegation also conducted interviews with prisoners separately, carrying out a systematic examination of all the prisoners concerned. The CNDH concluded that after looking at videos, the delegation found that the six prisoners refused to “leave the [prison] hall next to the surveillance camera on October 31.” The activists also refused to return to their cells for more than two hours, “something that the prisoners confirmed during separate interviews.” The delegation added that the situation resulted in “an altercation between prison officers and two prisoners.” The incident resulted in minor bruises on “the bodies of two prisoners.” The CNDH argued that “no evidence of torture against the prisoners has been found.” The CNDH, however, condemned the “deplorable state of the disciplinary cells” in the Toulal 2 and Ain Aicha prisons. The CNDH found that the cells do not meet international standards.

Twenty-four MPs voted in favor of the bill, and 13 opposed it. MPs had been reviewing the bill for two weeks and proposed 270 amendments. King Mohammed VI reviewed the 2020 Finance Bill on October 9 with Minister of Economy Mohammed Benchaaboun.

The figure amounts to around MAD 2,500 per person in Morocco for the year. Lawmakers have also budgeted MAD 14.6 billion for the subsidy fund. The fund subsidizes flour, sugar, and butane gas, according to media outlet Le 360. A further MAD 26 billion would go to support the purchasing power of Moroccans. At the same time, legislators are keen to encourage investment in Morocco. The 2020 Finance Bill proposes a decrease in the corporate tax rate from 31% to 28%. Typical corporate tax rates globally range from 10 to 35%, although some countries have a 0% corporate tax rate. Morocco’s current rate is in line with France’s rate of 31%, but other countries in the region have lower corporate tax rates. Algeria’s rate is 26% and both Tunisia and Spain have a rate of 25%. In a presentation to the Finance and Economic Development Committee on Thursday, November 7, Benchaaboun said the new bill will continue to reform the subsidy fund and implement decentralization.

Rabat – The decline in newspaper sales in Morocco is “shocking,” said prominent media figure Mohamed Berrada on Tuesday, November 12. Berrada, the founder of publishing and distribution company Sapress, spoke at a forum celebrating the 60th anniversary of the state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). From the “golden days” of Moroccan national newspapers in the 1980s and 90s, Berrada noted that the number of newspaper copies sold per day has fallen from 500,000 to only 120,000 today in a country of more than 35 million. The media figure remarked on how people today want their news quickly and are drawn to pictures and videos. At the same time, people are less likely to search out details in the news to understand the full story. Berrada also lamented the proliferation of online news outlets in Morocco, currently standing at 400 electronic newspapers. The growth in online news “drives the reader away from the paper press and, as a result, precipitates its decline.”  Traditional media outlets in Morocco have a “fragile economic model” unhealthily focused on advertising, Berrada said.  Berrada has been a major figure in Moroccan journalism since the 1970s, when he published “Correspondence of the Press” and founded Sapress. He also received Morocco’s first National Press Grand Prize in 2003. The experienced journalist called for newspapers to restructure their companies to have a “clear vision” for how they need to modernize. National newspapers in Morocco also do not do enough to keep distribution figures up to par, Berrada suggested. He complained that distribution figures do not match the progress in Morocco’s development or the “ambitions” of publishers. In the context of internet media’s undeniable potential, Berrada did praise national newspapers for playing an “honorable” role in defending Morocco’s best interests despite limited funding. Along with the funding and sustainability challenges that the Moroccan press is dealing with, the press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF), painted a picture of difficult conditions in Morocco. For 2019, RSF ranked Morocco as 135th out of 180 countries for press freedom. RSF notes that a number of journalists have experienced “judicial harassment,” and the government has expelled several foreign reporters.

Rabat – The Polisario’s leadership has gone from disappointment to disappointment in recent months as the breakaway movement continues to lose key supporters worldwide.  Former President of Bolivia Juan Evo Morales announced on November 10 his decision to resign after 14 years in power. The decision comes following waves of protests against his disputed re-election. The South American country’ military forced his departure to ensure stability. The departure of  Latin America’s longest-serving leader may come as a blow to the Polisario Front. Under Morales’ leadership Bolivia, was a staunch supporter of the front’s separatist claims,  supporting the Polisario position in several international organizations, including the United Nations. Bolivia was among the countries to defend Polisario’s separatist claims at the UN 4th Committee in October. Representatives from the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) also exchanged visits with Bolivian officials. In July  Bolivian Chancellor Diego Pary Rodriguez received a copy of the “credentials of the ambassador” of the self-proclaimed SADR to Bolivia Mohamed Salmed Daha Lehbib. The meeting came only a few days after El Salvador decided to withdraw its recognition of the self- styled SADR. El Salvador’s decision was a  setback for the Polisario, whose leader Ibrahim Ghali has long lobbied traditionally socialist Latin and Central American countries to garner backing for the establishment of an independent state in Western Sahara. El Salvador is among a growing list of countries that support Morocco’s territorial integrity. Peru, Bolivia’s South American neighbor, is among the countries that support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, an initiative submitted to the UN in 2007 as a possible political solution for the Western Sahara conflict. In August, former president of Peruvian Congress Pedro Olaechea reiterated support for the Autonomy Plan.

Rabat – The government of Quebec, Canada, has launched a new test for foreigners applying to live in the region. The new procedure will become official at the start of 2020, according to Radio-Canada. As of January 1, 2020, all applicants for permanent residency in Quebec will have to take a “values test,” in order to receive “proof of learning Quebec’s democratic values.” The document will be necessary for applying to the Ministry of Migration to receive a Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ). To pass the test, applicants must achieve a minimum of 75% correct answers. In case of failure, the applicants can take the test a second or third time. They can also take part in a preparation course. The test is free, according to the Canadian radio. Immigrants who are already in Canada will have to take the test at the Canadian administration, while applicants who are applying from outside can take the test online. “If you want to come live in Quebec, you should know the values of Quebec. You should know that, in Quebec, women are equal to men, that the principle of secularism is important, that there is a separation between state and religion,” said Francois Legault, Quebec’s First Minister. Quebec’s Minister of Migration, Simon Jolin-Barette, added that “no immigrant will be selected if they don’t succeed in the Quebec values’ knowledge test.” The announcement of the new measure caused varying reactions within Quebec’s government, especially among the opposition. The opposition’s spokesperson, Moncef Derraji, said that passing the test “does not necessarily mean that you believe in Quebec values,” denouncing the arbitrary nature of the test.

Rabat – The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) has awarded Moroccan-German journalist Souad Mkhennet its International Leadership Award for her leading role in reporting on international issues including extremism, radicalization, and terrorism. Mkhenent’s career in journalism started in parallel with the 9/11 terror attack when she uncovered and reported conflicts and terrorist attacks in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Known for her in-depth knowledge of the subject, Mkhennet has interviewed terrorist leaders and jihadists. She was was part of a team of reporters who revealed the true identity of an ISIS militant Jihadi John, reported the Washington Post. Along with her then-colleague Michael Moss, Mkhennet published the series “Inside the Jihad” where, she interviewed various jihadist leaders, including the head of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The book was published between 2007 and 2008. Born in 1978 to a Turkish mother and a Moroccan father, Mkhennet grew up in Germany where she studied journalism at the Henri Nannen School for Journalism in Hamburg and the Johann-Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt. She also spent some of her childhood with her grandparents in Meknes, Morocco. The German-Moroccan journalist has published two books; the Eternal Nazi From Mauthausen to Cairo, the Relentless Pursuit of SS Doctor Airbert Heim in 2014, and I Was Told to Come Alone in 2017. For Mkhennet the award is an encouragement to continue her reporting on radicalization and extremism. The awards ceremony will be held at the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles on January 14, 2020. “I consider this distinction as an additional responsibility for furthering and deepening my reporting on those who act hatefully towards other human beings,” she said to the Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The 41-year-old prominent and courageous journalist conducted life-risking journalistic fieldwork in Egypt where she uncovered the whereabouts of one of the most wanted Nazi war criminals, Dr. Aribert Heim. “Ms. Mekhennet was able to do so through her courage and journalistic skills. She smuggled the Nazi doctor’s briefcase out of Egypt at great risk to her life and liberty,” said SWC. “As a result of her courageous acts, the Wiesenthal Center, in collaboration with the relevant authorities, was able to examine handwritten letters and other documentary evidence to establish that the man living under the name of Tarik Hussein Farid in Cairo, had indeed been Aribert Heim,” SWC added. The Nazi doctor had been living as a free man in Egypt for decades.  Later on, while reporting on the Arab Spring in Egypt, authorities jailed Mkhennet and threatened her with rape, holding a gun to her head.   During her interrogation, the Egyptian authorities brought up her involvement in solving the Aribert Heim case, an incident that deeply shook Egypt’s public relations. The hardships Mkhennet faced did not deter her from further covering challenging topics in dangerous locations.

Rabat – About 75% of Moroccan adults have a net worth of less than $10,000 (around MAD 90,000), counting both financial and material assets. The statistics appeared on the 2019 Global Wealth Report, published by Credit Suisse Research Institute on October 21. The report detailed wealth distribution in Morocco. Out of the 23.6 million adults in Morocco, 75.5% have a net worth of less than $10,000 (around MAD 90,000). Around 23.6% are worth between $10,000 and $100,000, and 1.3% have a net worth ranging between $100,000 and $1,000,000. Finally, only 0.1% of Moroccan adults are worth more than a million dollars. The document estimates the average net worth of Moroccan adults to $12,929. The average includes $3,494 of financial wealth, $10,757 of non-financial wealth, and $1,322 of debts. The average net worth of Moroccan citizens recorded a growth of 2.5% between 2018 and 2019. The exchange rate of the Moroccan currency to US Dollars went down by 0.9% in 2019, adds the report. In Africa, about 88.5% of adults have a net worth of less than $10,000, and only 0.6% have a net worth ranging between $100,000 and $1,000,000. Globally, the report notes that global wealth grew by 2.6% in 2019 to reach $360 trillion. The US, China, and Europe are the highest contributors to this growth with $3.8 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.1 trillion respectively. The average adult net worth globally has also reached a new record of $70,850. While the average might seem high, it does not reflect the disparities in wealth distribution around the world. The global wealth pyramid contained in the report shows that 0.9% of adults around the world own around 43.9% of the total world wealth. On the other hand, 56.6% of the population share only 1.8% of the global wealth. The report classed Morocco in the “poor countries” category, reflecting the average net worth of Moroccan households. In September 2019, the World Bank also published a report that highlights the financial situation of Moroccans. According to the report, around 9 million Moroccans (24% of the Moroccan population) are poor or at risk of poverty. In January 2019, Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) published the results of a household survey for the fourth quarter of 2018. The report stated that around 38% of Moroccan families go into debt or use their savings to cover their expenses. The document also mentioned that only 4.4% of Moroccan families are able to put a part of their income into savings.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Youth and Sports and Spokesman for the Moroccan government Hassan Abyaba misnamed  Mohamed Ould Ghazouani in front of a large audience during the 9th annual festival of Ancient Cities held on November 10 in Cinquetti, Mauritania. Abayba led the Moroccan delegation to represent Morocco, the guest of honor at this year’s symposium. The spokesman started his speech with greetings to the attendees, and the Mauritanian President, calling him  “Mohamed Ould Cheikh Cheikh El Azzouzi.” The spokesman continued his speech as if nothing had happened, reiterating Morocco’s determination to preserve brotherly relations with Mauritania. Later in the speech, the Moroccan politician called the Mauritanian president by his correct name and the crowd erupted in applause. Abayba, who is among the new ministers appointed as part of the government reshuffle,  did not have a successful start as a government spokesman. Videos of his first appearance at a press conference after the government council meeting went viral last month. The new spokesman repeated the word “maybe” over and over again while failing to answer the questions of the assembled journalists. The second unsuccessful appearance of the official was at a parliament session in his capacity as the Minister of Youth. During the parliament session, a member of parliament asked Abyaba about the role of youth centers and the measures to promote among Moroccan youth.  The minister then responded, reading from a script, with the answer to a different question. Several parliamentarians stopped the minister, telling him that he was answering another question. Abayba replied saying, “this is what I got. This is what they gave me,” suggesting that he was reading answers put in order.

Rabat – The school of Ait Ahya, in the province of Taroudant, 80 km to the east of Agadir, collapsed on Monday, November 11, due to strong winds. As students are on holiday, the incident did not cause any casualties. However, the building sustained massive damage. Around 90 students attend classes at the school. The incident will delay their return to class, originally expected on Wednesday, November 13. Additionally, the state of the building will not allow for regular timetables, with students now taking turns to use the classrooms. The poor infrastructure of Moroccan public schools, especially in rural areas, has been stirring debate between Morocco’s Ministry of Education and Moroccan teachers. In September 2019, a teacher posted a video online depicting the deplorable state of a public school in Sidi Kacem, 130 km to the northeast of Rabat. The teacher posted the video to urge officials to take action against the precarious infrastructure at her school. While Internet users admired the teacher’s move, Morocco’s Minister of Education, Said Amzazi, considered it “inappropriate.” On September 20, Amzazi announced in a press conference that the teacher was suspended and would appear before a disciplinary committee. During the press conference, the minister also denied the authenticity of several photos and videos shared on social networks and showing the state of public schools in Morocco. He said that the pictures and videos were “unfounded” and shot in another country. The issue of infrastructure is not the only problem that the ministry of education has to answer. Contractual teachers have been protesting throughout 2019. The teachers went on strike regularly, interrupting the flow of studies at Moroccan public schools. On November 10, the National Coordination for Contractual Teachers called for a two-day national strike in December. The teachers demand the abolition of fixed-term contracts and the end of the “discrimination” between contractual and public sector teachers.

Rabat – The Moroccan Federation of Consumer Rights warned citizens of the existence of microbes in some bottled water produced in a recently acquired manufacturing unit. On November 11, the federation said that the water bottles of 0.5 and one liter produced by the brand are not valid for consumption as they contain “dangerous microbes that threaten the lives of citizens, especially children and elderly.” The statement called on citizens to exercise caution.  The federation also called for the parties concerned, including Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, to intervene.  “We call on  the authorities of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Interior to assume their full  responsibility in this matter.” Sidi Harazem has responded to the warning, admitting that it knew about microbes in its bottled mineral water, causing an uproar among citizens and consumer federations. The company claimed that the National Institute of Hygiene reported “non-compliance” on three lots of “identified bottle size 0.5 liter “ manufactured on a new distribution line.” “Analysis has shown us that [the problem was identified ] exclusively in the Sidi Harazem 0.5 liter bottle,  with three limited lots made since the acquisition of the new line at the end of August 2019,” Sidi Harazem concluded. In response to the Sidi Harazem statement, secretary-general of the National Federation of Consumer Associations Wadie Madih told Morocco World News that the company is held responsible for its delayed reaction to a serious issue that could endanger the lives of people across the region. “The big question here is why the company has not reacted to the issue until now, knowing that the issue dates back to August?” he asked. The secretary-general said that the company’s reaction comes after a nationwide uproar, whereas communication should have been effective beforehand. Madih told MWN that the issue raised other questions that the public should take into account. Such issues cause a lack of trust among consumers, he said, emphasizing that citizens are now aware and very careful of what they consume. “Citizens now are very careful and picky about the products they use and the proof is the recent boycott,” a successful movement against high prices of certain products.  In April 2018 Moroccan citizens launched a boycott against three major companies, including mineral water Sidi Ali, dairy company Danone, and oil firm Afriquia gas. Madih said that the problem with some companies is that they fear the reaction of citizens, and so refuse to communicate and admit problems in their products so as not to lose their clients. “This is one of the issues that still exist and it is wrong,” he said, adding that communication at the right time can be effective as it ensures trust between the companies and their clients. The secretary-general of the federation also asked whether the Ministry of Health monitors and approves the validity of certain products before they are distributed in the market. Sidi Harazm said that it has removed the contaminated bottles from all points of sale. “All of this production was then destroyed.”

Rabat – The National Coordination of contractual teachers called for a two-day national strike in December, continuing to fight for equality with public sector teachers. The coordination issued a statement on November 10, calling on all education unions to participate in the strike scheduled for December 3-4. The statement also called for contractual employees that the ministry selected in 2019 to join the strike, urging them to boycott training. The decision comes a few weeks after the Coordination’s meeting with Minister of Education Said Amzazi as part of a dialogue to find a resolution for the situation of contractual teachers. The Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education, and Scientific Research previously announced that the first dialogue session with the syndicates representing contractual teachers would take place on Friday, November 1. In 2016, the Moroccan government decided to start hiring teachers under annually renewable contracts. The teachers, however, decided in February to participate in ongoing strikes, demanding to be hired into the public sector.  Throughout 2019, demonstrators called for the abolition of fixed-term contracts, and the end of the “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers.

Rabat – Moroccan professional footballer Abderrazak Hamdallah announced his international retirement in an Instagram post on Monday, November 11.     السلام عليكم ورحمة الله، لقد قررت أن أعتزل اللعب دوليا… Salam to all, I have quit playing internationally A post shared by  Hamdallah Abderrazzak (@abderrazak_hamdallah) on Nov 11, 2019 at 4:58am PST The 28-year-old center-forward is a goal machine with his Saudi football club Al Nassr FC, scoring 7 goals since the beginning of the 2019-20 football season. Hamdallah’s last appearance with the Moroccan national football team was on June 12, 2018, when the Atlas Lions lost to the Gambian national team in a friendly game (1-0). The Moroccan player was at the center of rumors of a rift within Morocco’s national team when he left the team training camp ahead of the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). The FRMF subsequently released a statement stating that Hamdallah’s departure is due to an injury. A day later, Hamdallah posted a video of himself training intensively on Instagram, proving that the FRMF statement was inaccurate. Several sports news outlets also reported that the major cause of his exit was a rift with his teammate Faycal Fajr during a friendly match between Morocco and Gambia in June. Hamdallah’s retirement from international football comes after the new Atlas Lions coach failed to list him as part of the Moroccan squad for two friendly matches. In a press conference on October 9, the Moroccan national football team coach Vahid  Halilhodzic said that he invited Hamdallah to join the training camp ahead of two friendly games against Libya and Gambia.   However, in an Instagram post, Hamdallah denied receiving an invitation from the coach or from FRMF.

Rabat – Moroccan athlete Chakib Lachgar has won the 55t Annual Behobia San Sebastian race, outperforming the other competitors. The Moroccan athlete came first with a time of 1h.00, 00, ahead of Iraitz Arrospide who arrived four seconds after the Moroccan. Spanish media described the win as a “surprise,” given the history of the athlete who immigrated to Spain irregularly  in 2008. He emigrated to Spain from Ouargui, a Moroccan town nearly 100 kilometers from Marrakech. The athlete managed to emigrate to Spain underneath a truck. Diario Vasco quoted Lachgar who narrated his risky adventure. “I was 18 when I left Morocco. I came under a truck. It was dangerous and difficult to forget.” Born in 1986, the athlete said he was interested in traveling to Europe from an early age. He said that  he needed a “lot of money” to ride a patera. “I ended up in the basement of a truck,” he said. He added that he was planning to emigrate to Germany. “I haven’t done any sports since I left school,” he added that he realized later that when he ran it made him feel better and began to practice sports regularly.  The athlete left school at the age of 16 to try to earn money, he travelled to the Sahara and to Tangier in order to earn a living. Before leaving Morocco, he worked selling fruit, in textiles, and selling bread.  Lack of employment opportunities have led hundreds of young people to take the risky trip to Europe.  In October, a Moroccan Taekwondo champion, Anouar Boukharsa, decided to cross the Mediterranean to reach Spain without papers.  The champion documented his trip on a small boat in a short video that went viral. In the video, Boukharsa throws his medals in the water, saying that they have no value. In Morocco, when athletes end their professional careers they usually find themselves in a precarious situation, unless they have a second job or made enough savings during their career.

Rabat – The Polisario Front has faced increasing pressure to free three Sahrawi activists, held in detentions without trial since their arrest in June. On November 10, the “authorities” of the separatist front finally released Moulay Aba Bouzid, Fadel Braika,  and Mahmoud Zidane following a trial. A “court” in the Tindouf camps, Algeria where the three activists faced charges of treason, crimes that can lead to severe punishment including the death penalty. The “court”,  however, found Braika, Aba Bouzid, and Zidane innocent of all charges. . The activists’ release comes after months of sit-ins and protests condemning then oppression and arbitrary arrest of the activists for peaceful protests against human rights violations, and the lack of freedom of movement and expression. The move to release the activists also comes after the Polisario authorities in the Edhaibia prison released private images of Braika’s wife to the press, prompting an angry backlash from Sahrawis in the camps.  Earlier this month, pro-Polisario news outlet Sawt al Watan (Voice of the Nation) published the leaked photos, showing Braika’s wife in her bedroom.  “Security services” took the images from Braika’s mobile phone, after confiscating the phone during his arrest in June. The move angered the Tindouf population, who strongly criticized the Polisario leadership, with several Sahrawis taking to the Tindouf desert to denounce the move. Former Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud  condemned the “heinous act,” calling on the Polisario Front to hold the people involved in the act responsible in order to preserve the “honor  and privacy of the [Braika’s] entire family and tribe.” The case of the three activists did not make waves in the international community with few press outlets reporting on the illegal arrest, however, Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the arrest of the detainees in August. The Secretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, also briefly discussed the arrest of activists at his  UN report on the situation on Western Sahara in October. Paragraph 71 of the report indicates that the UN bodies were informed by the OHCHR on “the harassment, arrest, arbitrary detention and ill-treatment by Frente POLISARIO security forces of a human rights defender and a blogger engaged in documenting human rights violations in the region.”

Rabat – Amine Harit’s previous performance with the Moroccan national football team has not satisfied Morocco’s head coach Vahid Halilhodzic. The Bosnian coach has not named Harit on the 24 member squad list for the Mauritania and Burundi games. The games are part of the 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers. The international football player expressed surprise at not being called up for the games with a small caption on his social media. Harit commented on his non-selection on Canal Football Club, a sports show aired on Canal+ on Sunday, November 10. The 22-year old international said he does“not understand” why he was not called for the qualifier games. He said that he heard that the decision was due to “disciplinary problems that did not happen.” Harit recounted that he contacted the Atlas Lions coach to ask for the reason why he was not selected. “He told me that there were things he did not appreciate from both my club and myself, about the fact that I had some pain and my club asked me to be careful.” The Moroccan football player added that the Bosnian coach doesn’t “appreciate my performances.” “I understand, and I accept it.” Harit said that perhaps he is“not good enough” and added that he must work more to regain his place. “Of course I want to be in [Morocco’s] selection,” he said. Lol 😂👌🏼🇲🇦 — Amine Harit (@Amine_000) 7 novembre 2019  Harit was among key football players in former head coach Herve Renard’s selection. He participated with the Atlas Lions in the 2018 World Cup. Bundesliga News announced on October 18 that Harit won the Bundesliga September player of the month. The Bundesliga News added that the international player had an excellent month with his German football club Schalke 04. The 22-year old player scored four goals and made two assists in Bundesliga matches throughout September. Harit “saw off competition from Philippe Coutinho, Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski, Stefan Lainer and Christian Günter,” the Bundesliga report added. Harit, in an article he wrote earlier this year, expressed his attachment to Morocco. 🗨️ “Peut-être que je ne suis pas assez bon et qu’il faut que je travaille plus pour gagner ma place dans ce groupe. Mais bien sûr que j’ai envie d’être en sélection !” Notre invité @Amine_000 Harit revient sur sa non-convocation lors du dernier rassemblement du Maroc 🇲🇦 pic.twitter.com/AtQcrW7Ejh — Canal Football Club (@CanalFootClub) 10 novembre 2019  He shared his story with his fans, friends and relatives, and those who didn’t yet know his name. In  the “Remember the Name” article, Harit said that he loves France for giving him “everything in” in his life. Morocco, however, remains special for him because “Moroccans… are my people too.”

Rabat – A United Nations (UN) human rights independent panel of experts has said that the prison regime in Egypt led directly to the death of the Egyptian former president Mohamed Morsi, on June 17. “Morsi was held in conditions that can only be described as brutal, particularly during his five-year detention in the Tora prison complex,” said the panel in a statement.  “Morsi’s death after enduring those conditions could amount to a State-sanctioned arbitrary killing,” the UN panel added. The report on Morsi’s death concluded that; “Thousands more detainees across Egypt may be suffering gross violations of their human rights, many of whom may be at high risk of death.” The finding was based on credible evidence from various sources that the experts compiled and analyzed. Led by special rapporteur Agnes Callamard and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the human rights experts explicitly condemned prisoners’ rights violations in Egyptian prisons under the current Egyptian president’s government. “This appears to be a consistent, intentional practice by the current Government of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to silence dissenters,” commented the experts. The experts stated that prison authorities held Morsi in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day with no interaction with other prisoners even in the one hour accorded to him to exercise. Morsi slept on a concrete floor with only one or two blankets for warmth. He was not allowed access to books, journals, writing materials, or a radio. Prison authorities deprived Morsi of life-saving and ongoing care for his diabetes and high blood pressure. The UN panel reported that the treatment led to Morsi losing his vision in the left eye and repeatedly fainting. Despite being warned of Morsi’s decaying health, experts found that authorities did not undertake any actions to provide treatment or improve Morsi’s living conditions. Morsi was serving a 7-year-sentence for allegedly falsifying his candidacy application during the 2012 presidential campaign. He faced other accusations including inciting supporters to murder a journalist and two opposition protesters. His trial began in November 2013. The late president denied the accusations against him, saying that he was a victim of a military coup. Morsi’s deteriorated health condition led to his death on June 17after he collapsed during a court session. Experts reported that thousands of other prisoners “enduring similar conditions” include Dr. Morsi’s former foreign affairs adviser, Dr. Essam El-Haddad, and his son Mr. Gehad El-Haddad, who was the chief spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood at the time of his arrest. “These two men are effectively being killed by the conditions under which they are held and the denial of medical treatment. It appears that this is intentional or at the very least allowed to happen through the reckless disregard for their life and fate,” the experts declared. Prisoners are suffering from inadequate food, poor ventilation, no access to sunlight. The prison authorities have also denied family visits, and fail to provide necessary medical care. Prison guards also place detainees in solitary confinement for extended periods of time. The experts are closely monitoring the prisoners’ situation in Egypt and have called for the prosecution of those responsible for the inhumane conditions in Egyptian prisons. They are also calling for compensation to be paid to the victims’ families.

Rabat – A Moroccan expat died yesterday, November 10, in a hospital in Cairo, Egypt, after ten days in a coma. The passenger’s condition deteriorated during a Turkish Airlines flight on October 31. The flight was linking Medina, Saudi Arabia to Morocco. The plane, however, was forced to make an emergency landing in Cairo’s International Airport in order to provide the passenger with the necessary medical treatment. The Moroccan embassy in Cairo tracked the expat’s health condition following his admission to the intensive care unit of an Egyptian hospital. The embassy also covered all medical expenses. The man, however, remained in a coma until his death on Sunday. Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation, and Moroccans Living Abroad will take charge of repatriating the body to Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport in the next two days.

Rabat – In the Spanish general elections on Sunday, November 10, the far-right Vox party picked up Ceuta’s singular seat in Spain’s lower house, the Congress of Deputies. For the Senate, residents in Ceuta split the vote, sending one Vox politician and one center-right People’s Party politician to Madrid. Sunday was the first time voters in Ceuta, the Spanish enclave in Morocco, voted in larger numbers for Vox, a political party founded in 2013, than for any other party. In Spain’s general elections in April, the central-left socialist party (PSOE) won Ceuta’s lower house seat. Vox won nearly 12,000 votes in Ceuta, representing 35% of the votes. Voters in Melilla elected a center-right People’s Party politician. Spain’s socialist party retained hold of the most seats (120) of any party in the lower house. But Spain’s two largest parties on the right each picked up more seats than they had won in the April general election. The People’s Party won 88 seats, making it the second largest party in Spain, and Vox won 52 seats, making it the third largest. Having gained 28 more seats than in April, Vox has more than doubled its deputies in the lower house. With the success of the People’s Party and Vox, the socialist party did not win enough seats to form a government with other leftist parties, such as far-left party Podemos. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, after failing to form a government by a September deadline, had hoped to secure more seats for his socialist party to end months of deadlock. Vox is seen as an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party. The far-right party has proposed that the government should close down “fundamentalist” mosques. Ceuta is the scene of many attempts at irregular migration for Moroccans and sub-Saharan migrants. Migrants regularly attempt to scale the fences at the enclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla or to swim from the Moroccan side to the Spanish side of the border. The leader of Vox, Santiago Abascal, has called for Spain to build a wall around Ceuta and Melilla to prevent irregular immigration, saying that Morocco should pay for it. Vox has also proposed that Spain should deport all illegal migrants and any legal migrants who have committed a crime.

Essaouira – Wooden chalet style buildings lined the edge of the dusty street, and outside each a hut sat huddled groups of women and girls. Bare feet and splayed hands basked in the sun and the intricate golden-brown lines on each finger grew darker and darker. Small girls proudly showcased the designs traced on their small hands, and groups of older women flicked through images in albums and on smartphones.  The public setting and buzz of excited chatter blended strangely with the intimacy of the scene. The first summer I spent in Morocco was as a tourist, exploring Casablanca with the eye of someone not planning to stay. At the end of Ramadan, I watched the groups of women covertly as I walked slowly down the path behind a spice market. Intrigued, I wanted to be a part of the group and to share that excitement, to understand the history and culture behind that moment in the summer sun. And, three years later, I am slowly learning the importance of henna through my experiences of Morocco. In contrast to my initial view of henna tattoos on Casablanca street corners at exorbitant prices, I began to get a real insight into the power of henna at the end-of-school-year party for the preschool students at my husband’s school. Expecting party games and screaming, I was surprised to hear no such noises from our flat above the school. I pottered downstairs to find out what was missing from the so-called party.  However, rather than finding disappointed children, a queue of thrilled little girls waited for me. All dressed in their finest kaftans or takchitas (traditional Moroccan party dresses), they watched, fascinated and in awe, as the teacher finished the beautiful Amazigh (Berber) design on the first little girl’s hand. She, in turn, called out to me in excitement to look at the finished product.  Like so many little princesses, the girls showed off the unique patterns on their hands as they went to join the little boys playing musical statues in the adjoining classroom.  For the children, henna simply meant celebration and a moment of being beautiful and special. But, while this is one aspect of the tradition, it by no means tells the whole story. In Morocco, henna is part of the life cycle of a woman, and for me, symbolizes female friendship, shared experience, and solidarity.  Henna is a key part of Moroccan wedding ceremonies. At my own Moroccan wedding, we chose to include the symbolic henna application in the wedding party. Wearing a green takchita, symbolizing fertility, I sat in front of the wedding guests while the negafas (women responsible for the bride during a Moroccan wedding) applied the henna. My husband’s family explained to me that the henna, and the specific symbols, gave the bride luck and happiness. Henna also symbolizes the end of the girl’s life and, through her marriage, the beginning of the woman’s. Many Moroccan brides choose to dedicate a day to the henna ritual, a day that is shared with female friends and family. Sharing the ceremony in this way, with female companions and maternal figures, adds to the symbolism of mourning the girl and celebrating the birth of the woman in the presence of those who can understand and share her journey. It is not only henna tattoos that symbolize womanhood, or wifehood. According to Marie Anakee Miczak in her book “The History, Mystery, and Folklore of Henna,” Amazigh tribes used henna as a hair dye in order to differentiate married women. She explains that in mountain villages such as Ait Haddidou, “Akidou, their name for henna hair dye/mud, is applied to the hair of married or widowed women only.”  Miczak added that regions like Ait Haddidou, due to their remote locations, have retained more of the traditional Amazigh customs than Moroccans living in more easily accessible regions.  Henna is also part of a woman’s journey to motherhood. Some Moroccan women celebrate pregnancy with henna. Whether a full hand design or a simple spot of henna on the palm of the hand, in Moroccan tradition henna brings good luck and good health to both the mother and baby.  In February 2019, internet users all over the world hummed and hawed over Meghan Markle’s henna tattoo. When the duchess of Sussex visited Morocco with her husband Prince Harry, the grandson of the UK’s Queen Elizabeth II, she made a point of visiting a girls’ boarding house in the Atlas Mountains. The pupils, beneficiaries of the “Education for All” project, welcomed the royal duchess and celebrated her pregnancy with a henna tattoo.  One of their housemothers told People Magazine, “Now she is pregnant we do the henna to keep her happy with the baby. For good luck.” Luck is not henna’s only power, in Amazigh tradition henna can also protect women from the evil eye. Henna artists historically used painted symbols and patterns, in particular eyes and diamonds, to ward off evil spirits and the bad luck brought on by envious eyes.  In her book on Amazigh culture, “Amazigh Arts in Morocco: Women Shaping Cultural Identity,” Cynthia Becker explains that henna was used by traditional Amazigh communities during female “rights of passage,” including engagement, marriage, pregnancy, and widowhood, “due to its association with baraka (divine blessing).” She adds that henna protects women from jnoun (demons or evil spirits) during “crucial moments in the life cycle.” While some of the origins of the traditions outlined by Becker may have been forgotten, henna remains a key part of female celebration and, more importantly, a reflection of female solidarity and shared experience. It is true that the men do use henna on some occasions due to its links with baraka, circumcision and marriage for example, but it does not hold the same importance as for women.  When I recall seeing the women of Casablanca gather to celebrate with henna, I do not remember the details of the patterns or the faces, what I remember is the feeling of warmth and the atmosphere of joy and acceptance. When my mother visited Morocco for the first time to meet my husband’s family after our engagement, his mother organized a henna day. At the time, I remember thinking that it was a waste of an afternoon and worrying how my mother, the deputy head of a boarding school in the UK, would go back to school a week later with full hand tattoos.  However, after an afternoon of admiring each others’ designs, and asking and answering questions about weddings in our different cultures, I realized that the henna itself was not really the point. So, now, when my mother-in-law spends an afternoon mixing herbs and henna to color my hair and, painstakingly, paints the mixture onto my hair, I cherish it because it means that I have been accepted into the henna life cycle.  While there are obviously other perspectives on the matter and have experienced only a fraction of Morocco’s henna traditions, I see the henna tradition as one of support, solidarity, and acceptance. And, unlike the tourists’ view of the fading embellishments, the sense of being part of the ancient female tradition of henna is indelible.

Rabat – Three Moroccan inventors earned medals the BIXPO 2019 fair for energy transition and digital transformation in Gwangju, South Korea. Inventors Younes Karfa Bekali and Abdallah Ayache won “The best invention” award, while their compatriot, Rachid Oulad Madani, earned a bronze medal. BIXPO is a new technology exhibition, an international conference, and an international invention fair. It brings together leaders of the electric power industry. This year’s event took place from Wednesday, November 6 to Friday, November 8. Bekali, from Sale, and Ayache, from Kenitra, won the award for inventing a secure and waterproof rotary electrical socket. The invention had different safety features and consumes less energy than all its marketed counterparts. The award is not Bekali’s first. In 2016, the Moroccan inventor won an international award in Canada for a different invention. “This win was very special. When you hold the national flag in international events and you hear claps for Morocco, it gives you goosebumps,” Ayache told the press. Oulad Madani, from Tangier, said that “being able to have a stand at an international event such as BIXPO is an achievement in itself.” The bronze medalist earned his award despite his invention getting broken during the journey from Morocco to Korea. Oulad Madani invented an educational robot for children with special needs. Oulad Madani also received a decoration from the president of the National University of Callao in Peru. Around 160 inventions participated in “The best invention” competition, with inventors representing numerous countries from all over the world.

Rabat – Around 96% of Moroccan employees have admitted to suffering from stress related to their work and daily life. Mercer, the world’s largest human resources consulting firm, recently published the results of its study on the perception of work in Morocco. The main cause of stress, according to the report, is the lack of social security. Around 82% of employees declared that access to good health insurance programs is crucial. However, 45% of employees rely on public health services for medical treatment. Financial security is also important. Around 84% of employees said that a retirement plan is necessary, and 66% would like to change their job for a better salary. Income is the main reason for deciding to stay in the same city or look for opportunities elsewhere for 43% of employees. The main cities that Moroccans decide to live in to look for better jobs are Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangier. The study also revealed Moroccan employees’ fear of artificial intelligence (AI). About 28% of employees believe that AI will have a negative impact on their jobs and will be able to do half of their tasks in five years. Moreover, 39% of employees are afraid of losing their jobs in the next five years. Mercer’s report presented various suggestions for employers to retain their employees. According to the report, employers must listen to their workers’ demands to attract and retain talented professionals. They should also prioritize human skills over AI to have a competitive advantage. Finally, business owners have to adopt new ways of work and allow for flexibility and innovation to build a positive and motivating atmosphere for employees.

Rabat – Moroccans came to Paris from across France on Sunday, November 10, to raise the Moroccan flag in response to the burning of a Moroccan flag in a protest last month. The protesters gathered at the Place du Trocadero, a plaza opposite the Eiffel Tower, and waved Moroccan flags.  The Moroccan Dynamic Association (ADM) organized the demonstration along with other French civil society organizations, according to state-owned media outlet Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The demonstration came four days after the anniversary of the Green March, a day Moroccans celebrate national sovereignty and remember when they marched into Western Sahara in 1975. According to the French Mediapart outlet, the demonstrators in Paris sang the anthem of the Green March. MAP reported that demonstrators came from as far as Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. They chanted the national slogan, “God, the nation, the King.” Among the hundreds wearing and waving the flag was Moroccan singer Said Senhaji, Mediapart reported. On October 26, protesters gathered in Paris to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Mohcine Fikri. The fishmonger’s death at the hands of authorities ignited the Hirak Rif protests across Morocco’s northern Rif region in 2016 and 2017. Fikri’s work in the informal sector and his death became a symbol of the Rif region’s economic and social marginalization. Protests rocked the Rif region from late 2016 into 2017, ultimately leading to the arrest of dozens of protest leaders. A Moroccan court sentenced Hirak activist Nasser Zefzafi to 20 years in prison for his participation in the protests. From his prison cell, Zefzafi called for supporters of the Hirak Rif to commemorate Mohcine Fikri’s death. At the Paris protest, some people burned a Moroccan flag, raising the ire of the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad. Showing “contempt of the emblem and symbols of the kingdom” is illegal in Morocco and punishable by six months to three years in prison.

Rabat – Police near Rabat arrested a man and his wife for their alleged involvement in drug trafficking. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said on November 8 that the  police arrested the suspect in a rented vehicle in the region of Sidi Allal El Bahraoui near Rabat. Police seized  3,216 psychotic tablets and  unspecified quantity of cocaine during the arrest operation. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigations to determine the circumstances of the case. The operation is part of Morocco’s crackdown on drug trafficking and transnational criminal networks. The wali (governor) of the judicial police, Mohamed Dkhissi, said in September that DGSN seized 1,161,000 psychotropic pills from  January 1 to September 15 this year. Security services also seized 44 kilograms of cocaine and 6 kilograms of heroin during the same period. He said that DGSN seized nearly twice as many psychotropic pills in the same period last year, having seized 554,390 more.

Rabat – A Polisario leader and a young female separatist activist are in hot waters after revelations of “hard romance” between the two, igniting debates about the “credibility” and “virtues” of those entrusted with the mission of broadcasting the “Sahrawi cause” to the international community. Maghreb Leaks reported earlier this week that Bachir Oubi Bouchraya, the Polisario representative in Paris, and Aziza Hameida, the president of the Paris-based League of Young Sahrawis have been involved in a “very hot” romantic relationship. Titled “The Hard Romance of Polisario’s Paris Representative,” the report depicts the escapades of Bouchraya. The separatist official is said to have left “his wife and children to a difficult life in Bilbao, Spain, where they barely survive thanks to meager social aid from the Spanish government,” while he enjoys a luxurious life with another Polisario militant in Paris. “It is another type of militancy,” the report teased. The news quickly hit a chord in some pro-Polisario circles, with a wave of indignation and outrage in a number of separatist quarters. There have been suggestions that some of the separatist group’s representatives deserve neither the public’s trust nor the “honor” of being at the forefront of the front’s “righteous” struggle. In the meantime, however, a number of critical voices have played down the surprise and outrage the revelations may have elicited from the separatist group and their sympathizers, arguing that Bouchraya’s conduct should not be news to those with first-hand or in-depth knowledge of the group’s modus operandi. “This should not come as any surprise to us,” Clara Riveros, a Colombian political scientist specializing in the Western Sahara conflict, tweeted in reaction to the report. “Polisario delegates are only interested in leading pleasurable lives. They are keen to indulge their sexual desires, while depriving Sahrawis in Tindouf of fundamental freedoms.” In her Tweet, the Colombian political scientist took issue with Bouchraya’s “naive” conduct. “What particularly caught my attention is that your sexual adventures were with a Sahrawi. Isn’t that naïve of you?” Riveros’s surprise and her description of the Polisario official as naïve, she went on to explain, is because Polisario delegates are traditionally said to be more interested in having sexual adventures with foreigners. She suggested that foreign women are generally seen by the separatist leadership as more appealing because they can be seduced on two fronts: both as mistresses and as staunch advocates of the separatist cause in their respective countries. Lo que me llama la atención es que se involucre con una saharaui. Algo genuino? Me había dicho algún expolisario que prefieren seducir a las extranjeras por lo que de ellas pueden obtener para la “causa”. — CLARA RIVEROS (@CLARARIVEROS) 9 novembre 2019  “A former Polisario leader told me that they prefer to seduce foreign women from whom they can obtain more in terms of support for the cause,” Riveros pointed out in her tweet. In addition to revelations of the forbidden intimacy between the two Paris-based separatist militants, the Colombian Western Sahara specialist’s revelation of the front’s leaders’ instrumentalizing sex for support is set to be yet another low point for a group that has been hit by a series of scandals in the past months. In recent weeks, accusations of embezzlement and related scandals have proven a blow to the separatist group. In most of these instances, the front’s leadership was heavily criticized for indulging in luxurious lives abroad and sometimes in the Tindouf camps, while the people it claims to represent in Tindouf are left to live in squalid conditions.

Rabat – Morocco has become the first African country to use the video assistant referee (VAR) during a domestic game between Ittihad Athletic Sports of Casablanca (TAS) and El Jadida’s Difaa El Hassani on Saturday, November 9.  It was on the occasion of the first semi-final of the Throne Cup. And the second semi-final of the same competition, scheduled for today at 4 p.m (Moroccan time) between Hassania Agadir and Maghreb Athletic Tetouan in Marrakech, is also set to feature the video refereeing system. Morocco’s Football Federation (FRMF) announced on November 8 that the he International Football Association Board ( IFAB) had granted its accord for Morocco to use the VAR for the first time in a local game. Casablanca won yesterday’s first semi final game against El Jadida (1-0), qualifying for the final of Throne Cup.  TAS won the game thanks to a 120th minute penalty decided by the video system. The BBC reported that a committee from IFAB visited the Marrakech Stadium to look at the VAR set-up last week. Morocco  hosted a training session of VAR at the Mohammed VI Conference Palace in Skhirat near Rabat in September.

Rabat  – Moroccan police in collaboration with customs at the crossing point in Ceuta seized 130 kilogram of cannabis resin on November 7. A source from Moroccan customs told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that the joint operation enabled police to find the drugs hidden in a Spanish-registered vehicle. Police arrested the driver of the vehicle, who Spanish authorities said turned out to be a Moroccan national residing in Spain. Police put the suspect in custody in the city of Tetouan in Northern morocco for further investigations. The operation is part of Morocco’s determination to fight against drug trafficking and cross border crimes. In October, Moroccan customs announced that they had seized a total of 8,342 kilograms of cannabis since October 22. Meanwhile, police seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15, 2019.

Rabat – Immigration of Jews to Israel continues to this day, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on its Facebook page. Sharing statistics from the Population and Immigration Authority, the ministry said that as many as 432 Moroccan jews immigrated from Morocco to Israel in the last eight years. The ministry added that the number of Jews living in Arab countries at the end of World War II stood at 850,000. “Today, only about 3,900 Jews remain” in the Arab world, the ministry added According to a graphic shared by the ministry,  160 Jews immigrated to Israel from Tunisia in the last eight years. Around 119 others migrated from Yemen, while two Jews permanently left Algeria within the same period. A total of four Jews immigrated to Israel from Qatar, Lebanon, Bahrain, and Libya within the same period.  Despite the shrinking of the number of Jews living in Morocco, hundreds continue to travel to the North African country on different occasions of social or religious significance. Morocco’s Jewish population significantly decreased following the end of World War II.  International federation of Jewish communities and organizations World Jewish Congress (WJC) estimates that there are approximately 2,300 Jews still living in Morocco. The numbers represent fewer figures compared to 1948, when more than 200,000 Jews were living in the North African kingdom. Thousands immigrated to France, the United States, Canada, and especially to Israel—following the state’s establishment. The remaining Jewish communities are spread across mellah or walled cities in Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakech, Meknes, Tangier, and Fez.

Rabat – Now, more than ever, young people are making their presence known. From sports to science, talented and innovative youth are emerging at the forefront of public spheres.  Take Greta Thunberg, for example, the 16-year-old environmental activist from Sweden whose no-nonsense attitude towards climate change has earned her global recognition. Or consider the youth activists of the developing world, including young Moroccans, whose passion for the environment long preceded Greta’s scathing “How dare you?” speech of September 2019. Young people are not only making waves in activism—they are creating, competing, engineering, and healing.  Outstanding Moroccan youth, especially, have made headlines in recent years.  15-year-old Moroccan student Fatima Zahra Al Akhyar is prepared to win the 2019 Arab Reading Challenge in the UAE later this month. Fellow Moroccan Mariam Amjoun won the competition last year despite being the youngest participant at just nine years old. Young Moroccans recently earned medals in world competitions for Taekwondo, Karate, and Muay Thai.  A delegation of young Moroccans represented the Kingdom at the Shell Eco-Marathon, an energy efficiency competition, in July 2019. Moroccan amateur singer Hamza Labeid won best performance on The Voice Kids when he was only eleven years old.  Fatima Ezzahrae Benoughazi, a 22-year-old Moroccan woman, received the Common Ground Award for her contribution in mobilizing youth against extremism in 2017.  Walid Ijassi of Rabat, Morocco won a global entrepreneurship competition in 2016 when he was 19 years old.  The list goes on and on. Young Moroccans are routinely recognized for their athletic feats, artistic talents, ingenious engineering, entrepreneurship, humanitarian missions, and groundbreaking ideas.  But how can this creativity and innovation make a tangible impact in Morocco, where young people are generally excluded from the national dialogue on policymaking, despite being one of the most valuable social categories?  MML: Building bridges between youth and decision-makers Moroccan Millennium Leaders (MML) is driven by a simple question: “How can youth be decision-makers in Morocco?” MML is a non-profit association composed of young Moroccans who share the principles and values of commitment, citizenship, integrity, mobilization, and respect. “Morocco’s development prospects and the success of political and socio-economic changes depend, among other things, on the socialization conditions of young people,” MML believes.  MML’s goal is to enable young Moroccans to participate in the implementation and strengthening of national public policies, as well as Moroccan ambitions in Africa and in the world.  “In ten years, we will be the leaders,” Maroune El Idrissi, president of MML, told Morocco World News.   “We would like to see more Moroccan youth more engaged in decision making in this country.” In pursuit of this aim, MML works to reduce the gap between decision-makers and youth by bringing Morocco’s decision-makers out of their offices. At conferences, workshops, roundtables, and other “bridge-building” events, Morocco’s decision-makers can openly engage with and listen to the ideas and aspirations of Morocco’s youth.  Despite the association’s name and stated goals, MML does not exclusively cater to youth; rather, “we are trying to talk about the solidarity between generations,” El Idrissi said. “Youth are not the only people who can solve the problems in Morocco,” he continued. “We need the collective intelligence from all generations to find solutions to the challenges that we are facing.” Moreover, “we are trying to prepare a new generation of leaders in Morocco to be engaged with future challenges,” such as water scarcity, food insecurity, climate change, unemployment, and poverty.  “We must find innovative solutions,” he declared. “We don’t have another option.”  Women in MML Women’s empowerment in Morocco is best attained through engagement with public life and politics, MML believes. While working to empower youth, MML also gives Moroccan women space to raise their voices—but this is far easier said than done. “We have a lot of work to do in Morocco,” El Idrissi admitted. “Our society is still conservative, regardless of top-down reforms. We can only resolve that through education.”  Rural women, in particular, must not be excluded from the conversation of women’s rights in Morocco. El Idrissi noted that reforms such as the quota for female Members of Parliament is not enough, as such reforms do not impact women on the social and geographical peripheries.  “We need to change the view of women,” he argued. “Women are at the center of the household, but in public life, they are on the margins.” Confidence is key Similarly, a quota for youth in Parliament is not enough: Change needs to come from the average citizen.  “We can have the best laws in the world, but if youth don’t have the motivation to change their situation and empower the community, the laws won’t fix anything,” El Idrissi said.  The big mission, then, is to bring positivity to youth. This, in turn, will make young Moroccans more confident and involved with public life and more empowered to take on leadership initiatives. “We have the potential to be leaders and to empower youth, to empower our communities,” El Idrissi said.  “We see that Moroccans are talented and resilient,” he continued. “The youth are the solution, not the problem in Morocco.” The key to youth empowerment? Confidence, according to MML.  MML ultimately aims to give youth confidence in their own ability to take leadership. The future is in the hands of young people who have the skills and ability to be the change that the world needs.  Through engagement, outreach, and education, MML is working to empower young Moroccans to become agents of countrywide change. While this initiative begins within individuals and their communities, MML is providing Moroccan youth with the tools to take charge and enact change as future leaders of their country.

Rabat – Members of the Muslim community in France will march in Paris on Sunday, November 10 starting from 12 p.m. to decry the scourge of Islamophobia. AFP reported that the Collective Against Islamophobia in France or NPA and other activists called for activists to raise their voice against  a wave of hatred targeting Muslims in France. The initiative to protests against Islamophobia started on November 1 after the attack on a mosque in Bayonne by a former right wing activist on October 28. The attack resulted in two serious injuries.  The march will be organized under the slogan “Stop Islamophobia” in response to te growing discrimination against Muslims in France. A recent study from the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) found that 42% of Muslims in France said they have experienced religious discrimination at least once in their lives. The study added that 60% of women wearing a headscarf were subject to discrimination, while 37% of them have been victims of verbal harassment and insults. Women who do not wear headscarf were also subject to discrimination for their religion. Headscarf or hijab is a topical issue in France nowadays, dividing public opinion with some calling for its ban in public spaces. On October 11, Julien Odoul, a member of France’s National Rally (RN), the country’s leading right-wing political party, asked a Muslim woman to remove her hijab while she was accompanying her son on a school trip.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has granted royal pardon to 300 people on the occasion of Eid Al Mawlid Nabawi, a Muslim holiday marking the anniversary of the birth of Prophet Mohammed.  The Ministry of Justice announced the news on november 9, detailing in its statement  that 103 of the 300 beneficiaries had their prison terms reduced. The royal pardon also includes 36 prisoners who benefited from pardon over their remaining prison terms. 10 others benefited from the initiative over their imprisonment terms while their fines were maintained. The statement added that three inmates benefited from the pardon over their prison terms and fines. The royal initiative also annulled fines for 42 prisoners. The royal pardon is customary in Morocco to mark national and religious holidays. Today marks the anniversary of the birth of Muhammad the prophet. For the event, King Mohammed VI chaired a religious ceremony on Saturday, November 9 in his Marrakech royal palace. Crown Prince Moulay Hassan and Prince Moulay Rachid and prince Moulay Ismael attended the ceremony.

Rabat – Planting trees is “the most effective way to fight global warming,” according to a study released July 4. Swiss scientists tracked current global tree cover, and reported that the world has 0.9 billion hectares of land available for a trillion or more new trees. After excluding urban and agricultural lands, the scientists landed on a figure which is roughly the size of the continental US. The 30 plus scientists found that the new trees could absorb over 200 billion tons of carbon. Humans have released roughly 300 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. “Our study provides a benchmark for a global action plan, showing where new forests can be restored around the globe. Action is urgent and governments must now factor this into their national strategies to tackle climate change,” said the study’s lead scientist, Jean-Francois Bastin. As straightforward as global reforestation may sound, in an era when Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s policies threaten to deforest vast swaths of the Amazon for profit, even a seemingly simple solution is far from so. “It’s certainly a monumental challenge, which is exactly the scale of the problem of climate change,” said Thomas Crowther, one of the study’s co-authors. Crowther is the chief scientific advisor to the UN Trillion Trees Campaign.  Crowther argued the straightforward logic to implementing this solution: “This is by far—by thousands of times—the cheapest climate change solution.” It is certainly cheaper than today’s manmade carbon capture technologies. The idea of forests as “carbon sinks” is not new, but the study reports a new scale of hope. It does so with unprecedented accuracy in current and future climate conditions. It is able to map where trees can be planted and how much carbon dioxide (CO2) they can absorb. Still, many scientists disagree with the study’s assertions. Tree planting alone cannot solve climate change. Fossil fuels emissions must be cut significantly, and there is no simple fix to circumvent this reality. Crowther is quick to acknowledge this: “None of this works without emissions cuts.” Today, climate justice’s ultimate goal is to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This is the basis for the Paris Agreement, a non-binding mechanism for developed countries to curb emissions, developing countries to continue their right to develop, and developed countries to assist developing countries in doing so on a low-carbon path. Plants breathe in CO2, so reforestation is a basic step in combating climate change. But no amount of trees can absorb everything humans are spewing into the Earth’s atmosphere. “Yes, heroic reforestation can help,” said Myles Allen of Oxford University. “But it is time to stop suggesting there is a ‘nature-based solution’ to ongoing fossil fuel use. There isn’t. Sorry.” Trees cannot replace emissions cuts. But that is not the only problem other scientists have spotted with the study’s findings.  Some researchers pointed out that today’s grasslands, that will host tomorrow’s forests, are undervalued. Grasslands do not face vulnerability to forest fires, which increases as global temperatures rise and rainfall patterns shift. Grasslands might absorb less heat than trees, due to their lighter color. Some studies have shown that planting large numbers of trees in savannahs can decrease river levels and even dry streams. “The authors have forgotten the carbon that’s already stored in the vegetation and soil of degraded land that their new forests would replace,” argued two professors from University College London. This means carbon released during reforestation must be deducted from the study’s absorption figure, and the amount is not negligible.  The same researchers argued that the study’s estimated carbon capture capacity is faulty as it assumes forests will only take a few decades to reach maturity. In reality, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, such maturity could take centuries longer. The study presents another drawback at the human level. Promising a cheap and easy solution to climate change may lead to “mitigation deterrence,” according to Professor Duncan McLaren of Lancaster University. He explains that promising such an easy future solution makes it “less likely that time and money will be invested in reducing emissions now.” McLaren warns that over-celebrating such a study could harm momentum in the climate justice movement. Urgency is, after all, pushing a global focus on climate change after decades of sidelining the topic. The study’s findings are not bulletproof. But they do make some recommendations that few could argue against. The study points out goal and approach inconsistencies in different global reforestation projects. It also cautions that “better country-level forest accounting is critical for developing effective forest management and restoration strategies,” according to a news release that accompanied the study’s publication. Morocco and Lebanon will host pilot programs in reforestation and land management. An initiative from the Union for the Mediterranean and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization will focus on these two Mediterranean countries because they are regional biodiversity hotspots. Programs will focus on Morocco’s Maamora Forest near Rabat and Lebanon’s Chouf and Bkassine Regions.  The “Scaling up forest and landscape restoration to restore biodiversity and promote joint mitigation and adaptation approaches in the Mediterranean” project was announced during the 6th annual Mediterranean Forest Week summit, hosted this April in Lebanon.  Consistency, as urged by the Swiss study, is a key benefit in the new program, according to Chadi Mohanna, the director of rural development and natural resources in Lebanon’s Ministry of Agriculture. Mohanna praised the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s focus on bringing together national stakeholders to standardize and harmonize restoration efforts. The four-year $2 million program will include this focus at both national and regional levels.  Regardless of criticism against the Swiss study’s highly optimistic prognosis, reforestation is a likely move in these warm Mediterranean countries. The project will help the two countries meet National Determined Contributions submitted for the Paris Agreement, according to Miguel Garcia-Herraiz Roobaert, Union for the Mediterranean deputy secretary general for environment and water. The Swiss study’s basic argument insists that carefully managed reforestation is a powerful tool to combat climate change. The projects in Morocco and Lebanon may shed further light on the study’s findings. More importantly, they will take part in “the global and political will to fight for our world” that a World Wide Fund for Nature Forestry Lead emphasized in reaction to the new report.

Rabat – Stuffed eggplant is one of the most popular appetizers in Morocco, it can also be served as a side dish. Restaurant menus and household meal plans often boast a variant of the recipe.  While some Moroccan cooks choose to stuff the eggplant with vegetarian options such as tomato sauce and grated cheese, others prefer to add ground beef.    I’m going to share with you my own take on stuffed aubergine. In this recipe, I will show you how to stuff the eggplant with chermoula sauce, usually used for stuffing fish. I find that the chermoula complements the distinctive flavor of the eggplant and makes for a special, unique starter.  You will need: 4 medium eggplants 2 small green or red peppers, cut into small dices 2 cloves of garlic, minced juice from half a lemon 2 tablespoon of minced parsley 2 tablespoon of minced cilantro ½ teaspoon of salt, to taste½ teaspoon of black pepper ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon of ground cumin 1 teaspoon of paprika2 tablespoon of olive oil  Now let’s get started: Make 4 cuts on the eggplants lengthwise, but keep them attached at the base. In a bowl put the spices, garlic, parsley, cilantro, oil, peppers, and lemon juice and mix well. Take the eggplants and fill them with chermoula and put them aside.  Now, ¼ cup of water and 2 tablespoon olive oil in a pressure cooker. Place the stuffed eggplants into the cooker and cover it. Put the pressure cooker on a low heat and cook for 15 minutes. Uncover the cooker, remove the eggplants, and place them on a plate. Drizzle some sauce on the top and serve them hot as an appetizer. Delicious!

Rabat – After a video of teenagers inhaling glue at a Moroccan school circulated on social media, Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) is mobilizing to strengthen security around schools. According to the Arabic-language daily Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the DGSN aims to target drug trafficking, indecent acts, and misdemeanors by boosting security around schools.  The same source reported on November 9 that implementing this reform includes ensuring a permanent police presence at schools in all provinces and prefectures of Morocco. DGSN is calling for police brigades and reinforcements during the hours of entry and exit.  DGSN’s announcement also encourages security services to increase their operations in schools and fight against all forms of delinquency. The reforms come after a video of teenage boys and girls inhaling glue made its rounds on social media. The video was filmed near a school in Beni Mellal, a city in the Atlas mountains 200 kilometers north of Marrakech.  The teenagers were identified and interviewed by the police, who then arrested the glue supplier.  MP Hicham Sabri, a member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), addressed the rising frequency of this phenomenon at Moroccan schools during the last oral question session of Parliament.  After analyzing the glue used by the teenagers in Beni Mellal, specialists determined it to be a psychotropic substance that can have devastating effects on those who inhale it.  DGSN reported that 3,015 crimes had been committed around Moroccan schools in 2018. Police arrested 3,122 individuals, including 587 minors, around schools last year.  Additionally, police seized 6,483 kilograms of cannabis resin and 143 psychotropic tablets near schools in 2018.  According to reports sent to the Ministry of the Interior and the DGSN, heightened police presence near schools resulted in a decrease in drug trafficking, harassment, and knife crime.  The new DGSN initiative, bolstered by thousands of new recruits to the force and several new police stations, aims to preserve the safety of schoolchildren and reduce crime among Moroccan youth.

Rabat – Tomorrow, November 10, Muslims in Morocco and around the world will celebrate Eid Al Mawlid, the birthday of prophet Muhammad. In the city of Sale, however, celebrations start today. Sale, Rabat’s twin city, is known for its annual “Candle Convoy.” The city holds the celebration the day before Eid Al Mawlid to commemorate the birth of prophet Muhammad. The carnival inaugurates a week full of festivities. Sale’s “Candle Convoy” is an artistic and religious carnival. Participants in the convoy carry large frames of wood, decorated with colorful candles in various shapes. The wooden frames can weigh as much as 50 kg and take the forms of domes and minarets, inspired from the Islamic architecture. The colored candles create Arabic words such as “Allah” (God) or praises to the prophet. The celebration starts after Al Asr prayer (afternoon) on the 11th day of Rabi’ Al Awwal, the third month of the Islamic calendar. The people carrying the decorated candles start their march from the main market of Sale’s old town. The march attracts thousands of participants who dance to folk music from musical groups accompanying the crowds. The convoy reaches its destination, the “Square of Martyrs,” after travelling through some of the city’s main avenues. The origin of the carnival dates back to the 16th century, when the Saadi Dynasty ruled Morocco. Ahmad Al Mansur, also known as Al Mansur Eddahbi (The Golden Mansur), the Sultan of the dynasty between 1578 and 1603, was fascinated by a parade of candles in Istanbul, the Ottoman Empire, before his reign. After he ascended to the throne, he decided to celebrate Eid Al Mawlid in the same way. The first “Candle Convoy” took place in the year 986 of the Islamic calendar, 1578 CE. At the time, it was a nationwide celebration, observed in all the major cities of the Sultanate. As time went by, the celebration survived in the city of Sale alone, becoming its most famous event. At the end of the march, at night, participants engage in “The Dance of the Candle.” The candles light up the streets while the attendees start dancing to traditional Andalusian music and Madih songs, songs that praise the prophet. The celebration ends with a feast, featuring various Moroccan dishes.

Rabat – A Tangier judge sentenced Felix Ramos to nine years in prison after finding him guilty of statutory rape and indecent assault of two minors. The judge announced the sentence on Thursday, November 7. In addition to the prison sentence, the judge ordered that the accused pay MAD 60,000 in compensation to the anti-pedophilia NGO “Don’t Touch My Child.” The accused is a journalist and owner of a television channel in Marbella, Spain. Ramos is known to the Spanish and Moroccan courts for selling falsified titles, distinctions, and diplomas on behalf of several institutions.  One of Ramos’s victims filed a complaint against the Spanish national in June of 2018. Although the 20-year-old Moroccan withdrew his complaint on September 12, 2019, prosecutors pursued the case despite the significantly weakened evidence.  During the trial, Ramos, assisted by an interpreter, denied all the charges alleged against him. This maneuver earned him the maximum penalties for his crimes, according to French-language news outlet Le360. The victim accused Ramos of raping him when he was 14 and living at a homeless shelter in Tangier.  According to the Arabic-language daily Assabah, Ramos frequently visited the homeless shelter where the victim resided. He approached the 14-year-old boy and offered to teach him photography.  Ramos also promised the boy documentation and accommodation in Spain. The TV presenter then invited the boy to a five-star hotel in Tangier, where the first instance of sexual assault took place. Ramos took the victim on trips to Casablanca, Marrakech, and Chefchaouen. During these trips, the pedophile continued to rape the boy. The abuse continued for three years, and Ramos paid the boy to stay silent.  In the initial June 2018 report, the victim alleged that the accused invited Rafael Ojeda, a 41-year-old flamenco singer from Sevilla, to join the abuse. Ojeda reportedly raped the victim for four days.  When the victim withdrew his complaint from Tangier’s court on September 12, prosecutors feared that Ramos would escape jail time. Taib Bouchaiba, the regional coordinator of “Don’t Touch My Child,” believes the victim received money from Ramos’s circle.  According to Bouchaiba, other homeless young people in Tangier could have been victims of similar abuses. “These children living on the street are the new victims of pedophiles who come here for what is called ‘sex tourism,’” he said. These young people seek for the most part to sell their bodies to survive. “It’s an easy solution when they need money. They do not always want to lodge a complaint because they live on it,” says Bouchaiba. “It took several days for the young man to trust us and eventually file a complaint,” he added. Thanks to the Tangier Court of Appeal, Ramos will not be walking free anytime soon. While this is a victory in Morocco, Bouchaiba believes that Ramos is only one part of a wider network of foreign pedophiles.

Rabat – Japan’s leading conglomerate Sumitomo is poised to drive up its investments in Morocco with the business giant looking to make the most of the North African country’s increasing international appeal. With Britain set to leave the European Union and Morocco having recently signed a tariff-free, “continuity agreement” with London, Sumitomo is joining forces with Tanger Med, Morocco’s newly completed game-changer port, to establish a Europe-bound export hub in Morocco. “Sumitomo corps is setting Morocco to be an alternative manufacturing hub in the post-Brexit world,” read a report from a Japanese paper. “Tanger Med and Sumitomo aim to attract manufacturers operating in Britain that are hunting for a new export base in the European Union as the UK’s drawn-out divorce from Brussels threatens to disrupt trade.” The report went on to wittily describe Morocco as “Europe’s Mexico,” referencing the tariff-free deals between the US and its Latin American neighbor, as well as the enormous trading transactions between the two countries. The initiative, which entails the acquisition by Sumitomo of five industrial parks near Tangier, is set to serve as bait for “luring” more Japanese manufacturers into exporting to Europe. Shipments from Tanger Med to EU countries can reach destination in a week, making the Moroccan port an ideal export base for Europe-bound products. Morocco’s own investments in key sectors like automotive and aeronautics have made it a valued market and a regional hub. With the added advantage of its geographical position as a bridge to different markets, the North African kingdom has cemented its place as a cherished place for investors. Speaking of how “Japan greatly values its partnership with Morocco,” a high-profile Japanese diplomat recently said that an increasing number of Japanese companies are setting their sight on the North African kingdom. In terms of international exchanges, the Japanese officer argued, Japanese investors consider Morocco as “a gateway to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.”

Rabat – The minister of Energy, Hydrocarbons, and the environment Aziz Rabbah signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Center for Energy and Nuclear Science and Technology (CNSTN), the American Long Island University, France’s Dassault Systemes, and the national Canadian laboratory Canadian Nuclear Laboratories.  The signatories inked the MoU on Thursday, November 8 in Rabat.  The MoU aims to establish a strategic partnership (consortium) to contribute to the strengthening of nuclear medical services in Morocco, and to improve the production processes for radioactive pharmaceuticals. During the signing ceremony, Rabbah called for enhancing African cooperation in line with King Mohammed VI’s instructions to strengthen African cooperation. He also recalled the strategic relations that Morocco maintains with French, American and Canadian partners. The minister commended the pivotal role that the CNSTN plays in Africa and in the nuclear field. CNSTN’s main role is to promote scientific research and the application of nuclear techniques, the organization also prepares the technological bases necessary for the introduction of nuclear power in Morocco. He also called for strengthening work on three levels to develop this sector, namely education, training, scientific research, and the transition to pharmaceutical manufacturing. The MoU is aimed primarily at improving international nuclear medicine services, particularly on the African continent, through a new and innovative approach to the value chain of radioactive pharmaceutical production. The agreement also involves improving production processes in nuclear research reactors and accelerators and the development of education and training programs in African countries. The training programs include certification in nuclear medicine and radiation pharmacy. Through the MoU, the CNSTN will benefit from shared best practices with its renowned partners with the aim of strengthening nuclear medicine services in Morocco.

Washington DC –  The events of 1989 really were momentous in Europe. The Iron Curtain was beyond repair, so the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9 signaled—seemingly out of nowhere—a new era.  The Cold War, the dominant political, economic and strategic narrative that had defined the continent since 1945 was rapidly coming to an end. But who could have been prepared for the speed of that demise? German unification came in October 1990 and 14 months later the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is in part a testament to US leadership at the time that as the Berlin Wall collapsed and German unification unfolded (as well as the realignment of Eastern Europe) those momentous events were rightfully credited to a mix of skilled statecraft from European political giants like German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet Premier Michael Gorbachev, as well as a legitimate desire by Germans to live in an undivided nation.  When advisors to US President George Bush suggested that he travel to Berlin as the wall came down to claim ultimate success in the Cold War struggle, he reportedly responded, “What would I do? Dance on the wall?”  Bush saw the importance of restraint by American, German, and Soviet leadership during turbulent events. The decades-long American commitment to militarily defend Western Europe following World War II helped set the stage for enduring prosperity in the EU that slowly took root after the wall fell. Fast forward to 2019. We have a far different Europe, far different challenges, a far different American president and a vastly different political environment across the continent.  US President Donald Trump views key European allies with a measure of skepticism, and he has emphasized the need for Europeans to make greater financial contributions to the NATO military alliance and to take a greater role in their own security.  Agree or disagree, Trump’s blunt assessments have had an impact. In a Paris speech last year to French ambassadors, Macron proposed a blueprint for a more European-oriented defense strategy that would complement the transatlantic alliance and NATO. “It’s up to us to meet our responsibilities and guarantee our security, and therefore European sovereignty,” said Macron. Macron is right. Europe faces new challenges that have little in common with the Cold War playbook. Irregular migration, inward-looking nationalism on both sides of the Atlantic, economic dislocation, Brexit, Russia as both trading partner and regional neighbor (though it is no longer the Soviet Union nemesis, an uneasy relationship remains), and more consternate continental leaders.  Europe is critically important for global security beyond just the health of the European Union; the largest single market in the world remains a destination for people and goods from around the globe. The heartbreaking discovery of 39 Vietnamese migrant bodies in a lorry container in Essex, England, two weeks ago is testament to that fact. In 2003, then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld infamously derided the Germany-France relationship as representative of “old Europe” as the US sought European support for the eventual invasion of Iraq. Old Europe still matters, and how Berlin and Paris cooperate on key issues often sets the tone for the rest of the EU. A new Pew Research Center survey of 19,000 EU and non-EU citizens regarding views on the general progress that the continent has made since the fall of the Berlin Wall indicates general support for the move to more democracy and market economies. But the report also noted the apparent disconnect between segments of society: “There is widespread agreement that elites have gained more from the enormous changes of the past 30 years than average citizens have.”  Migration is one example of the EU struggling to form a unified policy for the 21st century. As a recent policy brief from the European Council on Foreign Relations noted, the EU has yet to construct a coherent and unified migration and asylum processing model: “The bloc’s current approach to cooperation with third countries is marked by unstable, security-driven deals and an insular, not-in-my-backyard approach that leads to chaotic governance.” In the absence of a broader EU-wide mass migration and asylum framework, individual members will work with regional partner nations.  Morocco, for instance, now partners with Spain to combat irregular migration across the western Mediterranean. Morocco has reportedly stopped 57,000 irregular migrants from crossing to Spain this year alone. In turn, Spain has committed to providing Morocco an additional €32 million (beyond other EU financial commitments to Morocco) for migration control efforts and equipment.  Italy has just renewed an agreement with Libya to control irregular migration across the Mediterranean, too. The challenges for the EU will be to work with North African and other nations on migration issues that protect and respect EU member state borders while acknowledging the critically important role that departure point nations play in EU security and migration matters—not to mention the importance of the migrant workforce in the EU economy. Security, economic, political, humanitarian and electoral issues are now often linked together by politicians and political parties in Europe.  The dynamics are complex and contradictory at times. Hungary may balk at permitting Syrian refugees to settle in the country, but low domestic birth rates and an exodus of young educated Hungarian workers westward has meant the country is now actively pursuing foreign workers from Mongolia, Serbia, and elsewhere.  Here the challenge is to give meaning to both the benefits and the responsibilities of a genuine union. Russia remains an important EU trading partner despite tensions over Crimea and other security issues. How the EU balances the views and priorities of member states at the eastern end of the union like Poland and Hungary, where civil society institutions are facing increasing restrictions, with the views from Berlin, Paris, and Brussels will demonstrate the long-term durability of a European union. Though Euroscepticism is widespread, including the caricature of free-spending Eurocrats in Brussels, the EU annual budget (€148 billion in 2019) represents less then 2% of combined member nation budgets. Brexit—no matter its outcome—demonstrated the power of citizens who reside outside the power centers of a nation to effect dramatic change in national policy. The same goes for the rise in influence of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party in eastern Germany, particularly at the expense of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. Even with a sprawling population of 513 million citizens, all EU politics is seemingly local. The challenge for a new generation of EU leaders is to build on the success of the past union and to secure prosperity and security through relationships with domestic partners committed to strengthening core values. Those values led Europe to become the largest single market in the world and created an enduring transatlantic alliance with countries like the US and Canada and now rising regional leaders like Morocco. Thirty years after the wall, a renewal is required. In ways large and small, it is already underway.

Rabat – A candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Algeria has called for diplomatic rapprochement between Morocco and Algeria, reigniting talks on promising prospects for Algeria-Morocco relations. Ali Benflis, a former Prime Minister now running for presidential office in Algeria, said in a televised interview that Rabat and Algiers needed to settle their differences and work together towards establishing a strong Maghreb Union. “Moroccans are our brothers and neighbors,” the Algerian politician told Algerian El Bilad TV channel. “Algerians are neither enemies of Moroccans or adversaries of the Moroccan people.” Benflis’s emphasis, as he spoke about the regional significance of both countries, soon drifted to the closed borders between the two neighbors, a policy many have decried in Algiers and Rabat. Benflis joined the growing ranks of “Let’s open our borders” advocates, arguing that the 1994 policy does not benefit either country. He acknowledged, however, the complexity of the issue, pleading for intricate political steps from both sides. “This question needs to be posed in the way of a holistic political dossier. There is a need for negotiations and debate.” The presidential candidate’s call comes weeks after another established political voice in Algiers, a former secretary general of the country’s historically leading party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), said that the two North African neighbors needed to “break the impasse” and specially settle what he saw as an uncalled for hostility on the Western Sahara question. “Western Sahara is Moroccan and nothing else,” Amar Saadani, the former FLN secretary-general, notably stressed in his comments. While Benflis’s statements are not as emphatically pro-Rabat, they also buttress the impression, however erratic and uncertain, of a growing Western Sahara fatigue in the new—emerging—political configuration in Algiers. There have been reports of an emerging crop of political leaders who want to bury hostilities with Rabat once and for all. Meanwhile, in Rabat, the consensus on the question has long been an increased readiness to discuss normalization. This has especially been the case ever since King Mohammed VI extended his hands, saying Rabat was poised for “frank dialogue” that could pave the way towards normalization of bilateral relations and regional cooperation.

Rabat – Ahmed Aboutaleb, growing up as a young boy in the remote village of Beni Sedil, located in the northern Nador province of Morocco, would have found it difficult to imagine that he would one day don the mayoral chain of Rotterdam, one of the largest cities in the Netherlands. Though the odds were against him, over the last 10 years Aboutaleb has proved an invaluable mayor of Rotterdam to both friend and foe. During his recent trip to Morocco, Aboutaleb spoke to Morocco World News about the current debate revolving around dual-citizenship in Europe, what it means to be regarded as an example of “successful integration,” and whether he would like to exchange his mayorship one day for the office of prime minister. An envelope for the King As the first Moroccan-born mayor in the Netherlands, Aboutaleb’s inauguration made worldwide headlines back in 2009. In the wake of President Obama’s election, Aboutaleb was hailed as “the Obama on the Maas,” referring to the well-known river through which Rotterdam has asserted itself as the third-largest port city in the world, reported the Guardian. “The son of an Islamic preacher became the first Moroccan-born mayor of a Dutch city,” the New York Times wrote.  The Moroccan’s appointment was groundbreaking in a country where almost 1 million people adhere to Islam. But Aboutaleb’s inauguration put some noses out of joint as well. At the mayoral inauguration, Marco Pastors, a politician of the far-right, Rotterdam-based party “Leefbaar Rotterdam,” presented Aboutaleb with an envelope that was addressed to the King of Morocco. Pastors urged Aboutaleb to send his Moroccan passport back to Morocco, suggesting that, as a dual citizen, Aboutaleb’s loyalty to the Netherlands would waver. “After having lived for 32 years in the Netherlands, I refuse to have my loyalty questioned,” Aboutaleb responded to the ploy by Leefbaar Rotterdam. But it was not the first time Aboutaleb’s loyalty was openly questioned. Blond hair and a Swedish passport “Before I became mayor of Rotterdam, I served as deputy minister at the Ministry of Social Affairs from 2007 until 2008. Doubt was cast about my loyalty, by far-right politician Geert Wilders who argued along the lines of ‘there is no place for a Muslim in the Dutch government,’” Aboutaleb told MWN. When the new Dutch government was installed in early 2007, Wilders proposed a motion of no confidence on behalf of his Party for Freedom (PVV), expressing disdain for Aboutaleb’s appointment. Wilders argued that Aboutaleb’s Islamic background was not necessarily behind the move by stating, “If Mr. Aboutaleb would have had blond hair and a Swedish passport, I would be saying the same thing.” Not easily provoked, but not insensitive to criticism either, Aboutaleb responded by stating: “If I were to discard my Moroccan passport, would I be considered more loyal to the Netherlands or will that suffice? Or should I burn the Qur’an after that as well?” The hot-tempered discussions of dual-citizenship are not devoid of selective outrage, Aboutaleb points out. “Recently the discussion of dual-citizenship resurfaced, on account of Brexit. Several political parties in the Dutch parliament argued for Dutchmen who are working and living in the United Kingdom, to have a second passport. As you can understand, that made me smile a little,” Aboutaleb told MWN. With the pending Brexit hanging over the heads of many expats working in the United Kingdom, a majority of the Dutch Parliament recently voted in favor of a legislative safety valve for the roughly 100,000 Dutchmen working and living in the United Kingdom. This safety valve would allow Dutchmen the right to hold on to their Dutch passport, in addition to a British one, since Parliament fears for the uncertain legal liabilities of Brexit. The long arm of Rabat Among the Moroccan diaspora, dual-citizenship can be a thorn in one’s side, however. In late September, a group of outspoken Dutch-Moroccans signed a manifesto, calling for the right to be free from the “Long arm of Rabat.” “We, Dutch citizens with dual nationality, the Moroccan nationality, which we have not freely chosen, turn to Dutch society and the Dutch government to help us get rid of the fear and lack of freedom inevitably linked to our second nationality,” the manifesto states. When asked about the manifesto, Aboutaleb commented on the manifesto to MWN by saying: “It’s unbefitting of a mayor to involve himself with the internal affairs of a country. Morocco has its own legislative bodies and as a Dutch mayor I have to respect that. Having said that, I do respect the desire of the signatories of the manifesto and their right to renounce their Moroccan identity.” Nevertheless, Aboutaleb has become, along with other prominent Dutch-Moroccans such as Khadija Arib, speaker of the House of Representatives, and Hakim Ziyech, regarded as one of the best football players of the Netherlands, a shining example of “successful integration,” while having two passports. But can you only be considered an example of successful integration when you have become mayor of a large Dutch city, have risen to the upper echelons of politics or grown up to be one of the best football players a country has to offer? Aboutaleb understands the notion, but with a worn-out narrative in which dual-citizenship is often conflated with questionable loyalty or unwillingness to integrate, he does not mind being an often-called on example. “The Netherlands can be rightfully proud of Dutch-Moroccans such as Arib and Ziyech. Personally, I do not find it tiresome to be an often-called example, ultimately someone has to be,” Aboutaleb explained to MWN. Yes, prime minister? After 10 years of serving as mayor of Rotterdam, Aboutaleb expresses great enthusiasm for his work. “In my professional capacity as a mayor, this is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I have given and received a great deal. With a lot of hardworking executive council members, cut out of varying political cloth, members of the municipality, and of course, thanks to the effort of many citizens, we have endeavored together to improve the city of Rotterdam.” There was a time when his office of mayorship was rumored to be exchanged for the office of prime minister. When the Social Democratic Party was down in the polls in 2016, well-known pollster Maurice de Hond held a survey indicating 13% of the Dutch electorate would vote for the Social Democratic Party, provided Aboutaleb would serve as its new political leader. And, if pitted against Prime Minister Mark Rutte during the elections of 2017, Aboutaleb would have won 18% more of the votes, according to the poll by de Hond. Though Aboutaleb held down the fort during the elections of 2017 as mayor of Rotterdam, when asked by MWN if he would consider becoming prime minister in the future, Aboutaleb abstained from any soothsaying: “I do not have a glass ball to gaze into with which I can see the future. I consider myself very lucky with all that I have and I am very curious what life further has in store for me.”

Rabat – A new documentary is setting out to shed light on Morocco’s transformation during King Mohammed VI’s two decades of reign. Titled “Morocco: A King, A Vision, An Ambition,” the documentary was screened in preview at the Lincoln Center in New York on the evening of Thursday, November 7, as hundreds of high-profile guests gathered under the auspices of the Moroccan embassy in the US. The documentary explores the “positive transformations” that have marked King Mohammed’s two decades in power, according to a report from Morocco’s state-owned news outlet. The documentary focuses its narrative on the socio-economic transformations witnessed under the monarch’s “enlightened royal vision,” as well as the social reforms and the big infrastructure plans that have increased Morocco’s global and continental appeal. Speaking after the preview screening, Lalla Joumala Alaoui, Morocco’s ambassador to the US, said the documentary was a vibrant testimony to the positive effects of the King’s “enlightened vision” for Morocco and the Moroccan people. She corroborated the documentary’s main talking points, insisting on the King’s “transformative” role in the modernization of the country. “The screening of this documentary represents for us, Moroccans and friends of Morocco, the opportunity to celebrate, in this city that symbolizes the best of the American dream, our own success story and our own Moroccan dream.” The “Moroccan dream,” Ambassador Alaoui went on to argue, has largely been possible because of King’s Mohammed VI’s own implication in the implementation of a royal vision-guided roadmap for both infrastructure projects and social inclusion policies. Also prominent in the Moroccan ambassador’s argument was the number of recent political and social reforms to further consolidate Morocco’s democratic experience. She described the monarch as a “King of the people, genuinely committed to bettering the living conditions of his people.” Speaking after the screening, Omar Hilale, Morocco’s UN Ambassador, highlighted the kingdom’s growing role in topics of global relevance. From the fight on terrorism to the global push for more interfaith efforts to curb radicalization, Hilale argued, Mohammed VI Morocco has emerged as a valuable and credible partner. “In fact, His Majesty the King is an ardent defender of the United Nations and all actions aimed at maintaining a working and dynamic multilateralism,” he said. The enthusiastic comments from the two Moroccan officials are nothing new when it comes to the assessment of King Mohammed VI’s image as an effective leader. Over the years, a number of foreign and domestic observers have made strikingly similar remarks when commenting on how Morocco has changed since King Mohammed ascended to the throne in 1999. Most recently, in July of this year, the commemoration day of the King’s twenty years in power was marked by a spectacle of congratulations and praise, with a frenzy of articles in the national and international media all agreeing that the past two decades have been largely positive for Morocco’s socio-economic development. “Like a good commander,” one observer recently said of the King, “he has led his troops in a clear direction.”

Rabat – After a video of a woman giving birth in the streets of Fez shocked Moroccan social media users earlier this week, Morocco’s health minister has suspended the doctor deemed responsible.   In the disturbing video, a woman can be seen giving birth in the street just outside of the University Hospital of Fez.  The woman and her husband are from Sefrou, a small town about 30 kilometers south of Fez. The couple first went to Sefrou’s maternity ward, where medical staff sent them to the University Hospital of Fez.  The hospital in Fez then denied the woman care, and she went into labor a stone’s throw from the hospital’s entrance.  The recently appointed Minister of Health, Khalid Ait Taleb, has brought the hammer down on Abdeslam El Bekkali, a gynecologist-obstetrician practicing at Mohammed V hospital in Sefrou. Morocco’s Head of Government Saad El Othmani appointed Khalid Ait Taleb as the new Minister of Health as part of the government reshuffle announced on October 9. Since the Hassan II University Hospital Center of Fez opened its doors in 2009, Ait Taleb acted as the general director of the hospital and the head of its visceral surgery department. Consequently, the horrifying incident hits close to home.  Ait Taleb launched an investigation into the incident and found that El Bekkali was responsible for the woman’s traumatic and humiliating lack of care.  On November 8, French-language news outlet Le360 published a photo of the letter sent by Ait Taleb to the Regional Director of Health in Fez.  In the letter stamped on November 7, the Minister of Health states that El Bekkali will be temporarily suspended from his position while continuing to receive his salary.

Rabat  – Ivanka Trump, the daughter of, and advisor to, US President Donald Trump, has been on a three-day trip to Morocco since Wednesday, November 6. The visit seeks to promote the rights of Moroccan women through the effective implementation of a bill adopted by the Moroccan Parliament in July on the promotion of the property rights of women in rural areas. The trip has been making headlines in Moroccan media and is being widely commented on in social media, especially Twitter and Facebook. Does Ivanka’s trip benefit Morocco? Amid the snarky comments and shallow discussion of the visit, there has been a conspicuous absence of any comments on, or attempts to discern, the political connotation of the visit. What does it mean for Morocco’s image and the advancement of its strategic interests? Regardless of the merit of Ivanka’s trip to Morocco and whether it will help Moroccan women in rural areas improve their economic and social status, the debate should revolve around what diplomatic and political gains Morocco as a country will achieve from the highly publicized visit. To understand the political connotation of Ivanka’s trip to Morocco, one should place it in the broader context of US-Morocco relations over the past three years. When President Trump assumed power in January 2017, many in Morocco feared that the relations between the two might be adversely affected. This fear was driven by two factors: First, Trump was not a traditional Republican with whom Morocco had been acquainted. Though Trump won the election under the banner of the Republican party, he was an outsider who had never taken office and is known for being unpredictable and transactional. The second reason was the fact that in 2015, ahead of the 2016 presidential elections, there were allegations that Morocco donated $12 million to the Clinton Global Initiative summit, provided that Hillary Clinton attend the foundation’s fundraiser in Morocco. Though Clinton did not eventually attend the meeting in Marrakech, the Trump presidential campaign used the allegations against her and accused of her of “pay for play” in favor of Morocco. President Trump himself, as well as his son Donald Trump, Jr. and their followers, used the allegations to attack Hillary Clinton and question her legitimacy to become president. Though the allegations were disproven, and there was no evidence of quid pro quo between Morocco and Hillary Clinton, there was a growing fear among Moroccans that Trump’s vindictive tendency would cause him to adopt an unfriendly foreign policy towards Morocco. That fear was compounded by the absence of a US ambassador to Morocco since Trump came to office and 16 months later, by the appointment of John Bolton as national security adviser to President Trump. The absence of a high-level American interlocutor in Rabat and the presence of John Bolton at the highest level of the Trump administration did not bode well for Morocco, especially regarding the Western Sahara conflict. Moroccan achievements in Washington Notwithstanding the obstacles that Morocco has had to face over the past three years, its diplomacy has shown resilience and navigated the murky and agitated waters of the Trump administration. The major evidence to that is the Western Sahara conflict. Despite John Bolton’s presence within the Trump administration and its attempts to put pressure on Morocco by putting the question of a referendum on self-determination on the front burner, Rabat not only neutralized him, but made political gains it had not made in the past. Whereas the U.S. delegation in the Security Council pushed last year and earlier this year for shortening the extension of the mandate of the UN Mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) from one year to six months, the U.S. has, last month, rescinded this position in favor of going back to the full-year mandate, which is a sign that the position of the U.S. is softening towards Morocco’s position vis-à-vis the Sahara issue. During Bolton’s tenure, the United Nations Security Council adopted two resolutions (Resolutions 2440 and 2468), in which Algeria is mentioned for the first time as a party in relation to the conflict on the same level as Morocco. The UN also inaugurated the Geneva roundtables with Algeria’s and Mauritania’s participation. The achievements could not have been possible without US support and without the presence, within the Trump administration, of influential figures who have the ears of the president and could work as a counterweight to Bolton. With the benefit of hindsight, one can argue that Morocco has successfully neutralized “the Bolton effect” on the Western Sahara conflict by approaching Trump’s ultimate inner circle, mainly his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. It is an open secret in Washington that President Trump relies on what he describes as his “guts,” as well as his family when making policy decisions, and he has a tendency to go past the traditional interagency process. Morocco has arguably understood that for its message to get across to the White House and get its attention, it has to court his inner circle, meaning Ivanka and Jared Kushner. That Kushner has made two trips to Morocco, one official in May, and another unofficial, followed by Ivanka’s trip, is telling where Morocco has concentrated diplomatic efforts over the past two years. By ingratiating itself with the president’s inner circle and trusted advisors, Morocco has succeeded in getting the ears of the president himself, thus securing US support for its vital strategic interests, chief of which is the Western Sahara conflict. Even the timing of Ivanka’s trip is evocative. She began her visit to Morocco on November 6 while the country was celebrating the anniversary of the Green March, an indicator of President Trump’s and his inner circle’s sentiment about Western Sahara. It is highly likely that Jared Kushner’s and Ivanka Trump’s visits to Morocco may pave the way for a visit by Trump to Morocco or King Mohammed VI to Washington. The value of an Ivanka tweet Besides the political and diplomatic gains Morocco has achieved, it is also poised to make gains in terms of image and messaging to a global audience. What many Moroccans miss when dismissing a visit such as Ivanka’s or questioning her keenness to help advance Moroccan women’s rights is that her very presence in Morocco, her wearing of Moroccan clothes, etc., sends a message to the millions of Americans who follow her on social media and hundreds  of millions throughout the world that a centuries-old country is open, welcoming, and forward-looking. The impact of only one tweet from her could surpass the efforts, if any, made by the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism, to market Morocco as a welcoming and safe tourist country. People who have worked in public relations and lobbying in Washington know well the amount of money other countries pay to celebrities to attend mere events, such as a reception, and tweet about them. In some instances, a celebrity or an influential figure such as Ivanka is paid millions of dollars just to participate in an event or make a trip to other Arab countries and tweet about them with the main purpose of improving their image for a global audience. The debate in Morocco should not revolve around Trump’s personality and the merits of the policies he has made over the past three years. This is a debate that concerns the American people, and it is up to them to reelect their president or not in 2020. What should matter for Morocco and the Moroccan people is to what extent Morocco should benefit from his tenure to push for a final political solution to the Western Sahara conflict? Despite the political turmoil President Trump has been facing since the Ukraine scandal came to light, it is unlikely that the Democrats will succeed in removing him from office, since the Senate, which has the ultimate say in the impeachment process, is under the control of the Republicans. Given the thick skin of President Trump and the absence of a charismatic Democrat contender for the 2020 presidential elections, it is highly likely that Trump will win reelection. Despite the heated debate surrounding the Ukraine controversy, his reelection chances will hinge on the health of the US economy. And in the event Trump is reelected, Morocco, by cozying up to his inner circle, will have the ears of the American president, thus securing Washington’s support for its strategic interests.

Rabat – Sound Energy announced on Wednesday that it has agreed to sell 51% of its Tendrara gas exploration concession stake in eastern Morocco to an undisclosed British company for $112.8 million. Sound Energy said it entered into non-disclosure agreements with 23 companies and received multiple non-binding offers. The British gas company has granted the purchaser an exclusivity period, expiring on February 14 next year, to finalize a binding sale and purchase agreement for 51% of Sound Energy’s stake.  Sound Energy holds 47.5% of the Tendrara portfolio in eastern Morocco, while the Texas-based Schlumberger company, a Sound Energy partner, holds 27.5%, and Morocco’s National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) holds 25%. Sound Energy will subsequently retain a 23% overall stake in the Tendrara concession. The company added that it will grant the buyer a one-year option to acquire a further 9% of Sound Energy’s remaining shares on the same terms. On October 29, the Moroccan National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) signed a memorandum of understanding with Sound Energy Limited related to the sale of natural gas from the Tendrara concession in Eastern Morocco. Sound Energy is projecting gross revenues of $84 million in the first year of selling Moroccan gas.

Rabat – Mauritanian foreign minister, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, has emphasized that “time has come” to find a political solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara once and for all while speaking about his country’s position on the conflict. The Mauritanian official talked about the conflict on Thursday, November 7, in Nouakchott. For Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the Western Sahara conflict is the reason why the Maghreb Arab Union project is “frozen.” The Mauritanian minister added that Mauritania is active in the UN-led political process, emphasizing the principle of neutrality. Despite the importance of the conflict for Mauritania, the country, he said, does not take sides. Ould Cheikh Ahmed said that Mauritania is not a “spectator, and we need to see this conflict solved as soon as possible. The time has come to find a mutually acceptable political solution for the conflict that has caused enormous suffering for the people and resulted in a frozen Arab Maghreb Union.” The statement comes a day after King Mohammed VI addressed problems hindering Maghreb unity during his speech on Wednesday, November 6, for the 44th Anniversary of the Green March. During his speech, the King reiterated Morocco’s firm position on the conflict and expressed Morocco’s commitment to establishing “sound, solid relations with sister Maghreb countries.” “Hopes, just like expectations, are running high, and the challenges are many and complex. Regrettably, some are not taking the situation seriously,” the King said, referring to Algeria. Algeria claims to be only an observing party in the Western Sahara conflict. For Morocco, Algeria is a main party to the conflict, and the Polisario Front has no legitimacy to represent Sahrawis. Morocco has long called on Algeria to take responsibility and engage in the UN-led political process as a main party and not just an observer. Morocco has made clear on many occasions that its Autonomy Plan, a proposal submitted to the UN in 2007, is the only political solution to end the conflict as it guarantees “full respect for the Kingdom’s national unity and territorial integrity.” Mauritania, which Morocco also considers one of the main parties to the conflict, participated in the UN roundtables initiated by then UN Personal Envoy Horst Kohler in December 2018 and March 2019. Recently, the Polisario Front expressed frustration after Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani did not mention the Western Sahara conflict during his speech at the general debate of the UN 74th Session of the General Assembly on September 24. Pro-Polisario news outlet Futuro Sahara criticized the Mauritanian president, stating that the official cynically made no reference to Western Sahara and that the commission was politically motivated.   The news outlet added the Western Sahara conflict is only a “card” to play for presidential candidates in Mauritania and other states, such as Spain.

Rabat – Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande Marlaska has said he appreciates the “real” cooperation between both Morocco and Spain to tackle the migration crisis. He told the Spanish press that the cooperation has reduced the number of undocumented entering the Spanish enclaves over the border fence. “Now we have more forces, we train them, we give them means and protection and we do investigation work against mafias” involved in human trafficking. The Spanish minister condemned human trafficking, emphasizing that “mafias” put the lives of migrants in danger, and they suffer inhumane conditions. Marlaska’s statement comes after remarks from his prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, who lauded Morocco’s efforts in reducing the number of undocumented migrants. Sanchez said on November 4 that Spain “managed to reduce by more than 50% the number of illegal migrants arriving on our shoes through cooperation with our partners, especially with Morocco.” He explained Spain advocates for a “humanitarian approach, dialogue, and cooperation with counties of origin and transit like Morocco” to tackle migration flows. The Spanish Interior Ministry said that the country reduced the “arrivals of undocumented migrants arriving by sea in Spain between January 1 and October 30 by more than 53% compared to a year earlier.” A total of 22,247 irregular migrants reached Spain by the sea in makeshift boats as of October 30, down from 47,684 migrants during the same period in 2018, the ministry added. About 1,030 boats arrived on the Spanish coast from January to October of 2019, compared to 1,775 boats during the same period last year. The difference constitutes a 42% decrease. The fight against irregular migration is not the only field in which Madrid and Rabat cooperate; both countries also share trade and security collaboration. In September, Marlaska reiterated Spain’s determination to strengthen diplomatic relations with Morocco during a visit to Morocco.

Rabat – As part of her three-day visit to Morocco, Ivanka Trump visited the Palais des Congres in Rabat on Friday, November 8, giving $6.2 million in grants to nine beneficiaries.  The event was part of the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (W-GDP), which President Donald Trump established earlier this year to advance the global economic empowerment of 50 million women in developing countries in the upcoming six years. Previously having visited Ethiopia and Cote d’Ivoire, Ivanka made Morocco her second destination on behalf of W-GDP to the African continent.  This time Sean Cairncross, CEO of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), accompanied Ivanka, backing the initiative as an independent US foreign aid agency that provides grants to developing countries to strengthen economic growth and reduce poverty.   Hope Ivanka Trump came to Rabat in her capacity as senior advisor to the president, paying tribute to the many initiatives that have blossomed as a result of the W-GDP. One of them is a promising job fund, aiming for the empowerment of women through labor participation. “Research shows if women participated equally compared to men, over $12 trillion would be accumulated to the global GDP. That number represents more than an economic boom. It represents hope. Female students who can attend colleges and mothers who can lift themselves out of poverty,” Ivanka stated. Ivanka underlined how the job fund is tied to achievement. Nine beneficiaries stood out and earned themselves the total sum of $6.2 million. But, as Ivanka pointed out, one particular organization has earned a special round of applause.   “One of the awardees is the Moroccan Foundation for Education and Employment (EFE). For more than 10 years, this foundation has provided skills training. They have created 25,000 jobs for women seeking employment.”  “Now, more than ever, it is essential we work hand in hand not only to participate but to thrive and prosper in our global economy. Everyone is taking bold steps to invest in the underutilized talent, ambition, and genius of women. Together we can make a true global impact, growing economies and fostering hope, stability, and peace. This is a legacy we can write into our history,” Ivanka concluded. 2 days, 5 deliverables, 1 incredible W-GDP trip to Morocco! #WGDP
🇺🇸🇲🇦 pic.twitter.com/iYN2PkKmkq — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) November 8, 2019 Ivanka concluded her three-day trip, by posting a closing video on Twitter of herself with Sean Cairncross at the US embassy of Morocco. Ivanka reiterated Morocco’s great progress in accomplishing better legal -and working conditions for women.  When women thrive Accompanying Ivanka as CEO of MCC, Sean Cairncross elaborated about the necessity of more females joining the Moroccan working force. “Twenty-two percent of the females above 50 are not working, this opposed to 65% of the male labor force. Economic growth cannot be achieved if half the working force is not participating. MCC hopes it can help women to support themselves.” “When women thrive, countries thrive, and MCC is giving these women the tools to do so,” Cairncross concluded. Married at 21 and dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities and personal freedom, Fatma Bouhadha took time in her hands when she decided to divorce her husband. “For four years I was married to my ex-husband. I was not allowed to study or work for myself. There simply came a moment where I thought, ‘enough is enough,’ I want to be independent and look after myself,” she told Morocco World News. The W-GDP initiative made an impact on Bouhadha’s life, she explained. “Though divorce is very much frowned upon in Morocco, my family rallied behind me and supports me all the way! I have recently concluded my study of finance, and I am right now looking for a job in the banking sector. Through the initiatives of W-GDP, I have been able to expand my network significantly and get in touch with a lot of people. To me, Ivanka Trump is a role model and an inspiring figure to look up to,” Bouhadha concluded.

Rabat – The Public Prosecutor’s office and the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Reintegration of Prisoners will organize a national meeting on November 12-13 in Rabat to develop a roadmap to promote alternatives to institutional placements of children in conflict with the law or in difficult situations. The meeting will be held in partnership with UNICEF and the European Union. In 2018, 1,224 children were detained in custody while 3,300 others were placed in Children protection centers. Organized as part of the Himaya program, a joint UNICEF and EU project, the meeting aims to identify ways to enable children in prison to benefit from a reformed justice system adapted to the needs of child inmates.  The initiative seeks to establish a legal tradition that takes into account the child’s ultimate interest and ensures that incarceration and institutional placement are the last resort. The Himaya program’s main goal is to help improve children’s access to justice that respects their rights. As a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Morocco is committed to developing alternatives to the deprivation of liberty of children in conflict with the law or in hard situations.

Rabat – Abderrazak Hamdallah, the prolific Moroccan striker playing for Saudi football club Al Nasr, is in legal trouble with Saudi authorities. Following an altercation with the chief of the security staff at King Khalid Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia has banned the Moroccan from leaving the Gulf country. According to Saudi sources, Hamdallah “verbally attacked” the security officer, leading the officer to file a complaint against the Moroccan player. The incident took place around 3 a.m. on Thursday, according to reports. Hamdallah reportedly lashed out at the security officer, described as “a woman who holds the rank of sergeant.” Hamdallah was protesting against the use of full body scanning on his pregnant wife. The Moroccan player is said to have claimed that the “automatic inspection” was detrimental to the health of his wife and unborn child, a local newspaper reported. The Saudi security officer said in “her statements that the Moroccan player used offensive words, exceeded respect, and tried to enter the inspection area for women,” according to the same newspaper. Hamdallah denied the complainant’s version of the events. He, however, maintained his opposition to the use of the body scanning inspection for his pregnant wife. “After taking statements from both parties,” the Saudi newspaper detailed, the public inspector determined that the Moroccan may have crossed boundaries in his clash with the employee. Meanwhile, there are reports that the Moroccan player’s Saudi club has been in touch with the airport employee in an attempt to persuade her to drop the case. The news comes as Morocco’s Atlas Lions prepare for a series of CAN 2021 qualifier games. Hamdallah, who has not been on good terms with Morocco’s footballing authorities, is notably absent from the list of players who have been called to represent the Moroccan squad. The player, who was due to join the Atlas Lions for this year’s CAN, walked out from the squad at the last minute. While early reports said he left because of a last-minute injury, the player would later fume at internal divisions in the Moroccan squad, describing what he saw as a toxic environment for players with no established friendships in the group.

Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, along with the daughter of and advisor to US President Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, chaired the signing ceremony of a partnership agreement between Morocco’s interior ministry and the MCC. The agreement seeks to support the implementation of the new laws related to the soulaliyat (communal) lands. The signing of the partnership agreement falls within the framework of the White House’s Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (W-GDP) and its goal to protect the rights of female landowners and to implement the national project. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that a center will be set up under the agreement to “foster the integration of the gender approach in the project of the Soulaliyates lands’ [land titling] for the benefit of the beneficiaries.” The center will establish a database on women’s land rights to “promote their access to land as beneficiaries.” The database will keep track of the number of women beneficiaries, showing if there are more after the law was revised, “ensuring that the rightful heirs are able to enjoy their land rights in accordance with the rules laid down in the Family Law.” The signing of the agreement is part of MCC’s mission in Morocco.  Ivanka Trump arrived in Morocco on November 6 to promote the W-GDP initiative, seeking to empower 50 million women by 2025. During her visit, Ivanka Trump received a warm welcome from senior officials and land owners in the city of Sidi Kacem near Rabat on November 7.

Rabat – Moroccan inventors and startups won four medals, including one gold, at the 2019 International Trade Fair for Ideas, Inventions, and New Products (iENA). The German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) hosted the event in Nuremberg, Germany, from October 31 to November 3. The Electronic, Mechatronic, and Mechanic Cluster of Morocco (CE3M), an innovation-promoting NGO, and the German Cooperation Agency in Morocco invited four Moroccan startups to take part in the event. “We are very happy and proud to return to Morocco with four medals,” said Marzban Cooper, a technical advisor at GIZ Morocco. “Morocco has always been a country of entrepreneurs and great ideas. It is now time to make Morocco a global hub of technological innovation and to give it the international recognition it deserves,” he added. The Moroccan startups that participated work in the fields of materials science, agritech, energy, and smart cities. The Mohammed VI Polytechnic University of Benguerir (UM6P) participated with its “Sens-Things” project. The project is a predictive diagnostic and maintenance solution based on new sensor technology and a platform of big data and artificial intelligence. The Moroccan Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation and Research (MASCIR) exhibited their product “Agriscan,” an olive oil quality analyzer. The startup Metatechnology invented an intelligent 3D camera to be used in public places without violating the identity of the people captured in its field of vision. Finally, the startup PilliotY won a gold medal for “Metronic-CBH,” a product that analyzes the quality of complex cables and aeronautical and space harnesses during their production. iENA 2019 included several conferences on innovation throughout the days of the event. It also gave a platform to young innovators to present their innovative products and ideas, and rewarded the best ones with medals. Inventors, exhibitors, investors, and experts from 14 different countries took part in the event.

Rabat – Morocco’s security services at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca have arrested two Tunisian women in possession of nearly 12 kilograms of cannabis resin. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that the police arrested the two Tunisian nationals on Friday, November 8, when they were intending to travel to Tunisia. A search operation showed that the two suspects were in possession of 11 kilograms and 460 grams of cannabis resin hidden under their clothes. Police put the suspects in custody for further investigation. The operation is part of Morocco’s strategy to combat drug trafficking and cross border crimes. Morocco’s DGSN seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives from January 1 to September 15. Police also arrested 420,348 suspects on charges of drug trafficking in the same period, according to statistics from the DGSN in September. Out of the total number of suspects arrested, 331,252 were arrested when found in possession of drugs.

By Alex C. Mitchell Rabat – As Morocco’s 2020 Finance Bill is under review by Parliament, debate has sparked regarding progressive measures to ensure the health of Moroccan citizens. The internal consumption tax (ICT), as featured in Article 5 of the Finance Bill, increases the tax on beverages sweetened with sugar. Taxation for different beverages will vary depending on how much juice a drink contains. More than 10% fruit juice in sodas or non-carbonated drinks, or more than 6% lemon juice in lemonade, would garner just an additional MAD 10 to 15 per 100 liters.  If a beverage is below the juice threshold, the rate of taxation rises. If a drink has five grams of sugar or less per 100 milliliters, the tax will be MAD 30 per 100 liters. Between 5 and 10 grams per 100 milliliters would garner a tax of MAD 37.50 per 100 liters. Drinks above 10 grams per 100 milliliters would experience a tax rate of MAD 45 per 100 liters. According to Mostapha Brahimi, chairman of the sector committee in the House of Representatives, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) hopes to raise the rates to MAD 45, 50, and 55, respectively. There have been talks concerning the introduction of additional ICTs on dairy products containing sugar, such as yogurt or cream cheese. MPs have introduced some proposals which would encompass all sweet products over a period of time. As reported by the World Health Organization in 2016, the rate of obesity in Morocco is 21.7%. The figure, alongside an overweight population comprising 55.1% of the country, has brought concern to the national government and inspired cooperation throughout Parliament in order to challenge these trends.  While all the same drinks would be available, the bill’s proponents hope it will incentivize people to decrease their sugar intake due to the proposed shifts in pricing. If Article 5 passes, the more sugar a drink has, the more expensive it will be. Parliament aims to create a society in which maintaining a healthy lifestyle is cost-efficient, while decreasing the difficulties that arise with high rates of sugar intake.

Rabat – The World Bank has announced that it approved a new $300 million loan to support the strengthening of “Morocco’s municipalities” as part of Morocco’s reforms to upgrade public administrations. The World Bank published a press release on Thursday, November 7, declaring that its executive directors approved the loan. The statement added that the loan seeks to help Morocco in its “broader efforts to upgrade urban services and turn urban conglomerations into engines of growth and job creation.” The World Bank will inject the loan through Municipal Performance Project which seeks to promote institutional performance of “participating municipal governments” to address challenges like unemployment. A recent note from the High Commission for Planning (HCP) said that the unemployment rate in Morocco rose to 9.4 % in the third quarter of 2019 from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier. The continually high unemployment rate is one of the major crises that the government of Morocco has been pledging to address. The municipal Performance Project aims to “build capacity by providing a sustainable, performance-based framework for municipalities to work with.” Quoting World Bank’s Maghreb Country Director Jesko Henschel, the statement said that the program’s goal is to “promote territorial development by strengthening Morocco’s municipalities.” “The program will target key gaps in performance to promote a transparent, efficient, and accountable urban management system that can drive long-term local development and enhance Moroccan cities’ attractiveness.” The program will work with Morocco’s Ministry of Interior to “roll out an ambitious annual performance assessment of municipalities.” It spans a five year period from 2019 to 2024, targeting the 100 largest municipalities in Morocco. Heavy external debts For senior financial management special and co-task team leader Kolie Ousmane, “strengthening the role of municipalities is a key outcome of the current program.” Despite the project’s lofty objectives, the approval of the new World Bank loan comes amid mounting external debt. The World Bank announced a new $500 million loan to promote Morocco’s education sector less than a month ago. Several top bankers in Morocco warned about the increasing external debt, including Abdellatif Jouahri, the governor of Morocco’s central bank, Bank al-Maghrib. Last year, Jouahri said he expected external debt to rise to 16.6% of Morocco’s GDP in 2019, up from 13.8% of GDP in 2018. In his annual report on the economic situation in Morocco, the governor acknowledged in July that Morocco is in a financial crisis as the economy is not able to keep up with growing special demands. Global Economic Data CEIC found that the external debt in Morocco reached $53.2 billion in June 2019, compared to $51.4 billion in the previous quarter.

Rabat – The port of Tangier Med, in northern Morocco, has recorded the largest growth in the world in the last 10 years in terms of its connectivity globally. Morocco inaugurated the port in 2007. The connectivity index represents the port’s connectivity with the rest of the world. It is calculated based on the yearly traffic, in merchandise and passengers, that goes through the port. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) published the result in a recent study on maritime transport in 2019. Morocco spent €3.5 billion to expand the port of Tangier Med in 2007. The port’s total processing capacity has tripled since the expansion, from 3 million shipping containers in 2007 to 9 million. The report also revealed that Tangier Med Port and Port Said in Egypt are the leading African ports in the Mediterranean region, benefiting from their geographic positions and private investments from global port operators. Tangier Med Port covers 1,000 hectares. It includes Tangier Med I Port, with a capacity of 3 million containers per year, Tangier Med II port, with a capacity of 6 million containers per year, and a passenger port. In 2018, Tangier Med Port exported MAD 139 billion worth of products, over 50% of all Moroccan exports. It also handled a traffic of more than 2.8 million passengers. The Maritime Transport Study is an annual publication by UNCTAD. It provides an analysis of the structural and cyclical changes affecting maritime commerce, ports, and shipping, as well as statistics.

Rabat – Ivanka Trump wore a kaftan fit for a Moroccan princess while attending a dinner at the royal palace in Rabat, hosted by Princess Lalla Meryem.  Ivanka glittered in her gold Moroccan gown, which she accessorized with pearl earrings and nude pumps.  Ivanka looked at home seated next to Princess Lalla Meryem, who stunned in a blue velvet kaftan with intricate gold detailing.  The dinner came after a full day of appointments for Ivanka Trump in and near Rabat on the second day of her three-day trip to Morocco. As with all of Ivanka’s appointments in Morocco thus far, the CEO of the Millenium Challenge Corporation, Sean Cairncross, was at her side.  Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the King’s adviser, Andre Azoulay, attended the royal dinner. A White House official said the charge d’affaires of the American embassy, David Greene, also joined the meal. Ivanka has been routinely styling Moroccan-inspired looks during her trip.  At least three of Ivanka’s Morocco outfits so far were designed by Fadila el Gadi, a Moroccan designer who teaches underprivileged children the art of embroidery. El Gadi designed the gray jacket Ivanka wore during her first meeting with Princess Lalla Meryem.  On November 7, Ivanka wore a white Moroccan-style top with black details designed by El Gadi on her visit to the rural town of Sidi Kacem. Ivanka fashioned the top with a black turtleneck and cinched it at the waist with a black belt.  El Gadi took to Twitter yesterday to express her gratitude to Ivanka, who styled one of El Gadi’s ornate capes with a silk green jumpsuit upon returning to Rabat.  Ivanka aime vraiment mes créations 😊 🙏😍😍😍 #ivankatrump #ivankatrumpstyle #fadilaelgadi #FEG pic.twitter.com/GqU8mjcBm8 — FadilaElgadi (@FadilaElgadi) November 7, 2019  Ivanka donned the jewel-toned ensemble at her meetings with Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Morocco’s Head of Government Saadeddine El Othmani on November 7.  Much like the Western officials who have come before her, Ivanka seems to be taking a liking to Moroccan fashion.

Rabat – Ten Moroccan scientists have signed onto a declaration titled “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency” highlighting the urgent need to address climate change. BioScience, a monthly scientific journal, published the declaration with signatures from over 11,000 scientists of 153 nationalities on Tuesday, November 5. The 10 Moroccan scientists represent various universities and research institutes both in Morocco and abroad. The signatories include scientists from multiple fields, including ecology, geology, biology, zoology, genetics, astronomy, and neurology. The signatories presented graphical indicators to prove the “climate emergency” that the Earth is facing. “Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and to tell it like it is,” reads the article’s introduction. Since the First World Climate Conference in Geneva in 1979, scientists have warned of the need to act urgently to reduce climate change. The 1992 Rio Summit, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the 2015 Paris Agreement, and other assemblies have all tried to put in place protocols to fight climate change. However, according to the scientists, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are still on the rise and dangerously affecting the world’s climate. “Most public discussions on climate change are based on global surface temperature only, an inadequate measure to capture the breadth of human activities and the real dangers stemming from a warming planet,” explains the article. The publication presents “signs of climate change over the last 40 years for human activities that can affect GHG emissions and change the climate, as well as actual climatic impacts.” The signatories suggested six steps to lessen the effects of climate change: Substitute fossil fuel with renewable energy sources, reduce pollutant emissions, protect the Earth’s ecosystem, consume mainly plant-based foods, develop a decarbonized economy, and stabilize the human population. The scientists conclude that they are optimistic about the current global movement for climate. “We are encouraged by a recent surge of concern. Governmental bodies are making climate emergency declarations. Schoolchildren are striking. Ecocide lawsuits are proceeding in the courts. Grassroots citizen movements are demanding change, and many countries, states and provinces, cities, and businesses are responding.”

Rabat – Bahrain continues to support Morocco’s mission to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara. On Thursday, November 7, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani held a meeting with the president of the Bahraini Council of Representatives, Fawzia bint Abdullah Zainal in Rabat. During the meeting, El Othmani recalled Morocco’s appreciation of Bahrain’s consistent position in favor of the country’s territorial integrity. Zainal extolled Morocco’s position in favor of Bahrain’s top interests, a statement from El Othmani’s office said. The Bahraini official also welcomed the dynamic role of Moroccan women and “their effective contribution to the socio-economic development of their country and their ability to address challenges.” The visit of the Bahraini official comes amid the three-day trip of Ivanka Trump, the daughter of and senior advisor to US President Donald Trump, who is advocating women’s empowerment as part of the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. Ivanka Trump met with senior Moroccan officials and King Mohammed VI, acclaiming Morocco’s reforms granting equal rights to female landowners, known as sullaliat. El Othmani’s meeting with Zainal marked the presence of other senior diplomats, including the ambassador of Bahrain to Morocco. The statement from the head of government’s office stipulated that the visit was “an opportunity to emphasize once again the quality of the fraternal ties between the two countries.” Both countries expressed the determination to expand bilateral cooperation in several fields. Zainal is leading a delegation as part of her country’s determination to consolidate relations between Manama and Rabat. Bahrain is among the countries in the Gulf peninsula that supports Morocco’s political positions, including on the Western Sahara conflict. In September, during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly in New York, Bahraini Minister of Foreign Affairs Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said that Bahrain “reaffirms its solidarity with the continuous efforts by the brotherly Kingdom of Morocco” to find a political solution to the issue of Western Sahara, he said. Bahrain, he added, supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Morocco. Bahrain was also among the 22 states that expressed support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, an initiative submitted to the UN in 2007 as a possible political solution to end the conflict.

Rabat – The Minister of Energy, Mines and the Environment, Aziz Rabbah, has said that Morocco and Germany are expected to further develop their cooperation in the renewable energy field through B2B joint ventures and partnerships.  Rabbah made the announcement during a workshop on “the role of the media for a renewable future”, on Thursday, November 7, in Rabat. The German Ambassador to Morocco, Götz Schmidt-Bremme, attended the workshop along with other renewable field stakeholders. The Minister stressed the importance of the German-Moroccan Energy Partnership (PAREMA) and the development of the bilateral strategic partnership in the energy industry. He also underlined the significance of the creation of German vocational training centers, joint ventures, and partnerships between Moroccan and German companies, as well as support for African leadership in renewable energy and sustainable development. “It is now time to enter a new era of partnership, that of renewable energies,” he said. Meanwhile, Schmidt-Bremme recognized Morocco’s considerable efforts in the renewable energy field, especially the Noor thermodynamic solar power plant. He also announced the allocation of a portfolio of MAD 20 billion for the German-Moroccan cooperation in renewable energy, water, and sustainable economy.  PAREMA was established following the signing of a declaration of intent at the Ministerial level, enabling an exchange of best practice and expertise to accelerate both countries’ energy transition. Morocco and Germany are both leading the energy sector in their respective continents. Yet, they both depend on electricity exports to light up homes and facilities. The two countries are set to decrease their dependency on electricity exports. Morocco aims to generate 52% of its electricity from renewable energies by 2030. To achieve its high aspirations, Morocco has heavily invested in solar energy through the world’s 2nd largest solar plant, the Noor Ouarzazate project and Noor Midelt I, which is yet to be constructed. The Noor-Ouarzazate complex was built on an area of more than 3,000 hectares with an investment of $400 million loans from the World Bank and an additional $216 million from the Clean Technology Fund. In 2018, Morocco produced 35% of its electricity output from renewable energy sources.

She is set to conclude her Moroccan trip Friday, November 8.

Rabat – Ahead of the CAN 2021 qualifiers against Mauritania and Burundi on November 15 and 19, respectively, head coach of Morocco’s Atlas Lions Vahid Halilhodzic has made public his 24-name list for the two games. The two upcoming matches mark the start of the serious, consequence-bearing stuff for Halilhodzic, with the Bosnian coach having been appointed to lead the Atlas Lions in their struggle to emerge from the painful memories of a disastrous outing at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Halilhodzic, who is searching for a working formula to honor the terms of his contract with the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), made notable changes to the pool of players he called upon for the underwhelming friendlies in the past weeks. The implication of the changes being that, after the languid outings in the friendly games, the Atlas Lions and their Bosnian head coach are still not settled on the flow and rhythm Moroccan fans are expecting from a team visibly battling to definitely leave behind the fresh wounds of CAN 2019, as well as the continued legacy of consistently, sometimes  inexplicably, punching below their weight when taking part in major tournaments. Shalke 04’s attacking midfielder Amin Harit, and Abderrazak Hamdallah, the top scorer of the Saudi league, are two notable absentees from the list of players for the November 15 and 19 games. Meanwhile, Olympiakos’ Youssefl El-Arabi, who has not been active for the Atlas Lions in a very long time but whose recent performances in the Greek league and the European Champions League have made headlines in Moroccan media, is back with the Moroccan Lions. Halilhodzic understandably expects El-Arabi to avail his experience and currently impressive shape to mend the Moroccan Lions’ lack of inspiration in front of goal. But whether the Olympiakos striker can replicate his sensational club form to remedy Morocco’s notable goal scoring issue remains to be seen. In any case, the continued absence of Hamdalah and the added value of El-Arabi are set to be some of the main talking points as the Moroccan team prepares for the next challenges. Here is the full list of Halildhodzic’s 24 Atlas Lions: Goalkeepers: Mounir El Kajoui (Malaga, Spain); Yassine Bounou (Sevilla, on loan from Girona, Spain); Anas Zniti (Raja of Casablanca, Morocco). Defenders:  Yunis Abdelhamid (Stade de Reims, France); Romain Saïss (Wolverhampton, England); Badr Benoun (Raja of Casablanca, Morocco); Zouhair Feddal (Betis Sevilla, Spain); Achraf Hakimi (Borussia Dortmund, Germany); Noussair Mazraoui (Ajax Amsterdam, Netherland); Hamza Mendyl (Dijon, France); Nabil Dirar (Fenerbahçe, Turkey). Midfielders: Selim Amallah (Standard de Liege, Belgium); Sofyan Amrabat (Hellas Verona, Italy); Fayçal Fajr (Getafe, Spain); Adel Taarabt (Benfica Lisbonne, Portugal); Yahia Jabrane (Wydad of Casablanca); Omar El Kaddouri (PAOK, Greece). Forwards: Rachid Alioui (Angers, France); Nordin Amrabat (Al-Nasr, Saudi Arabia); Youssef En-Nesyri (Leganes, Spain); Oussama Idrissi (AZ Alkmaar, Netherlands);  Hakim Ziyech (Ajax Amsterdam, Netherlands), Sofiane Boufal (Southampton, England), Youssef El Arabi (Olympiakos, Greece).

Rabat – Ivanka Trump attended a bilateral meeting with Morocco’s Head of Government Saadeddine El Othmani and other key ministers in Rabat after returning from a trip to rural Sidi Kacem on Thursday, November 7.  Prior to the meeting with El Othmani, Ivanka and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) CEO Sean Cairncross met Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. During the afternoon meeting with El Othmani, the US delegation acknowledged the important partnership between the US and the Government of Morocco.  The US delegation applauded Morocco’s recent adoption of land laws to improve women’s rights to collective lands. The land laws constitute a top priority of MCC’s Rural Land Project, an initiative that aims to strengthen land markets in accordance with investor demand.  The Rural Land Project involves governance activity, rural land activity, and industrial land activity.   MCC and the Moroccan government intend to work together to improve women’s access to land in Morocco and to enhance women’s participation in the economy.  MCC’s focus on tilting for collective lands aims to enable rural Moroccan farmers to experience land ownership. The MCC seeks to provide new resources for rural farmers to invest in, in a process known as “Melkisation.” Melkisation should support Moroccan women’s legal literacy, access to credit, and protect their land inheritance rights.  MCC’s industrial land activity aims to shift land markets from state-controlled zones to public-private partnerships. The goal of expanding the land markets is to better respond to investor demand and create more opportunities for Moroccan women.  The meeting with El Othmani comes on the second day of Ivanka’s visit to Morocco. The White House advisor and daughter of US President Donald Trump is in Morocco to assess the development of the White House’s Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) initiative.

Rabat – Police in the city of Marrakech have arrested a drug trafficking suspect and his main supplier. The police arrested the first suspect, who was the subject of a national search warrant, in possession of hard drugs as well as cocaine. The investigation into the first suspect led to information about a second suspect who police believe to be the main drug supplier. Police subsequently arrested the second suspect, a sub-Saharan African.  Security services seized an unspecified amount of cocaine during a “carefully prepared” raid to arrest the suspect, a security source quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) has said on November 4. Police also arrested four other suspects, including a woman for drug consumption. Police put all suspects involved in the case in custody for further investigation to arrest other possible accomplices. Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking from January 1 to September 15. During the same period, police seized 112 tons and 138 kilograms of cannabis and its derivatives. Police also seized 1,161,000 psychotropic pills. Security services confiscated 44 kilograms of cocaine and 6 kilograms of heroin.

Rabat  – The minister in charge of Moroccans living abroad, Nezha El Ouafi, has announced the relaunch of the Investment Fund dedicated to Moroccans diaspora also known as Moroccans living abroad (MREs). El Ouafi made her statement during a meeting to discuss the 2020 sectoral budget for Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The minister relayed that the Ministry of MREs will deploy interprofessional groups of bankers to sensitize national and international banks to the importance of the investment fund. She added that the strategy will be based  on the implementation of a “computer intelligence system and the launch of a communication campaign with highly skilled Moroccans at various international and national events.” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the ministry will work in partnership with the concerned parties to implement an annual action plan at each embassy to “preserve the attractiveness of the economic assets of Morocco, to involve Moroccans of the world in the development and integrate their skills in the areas of scientific research and training.” The newly-appointed minister also spoke about the development of support programs for MREs’ associations to provide the necessary assistance for MREs promoting their own projects. The number of Moroccans living abroad is estimated at 5 million. The Moroccan ministry in charge of the MREs has acknowledged several times the importance of the diaspora’s contribution to Morocco’s development. Remittances made by Moroccans living abroad (MRE) remain stable. At the end of September 2019, remittances amounted for MAD 49.80 billion against MAD 50.02 billion in the previous year, recent statistics of Moroccan Exchange Office has said.  Every year, Morocco receives thousands of MREs, who come during the holidays to visit their relatives. Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said in July that  “Morocco’s relationship with MREs is of great importance to the country and to the ministry.”

Rabat – With intra-African cooperation and Morocco’s Africanness as part of his Green March speech delivered yesterday night, King Mohammed VI signaled Morocco’s growing leadership in Africa, according to a Senegalese expert. Africa has become a staple in royal speeches, with the Moroccan monarch repeatedly and emphatically hammering home two points in most of his public statements: That Moroccan’s roots are African; and that, in a context of numerous geopolitical and domestic challenges facing the continent, the North African kingdom is poised to shoulder its “historical African responsibility.” Analyzing the “continental significance” of the King’s most recent speech, Boubacar Gueye, the president of Horizons Sans Frontieres (Horizons Without Borders), a migration-focused international NGO, said that Morocco is now a “confirmed African leader.” According to the Senegalese expert, a central notion in the latest royal statements is the increasingly obvious notion that Rabat, having formally returned to Africa almost three years ago, is more committed than ever to its role as a continental leader on various topics of regional, intra-African relevance. Morocco’s engagement with the continent has been more manifested in the country’s diplomatic orientations. Over the past decade, the North African kingdom’s has had an “active diplomacy interested in the defining issues of the continent,” Gueye explained. Spearheaded by the King’s own commitment to Africa and pan-African causes, he stressed, Morocco has emerged as an indispensable regional and continental leader. “Morocco’s diplomacy is characterized by a pan-African dimension that seals Morocco’s future with Africa’s,” he noted. Gueye’s effusive appraisal of Morocco’s Africanness and the kingdom’s “well-documented continental leadership” comes amid growing, sometimes well-established, suggestions that Rabat is set to be an indispensable shaper of the many new directions the continent is taking on various fronts. Western Sahara, the territory whose peaceful overtaking from Spain by masses of flags-waving and Quran-armed Moroccans the King commemorated in his yesterday’s speech, is largely perceived as the heart of Morocco’s historical connections with sub-Saharan countries, particularly West Africa. In his speech, the King capitalized on the historical significance of Western Sahara in Morocco’s professed African aspirations. “The Moroccan Sahara is our country’s gateway to sub-Saharan Africa,” the King said. “I firmly intend to make Morocco a key player in shaping the Africa of the future.”

Rabat – According to a survey by the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP), 42% of Muslims in France have experienced religious discrimination at least once in their lives. The survey found that 60% of women wearing a headscarf were subject to discrimination, while 37% of them have been a victim to verbal harassment or defamatory insults. The study, however, revealed that 44% of Muslim women who do not wear headscarves found themselves in similar situations. The survey found that13% of incidents of religious discrimination happened at police control points, while, 17% happened at job interviews. A further 14 % of incidents occurred while the victims were looking to rent or buy accommodation. Muslims aged between 30 and 40 years are more vulnerable to discrimination, with an average of 46% of women and 38% of men experiencing religious discrimination. The IFOP conducted the study from August 26 to September 18, based on a sample of 1007 Muslims aged 15 and above. Discrimination and racism are not centered only on Muslims but also affect non-Muslim communities. The IFOP pointed out that one Muslim in four (24%) was exposed to verbal aggression during their lifetime, compared to 9% among non-Muslims. In addition, 7% of Muslims were physically attacked, compared to 3% of non-Muslims. In France over the last five years, approximately 40% of Muslims have been the subject of racist behavior, compared to 17% among non-Muslims. Around 16% of the discrimination cases were religiously motivated, and 15% due to the skin color were racial. On October 11, Julien Odoul, a member of France’s National Rally (RN), asked a Muslim woman to remove her hijab while she was accompanying her son and his class on a school trip to explore the mission of the democratic assembly. Odoul and his colleagues asked Marie Guite Dufay, the President of the Regional Council, to have the woman either remove her hijab or leave the meeting.   Dufay, however, replied that she can only intervene when someone exhibits disruptive or offensive behavior, reported Le Bien Public. The Muslim woman subsequently left the room with her son after the argument. Following the event, pictures of the son crying after witnessing the discrimination his mother had experienced were widely shared on social media. Public figures and officials strongly criticized Odoul for the racist move.

Rabat – As Morocco assertively positions itself in the small circle of countries hailed for their evident determination to confront the global climate crisis, the North African country is leading an African coalition for “smart climate” and sustainable agriculture. Weeks ahead of the COP 25 in Spain, the AAA (Adapting African Agriculture), as the coalition calls it itself, is advocating for more integrated continental policies to promote “smart climate” initiative across Africa. Launched in 2016 at the request of Morocco, the country that organized the COP 22 meeting that year, AAA styles itself as a thinking laboratory for climate-friendliness and sustainability in African projects, as well as a link between African government stakeholders (governments and private institutions) and their international peers in the world of smart climate and sustainable agriculture. “We are especially interested in establishing a link between the climate and the agriculture worlds,” AAA director Abir Lemseffer told AFP at a two day meeting that her group organized from November 4 at the campus of the OCP-owned Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Benguerir. An essential part of AAA’s struggle is to give a prominent spot to Africa’s sustainable climate and agriculture agenda at international climate-related gatherings and negotiations. The group so far boasts the support and contribution of 35 African countries, more than half of the continent’s 54 states. Chad, Somalia, and Tunisia joined the continental effort on Tuesday. Two of these three new member states—Chad and Somalia—are first hand witnesses to, or primary victims of, the increasing climate degradation hitting the continent, especially in the Sahel and Horn of Africa subcontinents. AAA meetings typically take place “every year in prelude to a COP gathering,” director Lemseffer noted in her AFP interview. Meanwhile, weeks ahead of the Madrid-bound COP 25 meeting on December 2-13, the 35-country union is increasingly attracting the attention it sought in the first place. At its Benguerir meeting earlier this week, AAA was congratulated by both the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB), with the two financial institutions vowing to throw their investing weight behind the group’s advocacy for more sustainable and smart agriculture in the African continent. The World Bank expressed its readiness to accompany the efforts by investing $2 billion in smart-agriculture in 11 of the AAA countries across Africa. For its part, BAD said it would cooperate with AAA to “support a sustainable transformation of agriculture in Africa.” According to the AAA director, the group’s call for “smart” continental actions comes at a particularly challenging time for African agriculture. While over 200 million Africans are currently reported to be under-nourished, she pointed out, the continental agricultural output is set to decline by 20% in the next three decades. The dire projections call for robust continental actions, if the continent is to rise to the defining challenge of feeding its growing populations. In the meantime, Morocco, armed with its OCP group, is keen on leading the continental push towards smart, sustainable, and efficient agriculture.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI reiterated that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the sole viable solution to the Western Sahara conflict.  Speaking on  the 44th anniversary of the Green March, one of the most momentous events in Morocco’s journey to full unification the King emphasized that the proposal guarantees “full respect for the Kingdom’s national unity and territorial integrity.” The Autonomy Plan, submitted to the UN Security Council in 2007, seeks to  grant  all Sahrawis the privileged position of playing a leading role in regional institutions without “discrimination or exclusion.” The autonomy plan, according to the government, also insists on respecting the cultural identity of the Sahrawi population while also respecting Morocco’s territorial integrity. Morocco has long argued that the proposal is a compromise-based and mutually beneficial initiative is fully in line with the UN-led process’ vision of a consensual and mutually agreed upon solution.  A growing number of states that do not recognize, or have withdrawn recognition from, the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). This, the King recalled, is bolstering Morocco’s position and efforts towards a solution. King Mohammed added that currently, more than 163 states do not recognize the self-styled state or the Polisario’s false claims to independence. Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara “is also confirmed by the partnerships and agreements which have been signed by Morocco with the influential powers as well as with many countries and sister nations, and which concern all the Kingdom’s regions, including the Saharan provinces,” affirmed the monarch.  Morocco has signed a number of international agreements that include the Western Sahara, including the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, as well a post-Brexit association agreement with the UK.  The EU agreement covers the fishing area from parallel 35 to parallel 22, from Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. King Mohammed stated that Morocco’s position on its economic responsibility to all of the regions within its sovereignty is clear, with each region benefiting from government investments. Morocco’s Development Program (2015-2021) aims to address territorial and social disparities and includes significant investment in Western Sahara. The region’s Development Program includes 149 projects. Work on 21 of the planned projects is already complete, while a further 75 projects are in progress or in their final phase. Morocco’s head of government Saad Eddine El Othmaani noted the government has planned the launch of 50 projects for the near future, speaking at the regional communication meeting held in Dakhla on July 20, 2019. The ongoing investment initiative has already seen success with a tangible improvement in living conditions as well as the development of the regions’ economic and tourist sector potential. The development projects are in line with King Mohammed VI’s vision to enable the local population to benefit from the region’s assets and resources.

Rabat – Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, a former leading Polisario member has acknowledged the failure of the separatist group to meet the basic demands of Sahrawis living in Tindouf, Algeria. On the 44th anniversary of Morocco’s Green March, Mustafa Salma expressed regret that the Polisario has failed the aspirations of Sahrawis. He added that the Sahrawis are isolated in desert camps pending a political solution to the Western Sahara conflict. Posting a photo of the southern city of Laayoune, part of Western Sahara, the former Polisario member recognized Morocco’s efforts in turning the towns of the region into model cities. Mustafa Salma compared the city of Laayoune with Tindouf where thousands of camps lay in the middle of nowhere. “I wanted to believe that Morocco organized a ‘black march’ to the Sahara and that the Polisario organized a ‘green march’ for the Sahrawis to Algeria,” said Mustafa Salma. Commenting on the images of Laayoune and Tindouf, he said that the photos proved him wrong. “Morocco’s ‘black march’ has turned the Saharan cities into model cities among all other [neighboring cities] at least better than southern Algeria, Mauritania and southern Libya,” he argued. Mustafa Salma regretted that Polisario’s “green” march only served to move“ Sahrawis from tents to  camps.” Mustafa Salma is a critic of the Polisario leadership and its failure to meet the basic rights of Sahrawis in Tindouf, including the rights to assembly and freedom of movement.  The Polisario arrested Fadel Braika in June, along with Moulay Aba Bouzid, and Mahmoud Zidane for their participation in peaceful protests. The three activists were calling for freedom of speech and movement in Tindouf camps. The breakaway movement also continues to refuse to disclose information on the disappearance of Polisario Front member Ahmed El Khalil, who has been missing since 2009. Polisario and Algerian intelligence kidnapped El Khalil just two months after Polisario appointed him to monitor human rights in Tindouf camps in 2009. French lawyer and author Hubert Seillan has threatened to take El Khalil’s case to the international criminal court as the Polisario Front maintains their silence on the forced disappearance.

Rabat – Morocco’s Tourism Office (ONMT) recorded an increase in the arrival of British tourists to Morocco. ONMT shared the statistics about British arrivals at the 40th annual of the World Travel Market in London, from November 4 to 6. The office recorded an increase of 9% in arrivals of British tourists at the end of August compared to the same period in 2018. The statement added that Britons prefer to visit Morocco in Spring and Autumn seasons. The year 2018 also marked an increase of 4% in arrivals of British tourists compared to 2017. The office listed British tourists as second in 2018 in terms of overnight stays, spending more than  2 million nights in Morocco. The UK comes behind French tourists with 4.6 million overnight stays. Germans spent 1.8 million nights on holiday, placing them third. Finally, Spain tourists were fourth with 0.8 million nights. At the end of August 2019, numbers of overnight stays grew by 13% compared to the same period in 2018. Flights connecting between the UK and Morocco also increased from 55 flights per week in 2012 to 95 flights per week on average in 2019. “The British top destinations in 2018 remain the classic destinations despite a decline registered in the number of visitors for those including Spain, France, or Germany,” said the office Maghreb Arab Press cited recent report from Association of British Travel Agents, stipulating that British people still prefer holidays abroad despite political crises. The ONMT concluded that the UK market remains a priority for Morocco. Recently, British ambassador to Morocco Thomas Reilly spoke to Morocco World News about the importance of UK-Morocco diplomatic relations. Rielly also commented on the signature of the post-Brexit Association Agreement between Rabat and London. The deal signed on October 26 seeks to emphasize that relations between the two countries will not be impacted by Brexit. “It means that after Brexit, once the UK is effectively no longer an EU member, commercial ties will continue between our two countries. This is very important for us because the UK imports a host of agriculture products from Morocco and we export many things, especially services, to this country,” Reilly told MWN.

Rabat – The unemployment rate is the highest among Moroccan youth, it has slightly dropped from 27.5% in the first three quarters of 2018 to 26.7% in 2019. Morocco’s overall unemployment rate rose to 9.4% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to the High Commission for Planning (HCP). In a briefing note on key indicators of the labor market, HCP said that the number of job seekers in Morocco has risen from 1,088,000 to 1,144,000 in the third quarter of 2019. The numbers represent an increase of 26,000 people, of whom 23,000 are in rural areas and 3,000 in urban areas. The unemployment rate dropped from 13.1% to 12.7% in urban areas, however, it rose from 3.9% to 4.5% in rural areas, said the HCP. Unemployment remains relatively high among young people aged 15 to 24 with a rate of 26.7% compared to 7% among people above 25 years old. During the same period in 2018, the unemployment rate among youth was 27.5%. According to the HCP statistics, the unemployment rate among women stood at 13.9% compared to 8% among men, while diploma holders’ unemployment rate reached 15.5% compared to 3.7% among people with no degree.  The HCP pointed out that more than half of the unemployed (55.3%) are looking for their first job, while 66,8% are in long-term unemployment (62.2% of men and 75.1% of women). Approximately 27.8% are unemployed because they were fired or their employer’s activity was suspended. HCP also released data on underemployment rates. Underemployment is when workers are only able to find a part-time job when they are searching for full-time employment. Underemployment can also be linked to insufficient income and how well their skills and training are adequately used in the job occupied.  The number of people who are underemployed due to a lack of working hours increased to reach 380,000 overall in the first quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, the number of people classed as underemployed due to insufficient income or the mismatch between training and employment has fallen to 589,000 overall, a rate of 5.6%. The national volume of underemployment, in both its components, dropped from 1,021,000 persons in the third quarter of 2018 to 969,000 in the same period in 2019, with a rate of 9.1% (7.8% in the urban area and 10.8% in rural areas). The underemployment rate for men is as high as 10.2%, while among women it sits at only 5.2%.

Rabat – The wali (governor) of Fez-Meknes region, Said Zniber, inaugurated two new police stations in Fez yesterday, November 6, on the 44th Green March anniversary. The new police stations are located in the neighborhoods of El Merja, northwest of Fez, and Riad El Yassamine, southern Fez. The police prefect of Fez, Abdelilah Essaid, also attended the inauguration ceremony of the two stations. The inauguration of the new police stations is part of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN)’s proximity policy. The policy aims to strengthen citizens’ security in the neighborhoods and to fight against all sorts of crimes, according to Essaid. The new police station of El Merja has three floors and will provide services for 50,000 inhabitants over 7.5 square kilometers. The building’s facilities include an office for identity cards, two offices for the president and vice-president of the station, a reception desk, five offices for station writers, two waiting rooms, and an office for administrative documents. The new station of Riad El Yassamine has also three floors, and contains the same facilities. It will provide services for 60,000 inhabitants over 4.5 square kilometers. In recent years, DGSN has launched a proximity policy that facilitates and improves police response time to emergency calls. As part of the policy, DGSN has built new police stations in previously-remote neighborhoods. They have also built emergency operations centers that aim to coordinate between police stations and offer immediate response to emergency callers.

Washington DC- Over recent years, the Moroccan public has been accustomed to government spokespersons incapable of articulating basic policies, prime ministers unable to govern, legislators unequipped to understand simple parliamentary procedures, unqualified ambassadors running embassies in key capitals, and head of public policy organizations incapable of presenting a simple dissertation. The startling reality is unqualified people hold many high-level positions in the public and semi-public sectors in the Kingdom. Nepotism and favoritism continue to dominate the hiring practices in the government and in some private sectors. This fact nullifies the government heavy investments in human capital. In the last few decades biased hiring decision-making processes and the unfair treatment and harassment of skilled employees have discouraged competent candidates from applying; and pressed current workers to underachieve leading to a net loss to Morocco’s economic performances. Some decision-makers are putting personal greed before national interest and endangering the very existence of a “system” that has made them rich but destroyed the potential, accomplishments and innovations of a young and vibrant workforce. Some are willing to scarify competent workers who drive economic growth and who are vital to key public services for the sake of keeping an unstainable political status quo that would ultimately collapse on its own weight. Because of a deteriorating public education system, nepotism, incompetence and lack of transparency, the Kingdom is losing the potential contribution of thousands of highly educated Moroccans to an ailing economy. Furthermore, Morocco is faced with a host of socio-economic problems that have stagnated the economy, tainted society and poisoned the political discourse. A mediocre education system, the alienation of qualified workers with essential expertise, the persistent poor quality of human capital, and ineffective and corrupt contract enforcement will further destabilize an economy and a job market already on a shaky footing. On the bright side, the number of successful Moroccan immigrants thriving in their adoptive countries stands as a testament to the competence, aptitude, and talent of Moroccans and evidence of the failure of the Moroccan government to create an environment for attracting and keeping a talented workforce. Indeed, the accomplishments of Moroccan born entrepreneurs, politicians, artists, scientists, athletes, and journalists in Spain, France, Belgium, Holland, Canada, the United States, and even Italy demonstrate that Moroccans prosper when they are given a fair and equitable chance to compete for jobs and contracts. It is a shame, if not a crime, that such skillful and talented workforce should immigrate to find a worthy job when Morocco would be soon facing a major skills gap and a decline in direct foreign investments. If Moroccans come to expect and accept the poor executions of their representatives and elected officials, foreigners familiar with the laudable work of their Moroccans colleagues living abroad are always baffled with the discrepancies between the performance of the “two Moroccos”. As long as hiring decisions remain based on “whom you know” and “what you can” do, the Moroccan government and private sector will remain ill-equipped to handle an incoming economic meltdown smeared in a large fiscal deficit, higher taxes, and unskilled labor force.

Rabat – The Moroccan Minister of Economy and Finance, Mohamed Benchaaboun, announced that the Moroccan Pension Fund (CMR) will buy five university hospital centers (CHU). Benchaaboun has not disclosed the hospitals’ names. Benchaaboun made the announcement at a press conference on November 5. The move comes as part of a series of innovative mechanisms introduced in the  2020 Finance bill. The operation will generate MAD 4.5 billion for the state, money that will go back into the state spending budget. The mechanisms are required to finance 15% of investments in the general state budget as stipulated in the 2020 Financial bill. The financial practice is called privatization and is common in many industrialized countries. In practical terms, this means that the CMR will buy the CHU and rent them to the Moroccan state for public use. The memorandum of understanding was signed a few days ago, reported Moroccan news outlet Medias24. The innovative mechanisms will also concern the privatization of other state-owned facilities. Medias24 believes that the port of Safi will be among the first privatizations.

Rabat – This year’s Green March anniversary has not only served as an event for Morocco to renew commitment and sovereignty over its Sahara. During his annual televised speech on the 44th anniversary of the Green March anniversary, King Mohammed VI shared his aspirations and his vision for a more balanced internal economy, covering the 12 regions of Morocco On November 6, the monarch started his speech, with a firm and sincere vow that Morocco will not accept any solution to the Western Sahara conflict other than its Autonomy Plan. For Morocco, the Autonomy initiative submitted to the UN in 2007 is the “only way forward towards a settlement of the Moroccan Sahara conflict,” reiterated King Mohammed VI. Following  the staunch affirmation of Morocco’s unwavering position, the King addressed some challenges or obstacles, standing in the road to completing  regional development projects. Infrastructure was among the main challenges addressed in tonight’s speech. The King expressed surprise that, despite the geographical importance of particular regions, problems with infrastructure continue to hinder regionalization projects. Agadir, a national economic hub As an example, the King spoke about the lack of a railway connecting Agadir and Marrakech, two of Morocco’s most important cities, in terms of tourism and industry. By the end of July, nearly 7.544 million tourists visited Morocco, according to Morocco’s Tourism Observatory. Marrakech and Aagdir topped the list of favorite destinations. “The two tourist destinations of Marrakech and Agadir generated 57% of hotel nights in the first seven months of 2019,” according to the national observatory. In the same period, both Agadir and Marrakech recorded an increase of arrivals, 3% and 8% respectively.” The King regretted that despite Agadir’s central location, its resources, potential, and infrastructure remain issues that must be  addressed in the near future in order to open up into the region. “It is not reasonable that some basic infrastructure should end at Marrakech, whereas the Souss-Massa region is actually the center of Morocco and has enormous potential,” the King said. The King suggested the establishment of a railway connecting Marrakech and Agadir. He also recommended  a trainline extension covering the regions south of Marrakech. The King addressed instructions to Moroccan authorities, inviting them to give “serious thoughts” about the development of a railway to link the cities of Marrakech and Agadir. The project, according to the monarch, would be a first step “before extending it to the rest of the southern regions. We should also expand the road network, which I am seeking to further develop through the construction of the Agadir-Dakhla highway.” For the King, the project does not only seek to promote the region but also to contribute to its development and economic growth with regard to “the transport of people and goods and the promotion of exports, tourism and other economic activities.” The monarch also sees the project as an “essential lever” to create job opportunities, bearing in mind that unemployment is among the major challenges that Morocco continues to face. The unemployment rate stood at 9.4% at the end of September,  the High Commission for Planning said on Wednesday, November 6. The rate is slightly higher than the same period a year earlier when it stood at 9.3%. In his recent speeches, the King has called on the government to create more job opportunities for youth. The King is determined that the region of Souss Massa become a “economic hub” to serve as a bridge between northern and southern parts of Morocco. “This should be achieved within the framework of advanced regionalization and the equitable distribution of wealth between all regions,” the King said. He added that he looks forward to seeing a Morocco with “harmonious, integrated regions,” benefing on an equal footing from “infrastructure and major projects that should be profitable to all.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI expressed his commitment to ensuring balanced and equitable development in all regions of Morocco, and to establishing solid relationships with Morocco’s brother states in the Maghreb. Speaking on the evening of the 44th anniversary of the Green March on November 6, 2019, King Mohammed emphasized Morocco’s pivotal role in regional development.  “The current situation in the region and in the Mediterranean basin makes demands on us all,” he began. “It requires positive action, given the opportunities and the challenges involved.” The King went on to describe the unique challenges, hopes, and expectations of Morocco’s citizens, neighbors, and allies.  First, King Mohammed explained that the youth of the Maghreb need an open space for interaction and exchange, while the business sector requires favorable conditions for development.  The King asserted that Morocco needs to be an effective partner to its allies in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. “Finally,” he continued, “our Arab brothers look forward to seeing the Great Maghreb contribute to forging a new Arab order.” The Moroccan monarch described these hopes and expectations as enormous, and the challenges as numerous and complex. However, the common enemy, according to King Mohammed, is immobility and a low level of development. He continued his discussion of foreign policy with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. “The Moroccan Sahara is our country’s gateway to sub-Saharan Africa,” the Sovereign declared, adding that relations with African nations have always been at the heart of Morocco’s foreign policy.  “I have paid visits to numerous African countries, and close to 1,000 agreements have been signed, covering all areas of cooperation.” King Mohammed praised the economic, political, and cultural fruits borne of Morocco’s relations with sub-Saharan Africa.  “I firmly intend to make Morocco a key player in shaping the Africa of the future,” he stated before expressing his aim to launch a new stage of African coordination based on mutually beneficial interests.  A successful new age of cooperation between Morocco and sub-Saharan Africa, the Sovereign continued, requires Morocco to honor its commitments and to consolidate its presence in Africa. King Mohammed concluded his Green March speech by underscoring Morocco’s need to preserve national unity and territorial integrity, to promote global development across the country, and to strengthen relations between Morocco and other African countries. “We would thus reiterate our commitment to the Oath of the Green March, honor the memory of its architect, my revered father, His Majesty King Hassan II—may he rest in peace—and pay tribute to all the worthy Moroccans who made sacrifices so that Morocco may enjoy freedom and progress, in an environment where unity, security, and stability prevail.”

Here follows the full text of the royal speech: “Dear Citizens, The Green March has always been the best illustration of the effective cohesion between the throne and the people. It is testimony to the ability of Moroccans—the King and the people—to rise to the challenges facing the nation. This is a never-ending march. Indeed, the spirit which enabled us to recover the Sahara in 1975 is the same one which urges us today to achieve development in all the regions of the Kingdom. This naturally includes our southern provinces, which constitute a link between Morocco and the rest of Africa from the geographical, human, and economic perspectives. Dear Citizens, Morocco has always been clear in its position concerning the Moroccanness of the Sahara as much as in its firm belief in the justness of its cause and the legitimacy of its rights. It will continue to work honestly and in good faith to achieve a political, realistic, practical, and consensual solution based exclusively on the political approach adopted by the United Nations Organization and the relevant Security Council resolutions. The Autonomy Initiative provides for that solution, given that it is not only serious and credible, but also rooted in sound principles. It is the only way forward towards a settlement guaranteeing full respect for the kingdom’s national unity and territorial integrity. This tendency has been reinforced by the growing number of states—now more than 163—which do not recognize the fictitious entity. It is also confirmed by the partnerships and agreements which have been signed by Morocco with the influential powers as well as with many countries and sister nations, and which concern all the Kingdom’s regions, including the Saharan provinces. Dear Citizens, The Green March enabled Morocco to recover its southern provinces. As a result, the map of the Kingdom has changed. It is perhaps hard to believe that Rabat is, in fact, located in the country’s far north, and that Agadir is the center of the country. Indeed, the distance between Agadir and Tangier is roughly the same as that between Agadir and the Saharan provinces. With that in mind, it is not reasonable that some basic infrastructure should end at Marrakech, whereas the Souss-Massa region is actually the center of Morocco and has enormous potential. For this reason, I invite the authorities concerned to give serious thought to the development of a rail link between Marrakech and Agadir, as a first step before extending it to the rest of the southern regions. We should also expand the road network, which I am seeking to further develop through the construction of the Agadir-Dakhla highway. The railway line will contribute to opening up the regions concerned, in addition to stimulating development and economic prosperity, especially with regard to the transport of people and goods and the promotion of exports, tourism, and other economic activities. It will also create many job opportunities, not just in Souss-Massa, but in all surrounding regions, too. The Souss-Massa region must become an economic hub linking Morocco’s north to its south—from Tangier, in the north, to Oujda, in the east, to our southern provinces, in the south. This should be achieved within the framework of advanced regionalization and the equitable distribution of wealth between all regions. The country I would like to see should comprise harmonious, integrated regions that benefit, on an equal footing, from infrastructure and major projects that should be profitable to all. Regional development should be based on cooperation and complementarity between regions. Each region should have a major economic hub developed around its potential and specificities. Moreover, sectoral policies should be implemented at the regional level. It should be emphasized, in this regard, that the new momentum which has been created with respect to state institutions, the government and the civil service, should be extended to regions as well. Dear Citizens, My keenness to achieve fair, balanced development in all the kingdom’s regions is just as strong as my commitment to establishing sound, solid relations with sister Maghreb countries. The current situation in the region and in the Mediterranean basin makes demands on us all. It requires positive action, given the opportunities and the challenges involved. • Young people in the Maghreb want us to provide an open space conducive to communication and exchange; • The corporate sector expects us to bring about conditions to boost development; • Our partners, especially in Europe, need an effective partner; • Our fellow brothers and sisters in sub-Saharan Africa await our countries’ contribution to major programs on the continent and to tackling Africa’s main challenges; • And our Arab brothers look forward to seeing the Great Maghreb contribute to forging a new Arab order. Hopes, just like expectations, are running high, and the challenges are many and complex. Regrettably, some are not taking the situation seriously. As a matter of fact, we have one and the same enemy, namely inaction and limited development, which are having an adverse impact on the peoples of our five countries. Dear Citizens, The Moroccan Sahara is our country’s gateway to sub-Saharan Africa. Ever since I ascended the throne, I have put Africa at the heart of Morocco’s foreign policy. Therefore, I have paid visits to numerous African countries, and close to 1,000 agreements have been signed, covering all areas of cooperation. This has had a tangible impact on Morocco’s economic, political, cultural, and religious standing on the continent. I firmly intend to make Morocco a key player in shaping the Africa of the future. Moreover, our ambition is to increase the volume of trade with other African countries, to boost Morocco’s investments in the continent and to launch a new phase based on mutual benefit. The achievement of these goals hinges on the fulfillment of Morocco’s commitments as well as on expanding our presence in Africa. Dear Citizens, Ours is a collective responsibility to safeguard our national unity and territorial integrity, and to promote comprehensive development throughout Morocco. At the same time, it is our responsibility to strengthen the humanitarian, economic, and political relations binding Morocco to other African countries. We would thus reiterate our commitment to the Oath of the Green March, honor the memory of its architect, my revered father, His Majesty King Hassan II—may he rest in peace—and pay tribute to all the worthy Moroccans who made sacrifices so that Morocco may enjoy freedom and progress, in an environment where unity, security, and stability prevail. Wassalamu alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.”

Rabat – Under the leadership of King Hassan II, 350,000 Moroccans marched into the Sahara in a peaceful protest against the Spanish occupation of Western Sahara on November 6, 1975. Moroccans celebrate the anniversary of the Green March as a national holiday each year on November 6. History of the Spanish occupation The Spanish presence in Western Sahara began after the Berlin Conference of 1884 regulated European colonization and trade in Africa. At the time, King Hassan I ruled Morocco.  The Berlin Conference, headed by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, invited 13 European countries and the United States to establish a joint policy in Africa during the New Imperialism period of colonial expansion.  According to some historians, the Berlin Conference effectively launched the Scramble for Africa: The invasion, occupation, and colonization of African territory by European powers.  Through the Berlin Conference, the Spanish colonial empire established control over northern and southern Morocco, despite resistance from the local population. Leading up to the Green March  King Hassan II came to power in 1961 after the sudden death of his father, King Mohammed V.  “The Green March in Historical Perspective” by Jerome B. Weiner describes the events leading up to the groundbreaking demonstration against the Spanish occupation of Western Sahara. During the early years of his rule, King Hassan II relied heavily on the Royal Armed Forces (FAR). He founded and commanded the FAR in the late 1950s and the army was a cornerstone of his leadership.  However, the King’s own right arm turned on him with FAR trying to oust him on at least two occasions, in July 1971 and August 1972. Then, in 1973, there was an outbreak of guerrilla warfare from the Algerian border to Rabat and Casablanca.  These tumultuous years put King Hassan II in an exposed position, Weiner argues, as they “called into question the reliability of the army as a pillar of his legitimacy.”   Consequently, in 1973, the King began to more forcefully assert Morocco’s anticolonial position towards Spanish Western Sahara. He also promised to coordinate policy with the leaders of Mauritania and Algeria. The Moroccan public received this development favorably. Meanwhile, the UN continued to put pressure on Spain to decolonize Western Sahara. A series of liberation movements unfolded with the support of Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania. King Hassan II maintained a peaceful anti-colonial strategy towards Spain in the 1970s. King Hassan II’s call to action On October 16, 1975, King Hassan II delivered an unprecedented call to action to the Moroccan public on national TV and radio stations, officially launching the Green March.  “We have to do one thing dear people and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara.” And so began the mass mobilization of 350,000 Moroccans, “a number arrived at because it represents the number of births in Morocco each year” at the time, Weiner wrote.  In his speech, King Hassan II specified that 306,500 of the volunteers were to come from the general public, while the remaining 43,500 were local and provincial officials and other government functionaries.  Quotas for volunteers were set for each of Morocco’s provinces and prefectures, Weiner explains. Additionally, the King specified that each provincial tribe should send a certain number of troops on the Green March. Armed with Qurans 350,000 Moroccans marched into the Sahara Desert on November 6, 1975, armed with Moroccan flags, pictures of King Hassan II, green banners, and Qurans.  The Green March took its name from the color of Islam, a key influence and power behind the Moroccan movement. Brandishing Qurans, the Moroccan demonstrators were reminded of their King’s role as Commander of the Faithful.   After marching to Tarfaya, the Moroccan protesters came face to face with Spanish forces, according to Moroccan TV journalist Seddik Maaniou.  A 30-year-old Maaniou was on the first vehicle to cross the border into Spanish Western Sahara on the day of the Green March. He remembers seeing the Spanish army, stationed just 500 meters away, with his own eyes.  “Everyone waited to see what would happen,” Maaniou narrated to the BBC in 2015. “But in the end, each side stayed where they were.” “We had our tents and we had folk-singing groups. I wondered what the Spanish soldiers were thinking, looking at these people dancing around their fires, eating food and looking happy. And perhaps they were going to die!” The Madrid Accords Shortly after the King’s October 16 speech, talks between Spanish, Moroccan, and Mauritanian officials began.  When the talks did not appear to make any headway, King Hassan II decided to go ahead with the Green March. The mass protest symbolized Morocco’s unrelenting commitment to liberating Western Sahara.  After nearly a century of occupation, Spain finally bowed to regional and international pressure. On November 14, 1975, Spain signed the Madrid Accords and agreed to leave the territory by May 23. A patriotic event in Moroccan memory Every year on November 6, Moroccans celebrate their country’s determination to retake the Spanish provinces in Western Sahara.  The Green March is considered a watershed event in Morocco’s recent history, and Moroccans celebrate the event as a national holiday.   While the Spanish rescinded their imperial claim in Morocco’s south, Spain still controls the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla along Morocco’s northern Mediterranean coast. The Spanish territories, once highly-coveted port cities, have come to symbolize the strain of the migration crisis in Europe and Morocco. The Green March has left a lasting impact on contemporary Morocco, where its legacy reflects a patriotic and peaceful people. Remembering the large-scale act of solidarity in 1975 is a celebration of the Moroccan people’s commitment to an independent and strong Morocco.  However, territorial disputes in Western Sahara still persist.  Until the conflict is resolved, Morocco will need to harness the determination and strength of the Green March as it continues to support the UN-led peace process in the region, a process that is based on negotiation and consensus.

Rabat – French Minister of Armed Forces Florence Parly announced on November 5 that French forces killed a Moroccan terror fighter in Mali in early October. Parly told the AFP that  French troops killed Abdou Abdel Rahman, known as Al Maychou, on the night of October 8-9. The operation took place in coordination with Malian and American forces. She added that the terror fighter was the “second most wanted terrorist in the Sahel.” Al Maychou joined Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2012. The French official said that Al Maychou is the second of two topo targets killed this year; Security services also killed number one target Algerian Djamel Okacha, known as Abu El Hamame, in February. It is “necessary to continue this work of counterterrorism,” the French official warned. The statement followed a fatal terror attack on a military post in northern Mali. The attack killed at least 53 soldiers and one civilian. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The Sahel remains one of the territories that still  pose a dangerous threat to the region due to the scourge of terrorism. Morocco’s top security chiefs have long warned that security cooperation is needed to face terror challenges in the region. Last year during several interviews, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak El Khiame, expressed his deep concerns over the security threat in Sahel, where terror groups continue to jeopardize the stability of the region. El Khiame  described the Sahel as “a fertile ground for terrorism.” He recalled Morocco’s “efficient” policy, as well as its security system aimed at confronting  all dangers related to terrorism and drug trafficking.

Rabat – Morocco is an up-and-comer in the aerospace sector. Currently boasting 140 aerospace companies, it aims to bring together more than 220 companies to operate within its aerospace hubs. Aeronautics has significant potential in Morocco with more than 80 new companies planning to invest in the aerospace industry in Morocco in the coming years, wrote Moroccan newspaper, L’Economiste, on Tuesday, November 4. “The sector, which currently hosts 140 companies, will have 220 in the next 11 years,” added the paper. The country has even managed to exceed its local integration goal rate of 32% by reaching 38%. Morocco is now aiming for an integration rate of 42% by the end of 2020.  The geographical position, political stability, and low labor force costs have all contributed to making Morocco the most attractive hub for investment in Africa, according to L’Economiste. Following the launch of the Industrial Acceleration Plan (PAI) in 2014, Morocco doubled its aerospace export turnover to reach MAD 17 billion. According to the 2018 figures from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, and the Digital Economy, the sector employed more than 15,000 people, generating a turnover of $1.2 million, and had an annual growth rate of 18%.  Morocco’s objective through the PAI is to create 8,700 additional jobs. The plan also sets out a program for the sector to reach an additional export turnover of MAD 27 billion. For the year 2021, Morocco projects sales (excluding the Boeing ecosystem) of $2.6 billion. The sector will triple its revenues. The Boeing ecosystem consists of structuring a business environment made up of suppliers with a sourcing platform based in Morocco. The ecosystem will reach an annual export turnover of one billion dollars, leading to the establishment of 120 Boeing suppliers, and allowing for the creation of 8,700 specialist jobs.  Boeing will implement dedicated training programs specially designed to cover the training needs of its ecosystem. The Aviation Professions Institute (IMA) also gives vocational training for professionals in the sector.  IMA’s medium-term objective is to train 800 persons per year in aviation and aerospace professions thanks to a tool of international standards, set up as a result of a partnership between the GIMAS (Group of Moroccan Aviation and Aerospace Industrialists), the UIMM (Union of Metallurgical Profession Industries) and the state of Morocco. Morocco boasts nearly 11,500 aviation professionals, of whom 50% are women. The aerospace companies operate in Casablanca’s Aéropole Nouaceur and Midparc free zones, as well as Tangier, Kenitra, Oujda, and Salé, which have aerospace facilities. “Morocco site has become an essential base in the aeronautical construction, distributed in the ecosystems assembly, engineering, RMO (maintenance of aircraft and engines), electrical systems, or composite ecosystems, engine, and embedded electronics,” continued L’Economiste. L’Economiste is not the only publication to laud Morocco’s progress in the aerospace sector.  Mazars, a Paris-based global audit, accounting, and consulting group reported in 2016 that Morocco has consolidated its international position to be among the top 5 most attractive countries for the installation of subcontractors, just behind France, the United States, China, and Germany.

Rabat –  The public prosecutor’s office issued a statement on Tuesday, November 5, emphasizing that it is ready to re-investigate claims of torture made by detained Hirak movement leader Nasser Zefzafi. A leaked recording made by Zefzafi has gone viral on social media. In the recording, Zefzafi claimed he was subject to “torture” and inhumane conditions during his arrest. The General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) denied that detainees held at the Ras El Ma prison in Fez were subject to “any ill-treatment.” During his arrest, Zefzafi made not mention of having been subject to “indecent assault,” the public prosecutor said. The statement added that during his first appearance before the public prosecutor’s office on June 5 207, the detainee said he “suffered only violence at the time of his arrest in Al Hoceima.” The statement added that the injuries he sustained were “minor wounds observed on his body, which were recorded within the minutes of his arrest.” The  public prosecutor added that Zefzafi sustained injuries due to “his fierce and violent resistance at the time of arrest by security services.” The statement added that the detainee had said that the judicial security services who conducted the investigation “had treated him well and had not subjected him to any violence or torture during the interrogation process.” However, Zefzai told the judge at the first instance court that he had been the subject of an “indecent assault attempt.” In the statement, the public prosecutor recalled that a medical examination conducted on June 8, 2017, showed that the Hirak activist “had not been subjected to any aggression, rape, or indecent assault.” The statement added that the injuries he sustained, “as recorded in the judicial police report, go back to the date of his arrest on May 29, 2017.” Police arrested Zefzafi, among other protestors, in  Al Hoceima for driving the emergence of the Hirak movement. Protests took off after the death of fishmonger Mohcine Fikri in October 2016. Zefzafi led the movement, with protests sweeping the al Hoceima region calling for social justice and condemning social disparities. The prosecutor’s office ordered Zefzafi’s arrest in May 2017 after he interrupted a prayer sermon inside the Mohammed V mosque in Al Hoceima. Zefzafi, along with three other detainees, is serving a 20 year prison sentence for “undermining the security of the state.”

Rabat – Former journalist Zineb El Rhazoui is at the center of a new controversy after her comments on the Mantes-la-Jolie incident. On October 25 clashes erupted between police and hundreds of young people. The Moroccan-born French journalist said that the police should have used “live ammunition” against the youths. She described the young people involved in the clashes as “barbarians.” The former Charlie Hebdo journalist made remarks in a televised broadcast at CNews on November 5. Speaking during a debate on urban violence and the government approach to address the issue, El Rhazoui said: “The police must shoot real bullets in these cases.”. She added that the American police “would have fired live ammunition,” if  the clashes happened in the US. The guests on the show, including journalist Pascal Praud and Gerard Leclerc, strongly opposed El Rhazoui statement. Leclerc said, “in a normal democracy, we do not do that.” Former spokesman for the French Communist Party Olivier Dartigolles said that El Rhazoui’s statement amounts to a “call for murder.” After the debate, EL Rhazoui took to Twitter to defend herself, arguing that the law allows police officers to shoot  [ people] when threatened with death or serious injury.” In another tweet, she denied having ever recommended that “the police should shoot at protesters or people” who don’t pose a threat. She added that she “fights for democracy.”

Rabat – The number of undocumented children in Morocco reached 91,747 by the end of 2018. Morocco’s Human Rights Minister Mustapha Ramid presented the number to the House of Representatives in a parliamentary session. Undocumented children do not have a proof of identity and cannot benefit from basic rights such as education. The main reasons behind this issue are undocumented marriages, non-declared births, or simply parental negligence, the minister explained. Ramid’s report stated that the region of Rabat-Sale-Kenitra has 28,346 undocumented children, the highest regional number in Morocco. The regions of Fes-Meknes and Marrakech-Safi have the second and third highest numbers at 15,510 and 14,085 cases respectively. In 2018, the Moroccan government launched two national campaigns to urge parents to register their children in the social records. According to the report, around 70,000 children became documented thanks to the campaigns. Ramid added that children are not the only category that suffer from this issue. The campaigns led to the registration of 9,370 previously-undocumented adults. Women constitute around 75% of the number. In October 2019, the Ministry of Interior instructed all Moroccan administrations to facilitate the registration of children born from undocumented marriages. Article 16 of the Family Code considers the marriage certificate as the only legal and official proof of marriage. Couples without a marriage certificate face administrative obstacles when trying to register their children in civil records. The new instructions from the government aim to simplify the parental recognition procedures in order to reduce problems related to child registration.

Rabat – Spain plans to recruit around 16,500 Moroccan seasonal workers in 2020. The seasonal workers will take part in the strawberries and red fruit harvest season in the region of Huelva, southern Spain. Morocco’s Ministry of Employment and Vocational Integration made the announcement in a press release after a Moroccan delegation visited the Spanish region to prepare the recruitment operation. Spanish authorities shared plans to hire 11,000 Moroccan workers who have already participated in a previous season, and 5,500 first-timers. The experienced workers will receive their work permits starting December 2019 and start working in February 2020. Those who will take part in the harvest season for the first time will receive their permits in January 2020 and start working in March 2020. The Moroccan delegation to Spain evaluated last season’s results during their meeting with the Spanish delegation. Last year, 14,572 Moroccan workers participated in the harvest season. During the meeting, the ministry representatives also discussed ways to improve work conditions and the workers’ housing. The work contracts will have a minimal duration of six months that employers can renew. The organizers of the operation are studying the possibility of transporting the workers on a boat from Tangier to Huelva. The two delegations are also preparing a program to promote training and cultural activities for the seasonal workers. The Moroccan delegation included the secretary general of the ministry of employment, the director of the National Agency for Jobs and Skills Promotion (ANAPEC), and Morocco’s general consul in Sevilla. Its Spanish counterpart was composed of the general director of migration at the Ministry of Employment, Migration, and Social Security, representatives from Huelva’s government, and the employment, migration, and social security advisor at the Spanish embassy in Rabat. Thousands of Moroccan rural women participate in the harvest seasons every year. In the past months and years, however, there have been numerous complaints of sexual abuse, exploitation, and unpaid labor. “In Morocco, they are deliberately looking for those who are cheap and vulnerable to do this work, namely rural women with young children who only understand Arabic, cannot understand their contracts written in Spanish or claim their rights,” one woman told the Guardian. Despite the reports of abuse and exploitation, the extremely high unemployment rate in Morocco means the project continues to attract many Moroccan workers. Earlier this year, Morocco set up a committee to deal with the recurring exploitation and sexual abuse complaints, vowing to preempt a repeat of previous scandals and defend the rights of the women it annually sends to Spanish strawberry fields.

Rabat – On the 44th anniversary of the Green March in Morocco, football legends from around the world will convene at the Sheikh Mohamed Laghdaf Stadium in Laayoune for a gala match on Wednesday, November 6. The annual Green March celebration commemorates the 1975 movement when 350,000 unarmed Moroccans marched into the Sahara. The march protested the Spanish occupation of Western Sahara during the rule of King Hassan II. The anniversary of the Green March is celebrated in Morocco as a national holiday, and the football match in Laayoune is a key component of the annual celebration.  Dozens of international football stars, most of whom are retired, will face off in the traditional Green March gala match.  The players will be divided into two teams based on their country of origin. One team will consist of players from Africa and the Middle East, and the other welcomes players from the rest of the world.  Some of the football stars have taken to social media to announce their arrival in Morocco, much to the delight of their Moroccan fans who have been leaving words of welcome under the players’ photos.  The African team Khalilou Fadiga, a retired Senagelse midfielder, shared an Instagram selfie this afternoon announcing his touchdown in Morocco.      #maroc et me voilà chez les lions de l Atlas,toujours un plaisir de revoir cette belle ville #marrakech En route pour célébrer #lamarcheverte, à #Laayoune cette grande marche est une étape marquante dans l’histoire du Royaume #sahara #noiretfier #blackandwhite #blackexcellence #blackmen #africa GOD IS GOOD A post shared by @ khaliloufadiga on Nov 5, 2019 at 3:18am PST  In his caption, Fadiga described the 1975 Green March as a “milestone in the history of the Kingdom,” tagging the photo #sahara. Nader El-Sayed, a former Egyptian goalkeeper, shared several Instagram stories last night from Dar Moha, an upscale Moroccan restaurant in Marrakech.  Zoubaier Baya, a retired Tunisian midfielder, has been sharing photos of himself in Morocco since Sunday. He posted a photo to his Instagram story last night with Kalusha Bwalya, a Zambian former international footballer, after sharing videos of his outings in Marrakech.  Baya also snapped a group photo with Tareq al Taieb and Karim Haggui.  Al Taieb, a Libyan midfielder, shared the same photo on his Instagram. “With the stars of Arab and African football,” his caption reads in Arabic.     مع نجوم الكرة العربية والأفريقية ، الحاج ضيوف , زبير بية التونسي ،كريم حقي تونس 🇲🇦🌹 A post shared by  طارق التايب (@tareqaltaib77) on Nov 4, 2019 at 2:39pm PST Al Taieb also posted a photo with Ismail Youssef, a retired Egyptian football player, at the Savoy Le Grand Hotel in Marrakech.  Haggui reposted the group picture with Baya and al Taieb, as well. The Tunisian national, who is now a coach in Germany, also shared a photo with Roger Milla, a retired Cameroonian forward.  In an Instagram story, Haggui posed with his wife at the Royal Mansour Hotel in Marrakech.   Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, and Niger will also be represented by football stars at the Green March gala match. Two players from Saudi Arabia will be on the African team, along with a player from the UAE.  The list of 20 confirmed players on the African team also includes Abedi Pele and Samuel Eto’o. The international team Javier Saviola shared a photo on Instagram yesterday of himself seated beside a Moroccan flag. The photo’s location is simply tagged Morocco. “Hello Morocco,” his caption reads in Spanish. “It’s a huge joy to be here again.”     Hola Marruecos 🇲🇦 una alegría enorme estar nuevamente por aquí @othmane_kettani A post shared by  Javier Saviola (@javier.saviolaok) on Nov 4, 2019 at 1:10pm PST Saviola is a retired forward from Argentina. The 37-year-old played for various European teams throughout his career, including Real Madrid and Barcelona.  Fellow Argentine footballer Hernan Crespo, the country’s fourth-highest goalscorer, confirmed his arrival in Morocco today with an Instagram story. Rafael Marquez, widely regarded as one of the best Mexican footballers of all time, shared a video of himself in Marrakech on Instagram.  Rivaldo Ferreira announced his arrival in Morocco today through Instagram stories, posted to both his and his wife’s profiles.  The retired Brazilian footballer, known as Rivaldo, was the second top goalscorer in his first season at Barcelona.  Luis Figo, an iconic retired Portuguese midfielder for Barcelona and Real Madrid, also arrived in Marrakech today after celebrating his 47th birthday on November 4.      Arrived in Marrakech for the LAAYOUNE a international charity game with the Support of the King MOHAMMED VI @setoo9 @othmane_kettani @mohamedramadanws ⚽️👌 A post shared by  Luís Figo (@luis__figo) on Nov 5, 2019 at 9:13am PST Edmilson Moraes, known as Edmilson, shared a video with his Instagram followers as he boarded a flight from Istanbul to Casablanca.  The 2002 World champion from Brazil played for Sao Paulo, Olympique Lyonnais, and Barcelona during his international football career. Footballers from Italy, Serbia, Mexico, Spain, Uruguay, Portugal, and France will also represent the international team at the Green March gala match.  The list of 18 confirmed players on the international team also includes Diego Forlan and Cafu. Notable absences Fans of the retired Brazilian star Ronaldinho, who participated in the Green March gala match last year, will be disappointed by his absence from this year’s event. False reports circulated among Moroccan news outlets that David Beckham, a retired English football star and UNICEF ambassador, was set to participate in the Green March match.  UNICEF UK denied these claims on Twitter. As a branch of the UN, UNICEF holds a neutral position in the Western Sahara conflict. Beckham, as a UNICEF ambassador, is bound by the same regulations.  The Green March anniversary football match serves as a celebration of Morocco’s momentous protest against Spanish imperialism while promoting the Kingdom as a football destination.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI will deliver on Wednesday, November 6 a speech to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Green March. On November 5, the Ministry of Royal Household, Protocol and Chancellery announced that the Royal speech will be aired on radio and TV channels starting at 9:00 p.m.  Last year on the 43rd anniversary of the Green March, King Mohammed VI delivered an unprecedented speech, inviting Algeria to join a “frank” and “direct dialogue” to break the political stalemate between Rabat and Algiers. Algeria, a main financial and political supporter of the Polisario Front, opposes Morocco’s territorial integrity in the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco considers Algeria a main party to the Western Sahara conflict. Morocco does not entertain any dialogue or negotiation with the Polisario Front as it lacks the legitimacy to represent Sahrawis. In previous Green March speeches, the monarch emphasized Morocco’s established principles as a  frame of reference. One of the four main principles include Morocco’s refusal to consider any solution to the Western Sahara conflict other than within “the framework of Morocco’s full sovereignty over its Sahara and the Autonomy Initiative,” said the King in his 42nd Green March commemoration speech. The Green March is a historical event, recalling Moroccans’ attachment and commitment to their homeland. Moroccans displayed incredible patriotism when late King Hassan II called upon his people to join a peaceful march towards the southern provinces in Western Sahara and to gather in the Moroccan town of Tarfaya, 100 kilometers north of Laayoune. On November 6, 1975, more than 350,000 unarmed Moroccan men and women rallied in Tarfaya to cross the border into Western Sahara, in protest of the Spanish occupation in the region.

Rabat – Morocco ranked 76th in the 2019 English Proficiency Index (EF EPI), maintaining a “very low” score in the recent ranking. The index listed Morocco among the very low proficiency countries with a score of only 47.19. In 2018, Morocco scored 48.10, and the index listed it 60th out of 88 countries. Morocco maintained its position in the regional index, where it is ranked sixth behind Tunisia (fifth), and Ethiopia (fourth). South Africa, ranked sixth globally, tops the index in Africa, followed by Kenya (18th in the global ranking). Nigeria came third in Africa and 29th in the world. The index ranked Algeria the 90th on the list. “Adults in North Africa speak English at levels similar to their peers in the Middle East. Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have complex linguistic landscapes with local dialects of Arabic, Berber, French, and Modern Standard Arabic all serving various roles in private life, the education system, and the public sphere.” The index emphasized that the English language is a newcomer to ‘the mix.’ The statement is particularly relevant to Morocco as senior Moroccan officials do not see English replacing French any time soon. Earlier this year, Morocco’s Minister of Education Said Amzazi said that French will remain the second language after Arabic in Moroccan schools. He ruled out the possibility of English replacing French in schools, stating that “everyone knows that science books are currently available in English more than French, and French more than Arabic. But we teach in the French language.” Languages in Morocco are one of the topical issues dividing public opinions. While some promote Arabic and English, others believe that French should continue to take the lead.  The Minister of Education urged Moroccan schools to implement the framework law 51.17 at the start of the academic year 2019-2020.  Article 31 of the framework law calls for the teaching of scientific and technical subjects in middle and high schools in foreign languages (mainly French).

Rabat – The appeal court of Casablanca has sentenced Zine El Abidine El Howas, the former mayor of Had Soualem, a town near Casablanca, to seven years in prison. The court judged the former official guilty of corruption, waste of public funds, and embezzlement on Monday, November 4. The court sentenced the other defendants in the case, also former officials in the Had Soualem municipality, to prison for between one and two years depending on the severity of their crimes. Police arrested El Howas in June 2017. The former mayor possessed around MAD 170 million in cash at his home. He participated in various corrupt acts. El Howas awarded a contract for a municipality plan, valued at MAD 800 million, without a call for bids. He also exploited the region’s resources by removing dozens of eucalyptus trees that decorated a public road to use them as fuel in four hammams (public baths) that he owns. The court accused El Howas of allowing inhabitants of some villages to connect their houses to electricity and drinking water networks illegally. Corruption is one of the major problems that hinder Morocco’s economic development. In July 2018, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said that corruption wastes approximately 7% of Morocco’s GDP every year, suggesting that the most effective way to deal with Morocco’s enduring economic and social problems is to fight corruption in public administration. In May 2018, the Moroccan government launched an anti-corruption hotline. The initiative implemented the government’s national plan to end all forms of corruption by 2050. Since its launch, the hotline has received several calls and complaints concerning public employees.

Rabat – When Ambassador Thomas Reilly speaks about Morocco, he does so fondly and with the unassailable, irrepressible joy of someone who is in with love his job. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Gathering to reflect on Morocco At bottom, Reilly’s joy, that engagingness and availability that has gained him a good reputation with Moroccan media, is immersive, contagious, and is a tribute to his defiantly easy-going demeanor for a “boss.” It is easy, as Reilly speaks after all from the vantage point of the British ambassador to Rabat, to read in his characteristic joie de vivre a skilled performance, one of the many demands of his job as a diplomat. Prior to our interview at his Rabat residence, on a light evening on October 30, the British diplomat introduced to an enthusiastic audience Alice Morrison, the world-renowned Scottish adventurer, known for her attachment to Morocco. Reilly, had he been performing for special effect, would probably have  dwelt on the big stuff of a fulfilled life. But he did not, instead immersing the audience in the joy of the plain stuff—the joy of small things. It was all about encounters. Friendships. Sustaining and nourishing the social connections one makes along the way, as one swings or grinds—depending on where one stands—one’s way through life cycles. “Alice and I have known each other since before we were born,” Ambassador Reilly announced to an exultant, giggling audience. He explained how his parents and Morrison’s had known each other for years. And, as Morrison took the centerstage on that light October evening to talk about her book of adventures on Morocco’s absorbing landscapes—the raison d’être of the gathering— the ambassador left the spotlight just as he had grabbed it: with aplomb and simplicity. In between, there were stories of Moroccan-British friendships; of similarities and differences; of “shared humanity;” of expectations for the prospects of the (growing) bilateral friendships between the two kingdoms. There were exaggerations, of course, sometimes in questions asked and at others in answers provided. Gateway to Africa MWN sat down with Ambassador Reilly amid that festive, almost blasé mood as conversations at the gathering circled to and fro about the value of adventures, travelling, and the genuine sense of what it really means to fall in love with a place. Quickly—and quite expectedly—however, our conversation turned to the news that had dominated the UK-Morocco relations just days before that relaxed, adventure-themed gathering: The signature of a post-Brexit Association Agreement between Rabat and London. Signed on Saturday, October 26, the deal is expected to keep the UK-Morocco relations afloat and undisturbed even after Brexit finally enters into force. “It should first and foremost be noted that this agreement is one of continuity,” Reilly said when asked about the significance and the timing of the agreement. “It means that after Brexit, once the UK is effectively no longer an EU member, commercial ties will continue between our two countries. This is very important for us because the UK imports a host of agriculture products from Morocco and we export many things, especially services, to this country.” Having set the tone, and having briefly described what that “continuity” deal meant for a post-Brexit environment, he went on to reflect on the timing of the “strategic relationship” with Morocco. Why sign the post-Brexit deal now? The idea has been floated around that the UK has actually been pushing for the deal for quite a long time. But Rabat, which understandably had other things on its diplomatic plate—the assertive return to Africa, the usual arm-wrestle over the inclusion of Western Sahara in its fisheries and agriculture deals with the EU, and its charm offensive with typically pro-Polisario partners—repeatedly delayed. One source from the British Foreign Ministry told MWN, “We have wanted this to happen since the start of the Brexit negotiations with the EU. But Morocco kept telling us to wait.” Ambassador Reilly does not repudiate the idea. Nor does he give it any extended attention. From him, it was a familiar refrain but different verses. With great diplomatic panache, he offered what read like a succinct, pithy summation of the UK’s increased interest in Morocco. “In terms of strategic relationship, the UK has historically perceived Morocco as the preserve of France. For years, my government saw Morocco as a bit of an exotic place. It came across as not really France, not really the Middle East, not exactly Africa. As it was difficult to frame the country, the idea was simply to leave it alone.” Now, however, “my government sees Morocco as a gateway to Africa. Morocco really knows a lot about Africa, and we know some parts of Africa. So this deal is really about bringing our strategic relations to the next level.” In the ambassador’s reckoning, that next level, post-Brexit is “particularly a good thing” because it allows for “more profound” bilateral ties between the UK and an array of countries it wouldn’t have particularly looked at outside of the EU frame. The Morocco-UK “continuity” deal, he argued, is an integral part of that post-Brexit diplomatic pathway the UK seeks to engineer in weeks and months after it definitely leaves the European club. Western Sahara central issue for Morocco For all the startling clarity, the spontaneity, and the authoritative aura of his responses—he knows by heart the exact statistics of UK-Morocco commercial transactions and the number of overnight stays by UK tourists in Morocco—another immense charm in Reilly is the winning ease with which he speaks about sensitive, fraught topics. Talking to him, there are no unnecessary shrugs, no sidestepping, no answering the questions he wants rather the ones he has been asked.  On Western Sahara, the defining question for Morocco, as he put it, the British diplomat was as direct as he was thoughtful, intelligently and assuredly navigating a potentially explosive diplomatic terrain. “Let’s face it: the Western Sahara issue is a central question for Morocco. And we [the UK government] are very well aware of this fact,” he prefaces his answer to the question as to why, in spite of the usual fuss, pro-Polisario fervor in the case, the continuity deal entails products from Western Sahara. Here, however, he spoke about wider commitments, about the necessity for the international community to ease the Western Sahara congestion. But back to the question at hand—does the inclusion of Western Sahara in the continuity agreement mean the UK supports Morocco’s position?—he answered by detailing his government’s position in four bullet points. That the UN Security Council is the only legitimate broker of the Western Sahara dispute. That London “applauds and supports” the momentum spurred by the Geneva roundtables. That his government holds the well-established view that a compromise-based political solution is the most viable alternative in the territorial dispute. And that the UK “salutes” and acknowledges “serious and credible efforts by Morocco” towards a pragmatism and compromise-based settlement. And then, relatedly: “Our bilateral agreement with Morocco replicates the EU-Morocco treaties; we did not change a thing in the EU texts. So our inclusion of products from Western Sahara follows the same spirit.”

Rabat – Turkish officials have announced the arrest of Rasmiya Awad, sister of former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Turkey’s communication director  Fahrettin Altun announced the news on Twitter on November 5. “Turkey’s fight against terror regardless of its ideology or origin continues unabated,” he said. He added that the arrest of al-Baghdadi’s sister is “yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations.” The news of Awad’s arrest comes a week after US President Donald Trump confirmed the death of her brother, the former ISIS leader, in a us-led military operation in Syria on October 26. Analysts and observers believe that al-Baghdadi’s sister, captured in Allipo by Turkish forces, might help intelligence services in their investigation into ISIS and terror organizations. Top security officials believe that the death of al Baghdadi is not the end of ISIS threats. The terror organization named a new leader for ISIS just a week after the US announcement. In a new audio clip, ISIS warned that its fighters are on the “doorstep of Europe and in the center of Africa.” Morocco, a leader in counter-terrorism, has warned against the threats posed by ISIS in the region, emphasizing that security cooperation is necessary. Last year, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), Abdelhak Khiame, said  that  “no one should say that the ISIS threat has ended.”  He argued that the war against ISIS will take a long time. He said that social media helps terrorists to spread their ideologies easily. Khiame added that there are many people who are known to have adopted ISIS ideology and are waiting for an opportunity to wage terror attacks.

Rabat – Online video platform Youtube has removed the music video of Moroccan pop singer Saad Lamjarred’s song “Ensay” (Forget). The song was a collaboration between Lamjarred and the Egyptian actor and singer Mohamed Ramadan. The music video was uploaded onto Mohamed Ramadan’s Youtube channel in July 2019. It garnered over 170 million views. Youtube explained that they removed the video because of copyright infringement. The video director, Hossam L Hossainy, said that he “and the team that worked on the video still don’t understand why it was removed,” in a statement to the press. “I am currently trying to find out the reason behind the removal of the video and to find a solution,” he added. Lamjarred and Ramadan, the artists behind the music video, have not yet commented on the removal of the video. This is not the first time Youtube has removed one of Lamjarred’s songs. In October 2019, Youtube removed the artist’s latest music video “Salam” after Moroccan artist Hicham Telmoudi accused Lamjarred of plagiarism. Telmoudi stated that a part from his 2015 song “Agwal souss” was used in Lamjarred’s “Salam” without his approval. “At the end of [Lamjarred’s “Salam” music video], it is mentioned that the song was inspired by the Amazigh musical heritage, but it is not a heritage work, since it is my own song, where I also collaborated with Ahwach artists,” said the artist. A few days after the removal, the video went back online after Lamjarred’s music producer defended the case. In September 2019, Lebanese singer Joe Raad claimed that Lamjarred copied his style in the music video for “Lmaallem”, the most-viewed Arabic song on Youtube with more than 770 million views.

Rabat – According to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Spain has reduced the number of undocumented migrants crossing its borders by more than 50%. The prime minister emphasized that the vast reduction in irregular migrant arrivals was thanks to cooperation with international partners, especially Morocco. “We have managed to reduce by more than 50% the number of illegal migrants arriving on our shores through cooperation with our partners, especially with Morocco,” Sanchez said during a televised debate on Monday, November 4. The debate convened leaders of the main Spanish political parties represented in parliament. The Spanish Prime Minister explained that his country advocates a “humanitarian approach, dialogue, and cooperation with countries of origin and transit like Morocco” for the management of migration flows. Last week, the Spanish Interior Ministry emphasized that Spain reduced arrivals of undocumented migrants arriving by sea in Spain between January 1 and October 30  by more than 53% compared to a year earlier. The statistics shared by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) added that a total of 22,247 undocumented migrants reached Spanish by the sea in makeshift boats as of October 30 against 47,684 migrants during the same period of 2018. The number represents a decline of 53.3%, the ministry added in its report on irregular migration from January to October 2019. About 1,030 boats arrived on the Spanish coast from January to October of 2019, compared to 1,775 boats during the same period last year. The difference constitutes a 42% decrease. A recent report from the European Commission also extolled Morocco’s effective cooperation to help reduce the number of undocumented migrants in Spain. For the commission, the “preventive efforts by Moroccan authorities continue to be effective and they are key to understanding  the strong reduction in arrivals in Spain during 2019.” Morocco’s approach to fighting irregular migration takes into account “shared responsibility” as a key aspect in tackling the issue. In August, the director of migration and border surveillance at Morocco’s Ministry of Interior Khalid Zerouali said that “border security is the responsibility of all countries, all countries must contribute to make the fight against cross-border crime an effective fight.” The Moroccan government announced in August that Morocco aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019.

Rabat – The Moroccan campaign to boycott Israel (BDS Maroc)  has called on the youth to abstain from participation at the fifth Forum of Young Leaders, a symposium that will take place in Essaouira from November 15-17. The condemnatory statement came in response to the possible participation of Israeli youth at the event. BDS described the move as a “clear normalization [with Israel] and an attempt to show the state of occupation and colonial-Israeli settlement as a natural partner in a forum.” The campaign emphasized Morocco’s solidarity with the Palestinian people, emphasizing that the “majority of our people absolutely reject normalization” with Israel. The event is sponsored by the French embassy in Morocco in collaboration with the French Institute. The  movement said that it is the “first time that the French embassy invited Israel to participate in the form.” The French embassy in Israel shared a statement in September, calling on Israeli youth, who understand French to apply to participate in the Euro-Mediterranean Young leaders. Morocco World News contacted the French Institute in Rabat for confirmation of Israeli participation at the event. The institute has not yet responded.  BDS strongly criticized the French embassy, condemning Israeli violations against Palestinians. “We denounce the fact that the French Embassy seeks to host Israeli youths in Morocco, since the position of the Maghreb people in general, especially the position of Moroccan people has been consistent with” the Palestinian cause. The call to boycott the event follows a  statement of condemnation from the Moroccan Observatory for Anti-Normalization with Israel in October when former Israeli Minister of Interior Meir Sheetrit who took part in the 12th annual World Policy Conference in Marrakech. The observatory argued in a statement that “Zionists started considering Morocco as a paradise of normalization.” The statement criticized the Moroccan government for the “intentional confusion between Moroccans” and “the Moroccan diaspora in Israel.” Morocco is among the Arab countries that have expressed their steadfast support for the Palestinian cause. In September, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Mothani reiterated Morocco’s position, emphasizing that  the country and King Mohammed VI confirmed their  “clear position that all attempts to undermine the status of Jerusalem are unacceptable.”  Morocco is also one of the countries that rejected the US “Peace Plan” known as the deal of the century. In letters and statements from King Mohammed VI, Morocco has officially “expressed rejection for the deal of the century once and for all,” El Othmani clarified.

In August 2019, the advisor expressed her support to the Moroccan government after the adoption of amendments concerning the inheritance law. We applaud the Moroccan gov. for this important step towards the adoption of inheritance law amendments &amp; look forward to supporting their full implementation.
W-GDP will continue to support women’s land rights &amp; I appreciate the strong leadership of HH Princess Lalla Joumala. — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) August 19, 2019  The message came weeks after the Moroccan House of Representatives unanimously adopted three bills in relation to communal agricultural land (sullaliat). The bills take into account King Mohammed VI’s instructions, calling on the government to take measures to meet the demands of rights holders. The bills also concern the aspirations of rights holders, including women also known as sullaliat. The sullaliat women have been demanding for equal rights in inheritance law for more than 10 years. During her visit, Trump will be accompanied with Sean Cairncross, CEO of the Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The corporation is a US foreign aid agency aiming to help developing countries promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and strengthen institutions. Morocco and the US have strong diplomatic ties. In June 2004, Rabat and Washington signed the Free Trade Agreement. The agreement became effective in January 2006. Since then, the volume of trade between Morocco and the US has quadrupled. Trade reached $5.44 billion in 2018, compared to $1.34 billion in 2006. Exports also increased to $1.38 billion in 2018 from only $0.26 billion in 2006. Morocco and the US have also intensified exchanges of visits to develop and reinforce cooperation in several fields, including security and trade.

Rabat – The High Commission for Planning (HCP) has published a report showing that single living is on the rise in Morocco. The report, “Population and development in Morocco,” emphasized that marriage has been in a continuous decline in Morocco in recent years. The report studies the current average marriage age compared to the previous generations.  The study emphasized that  Moroccan women used to marry on average at the age of 17 while men tied the knot at 24 during the independence era (1956). However, the average age for first marriages reached “very high levels” (31 years for men and 25 years for women) in 2014. The study showed that marriage ages changed from 31.3 years to 31.9 for men, and from 25.7 years to 25.5 for women in 2018. “The transition from early marriage to an increasingly late marriage took place simultaneously in both urban and rural areas.” The study finds that female celibacy reached “high levels at critical ages.” In statistics, HCP said that almost a quarter to 24% of women aged 30 between 30 and 34 had never been married, with permanent celibacy accounting for more than 11% of women aged 45 -49. Last year, British NGO Family Optimise released a study showing an increasing number of women who choose to remain single until later in life. The study shows that 60% of women of marriageable age are single. The study indicates that the number of single women has increased by 4.6%,  with 60% of Moroccan women (or 8 million) remaining unmarried. The study emphasized that Moroccan women are increasingly inclined to marry in their late twenties or early thirties.

Rabat – Morocco and the European Union have signed the administrative arrangements for the implementation of a science and technology cooperation agreement.  The administrative document sets out the conditions for Morocco’s collaboration in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). Moroccan ambassador to the European Union Ahmed Rahhou signed the agreement on Monday, November 4, in Brussels along with the director of International Cooperation at the Research and Innovation General Directorate of the European Commission, Maria Cristina Russo. Morocco is now among the 19 countries around the Mediterranean region to form the Partnership for research and innovation initiative. The EU’s PRIMA is the largest research and innovation program in the Mediterranean region.  One of the program’s objectives is to strengthen cooperation in the field of research and innovation in Mediterranean countries to develop innovative solutions for the challenges of sustainable food production and water security in the Mediterranean region. The initiative is based on three pillars, including sustainable management of water in arid and semi-arid Mediterranean regions,” a sustainable agricultural system facing Mediterranean environmental constraints,” and “a Mediterranean food chain for regional and local development.” In October 2018, the European Parliament adopted the scientific and technological cooperation agreement between Morocco and the European Union. Morocco and the EU signed PRIMA in April 2018 at the headquarters of the Council of the European Union. Within the agreement, Moroccan researchers will participate in projects with European and Mediterranean research institutions.  The agreement is a long-term project spanning 10 years (2018-2028).

Rabat – Thousands of Iranians gathered outside the old American embassy in Tehran on Monday, November 4, to mark 40 years since Iranian students fought their way into the building and took diplomats hostage. Protestors expressed anti-American sentiments and carried effigies of President Donald Trump. Some protesters raised banners with phrases like “Death to America,” according to AFP journalists at the scene. Other demonstrators burned American flags, Euronews reported. Iranian state media claimed the Tehran demonstration was only one of a thousand rallies across the country on Monday. The Mehr News Agency said “millions of people” came to the protests. Outside the old embassy, General Abdolrahim Mousavi called the US a “lethal scorpion” as he addressed the rally. “We are ready to crush this scorpion and [it] will also pay the price.”  Mousavi encouraged the protestors that their only option is “to maintain the revolutionary spirit through prudence and obeying the leader.”  The former embassy is now a museum. On Saturday, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard revealed new murals dishonoring the US on the compound’s walls. The murals included a depiction of the Statue of Liberty falling apart. In one mural, the bald eagle in a reimagined Great Seal of the United States clutched needles and bullets instead of an olive branch and arrows, and a star of David replaces the traditional ring of stars. One image depicted an emblem of the US sinking into a pool of blood, while an American drone being shot down appears on another wall. Iran brought down an American drone on June 20 in the latest spike in tension between the two countries. The Iranian siege of the embassy came after the US allowed the Iranian shah, in self-imposed exile, to receive medical treatment in New York. For years, the US had supported Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who ruled with an iron fist. The countries broke diplomatic ties in 1980 during the hostage crisis. Iran released the last of the 62 American hostages in early 1981 after 444 days of captivity. However, the episode remains a tense issue. In 2018, President Trump pulled the US out of the Iran Nuclear Deal and reimposed heavy economic sanctions on Iran. Morocco also broke diplomatic ties with Iran in May 2018, saying the Iranian-backed Hezbollah network was supplying Polisario with weapons.

Rabat –  French lawyer and author Hubert Seillan is taking the case of disappeared Polisario member Ahmed El Khalil to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva. Algerian intelligence services and the Polisario Front kidnapped El Khalil, a leading Polisario member, in 2009 two months after Polisario appointed him to monitor human rights in Tindouf camps. Seillan, a lawyer at the Parts Court of Appeal, brought the case to light at the UN 4th Committee in October. El Khalil’s family asked the French lawyer to take on the case, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. “Ahmed El Khalil was denouncing the systems when he was arrested. Since then, he was never seen again,” Seillan said. The lawyer explained that he met El Khalil’s family during one of his trips to Smara. “It was in Smara and one of his brothers and then a second one came and asked me to help them see things clearly and defend Ahmed El Khalil’s interests,” he said. He added that he also met one of the missing Polisario member’s sons. “Today, the whole family confirmed this mission to me,” he said. El Khalil was born in Tan-Tan in southern Morocco. He decided to join Polisario in 1977. Seillan emphasized his determination to get to the bottom of El Khalil’s case. For several months, El Khalil’s relatives have been protesting his forced disappearance in Tindouf, calling on the leader of the Polisario front to disclose information on his continued disappearance. The lawyer said that he started the procedure by sending a complaint to the prosecutor in Algiers. As yet he has received no response. “I am currently considering filing a complaint with the International Criminal Court and the UN HR Committee in Geneva,” he said,  He added that he will give the case “all necessary attention.” The lawyer recently published “Moroccan Sahara: Space and Time,” a book that narrates the history of Western Sahara and its inherent Moroccanness.

Rabat – Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report on November 4  condemning the continued oppression of activists, clerics, and women in Saudi Arabia. The report provided a timeline for the mass arrests Saudi Arabia has conducted since 2017. HRW found that Saudi Arabia arrested approximately 70 people in September 2017, including Salman al Awda, a cleric currently on trial for his alleged membership of the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as another Saudi national named Essam al Zamil. Saudi Arabia also arrested in the same year, Hassan Farhan al Maliki, a religious thinker who is on trial for his religious ideas. HRW said Saudi Arabia detained 8 more people in 2017. The NGO also cited the arrests of several businessmen and former ministers, including Prince al-Waleed bin Talal in November 2017 The businessman was among the 40 elites arrested on corruption charges and detained in the Ritz Carlton of Saudi Arabia in November 2017. Later in 2018, Saudi Arabia arrested 16 women’s rights advocates, including Aziza Yousef, Eman al-Nafjan, and Loujain alHathloul. The report said that the HRW obtained evidence that security services in Saudi Arabia tortured four female activists. “The torture included electric shocks, whippings, waterboarding, and sexual harassment.” HRW, citing a report from the New York Times, added that Saudi Arabia used “physical abuse to coerce so-called corruption detainees” in the Ritz Carlton. The report stated that at least 17 people required hospitalization for abuse in detention. HRW named Maj. Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, an aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, who later died in detention.  HRW condemned the continued mass arrests in Saudi Arabia despite allegations linking the murder of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi to the state. “Around April 4, 2019, despite continuing international criticism stemming from the Khashoggi murder, Saudi Arabia carried out a new round of arrests, this time targeting 13 writers and activists, the HRW wrote. In response, the HRW wrote a set of recommendations for Saudi Arabia, calling for the immediate release of all prisoners. “Immediately release all prisoners held solely for their peaceful practice of their rights to free expression and association, including prisoners convicted of alleged crimes, prisoners currently on trial, and prisoners held arbitrarily,” the report said. HRW also asked Saudi Arabia to publicize information about the ongoing trial of the 11 suspects allegedly involved in the murder of Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.

Rabat – Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) are in decline in Morocco, according to the latest statistics from the Moroccan Exchange Office. The flow of FDIs in Morocco reached MAD 13.35 billion by the end of September 2019, compared to MAD 19.62 billion at the same time of 2018, recording a 32% decline. The reasons behind this decline are a 19% decrease in FDIs receipts, along with a 7.8% rise in FDIs expenses, according to the exchange office. In the first nine months of 2019, the net flow of Moroccan direct investments abroad (IDME) almost tripled from MAD 2.96 billion at the end of September 2018 to MAD 6.57 billion at the end of September 2019. Remittances made by Moroccans living abroad (MRE) remained stable. At the end of September 2019, remittances amounted to MAD 49.80 billion against MAD 50.02 billion in the previous year. Travel receipts amounted to MAD 59.79 billion at the end of September 2019, compared to MAD 56.23 billion in the same period of the previous year. Travel expenses, on the other hand, recorded an increase of 7.9% at MAD 15.65 billion. The balance of travel receipts and expenses recorded an increase of 5.8% for the first nine months of 2019. Despite the decrease in the flow of FDIs in Morocco, the country still attracts the fifth-most FDIs in Africa, according to a report from the US State Department. Morocco’s political stability, its infrastructure, and its strategic location all contribute to Morocco’s status as a popular investment hub. Morocco also attracts investors through its macro-economic policies, trade liberalization, investment incentives, and structural reforms, according to the report. In the 2020 World Bank’s Doing Business report, Morocco ranked 53rd out of 190 countries. The report ranks the best places to do business through five criteria; the difficulty of opening a business, getting a location, accessing finance, dealing with day-to-day operations, and operating in a secure business environment. Morocco aims to be among the top 50 countries worldwide in the rankings by 2021.

Rabat – In the western city of Oran in Algeria, judges attending a courtroom swearing-in faced off with riot police on Sunday, November 3. The judges, as members of the National Union of Magistrates (SNM) began striking on Sunday, October 27, calling for the independence of the judiciary. Their action followed a judicial shuffle by the Ministry of Justice that affected nearly half of Algeria’s 6,000 magistrates. The Oran courtroom was the location of the swearing-in of new pro-government judges. SNM protested the occasion, complaining that the executive has too much control over the Algerian judiciary. When the judges caused a disturbance, fully-suited riot police arrived and clashed with the protestors. Algerian journalist Khaled Drareni shared a video on Twitter of the chaotic scene that followed in a courtroom full of shouting and screaming.   من محكمة وهران اليوم، قوات مقاومة الشغب التابعة للدرك تقوم بتعنيف و طرد قضاة
Tribunal d’Oran aujourd’hui, forces anti émeutes de la gendarmerie face aux magistrats #وهران #الجزائر#Oran #Algerie pic.twitter.com/PzaFMdPcQh — Khaled Drareni (@khaleddrareni) November 3, 2019  After the clashes, SNM said the police response was “a serious attack on the sovereignty of the judiciary,” according to the Algerie 1 news website. According to SNM, 96% of Algeria’s judges and prosecutors are standing down in the strike. They will continue to strike until their demands are met. Algeria’s judiciary is set to observe and supervise the December 12 presidential election in the country. However, judges protested in April against the election, then set for July, saying they would boycott it. Algeria’s long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned in April following protests that began in February. Protestors have called for major reforms to the Algerian political system before participating in an election. They want all leaders from the “Bouteflika Era” to resign before going to the polls.

Rabat – A house in Tangier’s medina (old city) collapsed this morning, killing one person. Rubble from the building’s collapse crushed a man, believed to be the father of the family living in the building. The accident also injured one woman. The collapse reportedly occurred at 1:30 (local time) on the morning of Monday, November 4, on Ahardane street. The accident happened as a result of the dilapidated condition of the house. The recent rain had also weakened the structure of the building. Civil protection services are working to remove the rubble and a search operation is in progress to rescue other residents who may be trapped under the rubble.  Houses in Tangier’s old medina are vulnerable to collapse due to dilapidated conditions.

Rabat – Gilles de Kerchove, the counter-terrorism coordinator for the European Union (EU), has described the EU-Morocco counterterrorism cooperation as “frozen.” Kerchove made his statement at a recent conference held in Brussels to discuss ISIS threats in Europe, according to the Maghreb Intelligence. “For more than four years, we no longer have any cooperation with Morocco in the field of information exchange, nor in the fight against terrorism, since relations were almost frozen because of the European Court’s judgments on the fisheries and agricultural agreements that had been contested by the Polisario,” the top EU official said,  Kerchove referred to the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) ruling in February 2018. On February 27, the ECJ announced that the EU fisheries agreement with Morocco is valid “as long as it does not include the Western Sahara” territory. Morocco strongly condemned the ruling, with legal experts calling on the court not to exceed its legal mandate by meddling in politics. Morocco reiterated that no agreement could be reached unless the Moroccan region of Western Sahara were also included. The EU subsequently renewed its agreement with Morocco, taking Morocco’s position into account. Kerchove described the European court’s “interruption” to counterterrorism cooperation, emphasizing the strength of Morocco as a leader in the field. He said that several countries benefit from Morocco’s expertise in the field, including the US, Spain, France, and Belgium. Morocco’s security services have an excellent reputation for strategy in the fight against terrorism, radicalization, and extremism. Among the reports and statements underling Morocco’s expertise in anti-terror strategy is the 2019 report from the US State Department. In its 2019 Country Report on Terrorism for Morocco, the department said that Morocco’s counterterrorism efforts have effectively mitigated risks of terrorism over the past three years. In 2017, Kerchove emphasized Morocco’s role in the global fight against terrorism, recalling that Morocco managed to “develop a very early detection system of radicalization signs.” “We have a lot to learn from Morocco in this area,” he added. Despite “frozen” cooperation in the field, Morocco and EU maintain cooperation in other fields, including migratory issues.  The EU has long extolled Morocco’s strategy against undocumented migration.

Rabat – Everyone knows that Christopher Columbus and his crew were the first to sail across the Atlantic ocean to the Americas in 1492. What if I told you this was not true? Captain Philip Beale, a retired British Navy officer, and the crew of the Phoenicia set sail from Essaouira port, Morocco, on November 2 to prove exactly that.  Built in 2008, the Phoenicia is an exact replica of a wrecked Phoenician ship found in Marseille. The Phoenicians, an ancient civilization born in the region we now know as Syria nearly 3,000 years ago, were legendary sailors. Rumored to have circumnavigated Africa before the Romans had even imagined Egypt, the Phoenicians held trading posts across Africa.  According to London’s “The Phoenicians: The Greatest Sailors Exhibition,” as early as “600 BC a fleet of Phoenician ships was said to have embarked on an epic journey to circumnavigate Africa.” In 2008, the crew of the newly-built Phoenicia set out to prove that the myth was, in fact, history.  After a two year voyage in a copy of a 3,000-year-old ship, the Phoenicia dodged Somalian pirates and extreme weather, sailing into the history books—the epic tale of the Phoenician explorers was no myth. However, not satisfied with one groundbreaking voyage, the crew of the Phoenicia is now on a mission to prove that the Phoenicians sailed to America over 2,000 years before Columbus. Archeologists have found what could be merely “anecdotal” evidence, as Captain Beale put it, suggesting that the Phoenicians reached North America. The latest voyage, Beale told Morocco World News, aims to find a “needle in a haystack,” or “a silver bullet,” proving that the voyage was possible. Having docked in Essaouira for three nights, the ship set sail across the Atlantic Ocean. After a  brief stop in Tenerife, Beale and his crew, unaccompanied by support craft or modern safety vessels, will let the wind take them in the footsteps of the Phoenicians.  While in port at Essaouira, Beale told MWN that the ship has no predestined course. He explained that the Phoenician explorers would have set sail from the African Atlantic coast not knowing their destination. Beale and his crew hope that the Phoenicia will land on the American coastline, proving that the fabled Phoenician explorers’ voyage was possible. The captain explained that the expedition chose Essaouira as a starting point because archeologists are certain the Phoenicians used Essaouira as a trading post. There is evidence that the Phoenicians traded in fish and a purple dye from plants native to Mogador island, as well as iron. Archeologists have also found that the Phoenicians traded iron from a deposit 12 kilometers from Essaouira, copper, and gold from the Atlas Mountains and frankincense from the Sahara.  Beale and his crew believe that Essaouira was the most southern point on Africa’s Atlantic coast where the Phoenicians held outposts, and therefore, the most likely starting point for a voyage to the Americas. While evidence has been found that the Phoenicians reached the Canary Islands, Beale told MWN that Essaouira was much more likely the exit port for the original Phoenician explorers.  In his epic poem “The Odyssey,” the ancient Greek poet Homer described the Phoenician vessels as “miraculous ships.” While he did not call the new Phoenicia a miracle ship, Beale explained that the Phoenicians were incredible innovators, particularly in the field of ship building.  “They were the first to use iron nails. They pioneered the use of mortise and tenon joints. Eight thousand joints were used in building the ship; the hull is incredibly strong,” the ship’s captain explained. The Phoenicia team had exclusive access to a wreck known as the Jules Verne 7, when designing the blueprint of the ship. “Down to the last detail,” Beale said, it is a copy of the Phoenician design.  An ancient civilization from the eastern Mediterranean, the Phoenician empire was a group of small states spread along the coastline in what we now know as Lebanon and Syria. Immortalized in epic poetry and by their own inventions, the Phoenicians, predominantly sailors, and merchants gave the modern world the alphabet and insurance. “There’s a rich, fantastic history here,” Beale said, explaining to MWN why the 3,000-year-old voyage is relevant to Morocco in 2019. “Morocco is a lot more than souqs, pottery, and leather handbags.”  The history of Morocco, Beale went on, is made up of so many layers: Amazigh (Berber) legends, pan-African history, Arab culture, Islam, and the influence of some of the world’s greatest civilizations, including the Romans. The Phoenicians are part of that canon. If the Phoenicia can find that “needle in the haystack” proving that its 3,000-year-old counterpart could have reached the Americas, Morocco is a key part of that story.  Among other sponsors, the UN Clean Sea Campaign is backing the Phoenicia’s Atlantic crossing. Every day one of the ship’s crew members collects two vials of seawater that will be delivered to the UN for testing. The project will analyze levels of pollution across the Atlantic; each sample will give a percentage of microplastics present in the water. Beale and his crew conducted a similar experiment while circumnavigating Africa. The captain told MWN that the levels of pollution in the eastern Mediterranean were “embarrassing.” On some days, Beale recounted, the crew could see masses of plastic floating around the boat. He explained that the levels of plastic refuse could be explained by wind direction and strength or currents, but the facts are that “we’ve treated the oceans like the world’s biggest rubbish bin.” There is evidence of plastic in the ocean’s deepest trenches and it is affecting sea life and the ocean’s ecosystems. Beale told MWN that it is a question of awareness—we must all do our part to address waste disposal. “It’s a question of changing mentalities.”  You can track the Phoenicia’s progress across the Atlantic at https://www.phoeniciansbeforecolumbus.com/

Rabat – Former Dutch professional football player Mario Been believes that Moroccan international player Hakim Ziyech has nothing “more to learn” in the Eredivisie, the highest championship in the Netherlands. Been said that Ziyech should consider more options.  “In the Dutch competition, he doesn’t learn anything anymore and he is so far the best player we have here,” the sports analyst added. Ziyech is a key player at his Dutch football club, Ajax Amsterdam. Despite receiving several important offers from renowned international football clubs, Ziyech chose to extend his contract with Ajax Amsterdam until 2022 in August. In July, the football player said that he had rejected an offer to join Sevilla, saying that the Spanish club is at the same level as Ajax. “I don’t switch Ajax for nothin’,” he told Fox Sports. Last week, former Tottenham Hotspur football star Rafael van der Vaart asked Daniel Levy, the chairman of the club,  to sign Ziyech in the next transfer window. Van der Vaart said that he “sent a message”  to Levy asking him to sign the Atlas Lion. Ziyech has given some spectacular performances with Ajax, making him one of the key targets for several international football clubs, including Arsenal and Bayern Munich. Eredivisie, the highest echelon of professional football in the Netherlands, named Ziyech the best player for the month of August.

Rabat – The Polisario Front continues to commit inhumane acts of humiliation and violations against opposition activists. In an act designed to humiliate, Polisario Front “security services” violated the privacy of one of the detainees by leaking indecent photos of his wife. Pro-Polisario news outlet Sawt al Watan (Voice of the Nation) displayed the leaked photos, showing the wife of Fadel Braika in her bedroom. “Security services” took the images from Braika’s mobile phone, after confiscating the phone during his arrest in June. Braika is one of three activists in prison since June after the Polisario Front arrested them for participating in peaceful protests against Polisario’s violations in Tindouf. The activists have been in prison since June. The Polisario “authorities” have not brought formal charges against them and there has been no legal process. Sawt al Watan deleted the article and the leaked photographs of Braika’s wife. The humiliating article called Braika an “agent” for Morocco, accusing him of treason. The pro-Polisario news outlet published another article, announcing that they had deleted the images following calls from readers condemning the publication. The second article included an apology to Braika’s wife: “We apologize to the lady and her family for sharing the photos. The reason why we shared the photos is the continuous provocation from traitors.” Treason charges are one of the most serious charges that a Polisario member can face.  Sentences against Sahrawis accused of treason range from life imprisonment to death. Braika, along with two other detained Sahrawis, have denied the accusations against them. Former leading Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud condemned the publication of the private images, describing it as a “heinous act.” The Sahrawi called on the Polisario Front to hold the people involved in act responsible in order to preserve the “honor  and privacy of the [Braika’s] entire family and tribe.” Polisario arrested Braika along with Moulay Aba Bouzid, and Mahmoud Zidane in June.   The families of the activists continue to protest the arrests. On October 20, several women protested the continued detention of the three activists. The Polisario Front has not responded to the calls for the release of the three activists.

Rabat – Morocco’s National Rally of Independents (RNI) party has begun a campaign called “100 Days for 100 Cities.” The campaign is a learning expedition to take the temperature of RNI party members in Morocco’s cities and hear their opinions on how to move the party forward. The campaign will reach beyond Morocco’s largest cities. Aziz Akhannouch, the head of the RNI party, launched the 100 Days campaign on Saturday, November 2, in Demnat. The town, located in central Morocco at the foothills of the High Atlas Mountains, is home to a population of 23,000, according to 2004 figures. At the launch, Akhannouch praised the “selflessness” and “sacrifices” of RNI party members in Demnat. He also told the audience, “We are aware that each city has its specific problems.” RNI party members will meet locals in three different cities each week to get a better understanding of each city or town’s priorities. To meet its target, the campaign will continue for longer than a literal interpretation would imply as it is not set to end until July 2020. The party will be asking citizens their ideas for how to improve public services, such as health and education, in the run-up to the 2021 elections in Morocco. RNI is also looking to learn about the investment, economic, and sustainability conditions in each city. Akhannouch called the launch of the campaign “a new milestone” in creating good public policy. Aziz Akhannouch, as the minister of agriculture, is a member of the cabinet of Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani. He has retained his post through multiple government reshuffles. Akhannouch is also one of the wealthiest men in Morocco, owning a majority share in the Akwa Group business conglomerate his father started. Forbes has listed Akhannouch as the 13th wealthiest person in Africa in 2019. The RNI party is one of Morocco’s most influential political parties. In the 2016 elections, RNI won 37 of the 395 seats in Parliament, making it the party with the fourth most seats.

Rabat – Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Maio has announced that his country deported 783 Moroccan undocumented migrants from Italy in 2019. Di Mio disclosed the information after his visit to Morocco, where he met with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita in Rabat on November 1. Following the visit, Di Maio shared his country’s interest in reinforcing diplomatic and business cooperation with Morocco. He described Morocco as a “central” country for Italy. “It has long been consolidating its position as a gateway to Africa,” he said. The Italian official emphasized that his country should take an opportunity to explore new markets in Africa for investment and development. “Italy has a duty to have a constant dialogue with its North African partners. It is through this dialogue that we deal with our national security, but also with our economy,” he added. He recalled that there is much to do to boost cooperation with Morocco. “Today, for example, our market share with Morocco is lower than that of Spain, France, and Germany. It is clear that we must aim to increase it,” the minister added. Di Miao, however, said that Morocco and Italy are bound by a migration agreement that dates to 1998. “We managed to repatriate 783 Moroccans,” he said. Di Maio added that the agreement “still needs to be ratified.” The minister explained that in the 1998 agreement both countries agreed to instill a “strict line” with regard to undocumented immigration. In October, the Italian government announced the signing of a new decree regarding asylum seekers.  It will allow security services to reduce the decision-making period for asylum applications from two years to four months. Di Miao said after the signing of the decree, “I thank (Justice) Minister (Alfonso), Bonafede, Premier (Giuseppe) Conte and (Interior) Minister (Luciana) Lamorgese because this morning we signed a ministerial decree that enables us to bring down the measures to establish if a migrant can stay in Italy from two years to four months.”  Italy listed 13 countries in the repatriation program, including Morocco and Tunisia. The countries on the list are deemed safe for repatriation, meaning that deported migrants’ lives will not be at risk.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump has signed a Presidential Determination to limit the maximum number of refugees that the United States will welcome in 2020 to only 18,000 people. The number is the lowest in the history of the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) since its creation in 1980. Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, announced the president’s decision in a press release, published on November 2. At the core of the Trump Administration’s foreign policy is a commitment to make decisions based on reality, not wishes, and to drive outcomes based on facts. The Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2020 does that. https://t.co/vFNm1kKPze — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) November 2, 2019  The decision is based on “realities” instead of “wishes,” according to Pompeo. USRAP is a consortium of federal agencies and nonprofit organizations working together to identify and admit qualified refugees for resettlement into the US. Every year, thousands of refugees enter the US to build a better life. The number of yearly admissions has ranged from a high of 207,000 in 1980 to 27,110 in 2002. The new admissions limit is lower by almost 10,000 than the 2002 number. The average number of yearly admissions since 1980 is 98,000. The new limit was met with a range reactions after its first announcement in September, especially among Democrat governors who expressed their willingness to keep welcoming refugees in their states despite the reduced number. Resettlement is a lifeline our country provides to the world’s most vulnerable refugees. The Trump admin will soon require states to opt IN to welcoming refugees, their latest attack against immigrant &amp; refugee communities. These are not the values on which our country was built. pic.twitter.com/ImoJoIiJiH — Governor Kate Brown (@OregonGovBrown) October 21, 2019  Oregon’s governor, Kate Brown, announced on October 21 in a video that Oregon is a “sanctuary state” where “refugees are welcome.” “I, as your governor, stand with refugees,” she added. According to the New York Times, USRAP will admit only 5,000 refugees who have been persecuted in their home countries because of their religious beliefs. The program will also limit the number of refugees from Central America to 2000, while the number of admissions for Iraqis who helped the US Army during the Iraq war is set at 4,000. Under former US President Barack Obama’s administration, more than 9,800 Iraqis received asylum in the US on a yearly basis. The number approved by Trump for 2020 is less than half of the previous numbers.

The ONCF launched an investigation to uncover the full circumstances of the fire and its origin. The transport company apologized to its customers for the “inconvenience.” Morocco World News acquired a video documenting the incident. The incident comes weeks after a train connecting Marrakech to Casablanca derailed on October 15. No injuries were recorded. Earlier in January 2019, another ONCF train also came off the tracks in Casablanca, damaging most of its compartments. No passengers were on board, the ONCF said.

Rabat –  Mohammed Ihattaren, a promising Moroccan-Dutch football player, has decided to represent the Netherlands instead of Morocco. The midfielder made his choice today, November 3.  Since the beginning of the year, Morocco’s Football Federation intensified its efforts to secure the football player. Atlas Lions head coach Vahid Halilhodzic also attempted to convince Ihattaren to join the Moroccan national team due to his spectacular professional performances with his Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. The newly appointed head coach also picked the attacking midfielder for his list of pre-selected players for the Atlas Lions’ friendly games in September However, the 17-year old football player believes that it is better for him continue to represent the “Oranje.” “I played for the Netherlands for the under 14s [team] and I won the European Championship  with the Under-17 team with the Oranje. It’s good that I can continue.” Manager of the Netherlands national team Ronald Koeman expressed satisfaction with winning the race over Ihattaren. “Mo is a very young player with strong development potential.” “Keeping  that kind of talent in Dutch football is a good thing,” he added. Koeman, in several interviews, said he will do everything in his power to convince the football player to represent the Netherlands. “Ihattaran cannot play for Morocco in September,” he said when Moroccan coach called upon him to represent Morocco in a friendly game. “In case Ihattaren chooses to play for Morocco, he will have to follow some procedures, including filling in a formal request declaring his intention to join Morocco,” the coach of the Netherlands said. Ihattaren currently plays for Dutch PSV Eindhoven as an attacking midfielder.

Rabat – Despite reports circulating in Moroccan news outlets, UNICEF UK clarified in a tweet that international football star and UNICEF ambassador David Beckham will not be taking part in the gala in honor of the 44th anniversary of the Green March in Laayoune, Morocco. After a journalist on Twitter asked UNICEF UK to verify whether Beckham would be attending the gala, UNICEF UK issued a clarification.  UNICEF UK tweeted on November 1 that “David is not &amp; has never been planning on taking part in the events you refer to in Morocco this month.” The tweet went on to address the rumors.  “We are not sure exactly where this rumour began, but we can confirm it is false news.” Hit Radio, a Moroccan radio station and pop culture news outlet, reported on October 28 that the retired football player would be taking part in the gala match. Other Moroccan news outlets picked up the story.  UNICEF UK denied the claim, responding to a query from pro-Polisario journalist Ben Sanderson.  In Spanish, Sanderson tweeted: “Can UNICEF UK at least clarify that Beckham will not be in the occupied territories as is being falsely reported in Moroccan news outlets, as always they are only propagating.” Sanderson styles himself on Twitter as a professional journalist at News Week Espanol and finishes his profile with the hashtag “SaharaLibre,” meaning free Sahara.  As a branch of the UN, UNICEF holds a neutral position in the Western Sahara conflict—meaning that Beckham, as a UNICEF ambassador, is bound by the same regulations. Morocco’s annual Green March celebration remembers the 1975 movement when 350,000 unarmed Moroccans marched into the Sahara. The march was a protest against the Spanish occupation of Western Sahara under the leadership of King Hassan II. “We have to do one thing, dear people, and that is to undertake a peaceful march from the north, the east, the west to the south. It behooves us to act as one man in order to join the Sahara,” King Hassan II said in his call-to-action on October 16, 1975. Part of the annual celebration is a football match at the Sheikh Mohamed Laghdaf stadium.  While other famous football players are set to attend the Green March celebrations and participate in the gala match, UNICEF has confirmed that Beckham will not be among them.  Moroccan media also reported that the recently retired Brazilian football star Ronaldinho would attend this year’s Green March. While Ronaldinho attended the Green March in 2018, he is not on the confirmed list of players this year.

Rabat – The National Council for the Defense of Human Rights (CNDH), Morocco’s leading authority on human rights-linked issues, has picked its side in the ongoing debate between conservative and progressive Moroccans on whether the country’s penal code needs revamping. In recommendations published in a recent memorandum, the CNDH made the point that a number of legal provisions as contained in the Moroccan penal code are no longer reflective of the profound societal changes the North African kingdom has witnessed. According to the memorandum, some articles need to be either amended or downright dismissed to make the whole penal code more compatible with contemporary Morocco. Among the changes CNDH proposed are, quite predictably, all the articles that deal with “public prudishness” and individual liberties. As the CNDH propositions come on the heels of an surging, hot debate on the criminalization of practices like out of wedlock sex, abortion, and a host of other individual liberties that have to do with “prudishness and public decency,” the proposed texts advocate for the dismissal of articles that criminalize what CNDH, siding with progressive Moroccans, suggested are foundational individual freedoms. Also concerned by the change is the controversial Article 22 of the current penal code. That article criminalizes breaking fast or eating in public during Ramadan. For CNDH, however, that idea does not dovetail with an increasingly diverse, multi-religious Morocco—even though Islam remains by far the predominant religion. Similarly, the CNDH is also calling for amending or discarding of Article 220, which criminalizes religious proselytism and conversion from Islam to another religion. The radical proposals come months after King Mohammed VI appointed a heavily left-leaning CNDH leadership, with the evidently professed aim of making Morocco’s volatile, still-to-mature democracy more consolidated, full-throated. But with a ruling Islamic party and the general perception of Morocco as a predominantly conservative country despite concerted efforts at socio-political reforms more in line with emerging and regionally assertive Morocco, it remains to be seen how society at large will receive these radical CNDH proposals. Most recently, a law on the adoption of French as the primary instruction language in Moroccan schools provoked great ire in conservative circles. Critics of the law said those who support it are “cultural cowards” bent on attacking Morocco’s “identify and pride” as a Muslim country. To adopt French at the expense of Arabic, they said, was akin to “culturally and socially surrendering” to France and French culture.

Rabat – “Moroccan Sahara: Space and Time,” a new book by French author, lawyer and editor Hubert Seilan, recently published by French publishing house “La Croisee des Chemins,” recounts how, historically, geographically, and sociologically, the disputed  territory known as Western Sahara is and has “been Moroccan” for centuries. The book’s central thesis, as is apparent in the title and as the author makes it clear throughout his analyses, is that the disputed “space” is Morocco’s and that the ongoing conflict is a “colonial invention.” According to Seillan, Morocco has “for 1400 years been perceived” in the Sahelo-Saharan regions as “a spiritual and political authority.” He concludes that the cultural and social links between Moroccans in the South, and those in other parts of the country, are so manifest from history and social interactions that “the idea of a distinct Sahrawi identity is absurd.” In an interview this week with Moroccan outlet MAP, the French author reprised his book’s foundational ideas, from the “historical and sociological Moroccanness of the Sahara” to what he says is the “invention” of Algeria’s regional aspirations and Spanish colonization to challenge Morocco’s legitimate claims on the “Saharan space.” In a preemptive defense against critics who will surely be quick to lampoon him as a pro-Moroccan propagandist, or lambast his theses as uncritically pandering to Morocco, Seillan told MAP that he is “neither an ideologue nor a doctrinaire.” Instead, he hammered: “I simply observed what I perceive as a homeland, and there are so many throughout Morocco. That of Western Sahara of course has its own specificities but at the same time it is profoundly Moroccan and has been so for centuries.” On the subject of the Polisario Front, the book said the separatist group is incrementally losing relevance and weight. “Polisario no longer effectively exists. It is divided. People in Tindouf want to go back home but they are being prevented,” he explained. He concluded that he is hopeful about settlement prospects for the region, arguing the separatist front’s ideological support and personnel supplies will eventually dry up.

Dear Ivanka, Hello, Salaam. I read in the news that soon you will be officially visiting Morocco to enhance women’s empowerment programs. Moroccans, one and all, are most grateful to you and to the United States of America. Morocco and America have the longest-unbroken treaty of friendship and cooperation, since 1786. America is a reliable ally and a tremendous friend, of which all Moroccans are proud, to say the least. Back in 1967, in the city of Sefrou, 30 kilometers south of Fez, I became friends with a Peace Corps volunteer by the name of Gaylord Barr from Yakima, Washington. He not only taught me the English language but most importantly to love and respect the “other” in his “otherness.” And I will be grateful to him for my whole life. As you surely know, Morocco is, indeed, two Moroccos: The center, mostly urban and coastal, and the periphery or deep Morocco, mostly mountainous and Amazigh (Berber). Unfortunately, most of the crucial infrastructure is in the center: Hospitals, roads, industries, universities, etc. The periphery is still lacking in most necessities of life. I am not trying to be negative just for the sake of it, but the country is in need of territorial equity and social justice. Women in most societies are the center of life and existence. They give birth, a God-given gift that men do not have; they cement families and allow interaction between their members. However, in traditional societies women are used and abused; women are discriminated against and enslaved, and that is certainly not fair in an era of civil and human rights. All these wrongs have to be eliminated and this can only be done through education: Functional literacy for mature women and full education for young girls. Dear esteemed Ivanka, In rural Morocco, women do everything. They cook, clean the house, raise the children, work in the fields. On top of all that, they are supposed to honor their marital obligations. Alas, our society is still patriarchal, and it treats women almost like furniture to be moved around at will. How can this be changed? The answer is empowerment, empowerment, empowerment … and that is what you have come to our country for. For that we are grateful to you, to the Trump administration, and to your wonderful country, America. I worked on functional literacy and women’s empowerment in Africa and Asia from 1987 to 2013 when I was active within the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and I have witnessed how literacy over the years changed the lives of mature women in the eyes of men and society, at large. Women became learned members of society. They mastered the “Three Rs” of reading, writing and arithmetic, and as such they became financially-independent through basic commercial ventures or cooperative activities. I remember vividly what a woman in the bush in Mali told me, with much pride: “With literacy I became another woman, respected and admired, because I make money and can gratify my family.” The investment in literacy is basic. It requires small centers or existing schools, trained instructors, and adapted curricula. To make the venture feasible, participants must be offered a stipend. A material incentive makes a world of difference. The functional literacy program can last two to three years, for four hours a day and five days a week, according to the established objectives and expected results. In India and Bangladesh, functional literacy is changing tremendously the face of society, and the governments are staunchly behind it. Functional literacy can also be used successfully for teaching basic hygiene, reproductive health principles, and political and civil rights, etc. Another aspect of empowering women is of course encouraging families to send their girls to school. The Moroccan government has been very active in that area by providing grants to families and offering free full-board in boarding schools to rural girls. What is needed is the generalization of this program and the will to provide school transportation to make the initiative a successful venture. In Morocco, there are thousands of jobless young graduates desperate for a first job. These people can be trained for a period of 12 weeks in functional literacy and sent into the remote rural areas to undertake literacy programs. Other young graduates can be trained in coaching educational techniques to help rural young girls and young men do their homewerk and solve their learning difficulties to avoid becoming drop-outs. I think, to make these programs viable, the following actions are badly needed. There are four things the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative should do. First, set up an institution independent from the government to oversee the implementation of the program in the field that can devise urgent solutions in case of problems, and give pre-training and in-service training to the instructors and leaders of the program. Second, conduct constant internal evaluations of the program and a yearly external evaluation. Third, write a progressive curriculum based on successful similar initiatives worldwide. Fourth and finally, the initiative should follow up. The Moroccan Government should do three things: Provide schools or centers, provide accommodation to instructors, and follow up. However, both the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative and the Moroccan Government can cooperate in providing stipends for women, grants to families to school their girls, salaries to instructors and program leaders, and funds for transportation. Dear esteemed Ivanka, The Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative is undoubtedly a great initiative for human development in the sense of gender equality, women’s empowerment, and social justice, and Morocco is a fertile ground for its success. Women represent half of the economic potential of our country and empowering them economically is giving a tremendous boost to the nation’s GDP and providing much-needed recognition to our mothers, wives, and sisters. Forgive me for addressing you directly through the media; I hope I did not breach any protocol etiquette. My only aim is to get to your much-respected person the opinion of a simple Moroccan individual. I am not a government official but only a retired university professor and active political analyst and international education expert. I wish you the best of luck in your highly-interesting Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative worldwide and remain at your entire disposal for any possible expertise I can bring to the program in Morocco. I wish, also, to thank the government of the United States of America for its relentless efforts to help in the development of the Kingdom of Morocco. Thank you a million times. Sincerely yours, Mohamed Chtatou, PhD  The views expressed in this letter are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Morocco World News’ editorial views. © Morocco World News.

Rabat – The intricacies of Morocco’s diplomatic strategy, on a continental and international level, have long been the subject of debate and discussion at the highest levels. The US State Department, the Spanish government, and the General Secretary of the UN are among the cacophony of voices throwing Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy, return to the AU, and growing international reputation onto the limelight.  Morocco’s internal and foreign policies are also a hot topic for discussion in academic circles. On Saturday, October 26, the University of Ibn Zohr in Agadir held a round table under the theme “Morocco’s Diplomacy towards West Africa.”  Reda El Fellah, a research professor at the university and the director of the research team in public law, moderated the round table and introduced the panel of high-level academics, authors, and analysts. Mohamed Ahmed Gain, a research professor at the University of Ibn Tufail and president of the African Institute for Peacebuilding and Conflict transformation, tabled the first topic for discussion. Gain’s intervention focused on “Security Challenges for Morocco in West Africa.” A defining aspect of Morocco’s national security policy is that it incorporates the stability of the region and continental concerns into internal affairs. The country’s security services have long voiced the importance of reinforcing cooperation with neighboring countries to face security challenges in Morocco and beyond. Morocco is particularly aware of security threats in the Sahel region and the potential of the region as a nest for would-be terrorists. Under Gain’s leadership, academics and analysts at the round table looked in-depth at how Morocco’s security services aim to counter terror threats by developing relationships and cooperations with other African nations. The crises now facing the African continent “are complex crises not only at political, social and environmental levels but have impacts across a wide geographical area,” Gain explained. Gain, who is also a professor at the National School of Commerce and Management (ENCG) in Kenitra, identified three specific agendas that threaten security in the region, including terrorism, separatism, and criminal networks. “These agendas increase the level of challenges and the most important results of the expansion of the influence of “non-state” entities,” Gain emphasized. Security experts in Morocco and across the world shared concerns about terror threats in the Sahel. Top security agents, including the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) Abdelhak Khiame, have long described the region as a breeding ground for terrorism and terrorists. Khiame also described the Polisario Front as a terrorist organization. In 2018, Khiame recalled that the BCIJ managed to identify more than a hundred of the Polisario Front members, who are operating in AQIM “along which they have been involved in attacks in northern Mauritania.” Gain also spoke about the significance of Morocco’s return to the African Union in 2017 and its bid to join ECOWAS. He outlined how Morocco’s policy is driven by the long-term goal of strengthening cooperation with Africa and pan-African perspective in terms of internal and foreign policies. The academic went on to emphasize Morocco’s decision to move beyond francophone allies in Africa in order to diversify partnerships with anglophone states across the continent. Dr. Samir Bennis, a Moroccan political analyst based in Washington D.C., contributed to the discussion with a clear outline of the history and strategy behind Morocco’s new pan-African vision. According to Bennis, Morocco’s pan-Africanist approach paved a way for its return to its “home,” as King Mohammed VI described it during his speech during the 28 African Union Summit on January 31, 2017, marking its comeback to the African Union (AU). The first hints of Morocco’s plans to return to the AU came to light in 2013 when King Mohammed VI began to emphasize the importance of making Africa’s development one of Morocco’s priorities, the Moroccan analyst emphasized. Diplomatic overtures in the AU’s direction began, under King Mohammed VI’s leadership, with Morocco’s moves n to reinforce ties with Mali, Guinea, Senegal and other traditional allies on the continent. “During the first 13 years [in power] the King worked to further strengthen Morocco’s relations with traditional allies, such as Senegal, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Mali, as well as Guinea,” explained Bennis. In his speech at the 69th UN General Assembly in September 2014, the King emphasized that the former colonial powers bear the responsibility for the issues and conflicts still prevalent in Africa decades after most African countries gained independence. “Though many years have passed, the colonizers bear historic responsibility for the tough – and at times tragic – circumstances experienced by some countries of the South, particularly in Africa,” said the monarch. The King’s focus on solidarity with Morocco’s African neighbors was a new direction for Moroccan diplomacy. However, the ultimate sign of Morocco’s intention to rejoin the AU came in July 2016 when the King announced Morocco’s intention to rejoin the AU, said Bennis. Then, on November 6, 2016, the King delivered the Green March speech from Dakar, Senegal. This marked an unprecedented move in Morocco’s history that reflected the monarch’s pan-African vision for the Kingdom, he added. The Moroccan monarch then undertook his first-ever official tour of East Africa between October and December 2016. The King made significant trips to Rwanda, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Nigeria. These countries had long advocated for the Polisario’s independence claims. The King’s tour was part of Morocco’s outreach policy, a policy that aimed to diversify the country’s partnerships, the former advisor at the United Nations underlined during the roundtable. The move bore fruit, with countries including Nigeria and Rwanda expressing willingness to establish diplomatic relations with Rabat. Bennis pointed out that Morocco’s return to the AU was not an arbitrary move but a calculated maneuver “based on strategic decisions to achieve economic and political interests in the long term.” Bennis emphasized that, as part of Morocco’s long-term diplomacy aims,  King Mohammed VI increased official visits to Morocco’s African neighbors since he came to power 20 years ago.  The King has made more than 46 visits to more than 25 African countries.  Just months before the King’s African tour in the fall of 2016, the sovereign officially announced Morocco’s return to the AU after 33 years of absence. Bennis explained that Morocco’s relationship with the AU and its member states had been for over three decades. Morocco left the pan-African organization in 1984 after the AU decided to admit the Polisario Front as a “member state,” a move that served as a direct threat to Morocco’s territorial integrity.  Bennis explained how “the vacant seat provided the separatist group with an opportunity to spread its ideology among member states,” with both Algeria and South Africa supporting and backing its attempts. Outlining the Algeria-Pretoria-Abuja axis’ pro-Polisario maneuvers in the Union, Bennis recalled that the African Commission issued reports in 2013 and 2015 condemning “Morocco’s exploitation of natural resources” in Western Sahara.  The report alleged that Morocco was responsible for violations and human rights abuses in the region. The AU report also called for a mechanism to extend the UN peacekeeping mission, MINURSO, mandate to human rights monitoring in the region. Another significant pro-Polisario move was the appointment of Joaquim Alberto Chissano as a personal envoy for the Western Sahara conflict, Bennis added. The move aimed to oppose Morocco’s position and threaten its territorial integrity. Chissanon attempted to hold a briefing at the Security Council in April 2016 about the conflict, a maneuver that Morocco’s diplomacy thwarted. Bennis argued that Morocco’s strategy to open up to countries that have traditionally supported the Polisario has started to bear fruit. He gave the example of Nigeria, a country that before King Mohammed VI’s visit in December 2016 had been a staunch supporter of the Polisario.  “After King Mohammed VI’s visit in December 2016, Nigeria reconsidered its position on Western Sahara. While until 2015, it was present in the statements of Nigerian President before the UN General Assembly, it is no longer among topics that Nigeria mentions during the yearly gathering,” said Bennis.  “For example, in the statement delivered by Nigerian President Mohammed Buhari before the UNGA in September 2015, he did not only call on the UN to enable the Saharawis to exercise their right to self-determination, but he also equated the question of Western Sahara with the Palestinian question.”  Bennis explained, through his analysis and narration of the Kingdom’s ongoing diplomatic voyage, that Morocco’s pan-African vision and long-term strategy in African diplomacy have already seen tangible gains within the AU and in terms of continental cooperation but the long term effects of the country’s policy are yet to be seen. What is undeniable, however, is that Morocco has well and truly filled the “empty seat” at the AU and that the long arm of its diplomacy is ready to curb further moves against its territorial integrity.

Rabat – Constant, even rampant “degagisme” (get out-ism) has dominated in Algeria for the past 37 weeks. Since February, demonstrators have taken to the streets around the North African country, but mostly in the capital Algiers, every Friday to resolutely ask for political regeneration and total rupture from the Bouteflika years. Algerians this week on Friday again took to the streets in Algiers in even greater waves to reiterate their demands for a new political chapter for the country, one that is cleansed of the corruption, patronage, government complacency, and rentierism that prevailed under President Bouteflika and the surviving faces now leading the interim government. This week’s mobilization came in spite of the transition government’s apparent determination to go on with its scheduled elections in December, a move that the population has repeatedly called out as an intricately plot engineered by survivors of the Bouteflika establishment to ensure continuity. As their previous protest Fridays, youth, civil society, and workers’ rights groups were clear they want the last remaining breed of the Bouteflika species to leave before genuine elections can be hold. With this week marking the 65th anniversary of the country’s independence from France, the BBC reported, people went out in larger numbers than they have had so far to demand a “new revolution.” “Protesters do not want an election next month,” the report explained. “They argue that it would not be transparent or fair under the current political system.”

Rabat – Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita and his Italian counterpart, Luigi di Maio, announced the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement between Rabat and Rome on Friday, November 1.  The newly signed multidimensional agreement is in line with the goals of King Mohammed VI to diversify Morocco’s foreign partnerships with the EU and strengthen ties with Italy.  Morocco and Italy are committed to developing bilateral relations, contributing to the progress and prosperity of the two countries.  The text of the strategic partnership sets up mechanisms, defines areas of cooperation, and strengthen bilateral coordination on various issues. A key priority of the partnership is to peacefully settle regional disputes and conflicts while ensuring cooperation between Africa and the Mediterranean. A large part of this concerns the Libyan conflict and other threats emerging from the Middle East. The partnership between Morocco and Italy aims to promote dialogue and cooperation in combatting terrorism, international crime, and irregular migration.   Italy is already one of Morocco’s leading trade partners, but the new agreement will bolster economic, commercial, and financial relations between the two countries. Morocco and Italy predict opportunities for growth in all areas of mutual interest, such as the energy, maritime, and industrial sectors.  With the involvement of other African partners, Morocco and Italy can achieve triangular cooperation in strengthening culture, education, research, and sustainable development. During a press briefing following his talks with Bourita, di Maio praised Morocco as a loyal and credible partner. Di Maio’s signing of the partnership signals Morocco’s credibility on the regional and international scene, the Italian foreign minister said. Morocco is a “partner sought by several Mediterranean countries and elsewhere,” Di Maio said during the press briefing.  The presence of a large Moroccan community in Italy and an increasing number of Italian tourists in Morocco reflects the strong human relations between Morocco and Italy, di Maio added.  Last year, more than 500,000 Italians visited Morocco, making Italy the 4th largest source of international tourists in the Kingdom.    Di Maio noted the many shared cultural and economic interests between Morocco and Italy and called for further development in cooperation on these matters.  At the political level, Morocco and Italy share an interest in crisis resolution and migration management. The Italian foreign minister praised Morocco for its effective migration policies, calling the Kingdom a source of inspiration for the European Union and Mediterranean countries.  Additionally, di Maio congratulated Morocco on its energy policies.  While Morocco and Italy only just became strategic partners, the two countries have been collaborating in the fight against irregular migration, counterterrorism, international drug trafficking, and general security. In August 2018, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini announced that the Italian government will invest at least 1 billion Euros in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in order to restrict the immigration flow to Europe.  Morocco aborted 57,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, according to Moroccan government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi. Italy is a popular destination for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea in hopes of reaching Europe.  Italy, along with Spain and France, is a top destination for international drug trafficking networks based in Morocco. In 2019, Moroccan security forces arrested 420,348 people on charges of drug trafficking from January 1 to September 15. In early September, Abdellatif Hammouchi, head of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate of Territorial Security (DGST) traveled to Italy with Yassine Mansour, head of Morocco’s external intelligence agency (DGED). The two senior officials held high-level security talks with their Italian counterparts.  In late September 2019, Italian news agencies commended Morocco’s counterterrorism policies and the key role of the Kingdom in combatting global terrorism after Morocco was elected for a third term as co-chair of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum.  These praises were perhaps the writing on the wall of the strategic partnership that emerged just over a month later.  Italy is set to benefit greatly from this development in terms of security and migration. For Morocco, the partnership will stimulate economic growth in the Kingdom and promote cooperation with other European countries.

Rabat – The Agadir-Al Massira International Airport is the third busiest in Morocco, having welcomed a total of 1,505,792 passengers between January and September of 2019. According to a report released by Morocco’s National Airport Authority (ONDA), air traffic during this time increased by 4.55% compared to the same period of the previous year. In 2018, the Agadir airport processed 1,440,241 passengers between January 1 and September 30. This year’s 4.55% increase is linked to the rise of tourism in Agadir. Foreign and domestic tourism to Agadir increased by 14% in 2018. A total of 1,117,748 tourists visited the Moroccan port city last year, with domestic tourists accounting for 33% of this figure. The Agadir-Al Massira International Airport receives 7.98% of the total passenger traffic at Moroccan airports. Between January and September of 2019, Moroccan airports welcomed 18,869,118 passengers. This is an 11.98% increase from the 16,849,052 travelers recorded during the same period last year. Agadir-Al Massira airport is the third busiest airport in Morocco, behind the Marrakech-Menara International Airport and Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca. The Marrakech airport received 4,702,320 passengers between January and September, while the Casablanca airport received 7,833,886 passengers during the same period. New air routes, motorways, and hotels serve to bolster Agadir’s growing market for foreign and domestic tourism.

Rabat – The US State Department’s 2018 Country Report on Terrorism for Morocco lauded the Kingdom’s efficient handling of terrorist threats. The report praised the excellent and long-standing counterterrorism cooperation between the US and Morocco.  The US Department of State began issuing the Country Reports on Terrorism in 2017. The yearly reports examine terrorism trends and counterterrorism strategies in a given country from the year prior.  According to the annual reports, Morocco’s counterterrorism efforts effectively mitigated risks of terrorism in 2016, 2017, and 2018.  The three reports each noted that Morocco continues to face terrorist threats, primarily from small, independent violent extremist cells. The majority of these cells are affiliated with, or inspired by, ISIS. Every year, the Country Report on Terrorism praises Morocco’s comprehensive counterterrorism strategy. The 2018 strategy included vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation, and counter-radicalization policies. In December 2018, Morocco recorded its first terrorist attack since 2011 when two Scandinavian tourists were murdered by ISIS-inspired terrorists in the high Atlas Mountains. The report did not comment any further on the incident, but went on to describe Morocco’s unwavering commitment to global counterterrorism initiatives.  Morocco is an active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Morocco is also a member of the GCTF and is currently the co-chair of the GCTF with the Netherlands.  Regionally, Morocco is a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council and an active member of the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP). In June 2018, Morocco hosted a Political Directors Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS with a regional focus on Africa.  In an effort to prevent the financing of terrorist organizations, Morocco is a member of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF). Morocco’s Financial Intelligence Unit is a member of the Egmont Group, an informal network of 164 financial intelligence units.  At the national level, Morocco has proven itself to be well-equipped in handling threats on the ground in 2018. Border security remained a top priority for Moroccan authorities in 2018. Morocco tightened its control over all points of entry to detect and deter individuals attempting to transit illegally, and to interdict illicit traffickers. In January 2018, the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces created the Joint Standing Committee on Special Operations. This committee codified into the military doctrine a single organization responsible for all of the Moroccan military forces responsible for conducting counterterrorism operations.  In May of last year, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the Institute for Specialized Training to strengthen the kingdom’s intelligence and counter-terrorism related operations. Morocco completed a draft law last year to stop the illicit trade and transfer of goods that could be used to create weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or to support the development of a WMD program. Morocco works to combat the roots of violent extremism through education, promoting moderate religious teachings, conducting youth outreach, modernizing systems of prison management, and implementing terrorist rehabilitation programs.  Additionally, USAID’s Community Oriented Policing Activity helped facilitate greater trust and a freer flow of information between police and communities in Morocco.  The 2018 Country Report on Terrorism acknowledged the strides made by Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) in combatting domestic terrorism last year. The report highlighted the dismantling of various ISIS-affiliated terrorist cells that had been planning attacks in Morocco.  Moroccan law enforcement reportedly arrested 71 individuals and effectively dismantled more than 20 terrorist cells in 2018. Moroccan law enforcement used intelligence collection, police work, and collaboration with international partners to conduct successful counterterrorism operations.  Comparatively, in 2017, Moroccan law enforcement arrested 186 individuals and broke up nine cells in relation to terrorism. In 2016, Moroccan security forces dismantled 18 terrorist cells and arrested 161 suspected terrorists. The lower rates of arrest for 2018 indicate Morocco’s success in combatting the main sources of terrorism in the country.  The US Department of State cited Morocco as a major non-NATO ally of the US and praised Morocco’s participation in multilateral regional training exercises.  The Country Report on Terrorism also highlighted Morocco’s strong cooperation with European partners to thwart potential terrorist threats in Europe. For the third year in a row, the US has continued to recognize Morocco as a leader in combatting terrorism in Africa and Europe, as well as on a global scale.

Rabat – Nestled between the ancient medina of Fez and the old Jewish quarter, or mellah, the sprawling Jnan Sbil Park offers a quiet and shady refuge for weary travelers.  Sultan Moulay Abdellah commissioned the gardens in the 18th century. In the 19th century, Moulay Hassan opened Jnan Sbil to the public, making it the oldest and most prestigious public park in Fez.  The city of Fez, Morocco’s spiritual capital, conducted a careful renovation project from 2006 to 2010 in order to restore Jnan Sbil Park to its original splendor.  The city’s Regional Council of Tourism refers to Jnan Sbil Park as the “green lungs” of Fez, and with good reason: the park’s eight hectares boast more than 3,000 different plant species and trees more than a hundred years old.  The Oued Fes and the Oued Jawahir once fueled the park’s hydraulic architecture and water wheels, providing hydropower to nearby workshops of local craftsmen.  Jnan Sbil Park features various botanical gardens such as the Andalusian Garden, the Mexican Garden, and the Bamboo Garden.  At the park’s center, a geometric group of fountains and meticulously groomed rows of flowers present a popular site for concerts and other cultural events.   Following the park’s shallow creek will lead you to a large pond, which features a palm-covered island and a variety of water birds. The medieval walls of the old medina in the distance offer a picturesque backdrop, especially at sunset. Keep in mind that the park’s natural waterways can dry up during the summer months.  Unlike other Fez attractions, Jnan Sbil Park is the opposite of a tourist trap. There is no entry fee and visitors will likely see more locals than tourists.   Families, couples, and groups of friends stroll along cobblestone pathways and scope out the best resting spots. Students from the nearby high school frequent the gardens to unwind during breaks or hang out with friends after class.   With a multitude of shady benches in view of beautifully tiled fountains, the park is a popular spot for picnics during scorching summer afternoons. Travelers and locals alike also enjoy Jnan Sbil Park during Morocco’s rainy season when the foliage is in full bloom, the streams are flowing freely, and the pond is teeming with life.   Jnan Sbil Park is open Tuesday through Sunday from 8 am to 7:30 pm. The park closes for a few hours during Friday midday prayers.  With its canopy of date palms, eucalyptus trees, weeping willows, and stalks of bamboo, Jnan Sbil Park is an ideal spot to recharge after a busy day of getting lost in the old medina of Fez.

Rabat – After working for several years in Paris as a project manager in civil engineering, Kousmate switched gears by dedicating himself to the hand-to-mouth existence of freelance photography. With a one-way ticket to Thailand, a backpack, and the urge for self-discovery, Kousmate spent two years of his life traveling the world before returning to Morocco to dedicate his life to what matters most to him: addressing injustice, one photo at a time.  Originally from Essaouria, Kousmate witnessed how migrants from sub-Saharan Africa flocked to the major Moroccan cities from 2010 and onwards. “I found myself asking: Why do people go through all the trouble of traveling so many miles to cross the Sahara and end up here in Morocco?” Prevailing media coverage revolving around the lives of sub-Saharan migrants fueled Kousmate’s desire to delve into this topic. “The reports we get to read are always the same: NGO’s are collecting clothes and migrants are dying because of the cold. And more importantly, we almost never get to hear their personal stories. Instead, we get to hear of ‘groups of people who are moving from A to B’”. “The angle of shared humanity is completely missing. We are talking about people who are leaving everything they know and care for, and are ready to die en route to their destination. Ask yourself the question, why would they do so? And Would you truly not do the same thing if you were to be standing in their shoes?” The humanitarian photographer emphasized that trust is key to his work; “So, in 2016 I decided to tackle this topic. It wasn’t easy! It took me several months before they trusted me. Many of them come from Mali, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Senegal, in general countries in West-Africa.” “After having spent some time at a migrant camp located around Fez, I was told to go to Mount Gourougou in the north, to get a proper taste of their lives.” Kousmate explained that “Initially, you get to hear a lot of inconsistencies and soft-spoken lies because they do not trust you outright, you have to earn their trust. I did not take any pictures in the beginning in order to do so.”  “I have traveled a lot of back and forth to Mount Gourougou in the last three years and have spent some time living among the migrants as well. It varies how many people live there, it ranges between 400 up to 1000 people.” Painting a picture of the precarious situation in the camps, Kousmate reiterated the plight of the migrants. “Bear in mind, it’s a hostile environment. Every year the military comes to destroy the camps. I actually came very shortly after the yearly raid and the migrants wanted me to capture the situation with my camera. That’s how I got in.” For the Moroccan population, in general, there is not a feeling of sympathy with the migrants. “It is not just the average Moroccan that I feel the need, not so much to convince, but to point to the actual living conditions of these people. I really want to open up the debate and talk much more about this, since many people are simply not aware of the conditions to begin with.” “Do I think it is justified of Moroccans to be angry with the migrants who come here? Of course not! We have Moroccans who are trying to get into Europe on a daily basis. How much different is that?” However, the photographer remarked, there is some variation in the attitudes towards migrants amongst the Moroccan population. “Then again, I have noticed two distinctive sentiments in Moroccan society. On the one hand, there is ingrained racism aimed towards migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. It is not uncommon for Moroccans to say ‘even Moroccans cannot find a job, why then should we bother trying to find one for them?’. On the other hand, I see a lot of support being expressed by Moroccans, by giving them clothes, food and find a place for them to stay.” Having learned a great deal about life as a freelance photographer, Kousmate was ready to tackle a new topic in 2018. Sharing a border with Morocco, he was astonished upon learning that Mauritania as a neighboring country to Morocco is one of the highest countries on the global index of slavery. Even though slavery was officially abolished in 1981, daily life in Mauritania proves the practice is still prevalent. “Around 7% of the four million people who live in Mauritania, still live in slavery.” The shocking statistics were just the tip of the iceberg for Kousmate. “It is a vast country that is poorly connected, so it is hard to tell how many people are exactly still living in slavery. Not unlike the topic of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, I felt the strong moral drive to delve into this topic. How on earth can slavery still be practiced?” the photographer asked himself. Kousmate shared a glimpse of Mauritania’s rich history; “Throughout history, white Moorish inhabitants of Mauritania identified themselves as a distinctive, superior class of people. This group of people make up around 30% of the population and form the elite class who are till this day in power. As time progressed, various tribes settled into the country from Central -and West-Africa, which were classified as inferior and lived as slaves at the mercy and protection of their white, Moorish masters.” “Paradise is under the feet of the masters’, it is a well-known saying in Mauritania that indicates how slavery is still regarded as a way of life. Today you will find how slaves are living a serf-like existence. From the outset, it doesn’t strike you as slavery. Two families living in two tents. But the main family lives in a bigger tent and is being ‘served’ by the family who has to make do with a smaller tent of often poorer quality.” Delving into the simmering legacy of slavery in present-day Mauritania is a dangerous business. After having taken many photos and ready to go back to Morocco, Kousmate was stopped by security forces at the border between Senegal and Mauritania. “I went on a hunger strike for four days to secure my release. It was brutal.” However, before Kousmate was arrested at the border, he anticipated trouble was in the air. “Before I was arrested, I managed to reach out to my agency in Paris who helped me via the French embassy based in Mauritania to secure my release. After four days they agreed to let me go and I finally could go back to Morocco.”  “At first I buried my experiences and denied all the stress I had to cope with. But by meditating daily, I slowly managed to process everything that had happened to me and get back in the field of journalism.” Kousmate’s new project ‘One hundred and one destinies throughout the dreamland’, is funded by National Geographic and will be released soon.

Eishkasheim, Afghanistan – “In Waduj, they don’t want their girls to go to school. The Taliban say that the boys can go to school but not girls. They say that Muslims should not let their girls go to school.” I look at the young woman telling me this and sigh.  Here I am, yet again, being told of how girls cannot go to school.  I am sitting in a tiny English school in the small village of Ishkasheim in Afghanistan and talking to a group of young women. All of them are at the school to study English.  I nod and feel a familiar sense of frustration, but I am not surprised.  The frustration comes from years of travel in various parts of the world where I have heard the same story over and over again, where girls are denied the same rights as boys to go to school, or the same rights to do just about anything. I have heard it throughout the Middle East, in Africa, and in Asia. And I have heard it over and over again.  As a woman, I feel the enormous frustration of this. The unfairness of it, and not just because girls cannot go to school but because of the long reaching effects that this has.  I feel it because of the fact that this will result in these girls not having equal opportunities to gain a good job and to earn a decent income, making them vulnerable to the abuse of men. I am frustrated because of the fact that it sends a message that boys have more value than girls and the fact that such attitudes always lead to violence and sexual harassment.  After having spent 16 years in different parts of the world, I can say for certain that this seems to be a global problem, and Afghanistan is no exception. Consistently recognized as being one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women, Afghanistan has been recognized as a country where violence against women and girls is a serious problem.  So I had come to Afghanistan to try and find out more. To speak to women and men and to find out what they thought about the situation of women’s rights in their country.  I wasn’t able to travel far, only to the small villages of Eishkasheim and Shugnan on the border with Tajikistan due to security threats from the Taliban. The town is quiet, and up until now, I was told, the Taliban had not been able to infiltrate it. I felt a sense of relief from those living in the town. The nearest Taliban stronghold, I was told, was just 30 minutes away.  Despite the precarious security situation, the region was beautiful. Enormous snow-capped mountains surrounded us and big green fields lay at the base of the mountains. Goat herders and donkeys moved through the fields each day and the village was clearly agrarian based. A sparkling blue river marked the border with neighboring Tajikistan. The scenery was spectacular.  Yet there was a very strong sense of conservatism in the village, a sense of hostility, and I did not feel particularly safe.  The village was centered around a small market in the middle of the town. The market was made up of old containers, filled with various wares. All the sellers were male, most of whom had long beards and were dressed in traditional Afghan clothing. The few women that I did see walking through the streets wore long blue burqas. Nothing was visible, not even their eyes which were covered with blue mesh.  According to the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, women and girls in Afghanistan face domestic violence, sexual harassment, and forced marriages. The perpetrators are often family members and a culturally-sanctioned social system where shame is used against women who try to escape abusive situations, so most women are not able to escape.  Patriarchal cultural norms and customs, as well as the extreme interpretations of Islam, have been used to justify the subjugation of women. This has led to the perpetuation of cycles of violence against Afghan women. The situation for women and girls was particularly bad during the Taliban era. Violence against women was officially sanctioned and women were banned from going to school, working, from leaving home without a male family member and from choosing their own clothing.  So as I sat with these young women in their classroom, in this small rural village, I wondered about how they saw the situation for women in their country. “What do you think are the biggest problems for women in Afghanistan?” I asked them.  They were all silent for a moment, which I found particularly meaningful. A lack of willingness to speak up about your problems, I have discovered in my travels around the world, typically means you fear retaliation for doing so.  However, one of the girls eventually spoke up. Beginning with a praise to God, she said that one of the biggest problems for women and girls in Afghanistan was not being allowed access to education.   “There are still some people who say that women should stay in the house and should not work,” explained one of the young women. “They say that men can work in an office but a woman cannot. They say that this is because of Islam and because of this, a woman should cover her face.” Throughout the country, there are women who have not been allowed to go to school, simply because they are girls. In the areas that are still dominated by the Taliban, girls are completely banned from going to school.  All of the girls in the room nodded their heads, seemingly in agreement that this was one of the very serious problems facing women and girls in Afghanistan.  “Who agrees that this is right, that girls shouldn’t be able to go to school?” I asked them.  The all shook their heads. Girls should be able to go to school.  Though according to the girls, the lack of education wasn’t the only problem for women and girls in the country.  Women’s movement and dress is strictly controlled in the country. In Eishkasheim, all of the women were completely covered in the blue burqa. In Shugnan, the rules were slightly more relaxed, and as it was explained to me, women were not expected to wear the burqa, were free to move around and go to school, in contrast to the situation for many women and girls in other parts of the country.   In areas held by the Taliban, women are expected to wear the full burqa and can face death for not adhering to these rules.    At the school, all of the women in the room agreed that they didn’t like the strict rules and did not want to wear a burqa, yet almost all of the women in the room were wearing one.  “Why are you wearing the burqa if you don’t want to?” I asked.  “Because my husband wants me to wear it,” replied one woman.  Sexual harassment and violence is another serious issue in Afghanistan.  One of the women in the market explained, “It mostly happened when we walk in the market, but we have to stay silent when it happens. It’s a problem for women to walk alone.” In the nearby village of Shugnan, a female teacher at one of the local English schools agreed to sit down with me and talk about how she saw the situation of women and girls in her country. The situation, she said, was very difficult.  “There are many difficulties for women in Afghanistan. Many can’t study. It’s really hard for women in Afghanistan. Men are allowed to do everything, but women are not.” “I think that it’s related to Islam,” she said. “What the mullahs say is always related to Islam. So for example, they say that it is forbidden for women to go out and study. They say that women can’t wear short clothes. They say that this is what Islam says, but it doesn’t say this.” Some efforts have been made to improve the situation for women and girls in Afghanistan.  On March 4, a revised penal code was adopted by presidential decree. It incorporated all the provisions of the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) law while strengthening the definition of rape. However, a number of conservative members of Parliament opposed the EVAW law. As a result, President Ghani ordered the Ministry of Justice to remove the EVAW chapter from the new penal code.  The Afghan government promised to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325, calling for women’s equal participation in issues surrounding peace and security, but has been delayed.  For now, the situation for women and girls in Afghanistan remains precarious. Until considerable efforts are made to shift attitudes that severely limit women’s freedom, girls’ rights to go to school, and men’s rights to abuse women, then Afghanistan will remain one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a woman.  “Afghanistan is not a good place for women,” said the female teacher in Shugnan.

Rabat – A survey published by the BBC in June reported that 6% of the Lebanese population find homosexuality acceptable. This rank falls on one extreme side of the scale, opposite an Algerian acceptance rate of 26%.  The difference may come as a surprising statistic since Lebanon is known as one of the Arab world’s most progressive countries for its LGBT community.  Georges Azzi of the Arab Foundation for Freedoms and Equality commented on Lebanon’s relative openness to the LGBT community within the Arab world: “What has helped make the difference is a culturally diverse society, a mostly independent media and the relative ease of registering nongovernmental organizations.” Article 534 of Lebanon’s criminal code implicitly prohibits homosexuality as homosexual acts are usually classified under “any sexual intercourse contrary to the order of nature.” Punishment can include up to one year in prison. The law, originally enacted by French colonizers, is often cited to prosecute cases against LGBT individuals. However, legal interpretations of “unnatural/indecent acts” are changing. In a landmark move in late March, a military judge declined to prosecute a sodomy case against four military personnel. Lebanese judges have also recently ruled that Article 534 did not apply to some cases regarding consensual same-sex acts and/or acts involving transgender individuals.  In a groundbreaking 2018 case, one district court dismissed charges under Article 534. “The appeals court judge denounced the law’s discriminatory intrusion in people’s private lives and declared that homosexuality is not ‘unnatural,’” Human Rights Watch reported. The Lebanese legal system is not based on precedents, which allows for more fluid interpretation by individual judges. At the same time, it means that these recent cases will not necessarily result in similar rulings down the line. Even given such progressive rulings, Helem, Lebanon’s first registered LGBT group, reported a 2018 increase in arrests under Article 534. These new cases are still a big step for Lebanon’s LGBT rights movement. However, the community itself continues to face hostilities. One Amnesty International researcher wrote of “social media pages that call for transwomen to be prosecuted and calling on the state to arrest them, torture them and simply remove them from the public view.”  Gay men and transgender women have spoken out on abuse from police and other security officials. Some reported being raped with an iron rod or beaten with electric cables.  Lebanese police are known to perform anal examinations on men to prove or force “confessions” of homosexual acts. The government has spoken out against these examinations but has yet to enforce a blanket ban. Lebanon made headlines as the first Arab country to celebrate pride week. As activists looked forward to the opportunity, the government canceled the groundbreaking celebration’s opening event. Authorities cited a need to protect participants, who faced hostile threats. Subsequent pride week events have continuously faced cancelation.  Security officers also tried to shut down a September 2018 conference on LGBT rights in Beirut. The attempted shutdown came in response to a call from the Muslim Scholars Association. They had asked for the organizers’ arrests and conference cancellation, citing a legal clause on “incitement to immorality.”  The government crackdowns present a debate on response to hostile threats. Authorities say the actions serve “to ensure the protection of the audience as radical religious groups have threatened to attack if the event goes ahead,” according to an Amnesty International publication. However, “instead of holding those making threats accountable, security forces have taken the threat as a given and imposed the ban.”  Targeting the threatened, rather than the aggressors, sends a clear message. In February, Human Rights Watch submitted a complaint to UN rights officials about the crackdowns. The organization claims that government forces violate international rights law and basic freedoms in shutting down such gatherings.  Lebanon is a signatory to the International Bill of Rights, and HRW called on this commitment. “Government disruptions of peaceful human rights activities violate the rights to freedom of assembly and association, expression, and non-discrimination. We are particularly concerned to see such back-tracking in a country that has witnessed progress in the courts toward respecting the rights of LGBT people.” The international community also casts a critical eye on British funding for Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces. The UK government started funding the ISF in 2008 to address national security concerns and to promote human rights. To date, they have contributed almost $11.7 million dollars to the ISF.  British officials helped draft a Lebanese code of conduct to protect human rights in 2012. Since then, reports of ISF rights abuses and torture have continued to abound. In response to the concerns, a British Foreign Office spokesperson explained, “Much of our work with the Lebanese Internal Security Forces is focused on promoting and improving human rights—only by working with them can we bring about the changes we would like to see.”  Some oppose the financing and call on the British to revisit their policy. “The funds should be restricted and conditioned if human rights violations continue,” said George Ghali, programs manager at Lebanese rights organization ALEF. “The UK should use the funding as a pressure tool to influence human rights-friendly policies. Whenever funding has been restricted or conditioned to human rights change, the Lebanese comply.” One LGBT individual spoke to the New York Times about his life in Lebanon: “You live in your own bubble, which is a safe one. I’m surrounded by gay and gay-friendly people and I live in Beirut, the capital.” However, he said that changes outside of the capital. “As soon as you get out of Beirut, the situation changes. In my daily life I’m very comfortable. I’m not scared, but I’m cautious.”  From “liberal” Beirut to rural Lebanon, the country’s growing LGBT movement still faces an uphill battle.

Rabat – Experts investigating substances that police confiscated during a counterterrorism operation on Friday, October 25, have confirmed that the ISIS-linked cell used the chemicals  to manufacture explosives. The Ministry of Interior shared a statement today, emphasizing that the substances seized are chemicals “used in the manufacture of explosives and deadly poisons with dangerous effects on humans and the environment.” Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled the seven-member cell on October 25 in several cities, including Chefchaouen, Casablanca,  Ouazzane, and Dar Bouazza, a coastal town near the city of Casablanca. The BCIJ seized several shotguns and electronic pistols during the arrest. The ministry said that the same tests revealed that the weapons “were in good condition and ready for use.” “The rest of the seized electronic products are components used to produce energy and increase the power of the explosion.” Security services are still investigating the case under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office. Head of Morocco’s BCIJ, Abdelhak Khiame said that the cell intended to return Morocco into  a “bloodbath.” The cell was plotting dangerous terror attempts in sensitive areas, especially in Casablanca. On October 27, the BCIJ detected a site in the region of Ouazzane in northern Morocco where the members of the cell were planning to hide after carrying out terror attacks in several regions of Morocco.

Rabat – The daughter and advisor to US President Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, will spend three days in Morocco from November 6 and 8, to promote female empowerment.  A press release shared with Morocco World News shows a busy agenda for Ivanka Trump in Rabat and Casablanca. During her trip she will meet with female business leaders, senior government officials, and civil society stakeholders. CEO of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Sean Cairncross will accompany Ivanka on her trip to Morocco. Ivanka Trump and MCC CEO will visit Rabat and Casablanca from November 6 to assess the development of the White House’s Women’s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) initiative. US President Donald Trump established the W-GDP initiative in February 2019. The initiative seeks to empower 50 million women in the developing world by 2025. The MCC statement also expressed satisfaction with being a part of the W-GDP initiative “to advance women’s economic empowerment in Morocco through the MCC Compact.” “MCC’s $450 million pact with Morocco commenced in June 2017 and aims to improve land productivity and education, two priorities for the Government of Morocco that pose binding constraints to economic growth,” the press release said. The MCC also recalled Morocco’s reforms to amend laws related to inheritance. The statement said that the “visit comes at a particularly important time as Morocco has recently taken significant steps forward on women’s economic empowerment with the passage of laws reforming collective land rights.” In August, Morocco’s House of Representatives unanimously adopted three bills related to communal agricultural land (sulaliyat). The bills take into account women’s rights as a priority. The adoption of the bills received applause from Ivanka, who wrote a Facebook post on August 19 in support of the bills. “We applaud the Moroccan government for this important step towards the adoption of inheritance law amendments, and look forward to supporting their full implementation,” she said. She also expressed appreciation for the leadership of the Moroccan ambassador to the US, Princess Lalla Joumala, and the work of the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. The MCC said that Ivanka Trump and the MCC CEO worked “closely with the government of Morocco (including calls, letters, and meetings with the Ambassador, Foreign Minister, and the highest levels of government) to push for the adoption and expedient implementation of these reforms.” Boosting US-Morocco cooperation MCC’s statement also sheds light on the strong diplomatic ties between Morocco and the US, stating it will “further the strong partnership between the United States and Morocco which currently spans all aspects of bilateral cooperation from trade, security, democracy, governance, and regional priorities.” Morocco and the US are also linked by the Free Trade Agreement. Rabat and Washington signed the FTA agreement on June 15, 2004. The agreement has been effective since January 1, 2006. The volume of trade between Morocco and the US more than quadrupled during the 2006-2018 period. Trade reached $5.44 billion in 2018, compared to $1.34 billion in 2006. Exports also increased more than fivefold to $1.38 billion in 2018 from just $0.26 billion in 2006. Morocco and the US have also intensified exchanges of visits to develop and reinforce cooperation in several fields, including security and trade.

The 10th installment of the festival in the southern region of Zagora marks a decade of cultural exchange and celebration of Saharan heritage.  The festival will explore the life and legacy of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, a French writer, poet, aristocrat, journalist, and pioneering aviator. He lived from 1900 to 1944 and had a profound connection with Morocco and it’s nomadic people.  Saint-Exupery spent 18 months in Tarfaya, a city in the heart of the Sahara, between 1927 and 1929. His experiences in Morocco inspired his iconic 1943 novella “The Little Prince,” one of the world’s most read books.  The events of the 10th Taragalte Festival will unfold near Bivouac Le Petit Prince, a campground in the last oasis before entering the Sahara Desert. The bivouac is seven kilometers south of the village Mhamid El Ghizlane, across the Oued Draa and close to the Algerian border.   Events at the Taragalte Festival The weekend of the Taragalte Festival will be full of music and adventure. The festival will showcase three exhibits of nomadic culture every day.

Rabat – A new spokesperson for ISIS made an audio recording on Thursday, October 31, to name the terrorist network’s new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi.  Little is known about al-Qurashi. The name is likely not his given name, just as the founder and leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, went by his nomme de guerre. Al-Baghdadi’s real name was Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. ISIS described al-Qurashi as a “religious scholar.” The group’s shura council, which governs ISIS, selected Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi as their new “caliph.”  The name “al-Qurashi” indicates that the new leader claims a lineage from the tribe of the prophet Muhammad. ISIS’s media arm al-Furqan posted the audio clip, which contained a warning for the world. “Do you not realize that the [Islamic] State today is not only on the doorstep of Europe and in the center of Africa, it is staying and expanding from the east to the west.” ISIS already has a presence in Libya, and the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram has also given its allegiance to the caliphate. After the announcement, affiliated terrorist groups pledged their allegiance to al-Qurashi. The audio clip was just seven minutes long and called on fighters to free ISIS prisoners and recruit more jihadis. The spokesperson, Abu Hamza al-Qurayshi, also confirmed the death of al-Baghdadi. “America, do not be happy with the killing of Sheikh al-Baghdadi.”  US special forces raided a property where al-Baghdadi was living in northern Syria, near Idlib, early Sunday morning, October 27. During the raid, al-Baghdadi crawled into a tunnel and detonated a bomb, killing himself and two children.

Rabat – Former senior Polisario officer Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud has commented on the adoption of Resolution 2494. The newly adopted resolution extended the mandate of the UN mission in Western Sahara, MINURSO, for one year. Mustafa Salma, a critic of the Polisario leadership and its violations, said that the Security Council has called for a “realistic, practical, and lasting political solution for the Western Sahara conflict on the basis of consensus.” He argued that the reason for the extension of  MINURSO’s mandate for one year, and the delay in the appointment of a replacement to former Personal Envoy Horst Kohler, is “only because Algeria, the main party [to the conflict] and the first international supporter of the Polisario, is preoccupied with its internal situation.” Algeria is currently witnessing a political crisis with citizens calling for a complete overhaul of the system, with the removal of the ingrained political elite. Mustafa Salma sees the instability in Algeria as an impediment to the North African country’s involvement in talks on the Western Sahara conflict.  Through his analysis, the former Polisario officer argued that the Security Council’s decisions show that the international community considers “Algeria to be the real party in the political process, not the Polisario Front.” Mustafa Salma also emphasized the importance of Kohler’s two roundtables. Kohler convened all parties to the conflict in December 2018 and March 2019. The round tables were the first time all the parties had entered into face to face talks since 2012. Kohler revived the peace process through his roundtables. All of the parties expressed their aspirations, concluding that there is still a glimmer of hope to end the four-decade-long regional dispute. The Security Council expressed satisfaction with Kohler’s mechanism, emphasizing that the incoming emissary should convene the parties into the conflict at a third roundtable. Ahead of his resignation, Kohler vowed to organize a third roundtable to convene the Polisario Front, Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania for consultations ahead of negotiations. “Reaffirming the continuation of the roundtable as a mechanism for discussion and negotiation means that there is no solution to the conflict without the Algerian-Moroccan rapprochement.” Mustafa Salma echoed statements that Morocco has voiced in recent years. For Morocco, the Polisario Front is far from being a legitimate representative for Sahrawis.  The Moroccan government has long called on Algeria to engage as a main party to the conflict since it has been backing, arming, and financing the Polisario Front for the last four decades. Algeria, however, has been distancing itself from its responsibility, styling itself as merely an observer. Sahrawis should make practical demands Mustafa Salma also listed benefits that Algeria can seize through a settlement for the Western Sahara conflict, in addition to achieving the Maghreb Union project. “A true Maghreb union means solving the issue of Sahara within the framework of an Algerian-Moroccan settlement.” He added that the Sahara remains under “Morocco’s sovereignty in the form of autonomy.” What would Algeria benefit from a settlement to the conflict? For Mustafa Salma, “roads linking Algeria  to Africa via Tindouf-Laayoune” would be more economically beneficial for Algeria than the Tindouf-Zouerate road, which “Algeria has not benefited from due to lack of rehabilitation.”  Mustafa Salma also shared a message to his fellow Sahrawis, calling on them to make demands that are possible to meet. “The realism the Security Council called for is a message to Sahrawis to make their demands in compliance to the possible.” For Mustafa Salma, Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps should free themselves from the “illusion of the Polisario Front leadership.” He said that Sahrawis should not continue to be fooled by emotional manipulation and propaganda speeches. He also commented on Polisario’s threatening messages, emphasizing that  Sahrawis will “be the biggest losers,” if a war ever happened.
