Rabat – In a recent Instagram post, American actress Pamela Anderson, known for her role in the 90s show Baywatch, announced her split with French-Moroccan footballer Adil Rami. In the post, Anderson accused Rami of abuse and infidelity. In a lengthy message on his own Instagram account, the football player responded to the allegations. “I wish to tell you that these accusations of violence are completely false and I can’t let them run,” he wrote. According to Rami, the only reason he “kept silent” until now is that he “was shocked” by the allegations and worried he wouldn’t be able to “speak without every word being interpreted.’” “It’s one thing to lie to keep a good relationship with her ex and her children but lying about violence in order to hurt me that’s going too far and it’s unjust,” he claimed. He concluded by denying Anderson’s claims of violence. “Once again, I won’t allow these false accusations on me and my family to remain unanswered. All of this is too bad.”     Salut tout le monde. Bon j’ai pas le choix, je suis désolé. J’ai gardé le silence parce que je suis choqué et c’est super difficile de prendre la parole sans qu’on interprète chaque mot. Mais j’ai trop de choses sur le coeur. Je vais faire simple et super clair et comme je l’ai déjà dit je ne vais pas commenter les détails de notre vie avec Pamela. Je tiens à vous dire que ces accusations de violences sont complètement fausses et je peux pas laisser passer ça. J’hallucine tellement c’est grave. Ceux qui me connaissent savent qui je suis et mes valeurs. Ils savent que c’est impossible et que j’en suis incapable. Si elle voulait me toucher elle a bien choisi. Elle sait que mon engagement pour la cause des violences faites aux femmes est quelque chose de vraiment important pour moi. Je respecte trop les gens de solidarité femmes que j’ai rencontré et ce combat ! C’est vraiment dégueulasse. Après voilà je respecte la décision de l’association , ça m’attriste mais je respecte . Après mentir pour garder une bonne relation avec son ex et ses enfants c’est une chose , mais utiliser des mensonges sur la violence pour me nuire , ça va trop loin et c’est injuste. Encore une fois je ne laisserai pas ces accusations fausses sur moi et ma famille sans réponse. Tout ça est trop grave. Voilà j’ai dit ce que j’avais à dire et avec le coeur. Je laisse les pros s’en occuper maintenant. Pour moi place à l’avenir. Adil 💪🏽🙏💫 A post shared by  Adil Rami (@adilrami) on Jun 29, 2019 at 12:13am PDT Earlier this week, Pamela Anderson accused Rami of leading “a double life,” and claimed she was duped into believing he was a faithful man throughout their relationship, which began in 2017. The couple reportedly split in September 2018 before getting back together in March of this year.   “The last 2 years of my life have been a big lie. I was scammed, led to believe we were in big love. I’m devastated to find out in the last few days that he was living a double life,” the post read. “He used to joke about other players who had girlfriends down the street in apartments close to their wives. He called those men monsters, but this is worse. He lied to all.” “How is it possible to control 2 women’s hearts and minds like this – and I’m sure there were others. He is a monster,” Anderson claimed. The post alludes to rumors that Rami had been cheating on her with his ex, Sidonie Biémont, who he shared two children with.     It’s hard to accept 💔 The last (more than) 2.years of my life have been a big lie. I was scammed, led to believe … we were in « big love »?. I’m devastated to find out in the last few days. That he was living a double life. He used to joke about other players who had girlfriends down the street in apartments close to their wives. He called those men monsters. ? But this is worse. He lied to all. How is it possible to control 2 women’s hearts and minds like this – I’m sure there were others. He is the monster. How could I have helped so many people @ndvhofficial and not be wise enough or able to help myself. A post shared by  The Pamela Anderson Foundation (@pamelaanderson) on Jun 24, 2019 at 11:45pm PDT Anderson also accused the French-Moroccan football player of domestic violence in a series of letters published on her website. “He was very cruel to me at times,” one message read. “He threw me around by my hair in L.A. last summer because I left him to go to a hotel after a photo shoot with friends.” Anderson also claimed that she needed to go to the hospital after Rami allegedly “crushed both my hands,” during another incident. “I needed to go to hospital (6 months after) because I was in so much pain. I couldn’t write [or] open a water bottle. They need to put me to sleep to do injections.”

Rabat – Last night at the OLM Souissi stage, Mawazine finished with a bang with a performance from fresh-faced Colombian star Karol G, followed by one of the icons of reggaeton and one of the most popular singers in the world, Maluma. The show will surely be something the audience will remember forever, with both artists becoming emotional over the astounding number of people who came to see them perform – a record-breaking 200,000. Karol G, an upcoming star who won a Latin Grammy Award last year for Best New Artist, repeatedly expressed that even though the audience might not know the words to her songs, or understand the Spanish lyrics, she could feel their passion and enthusiasm, which touched her deeply. Karol G’s songs are known for telling stories, and she took the time to explain the meaning behind her songs to the audience before performing each one, to help the multilingual crowd understand her as an artist better. In one particularly heartwarming moment, Karol G expressed her amazement at how her dream of becoming a star, which started 12 years ago in her bedroom in Columbia, has lead her here- performing in front of record-breaking numbers in Morocco. Holding a Moroccan flag, with a sincere smile from ear to ear, she told the audience that her story should serve as an example to everyone in the audience that they should follow her dreams. After she left the stage, the excitement for Maluma to come on was palpable. At just 25-years-old, Maluma is already one of the biggest names in reggaeton music, and his influence has clearly spread across the globe. The artist, who is renowned for his good looks and having a large female fan base, had the crowd going wild in a way Mawazine has never seen before, with superfans in tears. At one point, Maluma himself was moved to tears, as he asked the audience to hold up their flashlights so he could take in the sheer scale of the crowd. In between performing his massive hits, such as “Corazon” and “Sale Pa ‘Ca,” he expressed his love for Morocco, where he recently shot the clip for his collaboration with Maitre Gims, “Senorita.” Emotions peaked as he performed his final song of the night while wearing a Moroccan football jersey and wrapped in a Moroccan flag. Visibly overwhelmed with gratitude, he let the hundreds of thousands of people in the audience sing along to his hit “Felices Los 4”, with him. After the show, he took Instagram – where has a whopping 43 million followers – to express his gratitude once more, still wearing a Moroccan jersey. “Performing at Mawazine was a dream come true,” he said. He thanked Moroccans for the “amazing atmosphere.”

Rabat- Nordin Amrabat, the winger whose impressive form has catapulted Morocco in the knockout stage of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), is hoping that the squad can sustain the combative spirit and formidable shape they displayed yesterday. Morocco was superior to Ivory Coast in yet another confrontation between the two. And Nordin Amrabat, the man whose numerous heroics elicited thunderous applause from the 15,000 fans present at the Cairo Stadium, is counting on his teammates to carry on the “good atmosphere” and the “good work.” Amrabat was voted the man of the match, mostly due to the glorious attacking gesture with which he beautifully set up Youssef En-Nesyri for the game’s only goal. Speaking during a post-match press conference, Amrabat emphasized the squad’s quality and ambitions. “We play good together,” Amrabat began as he stressed the importance of team spirit. From his perspective, though, En-Nesyri was the player who stood out and deserved to be named the man of the match. But Amrabat also believes the Leganes striker could have been more clinical. “Unfortunately he [En-Nesyri] didn’t score a second goal; he had a few good chances. But he did a good job.” Inevitably, Amrabat was asked about Abderrazak Hamdallah, his club teammate and compatriot who dramatically exited the national team just a week before CAN. Although the Moroccan footballing authorities officially said that Hamdallah left the team due to an injury in his back and groin, there have been credible suggestions that the Al Nassr striker left because of a feud with attacking midfielder Faycal Fajr as well as a sinking feeling that he was not welcome in the Renard-coached group. Hamdallah’ last-minute decision to walk out of the Moroccan squad heightened doubts about the team’s championship chances at this year’s CAN tournament. Most of the criticism revolved around the fact that Morocco’s team has not been particularly efficient in the attacking department, and letting go of a prolific goal scorer like Hamdallah was to many fans a huge mistake. Others hinted at the seeming lack of harmony in the group, raising concerns about the squad’s team spirit and readiness to stick together in vital moments. But after yesterday’s brilliant performance, Amrabat played down those concerns. “Of course, Razak Hamdallah is also a good player and a good guy. But… he is not here now. So we want to focus on the players who are here. We keep on the good work; we keep on the good atmosphere. Two games 6 points, Alhamdulillah. We want to carry on like this and we will see where it’s gonna end.”

Rabat – President Trump has announced that the US is “totally open” to cooperating with China as well as reconsidering lifting its recently-imposed trade ban on Huawei. Trump made the decision after participating in a G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The move means the Chinese high-tech giant, which the Trump administration has long suspected of being an instrument for realizing Beijing’s great-power aspirations and undermining US interests, can continue trading with American companies. “One of the things I will allow, however, is, a lot of people are surprised we send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make. And I said that that’s okay, that we will keep selling that product,” Trump explained. Is is not totally clear what made the US president reconsider his stance, but suggestions are that the series of meetings with world leaders at the Osaka G20 summit, including a much-anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, played a substantial role in the president’s change of heart. But there was also the fact that the Chinese giant is an exceedingly valuable customer which American high-tech giants cannot afford to lose. Even as he heaped praise on the “incredible job” being done in Silicon Valley, President Trump appeared to concede Huawei’s importance in the global high-tech ecosystem. “So American companies will continue [trading with Huawei] and they were having a problem, the companies were not exactly happy that they couldn’t sell because they had nothing to do with whatever it was potentially happening with respect to Huawei, so I did do that.” The Osaka summit opened on a sour note, with noticeable glimpses of the gulf separating EU leaders, China, Russia, and the US resurfacing in numerous instances. By the last day of the event, however, some deep-seated feelings of enmity appeared to have been attenuated. The summit’s final declaration urged to “keep our markets open” and champion “free, fair, and non-discriminatory” rules for international trade.
China’s Xi Ping, for his part, speaking of the trade war with the US, called for “dialogue and cooperation.” He argued that confrontation was in no one’s favor. President Trump called his encounter with China’s Jinping a “great meeting.” He added, explaining that things had gone unexpectedly well in the pair’s meeting, that US-China trade negotiations were “right back on track.” Trump said, “We will continue to negotiate, and I promise that at least for the time being we won’t be adding additional [tariffs] … We’re going to work with China to see if we can make a deal. China will consult with us and will be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products, and they’re going to start doing that almost immediately.”

Rabat – In collaboration with the Arab Foundation for Freedoms and Equality (AFE), Human Rights Watch released a video, Monday, June 24.  The footage, published on the Human Rights Watch Facebook page, aims to examine and combat the myths and stereotypes faced by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) people in the MENA region. Human Rights Watch and the AFE invited several participants, who all self-define as LGBT, from Arab countries to discuss these controversial subjects. Four of the participants were Moroccan.  Unlike some participants who preferred to remain anonymous for their own safety and to avoid any aggressive reactions of their societies, the young Moroccans, all in their 20s, expressed their opinions openly. In the video, whose idea is to respond to “recurring stereotypes” in the MENA region, these activists shared their own experiences.  They expressed their hope to abolish, with scientific arguments, the myths and prejudices often made by people hostile to those who self-define as LGBT. Through 12 questions based in stereotypes, the group of activists discussed a number of topics such as “LGBT and physical appearance,”  “LGBT and coming out,” “The definition of ‘normal’ sex,” and “Lesbianism and hatred of men.”  The discussion started with the first myth, which is the belief that homosexuality is a disease. Mariyem, in response to this wide-spread idea, said, “you’d hear everybody say homosexuality is a disease, you are sick, you should seek treatment, but then when you educate yourself, you find out it’s completely normal.” When later faced with the myth of “sex between lesbians is not real sex”, Mariyem answered firmly saying, “lesbians have been having sex for a long time whether they recognize it or not.” Youba, responding to how one’s sexuality can be determined solely from their physical appearance, said that “you can not judge a person’s orientation just from their looks.”  He further added, in relation to the issue of ‘coming out’, that “it is not necessary to reveal yourself or come out to everyone because the societies we live in are not all the same.” At the end of the video, the participants, called activists in the footage, were asked what their source of support was. Ayoub revealed that it was his friends, who he says are activists in the LGBT community. In light of the current LGBT situation in Morocco, the activists’ barefaced participation in this program could be considered courageous.  Despite not revealing their full names, the Moroccan participants showed their faces openly in the video. Homosexuality and gender identity, interchangeable concepts in the eyes of law, are considered a criminal act in the country.  Article 489 of the Moroccan Penal Code mentions that homosexuality “is punished by imprisonment from six months to three years and a fine of MAD 200 to MAD 1,000, unless the fact constitutes a more serious offense…” In June 2016, two men were arrested for homosexual acts in a car on the outskirts of Guelmim. In accordance with article 489, both men were sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and a fine of MAD 500.  The Court of Appeal in Agadir confirmed the verdict but reduced the sentence to a month and a half for one of the accused and 3 months for the other, without any explanation for the difference between the sentences. Similar cases are tainting the image which Morocco has been trying to portray to the world. Morocco aims to adopt international human rights laws and implement relevant UN recommendations while clinging to its traditional Sharia-based values and laws. Despite Morocco’s “efforts” to establish a non-discriminating democracy, the Council of Europe, a human rights organization in Europe composed of 47 countries, recently evaluated its partnership for democracy (with the Moroccan Parliament) granted to Morocco in 2011.  The Council consequently called on Morocco to stop criminalizing homosexuality.  The council had granted this partnership to Morocco after the country expressed its commitment to promote democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and all the values ​​advocated by the Council. Between Morocco’s façade and its real internal struggles lies a big gap reinforced by the lack of awareness of issues such as gender, sexuality, and identity, as well as a deeply rooted devotion to tradition.

By Barbara R Deraoui Rabat – If you asked me several years ago, did I expect to be living my life as an expat overseas, the answer would have been no. The idea had never even crossed my mind.  Though as a child, I lived overseas with my parents for two years, so the idea of it was not entirely foreign to me. That said, sometimes life has a way of taking an unexpected turn. In my case, through a series of unexpected circumstances, I ended up becoming one. 

What drew me here was that I had found my high school sweetheart online on after losing touch for more than several decades. 
 After we found each other, we knew we had to see each other again. After visiting him several times we decided to not waste this chance we had been given. We felt that we had to do something. Destiny has a way of doing that. Pushing us towards a path or direction. Sometimes we have to jump at a chance when given to us.  Since I was at a point in my life where I could make a change like this, I packed up my life and moved overseas to be with him. 

Over the last four years, my life has been evolving. Just like any move to a new place, there is a period of adjustment.  After a move, it always takes time to build support systems, learn the way around and be able to communicate effectively.  These support systems help offer stability and comfort along with easing the actual transition to a new location wherever it might be.  I had never lived in this part of the world before so everything was brand new to me. I had to create an entirely new support system to fit where I was.  With some time, exploration and familiarity came the development of personal tastes and preferences. We all have them— whether in food, brands, stores, doctors, hair salons, clothes to name a few. So bit by bit I created them here just as I had before.  In fact, I am still creating them as things change or I find something new. Along with my evolution, I discovered some groups through social media for expats like me. They offer advice and counsel which have been very helpful.  It’s a wonderful place to get recommendations, ask a question or find out about something unknown. They can also save time in trying to find something needed or try to avoid a pitfall. Through these groups, I have also been able to make some friends. In my specific case,  I married into a family which also offers companionship and support. My language skills are still improving which allow me to run errands with few communication issues. But they still need to improve so I am considering a tutor to do just that. I also set up a daily routine and started a new chapter in my life writing poetry and a book. Besides my day-to-day life and activities; the writing adds additional focus and allows me to grow in a new direction. This will be my third career. On a day-to-day basis I am living my life with my husband. We do the things any couple does— no matter where they are, shopping, cooking, cleaning, traveling and spending time together.  Like any life anywhere, some days are easier than others. Some things are different and some are the same or similar. That is all part of this journey and adventure.  The true challenge of expat life is feeling at home in the new environment so that everyday life ceases to cause stress of the unknown and life becomes a source of pleasure. Living in another country offers a true-life adventure of seeing the world through different eyes. It also opens up the mind to new ideas and ways of thinking.  My father always said expand the mind through experience. It increases acceptance and lessens intolerance.  This column will be the first of several columns I will write about my life as an expat in Marrakech and Morocco. The topics will vary depending upon what I observe and experience.

Rabat – Asmae Moussaoui, the wife of jailed journalist Taoufik Bouachrine, has claimed that Morocco arrested and tried her husband at the behest Saudi Arabia.   In recent comments to the Guardian, the 43-year old woman, who is also a Moroccan civil servant, said the main reason for Bouachrine’s arrest was his critical articles on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, colloquially known as MBS.  The most revealing part of Bouachrine’s wife’s statement, however, was that Jamal Khashoggi, the slain Saudi dissident journalist whose murder has been increasingly—and in many regards convincingly—linked to MBS, had told Bouachrine that he was in danger for his criticism of both kingdoms’ political elites.  Khashoggi, Massaoui explained, warned his Moroccan friend that his “life was threatened and he had to be cautious.” MBS ‘furious’ at Bouachrine’s Articles on him Relations between Riyadh and Rabat have known a downward spiral in recent months. Before the ongoing saga of post-Khashoggi’s Saudi-damning reports that appeared to have tainted the Saudi prince’s reputation on the world stage, the two kingdoms were known for enjoying particularly strong relations.  (There were other reasons for the reported rift between the two allies, including lukewarm Saudi support on Western Sahara and disagreements on regional crisis zones like Libya, Yemen, and Palestine.) Suggesting that the Bouachrine affair began at a time when the Rabat-Riyadh relationship was at its normal, Massaoui said that it was MBS who complained about her husband’s coverage of Saudi Arabian politics, especially the journalist’s trenchant criticism of the Crown Prince’s policies.  Bouachrine is the co-founder and editor of the liberal-leaning Moroccan paper Ahkbar Al Yaoum. He made himself a name with his incisive coverage of both Moroccan and regional affairs, mostly criticizing the countries’ political leadership.  He was arrested in February of last year after dozens of female employees—both former and current at the time of his arrest—accused him of sexual misconduct, including “multiple rapes, sexual assault,” and people trafficking.  Last November, after a months-long legal battle punctured by controversies—one of the journalist’s alleged victims complained about her testimony being altered and called the police “gangsters who want to kill the press”—a Casablanca court handed Bouachrine a 12-year prison sentence. During uncharacteristically dramatic hearings, the authorities produced videos of what is thought to be Bouachrine engaging in forced intercourse with a number of his reported victims.  The journalist has energetically denied the accusations and discredited the videos, saying they had been fabricated to serve the interests of people who want to “silence” him.  Several international human rights advocacy groups have criticized the circumstances under which Bouachrine was tried.  Amnesty International, which has been singularly scathing of Morocco’s human rights record, decried what it saw as the political instrumentalization of the country’s justice department.  The Morocco section of the advocacy group’s latest report mentioned cases of “blatantly grossly unfair trials.”  Although less assuredly condemnatory in their subsequent statements on the evolution of the Bouachrine case, both Amnesty and the UN human rights council group have made almost the same case as Bouachrine’s wife who maintains that the journalist may have been framed by powerful circles that felt threatened by his biting criticism.  Massaoui told the Guardian that months before he was arrested, Bouachrine told her that Saudi Arabia had “complained” about him to the Moroccan authorities.  In his confidence to his wife, Bouachrine reportedly emphasized how his reports on Saudi Arabia had made MBS “furious and enraged.”  In response to MBS’ alleged complaint, the Moroccan government is believed to have said that it would deal with Bouachrine on its own terms. “We are going to handle this journalist’s case our way,” was Rabat’s alleged response. In spite of the pockets of suspicion and controversies that have marked Bouachrine’s arrest and trial and are still hovering over the case, Morocco has strenuously defended the independence of its judiciary.  The Moroccan government has particularly denied allegations of a “political trial.” In addition, Rabat said it was surprised by advocacy groups’ resorting to a“neutrality façade” to “interfere” in the country’s internal affairs. Meanwhile, both Mohammed Ziane, Bouachrine’s Moroccan lawyer, and wife Massaoui, have insisted that the arguments and evidence which the Casablanca court used to sentence the journalist were spurious and fabricated.  Ziane said there was “no conclusive evidence… from the legal point of view” to treat his client as he has been so far.  He added, “We contest the authenticity of the video. Taoufik Bouachrine denies categorically [being in them]. These videos do not show, by image or sound, any threat or coercion.”  Morocco and Saudi Arabia have not yet responded to these latest accusations of collusion to “handle” Bouachrine.  Whatever happens next, some Bouachrine supporters, presuming that the case is already sealed from the vantage point of Morocco’s judicial system, are already pinning their hopes on a royal pardon in Bouachrine’s favor.   In March of this year, three senior politicians from the left-leaning Istiqlal (Independence) Party pleaded with King Mohammed VI  to accord his royal clemency to the jailed journalist.  In a letter that steered clear of fueling further controversy (The politicians refrained from taking sides in the contentious debate of whether Bouachrine has been framed), they invoked Bouachrine’s service to the nation with his “high-standard” journalism, pleading with the King to grant him a royal pardon.

Rabat – A survey of more than 25,000 people across ten countries and the Palestinian territories conducted by BBC News Arabic and Arab Barometer research network in 2018-2019, had a lot to reveal about the Arab world’s stance on women’s rights and the LGBT community. According to studies on Human Rights, women in the Arab World have been subject to discrimination and restrictions of their freedoms for years.  Some of these deprivations are a result of religious beliefs, but many have been limitations caused by cultural particularities that are deeply ingrained in the Arab world’s tradition and mentality even nowadays.  Most people across the region supported the right of a woman to become prime minister or president. The exception was Algeria where less than 50% of those questioned agreed that a woman could potentially become head of a state.  In 91% of the places surveyed, the majority agreed that women should be allowed to serve as head of government in a Muslim country, but the same margin also claimed that men are better political figures. The notion of a female political president or prime minister was mostly accepted in Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia. But when it came to domestic life, the majority of respondents – including a majority of women – claimed that husbands should always have the final say on family decisions.  Morocco was the only exception, where fewer than half the population thinks a husband should always be the ultimate decision-maker. Dima Dabbous, Equality Now’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said the contradictory results were “indicative of the dominant mood in the region”. “There is a realization that gender equality is a marker of progress and the ‘right thing’ to say is to support women empowerment. But when the framing of the question focuses on the role of men, then the real patriarchal, male-centric bias comes to the surface,” Dabbous said. “Women in the Middle East and North Africa are getting more educated and participating increasingly in the labor force, but their empowerment will remain incomplete as long as they are still excluded from decision-making positions and political participation,” she added. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender citizens generally have a highly restrictive lifestyle in most parts of the Middle East region, with many members of the community having experienced threats and hostility which has led them to conceal their sexual preferences.  Homosexuality is illegal in ten out of 18 countries that make up the region. The rights and freedoms of LGBT citizens are significantly affected by the cultural traditions and the religious practices of the Arab world which firmly oppose them.  According to the study’s results, acceptance of homosexuality varies but is low or extremely low across the region. Despite having a reputation for being more socially liberal than its neighbors, Lebanon has a 6% acceptance towards homosexuality; the second lowest one after West Bank. For taboo or difficult questions, respondents were asked to select “acceptable practices” from a series of options. The results suggested that “honour” killings were more acceptable than being gay in all the countries where this question was asked, besides Algeria. In Algeria, 26% of respondents said being gay was acceptable, while 27% believed “honor” killings were acceptable; in Morocco, the statistics were 21% and 25%, while in Jordan, the figures were 7% and 21%.  Sudan was the only country where a greater number of respondents found homosexuality more acceptable than “honor” killings (17% vs 14%).  An honor killing is one in which relatives kill a family member, typically a woman, for allegedly bringing dishonor into the family. “Of course, ‘honor’ killings are more acceptable than homosexuality. [They] preserve a social order based on ‘male honor’ and dominant masculinity – which is heterosexual – while homosexuality is a threat to it,” Dabbous said.

Rabat – What began as a one-night call to action to musicians on the campus of The American University of Beirut over a decade ago, morphed into the internationally popular quintet Mashrou Leila.  Although their lyrics are sung in the band’s native Lebanese dialect, the group’s appeal stretches far beyond the Arabic speaking world.  Mashrou Leila defies stereotypes through their music, challenging conceptions of identity and gender through lyrical wordplay.  Ten years on, the band is still on the rise, selling out shows in venues around the world. The band’s satirical lyrics, including themes of religion, politics, and homosexuality have caused controversy more than once.  Mashrou Leila has gained a large LGTBQ following and frontman Hamed Sinno is openly queer. This presents challenges in a region where only about 12% of the population support homosexuality, according to a recent survey. The Jordanian government banned Mashrou Leila in 2016 after the group announced a show in Amman. The government then reversed the ban several times before the concert was ultimately canceled. In 2017, seven Egyptian fans were arrested after they unfurled a rainbow flag in support of LGTBQ rights during a Mashrou Leila concert in Cairo. One of the men arrested was sentenced to six years in prison. On Sunday, June 23, Mashrou Leila played for a packed house at the Mohammed V National Theater during the annual Mawazine Festival in Rabat.  Morocco World News spoke with the band after their show to talk about their new single, Calvary, and what is next on the horizon. Mashrou Leila: Of course, being a band in the Arab world has meant a lot of improvisation, and more risk-taking. A lot of time I look back and wonder how some of the things we did ever worked! Some surprises have been quite negative, like the events that happened in Egypt and Jordan.  ML: This has been something that we’ve been thinking about for a while, especially given the content of the song and message we wanted to convey. And, after 10 years of existing, we are still finding ways to challenge ourselves and try new things. Obviously, we are still committed to writing music in Arabic, but it is a fun path to venture down. ML: Ya, of course some songs are specifically ambiguous, like “Kalaam” for instance. Cavalry was more direct and the core message was not really dealing with the issue of gender conformity or reinforcement. And making an English version is really about keeping the essence and finding rhythmic and melodic sense first, rather than being 100 percent true to the word-for-word translation. ML: The show was great, especially being back in the first venue that we played in Morocco years ago. Mawazine is one of the most diverse festivals in the region, and always has artists that we wish we could watch perform! MWN: Have you seen what they call “tacos” in Morocco? What is going on there?  ML: I had absolutely no idea this existed, looks special but definitely worth a try. ML: Currently we are working on our performance at the MET (Metropolitan Museum of Art) in July with Oliver Beer. Then we are taking some time to work on new material. We have several releases upcoming and we can’t wait to start sharing them!

Every book is assorted carefully on the bookstore’s wooden bookshelves, inspired by the simplistic architecture of the Far East. Chinese handmade teapots and cups used for decoration sporadically interrupt the piles of books on the shelves. A combination of traditional and modern vibrant Chinese paintings depicting nature alongside humans decorate almost every wall of the two-story space. In the center, one sees a swirling staircase leading up to the second floor that is particularly designed for the younger audiences, home to the children’s collections. Wooden tables and comfortable chairs with colorful cushions complete the cozy ambiance of the bookstore, as they invite the customers to sit and enjoy their reading and exchange of ideas. Harmony and symmetry prevail at Les Etoiles, giving off to the customers the impression they have been devoured by an intellectual kingdom that most likely belongs to Asia rather than to North Africa. Sat on the bookstore’s front desk, greeting the customers with a warm smile, is Yassin Qin, a 23-year-old from Beijing, alongside his five colleagues, all employees at Les Etoiles. “Most bookstores in Rabat are just selling books, but we are not just a simple bookstore,” Qin told Morocco World News. “We have created a space with tables and chairs where we want to provide coffee and sweets to the people who come here and read our collections, but also organize meetings, like reading clubs and book signing events.” “Les Etoiles does not only serve the needs of a bookstore, but also of a coffee store and an exhibition center,” he added. After only two months of operation, Les Etoiles has attracted local readers fond of the Chinese culture seeking to experience its merging with the Arabic and French mentalities. Every title in the bookstore is closely related to the Asian culture, while most of them are also translated into Arabic and French, giving locals the opportunity to explore China and its different hues by just flipping pages. “We also have many popular French titles and Arabic titles that might be bestsellers for online retailers or other bookstores to fully cater the local interests,” Qin said. “We always want to enrich the titles in our bookstore, so one can find titles about every broad category and we are always working on adding to our collection to make it more variable.” In reality, Les Etoiles is a branch of a Chinese publishing brand named Lighthouse, which is based in Beijing. Lighthouse decided to open Les Etoiles in Rabat, Morocco to promote expression through cultural discourse. For now, Qin is the only Chinese employee at the bookstore. His bachelor’s degree in Arabic studies and linguistics made him the perfect candidate for this position. “I am a representative of the Beijing brand,” Qin said. “The company in Beijing focuses on translating Chinese into Arabic and French and they decided to set up our bookstore in Morocco because this place can use both languages very well and also the people here are very fond of the Chinese culture.” Opening a place to mimic the Asian aesthetic, as well as to include such a wide range of Chinese titles and their translation to Arabic and French was certainly a challenge, as Qin recalls. “We spent two years preparing—it was a really tough time for everyone because we are foreigners and we needed special authorization by state officials,” Qin said. “The Chinese style is not superficial, it is very deep inside the culture. The industry here doesn’t have the technology to make it; everything was pretty difficult.” Not only the bookstore but also the bookstore’s name itself has a long story to reveal. The name: Les Etoiles; meaning stars in French was inspired by a Chinese belief that the Maghreb region represented the sunset. Through the sunset, the stars come out and they are visible in the sky. “And it’s not just one star—it’s the stars, meaning that everyone coming here can be a star,” Qin said. “Just one star cannot be seen, but when they’re many and in clusters they can be seen. And every book sparks light.” One of Qin’s favorite aspects of the job at Les Etoiles is observing how Rabat customers are always interested in learning more about the Chinese culture. “I think that books are the most important means and people in Rabat are definitely willing to buy them,” Qin said. “As of right now, people are very fond of the books about the Asian culture and the different ways to explain and analyze what is currently going on in China’s politics.” Still, the struggle of attracting readers is real for Les Etoiles as it is for most bookstores situated in Morocco; a nation that has drawn attention over its large percentage of illiterate citizens. According to Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Development (ONDG), the average Moroccan adult gets only 4.7 years of proper education, while the percentage of illiterate citizens nationwide was 32 % of the population in 2015. But Qin’s job at Les Etoiles has helped him realize the importance of books as a means to influence, educate and reach out to people. This is where the Les Etoiles team’s idea of event organizations came from. “Our team of six brainstorms every week about the upcoming events; I am here to manage the store’s daily operations, look after our entries and what to include in the future,” Qin said. Being Asian himself, Qin cherishes his presence at Les Etoiles and the whole idea of cultural merge behind it. “I know the deeper meaning of the Chinese culture and I have studied the Arabic language in depth; I think there are a lot of similarities between the two countries, working here has made me realize it even more,” Qin said. “I have to thank the Beijing company for providing me such an opportunity to work here, to be able to mix different cultures together and use our traditional way to promote our culture and allow the people in the city to learn more about it.” Although Les Etoiles specializes in Chinese collections and topics that mainly focus on the Asian culture, it is still competing against the street markets that sell books at significantly lower prices. Street market bookselling is often preferred by Rabat citizens fuelling an ongoing battle with bookstore retailers. A survey conducted by the Demographic, Economic, Legal and Statistical Studies Bureau indicated that the annual time devoted to reading by a Moroccan citizen does not exceed two minutes; but Les Etoiles customers are encouraged to take their time while deciding about their favorite title and also have a sit to quickly review it. “It’s a different feeling; when people get into our bookstore, they are attracted by our different titles, they are willing to stand here and think about the different topics and find the title that mostly interests them,” Qin said. “When you are walking on the street, it’s a much different experience, it’s very noisy and crowded. You just have to make your decision in one second —and it might not be the right one.” “Every book is warmly chosen by us from thousands and thousands of book collections to cater the needs of our customers,” he added. Qin feels he is working for a purpose now, while he is painstakingly trying to perfect Les Etoiles and the bookstore’s aim to reach an even bigger audience and inspire cultural dialogue, through its unique concept in Rabat’s community. “I did a lot of work for the bookstore in terms of organizing the collections and rearranging the space, the decorations, the paintings, the tables, all step by step, one by one,” Qin said. “When people want to buy books and relax themselves and the first thing that comes in their mind is going to be Les Etoiles that is when our mission will be officially completed.” “I can feel like ascending from the first floor to the 100th floor, so in the future we are going to have more things and provide more and better services to our different customers,” he added. For now, there is one thing Les Etoiles team envisions: for one to be able to order a cup of tea or coffee and spend a very leisurely afternoon peering through hundreds of Asian titles; reading, discussing, and enjoying the place they have lovingly created for the people of Rabat. They all acknowledge that there might be a long way to get there, but it is worth every single bit of the journey.

Rabat – Oasis, an electronic music festival in Marrakech, has announced the full lineup for its fifth edition. The festival, which promises to differentiate itself from its peers with “an atmosphere of relaxation and wellness,” will run from September 13 to 15 at Marrakech’s Fellah Hotel, and has announced 9 big headlining acts. Among them is English artist Four Tete. The DJ made his debut in the late nineties and has since made a name for himself internationally with his intricate electronic soundtracks and remixes. Up next are two Oasis veterans, Ame and Dixon, who will join forces for a back to back performance that is sure to get crowds jumping. Dixon and Ame are known for their spectacular collaborations, as well as finding the iconic electronic music festival Intervisions in Los Angeles. Their style of techno is described as sophisticated and deeply complex. Following their performance is Parisian techno collective Apollonia. The trio consists of Shonky, Dan Ghenacia, and Dyed Soundorom, and is known for their groove-driven house music that always the dancefloor going. Also headlining is Canadian-born Berlin based artist Jayda G. Jayda just released the debut album “Significant Changes,” this March, but is already making waves on the international electronic scene. The album combines vintage drum machine funk and house. Jayda is known for her incredibly high-energy live performances at festivals across the world, making her a must-see act at Oasis. Up next on the list of headliners is Italian-born group Mind Against, who are also Berlin-based. The duo consists of two brothers, Alessandro and Federico Fognini, and combines psychedelic sounds from the 1980s with modern day EDM to make their dance hits. Oasis will also see a headlining performance from Tunisian DJ Loco Dice. The hip hop DJ has well and truly established himself on the scene, having played support slots for major artists such as Usher, Ice Cube, Jamiroquai, and Snoop Dogg. Making the lineup even more multicultural is Swiss artist Sonja Moonear. Sonja originally studied classical music, but swapped her piano for a turntable and has been a rising figure in the Swiss DJ scene ever since. Another American DJ, Seth Troxler, will also headline. Troxler is known for mixing house and techno with indie-rock and ambient psychedelia for a completely unique sound. Just like many of the other headliners, the Detroit native’s career really took off in the mid-2000s when he joined the Berlin electronic scene. Last but not least is the American group Hercules &amp; Love Affair. The group, founded by DJ Andy Butler in 2004, has been a major part in New York’s disco rival, combining the 70s genre with modern day electronic music. The unique mashup has earned them multiple award nominations and hit singles. With such a varied array of top-tier DJs this year, Oasis is the place for any dance music fan to be this summer.

Rabat – Employing at least 40% of the workforce in Morocco, agriculture remains one of the most important industries in the kingdom.  For numerous crops such as olives and almonds, Morocco remains among the world’s leading producers, helping to maintain the country’s international presence and participation in trade. However, on the darker side of agriculture in Morocco lies a massive network dedicated to the production of one substance in particular: cannabis.  Morocco has gained an international reputation for cannabis production, with an entire industry dedicated towards “drug tourism” having recently developed, especially in cities throughout the Rif region, where a majority of the country’s cannabis is grown. The kingdom has also become notorious for its substantial hashish production, which at one point fueled over 70% of European consumption of the substance and continues to be the largest producer of hashish in the world. Meanwhile, this notoriety has been confirmed by a new report released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which confirmed that Morocco remains the world’s largest producer of cannabis, producing over three times more than the next highest contender, the European country Moldova. Additionally, the report revealed that cannabis production in the country continues to grow, with the production of cannabis herbs increasing from 35,653 tons in 2016 to 35,703 tons in 2017.  However, in reality, this number is even higher, as these figures do not include the production of resin and other forms of cannabis. In an attempt to mitigate this growth, Moroccan authorities have continued to place heavy pressure on the illicit drug trade since the government announced in 2018 that it would be placing more focus on combating the drug trade. Last year, Morocco announced the implementation of “a multi-dimensional national strategy to fight illegal drugs and is determined to place civil society in the forefront of this national strategy.” This week on June 23, police seized over 600 kilograms of cannabis resin near Zagora in southern Morocco, arresting two suspects as a result. Earlier this month, on June 12, nearly 13 tons of the substance were seized in Nador, as well. In addition to making strides in combating the trade of cannabis, the government has been working towards countering the distribution of other drugs, such as cocaine and various psychotropic substances. On June 16, police in Agadir seized 100 grams of cocaine and over 31,000 psychotropic tablets, leading to three arrests of individuals involved in the trade of these substances. Mustapha El Khalfi, Morocco’s government spokesperson, announced that more than 107,000 people were prosecuted for drug crimes in 2017, and this number is expected to increase as the implementation of the government’s new strategy becomes fully realized in the coming years.

Rabat – Former National Rifle Association (NRA) president, David  Keene has received payments amounting to six figures from the Algerian government since late last year to lobby against Morocco in the Western Sahara issue and defend Algeria’s interests in Washington, according to his Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) filing, accessed by Morocco World News on Friday June 28, 2019. His most recent FARA filing reveals that Keene has received at least $180,000 to support Algeria’s stance to the Western Sahara conflict and has attended multiple meetings with US government officials, including members of the Congress, the White House and even Supreme Court Chief Justice, John Robert. But the most important member on Keene’s US government agenda is President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor, John Bolton; Keene’s former colleague at the NRA.   Keene’s John Bolton Connection &amp; the Western Sahara Conflict As part of the US administration’s New Africa Strategy, Bolton supported negotiations to end the decades-long conflict between Morocco and Algerian-backed group Polisario Front over the Western Sahara territories. Keene’s close relationship with Bolton sparked his interest in Western Sahara and put him in contact with Algerian and Polisario officials. Polisario is an Algeria-funded group which has been in an ongoing battle against Morocco over Western Sahara since 1976.  Keene and Bolton met in January 2019 shortly after Bolton expressed “frustration that the conflict had not been resolved amid United Nations peace talks,” as stated by the report. In his FARA filing, Keene stated that he worked on “projecting an up-to-date image of Algeria, her government, and her role in regional and world affairs.” In fact, this is not the first time the American lobbyist has cooperated with the Algerian government and worked promoting the country’s interests to the US.  Keene had a similar lobbying activity in favor of Algeria between 2006 and 2007 on behalf of the Carmen Group, a lobbying firm in Washington D.C.  According to Washington Post, Carmen Group helped enhance the US- Algerian relations and extend trade, through government cooperation and “strategic advice.” Carmen Group was also responsible for projecting “an up-to-date image of Algeria and promote congressional, public and media support for Algeria’s legitimate interests and policy goals,” Washington Post reported in 2006. 2018 US-Algerian Contract  Although Algeria has long argued that it is not a party to the Western Sahara conflict, this is the second contract it has signed with a lobbying firm in Washington D.C. to help thwart Morocco’s endeavors to terminate the territorial dispute. According to the contract signed between Keene’s consulting firm and the Algerian government, effective through October 2019, the American lobbyist “shall provide counsel to and conduct lobbying activities” for Algeria to reinforce collaboration between Algeria and the US. Some of the activities include mobilization of “non-governmental organizational, public and media support for Algeria,” and “enhancing Algeria’s image” in the US. Under the 2018 agreement, Keene should regularly have in-person and telephone contact with Algeria’s Ambassador to the US, Madjid Bouguerra. Unlike many other registrants who usually fail to detail the extent of their foreign implication, Keene discloses many contacts with government officials and fully describes his specific role in lobbying on behalf of Algeria on his recent FARA filing.  Keene’s December 15, 2018, meeting with Chief Justice Roberts, which also included Senators Orrin Hatch and Pat Roberts, reportedly aimed to “further the relationships and mutual interests of the U.S. and Algeria,” and was the first appearance of the Chief Justice ever reported in FARA filings by foreign agents.  Other offices Keene contacted in the Senate for the same purposes included Shelley Moore Capito, Cory Gardner, John Cornyn, David Perdue and Senator Roy Blunt with whom he conducted three meetings. Blunt signed a letter in support of Morocco’s Autonomy plan as early as 2007 in his capacity as then House Republican Whip. According to his FARA filing, Keene’s conducted 34 meetings related to the acceleration of the US- Algerian relationships.  Morocco’s lobbyists in the US While Algeria was relying on Keene to promote its interests and solidify its relations with the US, Morocco opted for foreign lobbyist Richard Smotkin. A research report revealed that Rabat “has spent nearly $1.5 million targeting the US last year, according to Foreign Lobby Watch.” One of the latest lobbying activities conducted in the US for Morocco involved the US former vice president, Joe Biden. Since January 2018, JPC Strategies has become Morocco’s principal lobbying partner in the United States. According to FARA, JPC has been paid $75,000 a month to lobby in favor of Morocco. JPC’s aims are to strengthen the US-Morocco relations as a strategic alliance, defend the country’s strategic interests, and promote American investments in Morocco. Though not mentioned in the lobbying contract, the Western Sahara conflict is viewed as the heart of the firm’s advocacy work to support Morocco.  Bolton’s December 2018 speech at an event hosted at the Heritage Foundation in Washington D.C., suggested that he would monitor the Western Sahara issue, leaving his personal imprint on it, urged Morocco to act quickly to prevent Algeria from undermining the political process. It remains uncertain whether Morocco’s lobbying firms have fulfilled their mission, but Morocco’s diplomatic efforts have proved to be successful so far.  Morocco has prevented any development that would negatively impact the nation’s stance on the Western Sahara conflict and has succeeded in sustaining its diplomatic achievements despite Algeria’s constant efforts to swing momentum through Bolton.

Rabat – 1-0 is generally not a particularly impressive result. But Morocco’s Lions display against their most threatening opponent in the group stage was a thunderous testament to what this team can do when playing at its most scintillating. Should Morocco go on to win this year’s Afcon, to finally break the curse of three decades of disheartening continental performances, of embarrassing exits, of lack of clinical instincts at the most defining moments, the Cote d’Ivoire game will go down as their “moment of truth.” Where Morocco had been unconvincingly dominant—and quite lucky—in their first game against Group D’s underdog, they were impressive against Cote d’Ivoire, one of Africa’s most elite-packed teams. The game started with unusual intensity, with Ivorians pressing in the very fist minutes. That premature pressure yielded a spiriting result. A strong Serge cross was met by Jonathan Kodjia who elicited the first save from Yassine Bono, the Moroccan keeper. Those promising first minutes about set the mood for the entire first half as both teams evincing a sense of urgency and purpose. The games’ intensity was particularly felt in the Serge Aurier-Nordin Amrabat duel. Two players who take pride in their exquisite marriage of tender technique and buccaneering physicality, they seemed, from the very outset, conscious that each’s performance would have a consequential bearing on the trajectory of the game, the final outcome. But there was a short moment of energy drop after the exciting first fifteen minutes, with the players now calming the excitement of starters to have—perhaps—a clearer picture of what they were up against here. Sporting rationality suggests it is always a good thing to pause in order to come with more vigor. Morocco’s first scoring opportunity came at the 18th minute. Channeling his usual imperial presence on the left flank, Hakimi sent a beautifully executed cross in the Ivorian half. Youssef En-Nesyri made perfect contact, shooting the ball as accurately as possible from where he stood. The shot flew off target. But it was enough as an indicator of Herve’s lad’s ruthlessness when they resort to quick successions through the flanks.
No sooner had the clock struck 24 minutes that Moroccan came again. Amrabat, whose usual catalogue of heroics have won him a special place in the Moroccan footballing imaginary, was mind-bendingly clinical here. How—and do pardon the sporting parlance’s tendency to exaggerate—does one not delight in the audacity with which Amrabat single-handedly danced his way through the entire Ivorian defense to set En-Nysiri free to grant Moroccan fans the elation they had been expecting as their team appeared imperiously dominant? Amarabat is no stranger to such bursts of heroism. But—and there is a certain banality in stating the obvious—that move right there was beyond his usual standards, the nadir of his regular heroics. At 1-0, the game was mostly a one-man show. Ivory Coast has great individuals players, and they did try to unsettle Renard’s boys, to construct momentum, to discomfit the feeling that, as the game edged towards the vital moments, Morocco was simply the better side. This, of course, is not to refuse Ivorians their due, the credit for delivering what sometimes looked like a good performance. Michel Seri was particularly tantalizing; Aurier, in spite of Amrabat’s stratospheric display, was a reassuring presence for the most part. Max Gradel, when he had the ball, did threaten the Moroccan defense. But it was not enough. It takes more than the performance Aurier and company offered tonight to rise to the challenge of a Moroccan squad featuring all its star players. Anyone who watched Morocco’s pre-World Cup displays felt, as Renard’s boys comfortably dominated this game, an unmistakable sense of deja-vu. Belhanda swaggered; Hakimi was unstoppable; Ziyach was not at his most sinctaliating, but he still managed to be a constant threat. And what of Amrabat? Enough, isn’t it? The second half, to give it its due, had its own thunderclap moments. The Aurier-Amrabat duel continued, for example. However, it was Morocco that largely, unquestionably, led the mood here. A calm and calming presence, Amrabat was greeted with a chorus of fawning approval every time he touched the ball. Apart from his traditional youthful ebullience and Herculean elegance when protecting possession, the darling of Moroccan fans was an indomitable opponent, a soothing team mate. More to the point, on a purely footballing level, the display against Namibia comes nowhere close to what the Atlas Lions delivered this evening. And so, you can now count Morocco among the favorites to lift the trophy. 1-0 does not sound—indeed it is not—a surging victory. Consequently, it would sound like a misguided, grossly self-indulgent suggestion, to maintain that this “Renard generation” has what it takes to be champions. That is to say: besides a few defensive gaffes, there was a certain air of complacency once the Moroccan players reached the Ivorian half. They could have easily won 3, 4-0 had they been more focused in front of goal to take most of their scoring opportunities. Nonetheless, the highly commanding quality of the performance should be enough to shatter doubts and calm nerves. As it happens, now that morale has been boosted, it needs to be sustained.

Rabat – Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan inaugurated on Friday, June 28,  the Tanger Med 2, an extension project that will allow Morocco’s Tangier port to surpass some of the key international ports in terms of container capacity in the Mediterranean. The Crown Prince represented King Mohammed VI during the inauguration ceremony. The port will be operational following nine years of construction work, which started in May 2010. Worth  $1.3 billion, the construction of the project was planned in two phases.  Morocco launched the first phase of the project in 2010. This first phase was to establish the port’s infrastructure and was completed in 2016. While the second was to develop the port’s new docks over 1,600 linear meters The expanded six million container capacity calculated in a twenty-foot equivalent unit to make it home for more container terminals will further extend the port. The port is expected to surpass the Mediterranean’s largest ports of Algeciras and Valencia in terms of container capacity. In just a decade, the northern city of Tangier has positioned itself as the gate of both Europe and Africa thanks to the Tanger Med Port, which was deemed a key industrial zone thanks to Morocco’s geographical position. Located on the Strait of Gibraltar, Tanger med is connected to more than 170 ports in 77 countries across the world, providing a processing capacity of 9 million containers, as well as 7 million passengers, 1 million vehicles, and 700,000 trucks. Tangier is the home of many giant firms, specialized in different fields, including the automotive sector, one of Morocco’s key pillars. Tang Med serves as an industrial hub for more than 750 companies from different sectors, including logistics, trade, and textile. It also represents a business volume of €5,5 million. The firms’ choice to operate their plants in Tangier is no coincidence as they look forward to benefiting from the newly expanded Tangier Med port, which is a key source of trade. Created in 2011, Tanger Automotive City (TAC) serves as a free zone, focusing primarily on attracting international companies involved in manufacturing vehicle Pieces, logistics, and tertiary activities. The automotive city lay in an area of 300 hectares, offering direct access to Tanger med Port in 22 kilometers, as well as Tanger Free Zone. The automotive city provides “truck deliveries to Europe in less than 48 hours,” which makes it an easy choice for international automotive firms. “The TAC site is also linked to the development of Renault Tanger Med (less than 2 kilometers) and situated close to road which connects it to the urban centers of Tangier (14 km) and other cities in the country,” according to TAC. In addition to the automotive sector, aeronautics is a significant player as Morocco’s Ministry of Industry predicts that the sector will have an intrinsic role in Morocco’s economy. The sector is active with more than 120 companies, generating direct annual reviews of more than $1 billion in 2015. With the expansion, Tanger Med aims to promote even faster economic growth in the sector over the next few years. The industry creates more than 11,000 direct job opportunities contributing with “8.5 % to Morocco’s total employment and is forecasted to achieve approximately 33,000 by 2020.” “The Moroccan aeronautics sector of activity starts to take huge steps forward in terms of export intensity and trade diversity, valuing and expanding trade flow with Europe, Asia, and North  &amp; South America,” Tanger Med said on its Investment Memorandum 2018. Tangier Med Port’s forecast was backed by several international reports, which acknowledged the notable performance by both the automotive and aeronautics sectors.  An Oxford report said in March 2019 that Morocco’s plans to promote economic development through investment “has witnessed success, in particular in the automotive and aeronautics sectors.”  The sectors are part of the Industrial Acceleration Plan 2014-2020. The aeronautics sector has human resources of more than 11,000 employees. The extension of the project will certainly give added value, but the port is already attracting local and international key investors with its performance. In 2018, Morocco’s Tangier Med port exported MAD 139 billion work of products, representing 50% of all Moroccan exports. In the same year, the port processed an overall tonnage of 52,240,806 tons, an increase of 2 % compared to 2017. The largest in Africa, the port surpassed South Africa’s Durban port, handling a total volume of imports and exports worth MAD 317 billion in 2018.

Rabat – Last night, June 27, the performance of American hip hop trio Migos at Mawazine’s OLM Souissi stage saw crowds in the thousands. The trio consists of three rappers who have all made a name for themselves in their own right: Takeoff, Offset, and Quavo. The three, who are all related, popularized the dance move of “dabbing” with their 2016 single “Look at My Dab.” By 2017, Migos had solidified their place in the rap game with their hit “Bad and Boujee,” which hit number 1 on the Billboard Charts. They are also known for their high-energy stage performances, which was further evidenced last night. Thanks to the group’s meteoric rise to fame, all the three sections of the concert which have varying price points and exclusivity – black, gold, and free – were packed full of high energy fans.  Migos helped to get the crowd pumped by calling on the crowd to form circle pits, where participants back up into a circle before ramming back into each other as they jump up and down. Some concert-goers felt the performance was too rambunctious, with reports of injuries and fainting. “I saw two people getting carried out of the festival. One of was being manhandled by police, probably due to inappropriate behavior, and the other was a girl being carried out on a stretcher,” one concertgoer, Hugo OJ, told Morocco World News. “She was probably too small and the crowd was rough. It can be hard when you are too small for such a rowdy crowd,” he continued. Another attendee, who was in the gold section of the concert, described the experience as “horrible.” “I was being stepped on and pushed, and couldn’t even enjoy the concert or see the artists. At one point I injured my foot by being crushed by the crowd. Today I have bruises,” the attendee, Selma Lyoubi, said. “People were just going crazy.” Lyoubi recommends that future Mawazine attendees who may be afraid of crowds at the more packed concerts attend the free section instead. “The public section the previous night for Travis Scott’s performance was much better.” “In the public section, you are a little further away but this sometimes means you can actually see the artists better and stay out of rough crowds,” she said. However, not everyone agreed that the crowd was too rowdy. “It was amazing when they performed their hits, ‘Bad and Boujee’ and ‘Stir Fry,’ and the crowd was really pumping,” said concertgoer Hamza Khales.  Mawazine, a festival in Rabat with six venues, is currently in full swing until tomorrow night, June 29. The festival is organized by Maroc Cultures under the patronage of King Mohammed VI. Having drawn over 2.5 million attendees in recent years, Mawazine is the second largest music festival in the world, after Donauinselfest in Vienna, and the largest festival in Africa. The festival attracts international artists as well as highlighting local Moroccan musicians. This year, the festival has seen major international acts perform, such as Marshmello, Black Eyed Peas, Travis Scott and Future. The festival lists the democratization of culture in Morocco as one of its initiatives and provides free access to 90% of its shows each year.

In 2001, Boussoufa moved to England, joining Premier League team Chelsea F.C. In his first year at Chelsea, Boussoufa remained as a substitute, but in the following year became captain of the club’s second team.   At the end of his contract with Chelsea, Boussoufa signed his contract with K.K.A. Gent. While playing for K.K.A. Gent, he won the Ebony Boot, a prize for the best player of African descendant in Belgium. He also won the 2006 Golden Boot Best Player in the Belgian First Division.  The attacking-midfielder stayed with Anderlecht from 2006 to 2011, where he made his professional debut in the Jupiler Pro League and became the Pro League’s most popular players.  While with the Belgian club, the Dutch-Moroccan player won the Soulier d’Or Belge in 2006 and 2010.  In 2013 Boussoufa transferred again to FC Lokomotiv Moscow. During his years at Lokomotiv Moscow, he has made 39 appearances and scored 3 goals.  The Moroccan footballer did not settle into life at the Russian club and was eager to finish his contract and return the Netherlands or Morocco for personal reasons.  In an interview in 2015, he said, “Today, I do not make friends anymore. In fact, I have been very lonely in Russia for the past four years.”  Boussoufa returned to Belgium to play for K.A.A. Gent on loan in 2016. During his time with Ghent, Boussoufa was the match winner for Ghent against Mouscron-Péruwelz.   While on loan with Ghent, he made 11 appearances and scored 2 goals.  In July 2016, Boussoufa officially left Ghent and signed a two-year contract with Al-Jazira, a professional football club based in the United Arab Emirates. In 2019, Boussoufa signed a contract with a Saudi professional football club Al-Shabab, which lasts from 3 January this year to the end of the season. So far, he has made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Al-Shabab.  Qualified to play for both the Dutch and Moroccan national teams, Boussoufa chose to join Morocco’s Atlas Lions.  Talking about his choice to play with the Atlas Lions, Boussafa said in an interview with Jeune Afrique, “It is a country with which I have always been connected, because I went there for the holidays and I followed the matches of the selection. So I accepted, despite the approaches of the Netherlands a little later, and I do not regret it”. In May 2006, he accepted the invitation to join the Moroccan national team in the African Cup of Nations (CAN). In his first official match, he scored a goal, cementing his position with the national squad.  In 2012, Boussoufa represented the Atlas Lions in the CAN. His attacking football skills helped the Atlas Lions to win against Nigeria.   Boussoufa was qualified to play once again for Morocco in CAN 2017 and reached the quarter-finals along with the new generation of footballers. A year later, Boussoufa and the Atlas Lions qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.  An experienced player, fans have speculated that the midfielder may be close to retirement. Boussoufa, however hopes to finish CAN 2019 first. “Of course. I know that the end is near. I hope to play CAN in Egypt. And then, we’ll see, even if one day it will leave room for the youngest. There is a beautiful generation coming in, which is good news for the selection” he explained to Jeune Afrique. Boussoufa is now in Egypt with the Moroccan national squad to participate in CAN 2019. On June 23, 2019, the Atlas Lions started their 2019 CAN Group D campaign with a 1-0 win over Namibia.  “We were the better side and missed many chances,” Boussoufa said.  Boussoufa is hoping for better performance in the match against Ivory Coast on Friday, June 28.

Rabat – Born in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and raised, for much of his life, in France, Youssoupha has developed his own unique style of French rap during his career as a musician. Performing at Mawazine’s Bouregreg stage on Wednesday, June 26, these original Franco-Congolese rhythms and vocals filled the air along the river between Rabat and Salé. While the sixth day of Mawazine saw prolific artists such as Travis Scott and Aya Nakamura attracting a massive audience at the OLM SOUSSI stage, Youssoupha brought the sounds of sub-Saharan Africa to a smaller audience in Rabat. Despite being largely overlooked by the media in favor of popular performers at Mawazine’s International Stage, Youssoupha still gave a powerful and energetic performance, proving why the artist has been so highly decorated and recognized in the past. With three gold records and one platinum record under his belt, Youssoupha has certainly never failed to deliver audience-pleasing music to his fanbase. However, perhaps the artist’s most notable achievement is his title as a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded by the French government for a “significant contribution to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance.” Using music as a means of raising awareness about social problems, Youssoupha’s brand of conscious rap has earned him a loyal fanbase in both Morocco and other parts of the world. Though it may have been smaller than that of Mawazine’s more widely recognized artists, Youssoupha’s fanbase certainly did not lack any energy during his performance, with the audience’s singing feeling almost physically filling the air above the crowd. Moving into the final days of Mawazine, Youssoupha’s performance proved that the Bouregreg Stage could be just as energetic and powerful as the more renowned OLM Soussi stage, setting a high bar for the artists following after.

Rabat – Morocco has requested the purchase of a $250.4 million support package from the United States for sustaining its F-16 aircraft fleet, which will consist of spares, training, and logistics support. The US State Department stated on Thursday, June 27, 2019, that it will approve the potential Foreign Military Sale, with the US Congress being fully notified of the deal by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.  “The proposed sale will improve Morocco’s self-defense capability,” the US department said. “The continuation of sustainment for their F-16 fleet will strengthen the cooperation with the United States and other regional allies.”   Morocco already operates a 45 aircraft F-16 fleet and the country’s call for an aid package could ensure its fleet’s operation in the future. Morocco’s F-16s are deployed at Ben Guerir Air Base, situated north of Marrakech. Since entering service, they have been used to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, as well as Houthi targets in Yemen as part of the Saudi-led coalition.  The potential deal’s principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, an American global aerospace, defense, and security company with worldwide interests. In more detail, the Moroccan government has requested a continuation of sustainability support to its current F-16 fleet, which includes the following non-MDE components:  F-16 support equipment, spares and repair parts, personnel training and training equipment.  On top of this, the package will include publications and technical documentation, munitions support equipment (for AMRAAM, CMBRE, JDAM, PAVEWAY), support and test equipment, and  US government and contractor engineering and logistical support services. In fact, this was not Morocco’s first request to the US concerning its F-16 fleet maintenance. The country had made an additional F-16 preservation request to the US in March 2019, seeking to upgrade its existing fleet. The US State Department then approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Morocco of 25 F-16C/D Block 72 aircrafts and related equipment for an estimated cost of $3.787 billion.

Rabat – The Consul General of France in Rabat, Florence Causse-Tissier, has said that the French consulate in Morocco issued 315,000 Schengen visas in 2018. On June 27 in Rabat, Causse-Tissier added that French consulates in Morocco issued about 2,000 Schengen visas per day during the peak period in 2018. Quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), The French diplomat added that Schengen visa applicants reached 400,000 in 2018 with. The rejection rate for Schengen visas was close to the world average of 16 %. The diplomat added that the French General Consulate in Rabat processed 79,000 Schengen visa applications in 2018. The diplomat also gave advice to applicants regarding appointments.  She invited applicants to make appointments directly through the computer system. She said that the consulate provides applicants who travel frequently with a “circulation visa.” She also emphasized the importance of the new appointment system that “allowed a better flow of  Schengen visa issuance.” Causse-Tissier made her statement during a visit to the Teleperformance Company Center (TLS) in Rabat. She explained that the company is part of the outsourcing of Schengen visas to ensure a better reception for applicants. General manager of TLS Morocco, Bassem Missaoui, stated that the company has nine centers in Morocco, including two in Rabat. One of the centers in Rabat is deals with the Schengen Zone, while the other is dedicated to UK applications. “The TLS centers have some 300 employees all over Morocco and are spread over different cities,” he said. Marrakech, Casablanca, Fez, Oujda, Nador, and Tangier have their own centers. Missaoui said that the absenteeism rate among Schengen visa applicants has been decreased by more than 70%, owing to the new system of appointments set up in December. “On average, 750 applicants per day are registered at the Schengen Center in Rabat, with 80% of the requests for France.” Earlier in June, French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that Moroccans are among the travelers that receive the most visas from France. Le Drian made his statement during his visit to Rabat, where he met with several senior officials including his counterpart Nasser Bourita. The minister said that more than 400,000 Moroccans received Schengen visas to France from French consulates across Morocco in 2018.“The number makes Morocco the country that receives the second “most visas from France, after China.” The number, however, contradicts figures from the French Ministry of Interior. The ministry states that Moroccans only received 334,016 Schengen visas in 2018, making the North African country to receive the third most Schengen visas from France, after China and Russia.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry for Health has set up the new Commission for Bioequivalent Studies, which will provide independent advice on Moroccan research projects related to the quality and efficiency of generic medication. The commission will review the bioequivalence of generic medication in Morocco, that is whether the generic medication is equivalent to the brand-name medication in quality and efficiency.   The commission will be made up of members of the Direction of Medication and Pharmacy, the body which regulates the Moroccan pharmaceutical sector, as well as researchers with expertise in pharmacology and chemistry.  The ministerial decree, dated June 20, setting up the commission emphasizes that the commission members are independent: they must have no commercial interests in the making of the generic medication under review. In March 2019, the Ministry for Health announced by decree that all generic medication in Morocco must be confirmed bioequivalent to the brand medication, before it is released on the market. Bioequivalence testing must be done on all locally produced generic medication. For generics that have been produced overseas and have already been tested for bioequivalence, testing in Morocco is only required for smaller batches, where less than 100,000 units have been produced. According to 2018 figures from the Moroccan Pharmaceuticals Association (AMIP), 40.1% of medication consumed in Morocco is generic.  In 2018, 60% of medication consumed in Morocco was produced locally, by over 45 different pharmaceutical companies. The main Moroccan players in the industry are Laprophan, Cooper Maroc, Bottu, Iberma, and Sothema. A number of foreign companies also produce generics in Morocco including Astrazeneca, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Pfizer, and Roche. American company Mylan Pharmaceuticals inaugurated its factory in Casablanca last week, where it will produce a generic treating hepatits C. The pharmaceutical industry is Morocco’s second largest chemical sector activity after phosphates.

Rabat – The Polisario Front, the separatist militant group claiming an independent state in Western Sahara, has launched a cyber warfare operation against Cote d’Ivoire. The move is in response to the West African country’s support for Morocco’s claims over the disputed region. In its June 28 edition, Casablanca-based newspaper Assabah cited “well informed sources” who have discovered the activities of a branch of the separatist front tasked with using the internet to undermine and pre-empt Morocco’s actions to gain international support for its Western agenda. According to the newspaper, Cote d’Ivoire has been the recurrent target of a wave of online messages and threats to intimate the country into tempering its bold support for the Moroccan side. So far this week, a stream of fake messages and sensational pro-Polisario coverage of the Western Sahara crisis flooded Ivorian sites and social media, according to Assabah. The messages are reportedly meant to spark debates on the situation in Western Sahara and subsequently “monitor comments from [Ivorian] internet users.” The ultimate goal is to “wage a psychological warfare to pressure countries” into adopting a pro-Polisario line. Assabah’s sources noted that the cyber campaign is being orchestrated by pro-Polisario “high tech experts” established in France, Algeria, and the Canary Islands. Interestingly, though, the campaign’s “supervisor” is said to be a “young Moroccan” living in Guelmim, in Southern Morocco. His role is to coordinate the Polisario Front’s cyber unit living mostly in Algeria, France, and Spain. The unit’s members received training in state-of-the-art collage and video editing techniques from Spanish experts. The choice of Cote d’Ivoire is not coincidental. While Morocco has garnered considerable international support for its Western Sahara position in recent years, the West African country recently brought its pro-Morocco support to the highest possible level by inaugurating an honorary consulate in Laayoune. A particularly consequential diplomatic move, opening an official diplomatic representation amounts to a de facto recognition of Morocco’s jurisdiction over Laayoune. During the inauguration, Idrissa Traore, the Ivorian ambassador to Morocco, was unapologetic about his country’s pro-Morocco stance. “Ivory Coast has been and always will be with Morocco. For us, peace will come through the respect of Morocco’s territorial integrity,” Traore stressed. Polisario’s official response was just as blunt. The front castigated the Ivorian government and called for continental action to compel the Western African country to reconsider its move. It described the move as a “clear violation of the rules of international law” and urged the African Union to call on the Ivorian government to “respect the exceptional status of Western Sahara.” As well as a reprisal against Cote d’Ivoire’s recognition of the Laayoune province as part of Moroccan territory, Polisario’s cyber campaign is also meant as a deterrent for other countries that may be considering a decision similar to Cote d’Ivoire’s. If the West African country is the first to open diplomatic representation in Laayoune, many other countries have tacitly buttressed Morocco’s sovereignty over the region. In November of last year, a group of African ambassadors who paid a brief working visit to the region, hailed Morocco’s efforts in “rapidly transforming” the city with noticeable investment into a commercial hub. “Every time we visit the region we witness considerable improvements,” said Ismaila Nimaga, ambassador of the Central African Republic to Rabat. The diplomat said he was in awe of the region’s “rapid transformations… which bear witness to Morocco’s diverse development efforts.”

Rabat – The country of Tunisia was rocked by back-to-back episodes this week. On Thursday, June 27, 92-year-old President Essebsi was hospitalized after experiencing a “severe health crisis.”  Earlier that day the country suffered twin suicide bombings in its capital, Tunis. The attacks left one dead and multiple injured. Despite initial false reports that Essebsi had died, his staff claimed Friday, June 28, that the president is recovering. “The health situation of the President is in a remarkable improvement,” said presidency spokesperson Said Guarach in a statement to Reuters. According to Guarach, Essebsi’s condition had improved enough for the president to discuss recent events with members of his cabinet. “The President held a telephone call this morning with the Minister of Defence about the general situation in the country,” reported Guarach. Essebsi, Tunisia’s first democratically-elected leader, is recovering after he was taken to a military hospital Thursday afternoon. His condition was described as critical but stable.  It was the second time this week that the President had been hospitalized. Earlier in the week, Essebsi was admitted to a hospital for a series of routine tests. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed reassured his fellow Tunisians that the President was in good hands.  “The President of the Republic is in the process of receiving all the necessary attention he needs,” Chahed posted on Facebook, Thursday, June 27.  Only hours before the President’s hospitalization, a pair of coordinated terrorist attacks struck the capital city of Tunis. The bombings, which targeted security forces, killed one police officer and injured at least eight others, including civilians. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the attacks, but offered no evidence. Despite a previous suicide bombing in October of 2018, Tunisia has not experienced the same levels of unrest as some other countries in the region following the Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2011.  Initial reports mistakenly claimed President Essebsi had died following his hospitalization Thursday.  “Please do not be misled by rumors. The president’s condition is stable,” Key adviser to the President, Firas Guefrech said yesterday on Twitter.

Rabat – Herve Renard, the coach of Morocco’s national football team said that “each game against the Ivory Coast is more than difficult.” Morocco and Ivory Coast will face each other today, Thursday, June 28, as part of the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). The game will see one of the teams qualify for the next round of the competition. In a pre-match press conference held on Thursday, June 27,  Renard, who led the Ivory Coast team to a CAN victory in 2015, said that it has a secret he would “put it” on Friday’s match.  Quoted by France 24, the coach said that the “past doesn’t hold much importance” as he has to focus on today’s match. “We have to focus on the game tomorrow which isn’t just any group game. I think the goal of the two teams is to go much further in the competition,” Renard said. He added that he does not think of himself as a trump card for Morocco, emphasizing that he is lucky to be managing Morocco’s football team, which includes “quality players.” The Ivory Coast is also looking forward to meeting the Moroccan national football team with anticipation.  The coach of the Ivory Coast, Ibrahim Kamara, said that his team will not focus on revenge, referring to Morocco’s 2-0 win against his team in November 2017. The win secured Morocco’s place in the 2018 World Cup. “We’re not here for revenge,” said Kamara. He added, “In football, every match is different to deal with. Our main aim is to qualify, not to beat Morocco and then go home.” Morocco won its opening game against Namibia last week, securing three points that could give the Atlas Lions a push during today’s game. Fans of the national team now wait with bated breath to see whether the Atlas Lions will triumph in today’s match against Ivory Coast.

Rabat – Spanish police have arrested three suspects, including two Moroccans, allegedly involved in the rape of a 17-year old girl on Monday in Bilbao, Spain. The Moroccan suspects are aged 18 and 20, according to Spanish news outlet El Espanol. Quoting security sources, the news outlet reported that the two Moroccans were arrested moments after the assault. On Tuesday, June 25, the police arrested a 35-year old suspect, whose nationality has not been disclosed. Investigations into the circumstances of the alleged rape case and the alleged involvement of the Moroccan suspects are still ongoing. El Espanol said that the police are still looking for a fourth suspect. The news outlet added that the Bilbao City Council has strongly condemned the assault against the teenager, expressing its “deepest indignation.” Spanish law stipulates that the perpetrators of sexual assault face sentences of imprisonment from one to five years. The offender, however; might receive a sentence ranging between six to twelve years in prison if the sexual assault consists of “vaginal, anal or oral penetration, or inserting body parts or objects into either of the former two orifices,”  according to the Spanish Criminal Code, Article 179.

Rabat – Six Moroccan migrants died in an attempt to cross Morocco’s southern coast in Sidi Ifni to the Canary Islands on Thursday, June 27. Moroccan television channel Al Oula reported that several others were rescued after their boat sank. The list of deceased migrants includes one woman and her baby. The state television channel added that one of the rescued migrants remains in a critical condition. This most recent attempt to cross the Mediterranean, which ended in tragedy, is not the first of its kind. In the first months of 2019, hundreds of boats have already been rescued or lost in an attempt to reach Europe.  Faced with the increasing pressure of irregular migration, Moroccan law enforcement have thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019. The number represents half of the irregular migration attempts aborted in 2018 (88,761 foiled attempts in 2018). Spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi said in May that Morocco’s strategy in handling the issue is based on a  “humanitarian approach.”  He noted that the Royal Navy has intensified its rescue operations of irregular migrants, and, at the same time, “Morocco is implementing the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration adopted last December [2018] in Marrakech.”

Rabat – This year, 98.43% of Moroccan beaches comply with the microbiological quality standards; but what about the rest? A new application has been launched to inform citizens and tourists about the quality of bathing water, as well as the infrastructure and services available on the Moroccan bays. The Android app “Iplages” has been introduced by the Department for Sustainable Development to provide information about beaches, such as bathing water quality, itinerary, and facilities offered at the different Moroccan venues in order to help beachgoers choose the nearest and cleanest place to go swimming. “This new concept, developed in partnership with the National Laboratory for Pollution Studies and Monitoring, allows the general public access to information regarding the conformity of bathing water quality, as well as the services and infrastructure available on the beaches, “said Nezha El Ouafi, the Secretary of State for Sustainable Development. The launch announcement of the new application was made on Monday, June 24, 2019 by El Ouafi amid the multiple reports on Moroccan three beaches not meeting the standards for safe swimming due to cleanliness concerns. El Ouafi released the annual national report on the water and sand quality of Moroccan beaches earlier this week. The report discovered that seven resorts in Morocco do not meet the standards for safe swimming due to wastewater contamination and inadequate hygiene infrastructure. These resorts are situated at the beaches of Oued Merzeg in Casablanca, Ain Atiq, in Rabat and Jbila III, in the north of Morocco. But “Iplages” came to the swimmers’ rescue. Developed by national research laboratories for pollution monitoring, “Iplages” provides citizens with vital information on 169 Moroccan beaches. For water quality checking, the application receives data from 45 swimming stations in nine coastal regions, while it simultaneously collaborates with 451 air quality monitoring stations. The application is updated every 15 days to provide beachgoers with accurate information any time, while the data it includes can also be accessible on the secretary of state website, rendering locals and tourists fully equipped to spend a safe and sanitary summer swimming in Morocco.

Rabat – The jihadist group, ISIS, has claimed responsibility for the double suicide attack in Tunis on June 27, as reported by the US body monitoring extremist movements SITE Intelligence Group. The first attack, which targeted a law enforcement vehicle on Charles de Gaulle Avenue, killed a policeman and injured three civilians. Shortly after, a suicide bomber blew up his charge near a police station in Al Karjani district, injuring four others, according to the Tunisian Ministry of Interior. The authors of the “two attacks against Tunisian police forces in the capital are fighters of (group) Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,” said the group’s propaganda agency, “Amaq.” SITE Intelligence Group, which provides governments and institutions across the globe with intelligence on terrorist and extremist groups, published the message yesterday, June 27, on its web page.

Rabat – FutureBrand, “one of the world’s leading authorities in country brand strategy and management,” has ranked Morocco 66 out of 75 countries in their 2019 Country Brand Index (CBI).  The self-titled “creative future company” uses the index to “shift global perception with the explicit goal of boosting tourism, investment, and consumer choice for a country’s goods and services.”  By studying countries as brands, the company seeks to understand how they can be “managed and measured for trade, investment, and tourism growth.” The first CBI was released by FutureBrand in 2005 to demonstrate which countries qualify as brands, in that they have a measurable comparative advantage over other countries.  The data for this index is gathered through online surveys distributed to a global sample of 2,500 people. Each survey respondent ranks seven countries, and each country is rated by approximately 230 respondents.  Rather than using “measures of might,” such as gross domestic product (GDP), population size, and nuclear capabilities, FutureBrand re-orders the World Bank’s top 75 countries “based on how individuals rate dimensions of a country’s purpose and experience.”  Respondents are asked to rate countries according to qualities such as healthcare, education, environmental friendliness, technology, tolerance, political freedom, and security. By focusing on “countrymaking” rather than monetary measures, the CBI places “countries with smaller GDPs on comparable footing with more traditionally dominant nations.”  In this “new world order,” twelve of the top 20 countries are European, two are North American, and five are Asia Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand.  The top country is Japan, which has the third largest GDP in the world. The United States, which has the largest GDP in the world, is ranked twelfth.  At 16, the United Arab Emirates is the only Middle Eastern country in the CBI’s top 20. Four more Gulf countries–Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman–are within the top 40.  Morocco placed 7th in Africa behind Egypt (55), Sudan (59), and Algeria (60). The lowest ranked country on the CBI is Iraq. Morocco also has one of the worst “Quality of Life” scores, alongside Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Iraq.  These scores are based on perceptions of healthcare, education, and income disparity. Countries with high scores in this category are more likely to benefit from tourism and business investments.  Morocco’s World Bank ranking, which is based on its GDP, is 61. While this is quite low on the list of 75 countries, Morocco’s position at 66 on the CBI is even lower. This reveals an overall negative perception of the country within the survey sample.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has strongly condemned the despicable terror attacks in central Tunis, killing at least one police officer and wounding several other people. The attacks in Tunis took place yesterday, June 27. In his message, the monarch expressed his “firm condemnation of this cowardly criminal act.” The King also reaffirmed his “full solidarity and continued support for this sister country in the fight against the scourge of abject terrorism.” The message also reiterated Morocco’s ongoing support for all efforts to preserve Tunisia’s security and stability. The King also extended his “deep condolences and compassion” to President Caid Essebsi, and to the grieving families.

Rabat – Spokesperson of the Moroccan Government Mustapha El Khalfi expressed the government’s satisfaction with El Salvador and Barbados’ decision to withdraw recognition of self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). In the press conference, El Khalfi said that Morocco’s government  is committed to addressing any provocative action that h seeks to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity. The government’s stance is complemented by the newly adopted “vigilance system,” he said.   El Khalfi highlighted how Morocco responded  after the organizing committee of the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt posted a video featuring the flag of the the Polisario Front’s self-styled SADR.  “All the stakeholders s intervened, including the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Sports, the Royal Football Federation, and the Moroccan embassy [in Egypt].” Morocco’s quick reaction resulted in an official apology from the organizing committee, as well as  the Egyptian government. Morocco’s position on the conflict is gaining traction. “The best proof of this,  is the decision of El Salvador and Barbados to withdraw their recognition of the self-proclaimed SADR, he added.  “The number of countries that support the Polisario Front decreased from 80 countries to 50 countries. It is a limited number of countries,” said El Khalfi, adding that the number of withdrawals will increase. El Khalfi pointed out that there will be no “empty chair” policy anymore as Morocco’s government is mobilizing all its resources to combat any hostile moves that seeks to  undermine its territorial integrity and its sovereignty over the southern provinces in Western Sahara. The spokesperson of the Moroccan government  recalled Morocco’s participation in the 41st session of the Human Rights Council held in Geneva this week. During the Council session, a group of states sympathetic to Morocco’s position  expressed support for Morocco’s territorial integrity and its Autonomy Plan. The group also reiterated their full support for the UN-led political process to end the conflict, saying that the “issue of the Sahara is a political dispute managed in New York where the Security Council is making efforts to facilitate the achievement of a mutually acceptable political solution.” The group, which includes, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, reiterated  that the Moroccan Autonomy initiative has been recognized by the UN Security Council as the “unique and exclusive way to resolve” the decades-long regional conflict.

Rabat – Morocco and the European Union expressed on Thursday, June 27,  their determination to give new “impetus to their strategic, multidimensional, and privileged relationship; This impetus is consistent with their mutual expectations and the challenges of today’s world, by developing a true ‘Euro-Moroccan partnership for shared prosperity’.” The strategic partners announced their decision in a joint political declaration at the end of the 14th meeting of the Morocco-EU Association Council, held in Brussels on Thursday, June 27. “The EU-Morocco partnership is more necessary than ever to respond to such challenges,” the document says. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that shared views on numerous issues has made it increasingly possible for the European Union and Morocco to collaborate on developing suitable responses to issues, in line with the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. The  declaration emphasized that the EU-Morocco partnership will aim at further deepening bilateral relations, on the basis of common ambitions and the development of both parties. It will also aim at strengthening regional and Euro-African cooperation as well as supporting effective multilateralism. The  document also reiterated that the two parties “commit themselves to protecting the partnership which unites them, strengthening its resilience and stability and ensuring its continuity in case of difficulties, particularly through early consultation, strengthened coordination and use of the working structures established under the partnership”. The EU and Morocco also reaffirmed that they will work to “define a new framework for relations, one that is comprehensive and resilient. “ The ‘Euro-Moroccan partnership for shared prosperity’ will be based on four structural areas: an area of convergence of values, an area of economic convergence and social cohesion, an area of shared knowledge, and an area of political consultation and of enhanced cooperation on security. The partnership will also focus on two key horizontal fields in which specific operational actions will also be carried out, namely cooperation in the field of the environment and the fight against climate change, and cooperation in the field of mobility and migration; these actions will reinforce each other. The partnership for shared prosperity serves as a  dynamic example which can be used by parties who share the same level of ambition, according to MAP. Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita, and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini chaired the 14th meeting of the Morocco-European Union Association Council.

Rabat – Tunisia’s President Beji Caid Essebsi was taken to a military hospital on Thursday, June 27, after suffering a “severe health crisis,” according to the Tunisian presidency’s Facebook page. Essebsi remains in “very critical” condition but is still alive, an adviser told Reutors, countering previous rumors that he had died.  Essebsi, 92, was also hospitalized last week – though this was for non-serious treatment. Essebsi is the country’s first freely-elected president and has been involved in politics for most of his life, though he has become more well known for his political leadership since the Arab Spring. Following the overthrow of Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, Essebsi has been a prominent political figure in the country – leading the immediate transition towards democracy in his temporary role as Prime Minister. He was elected president three years later, in an election characterized by the polarization between Islamists and others.  Alongside his presidential victory, Essebsi’s secular Nidaa Tounes party also took the majority in parliament, replacing the Islamist Ennahda party.  In his victory speech he emphasized bringing Tunisians together and said he wanted to be a president of “all Tunisian men and women.” Essebsi recently announced he would not campaign for reelection this year, despite his party’s encouragement for him to run for another term. The 92-year-old said a younger person should lead the country.  His party has yet to suggest an alternative candidate. Born in 1926, Essebsi studied law before entering the political field.  He supported Tunisia’s independence leader, Habib Bourguiba. After Tunisia gained its independence from France in 1956, he served as Foreign Minister. Essebsi then held the position of speaker of parliament while Ben Ali was still in power.  The majority of Essebsi’s experience is in security, defence, and foreign affairs and these areas remain his focus as President.

Rabat – Mustapha El khalfi, the Moroccan government spokesman, has made a statement on the Tunis terror attacks. Speaking on behalf of the government, El khalfi emphasized the importance of condemning and categorically refusing such terrorist acts. The statement was made following the weekly meeting of the Government Council for the discussion, ratification, and approval of a number of legal and regulatory texts on June 27 in Rabat. Answering a question on the Tunis attacks, El Khalfi said that he considered the explosions “terrorist attacks” and expressed his support and solidarity to the Tunisian people. The minister seized the occasion to tackle Morocco’s own fight against terrorism. He mentioned that “this week, police forces were able to dismantle a terrorist group.” El Khalfi stressed that these police operations are a known and set approach which is part of a national strategy. This anti-terrorism strategy is based on intelligence networks to preempt  and immediately terminate any possible terrorist threat. He further praised the efficiency of all Moroccan police forces. He then added that this strategy is one of many adopted by Morocco in its fight against terrorism.  These strategies, as El Khalfi revealed, “focus on the origins of terrorism, i.e. the external forces trying to draw people into terrorist groups or networks.”  The country, according to the minister, has adopted a national program which aims to spread the values of moderate Islamism in order to eradicate extremist Islamic thought and speech. Other national programs include “Moussalaha”, launched by the General Delegation to the Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) and based on reconciliation with the self, then with the religious text, and finally with society, as well as international cooperation on the subject of terrorism. El Khalfi also emphasized Morocco’s internationally recognized efforts in war against terrorism saying that “the country has become an example to follow in this matter; through its experience, it has proven its efficiency and expertise.”

Rabat – After his flight departed over an hour late, Ambassador Thomas Reilly said he arrived in Casablanca only to wait another hour for his luggage to show up.  Reilly took to Twitter on Wednesday, June 26th, to voice his frustrations with Royal Air Maroc (RAM). The incident was not the first time RAM has come under fire on social media in recent months.  “It is not surprising if people are irritated,” Reilly said. Reilly explained that he eventually got his luggage, 70 minutes after his flight had landed. “It seems pilot left ‘plane &amp; turned it off so they couldn’t unload the bags,” he said. Other exasperated customers chimed in on Reilly’s twitter feed to complain about the airline’s bad service.  “I don’t know what’s happened with this company,” Twitter user Nabil Safir said. “It’s time for Morocco to think about building other ones.”  Earlier this year a distinguished pair of Reilly’s countrymates were also victims of the airline’s allegedly careless attitude toward luggage. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex brought along an entourage of photographers to document their trip when they visited Morocco in February . Prince Harry and Meghan’s plans were compromised when the luggage of several of their official photographers went missing. The airline denied responsibility for the incident, instead pointing the finger at bad weather. The lost luggage blues escalated when baggage handlers at Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca went on strike in April.  Over the last few months, baggage handlers that work for RAM subcontractor General Private Interim (GPI) have gone on a series of strikes, resulting in ongoing disruption and chaos at Morocco’s busiest airport.  Angered about RAM’s lack of accountability for misplaced luggage , customers turned to Twitter to vent their frustrations.  “We just spent 30 minutes on the phone,” one user tweeted, “and were basically yelled at for asking for information.” RAM has repeatedly denied responsibility for missing luggage during the strikes, blaming the subcontractor instead of inclement weather.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) seized on Thursday, June 27, chemical products in two farms.  The farms were searched following the arrest of a four-member dismantled cell used to meet there to manufacture explosives. The BCIJ apprehended the extremist suspects in Al Haouz near Marrakech on June 25. As part of ongoing investigations, BCIJ seized chemical products, including black powder, chemicals, aluminum sawdust, two small bottles of butane gas, as well as electric wires allegedly used to manufacture explosives. The seized products will be the subject of scientific examination by experts, according to the statement. Preliminary investigations have found that the suspects were planning to carry out several “serious” terror attacks at sensitive sites across the country. The suspects are aged between 25 and 40. The mastermind of the cell, according to BCIJ, forged “suspicious relations with active members in order to plan terror attacks” in Morocco using explosive devices. He also recruited and trained the other members of the cell. On June 25, BCIJ said that it has monitored a farm in Ourika, 30 kilometers from Marrakech which is owned by one of the cell members.

Rabat  – The Public Prosecution called on  the Court of Appeal in Sale to give death penalty to three main suspects involved in the killing of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal in December 2018. Lawyer of the suspects Hafida Maksaoui told Morocco World News on Thursday, June 27, that the Public Prosecutor condemned the “savagery” of the crimes committed by the suspects, asking for the ultimate punishment. The prosecutor’s representative, Madsaoui said, had asked for the court to hand a life sentence to the fourth main suspect involved in the crime. The four main suspects confessed to  killing the two Scandinavian tourists. The prosecutor also called on the court to hand verdicts ranging between 3 and 10 years to the remaining defendants who were not directly involved in the murders. The court have postponed again postponed further sessions, Maksaoui told MWN. The trial will now continue in two weeks, allowing defense time to prepare. Autopsy report The report, outlining the horrific injuries sustained by the two victims, was also discussed during Thursday’s court session. The report was disclosed at the Court of Appeal in Sale, where the hearings of the 24 suspects connected in the murder has been taking place since May 2. The report showed that Danish tourist Louisa Vesterager Jespersen sustained 23 injuries. A rupture in the neck and decapitation caused her tragic death. She was injured in her left eye, forehead, and left ear. She also sustained several other injuries to her left hand, fingers, and leg. Norwegian victim Maren Ueland suffered seven injuries and two fractures, one of which was in her ribcage. She also suffered from a deep wound of 20 centimeters on her throat. The prosecution representative said that the findings of the autopsy demonstrate  the “savagery” of the crime committed by “human beasts.” The Sale court closed the hearing of the case on June 21 following a series of court sessions with the 24 suspects allegedly involved in the case. The four main suspects, who appeared in a video pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi last year, confessed the crimes attributed to them. The four main suspects fa are facing multiple charges, including forming a gang to commit terror crimes, and intentionally taking a life in a premeditated attack. The main suspects will also face charges of inciting people to commit terror acts, praising terrorism, and promoting extremism. In addition to the suspects, lawyers representing the victims want the country to bear its responsibility. The lawyers claimed that Morocco shows the region as a tourist site “without providing safety” in the area. The families of the victims, who hired the lawyers, did not specify the amount of compensation they are claiming from the state.

Rabat – Trump has responded to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s comments suggesting that the White House is “mentally disabled,” and Trump is “afflicted by a mental disorder.” Rouhani questioned Trump’s mental faculties in response to new sanctions imposed on Iranian officials by Trump. “The White House actions show it is mentally retarded,” said Rouhani, calling them “outrageous and idiotic.” He also accused the US of lying about wanting to resume talks between the two countries. “You say you really want to hold talks with us, but at the same time you’re saying that you want to boycott and sanction our foreign minister, so you’re lying,” he said. The comments seemed to hit home, triggering an emotional response from Trump on Twitter. “Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion,’ they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,” he tweeted. “The U.S. has not forgotten Iran’s use of IED’s &amp; EFP’s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.” The statements from Trump seem to contradict other US officials, who say the US wants to negotiate with Iran rather than escalate the dispute. “The United States is not looking to go to war with Iran,” said Mark T. Esper, the acting defense secretary. “Rather, we want to get to a diplomatic path.” Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, also insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door.” Trump’s insult match with Rouhani bares a striking similarity to his dispute with North Korea in late 2017. The war of words came to a head at the 2017 United Nations general assembly, where he threatened to “totally destroy North Korea” with “fire and fury.” “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,” he said. He also referred to North Korea’s leader Kim Jung-un as a “Rocket Man” on “a suicide mission.” In response, Jung-un released a statement calling Trump a “mentally deranged and vowed “highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.” “A frightened dog barks louder,” he added. “He is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician,” Jung-un said. Even though Trump only doubled down on his statements in response, calling Jung-un “obviously a madman” on Twitter, when they met for face to face talks, the two ended up expressing mutual affection for each other with Trump going as far as saying they “fell in love.” The current dispute with Iran and the road to diplomacy may not be as simple, and complex nuclear deals are at stake. Iran has been adamant it will not be pressured into concessions and will not negotiate with the US under the current oil, banking and trade sanctions. The insult match was triggered by Donald Trump placing sanctions on Iranian officials. Trump explained that the sanctions placed on Iranian officials as a response to “aggressive behavior from Iran.” Just last week, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming that it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. However, the US insisted the drone was flying over international waters. In response to the drone being shot down, Trump approved air strikes on Iran but called them off just minutes before the military action was meant to take place, on the morning of Friday, June 21. US planes and ships were already in position when Trump called off the attack, according to the White House. Trump’s motivation behind calling off the attack, or whether it will be carried out at a later date, remains unknown. Iran shooting down the drone and Trump’s planned military action was just the most recent events in tensions that have been escalating for months. In May, things escalated further when Washington ordered all countries halt imports of Iranian oil. In response the US’ call for a boycott, Iran pulled out its international nuclear agreements on May 8, as well as giving Europe, China and Russia a two-month ultimatum to help Iran circumvent US sanctions and sell its oil or it would abandon two more commitments. Trump also accused Iran of being behind two sets of explosions that damaged six oil tankers in the Gulf region. Iran has denied the allegations. The US, in turn, announced that it is building a coalition with unnamed allies to protect Gulf shipping lanes.

Rabat – Former Tunisian president has cited Algeria’s pronounced hostility towards Morocco as the main reason for the “failure of the Maghreb Union,” a regional integration project to deepen social, economic, and political ties among Maghreb countries. In an 18-minute interview with Russian Sputnik, former Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki said a great part of the failure of the Maghreb Union is that successive governments in Algeria have blocked the impetus for such a project. He explained how, in the aftermath of the Tunisian Spring in 2012, he initiated a regional tour to speak to all governments of the Maghreb about the possibility of a regional body around ideals of diplomatic normalization and freedom of movement for both people and goods. Normalization between Morocco and Algeria is the unquestionable key to the success of such an enterprise in the Maghreb, Marzouki explained. He noted, however, “The energetic ‘No’ always came from Algeria.” In the interview, Marzouki made a striking portrait of the Algerian political establishment capricious and self-indulged leaders who seemed to be living in an alternative political universe where accountability to the people means very little. He said that Algiers tried to hijack the 2011 Tunisian Spring by providing the Tunisian regime with the support it needed to quell the demonstrations. “They tried to pre-empt to make sure that the Tunisian revolt would not be contagious. Unfortunately, what they feared is now happening in their country.” For Marzouki, the ongoing “revolution” in Algeria comes with promises that the “great Algerian people” will no longer tolerate being the means to the realization of the personal aspirations of its political leaders. “I have faith in the determination of the Great Algerian people,” he offered, explaining how the success of the revolution could be determining for a future of stability, democracy, and regional dialogue in the greater Maghreb region. On the regional integration stage, Marzouki is pinning great expectations on the outcome of the Algerian revolution. He said the Tunisian Spring was not a total success because Tunisians “naively” believed after the revolution that different faces from the same old political establishment they had ousted could inspire the political change the youth had fought—and died—for during the demonstrations. Unlike Tunisians, the Algerian protesters have been implacable about their demands. With the same vigor and energy as in the beginning of the anti-Bouteflika demonstrations, the Algerian protesters have been inflexible, saying that they will not stop until the entire Bouteflika cohort leaves political power to a brand new generation of politicians. This, Marzouki elaborated, could garner the leadership change needed to resurrect talks of normalization between Algiers and Rabat. When the Algerian protests broke out in late February as an earnest protest against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s desire to run for another presidential term, the broad expectation was that things would go back to normal should Bouteflika renounce. But when the president did renounce his presidential bid, protesters demanded that he resign altogether. Once again, the expectation was that the demonstrations would cease should the president resign. President Bouteflika did resign, but the protests have continued. Algerians are now demanding that the entire Bouteflika establishment be ousted from the country’s most powerful offices. Channeling the demands of the Algerian revolution, Marzaki said that what is happening in the country may result in a “genuine rupture” from previous political leadership. Such a political rupture, he argued, will come with a new understanding of doing politics, which “may pave the way for the Maghreb Union.” In addition to resurrecting hopes for the Maghreb Union, the Algerian revolution could inspire democratic change across the region, according to Marzouki. He said revolutions are “inherently contagious.” Part of the contagion could be improved political accountability across the region, since governments will act to avoid what is happening to their Algerian counterparts. Marzaki’s comments come months after Morocco’s King Mohammed VI extended Algeria an invitation for a “frank dialogue” over the main points of contention between the two countries. In a speech commemorating the Green March on November 6, the King said, “I should like to say today, in a very straightforward and responsible way, that Morocco stands ready for a direct and frank dialogue with our sister nation, Algeria, in order to settle the transient and objective differences impeding the development of relations between the two countries.”

Rabat – The head coach of Morocco’s national football team, Herve Renard, has high expectations ahead of the Atlas Lions’ match against the Ivory Coast, due to take place on June 28. The coach, who has twice clinched the CAN title, flew to Egypt determined to lead his Moroccan team to triumph in the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). Renard, who won the title in 2015 with Ivory Coast, wants to make history again by winning the title with Morocco; the 12th team he has managed since the start of his coaching career in 1999. Renard also won the title with Zambia in 2012. Quoted by AFP, Renard said that the upcoming game, against the team he used to coach, is “special” for him. Morocco’s national football team already has three points in its pocket after a win against Namibia on Sunday, June 23. After the Namibia-Morocco football game, Renard took to social media to thank Moroccan football fans for their support. Posting a photo of a Moroccan child attending the game, Renard wrote: “Thanks to the Moroccan public for its support during this important victory against Namibia.” It remains to be seen whether the Atlas Lions will satisfy their fans during the match against Ivory Coast, which will qualify them for the Round 16 of the competition.

Rabat – The Ivory Coast honorary consulate will promote diplomatic ties between Morocco and the African state, covering in particular the regions of Laayoune-Sakia El Hanra and Dakhla-Oued Addahab. “Thanks to the opening of the honorary consulate in Laayoune, the multidimensional relationships with Morocco will intensify,” stated Idrissa Traore, the ambassador of the Ivory Coast to Morocco.   “Beyond traditional bilateral relationships, the Ivory Coast and Morocco also have a strategic partnership,” Traore added. Over the past several years, the two countries have entered into a number of political and economic agreements.  Since 2014, 120 bilateral projects have been undertaken in Ivory Coast across the sectors of education, transport, finance, industry, fishing, and agriculture. These include the rehabilitation of the commercial Cocody Bay, works on the 25,000 m2 Mohammed VI mosque in Treichville, Abidjan, and a number of other infrastructure projects. The new Honorary Consul for the Ivory Coast Mohamed El Imam Maelainine, stated that the consulate “will play an important role as a human, fraternal and cultural link between the two countries.” The inauguration of the honorary consulate in Laayoune comes as the international community continues to debate the status of the region in Western Sahara.  On the question of Western Sahara, the Ambassador reiterated Ivory Coast’s unwavering support for Morocco’s position on the dispute. “On this matter, Ivory Coast has been and always will be with Morocco. For us, peace will come through the respect of Morocco’s territorial integrity,” Traore emphasized.  The Western Sahara conflict is an ongoing dispute between the Polisario Front and the Kingdom of Morocco, over a territory including the city of Laayoune. Under its “Autonomy Plan”, Morocco proposes that Western Sahara operate as an autonomous region, maintaining Morocco’s territorial integrity. States such as Namibia and South Africa support the Polisario Front on this matter, while a growing majority of countries support Morocco.  In response to the inauguration of the honorary consulate in Laayoune, Sahraoui website Future-Sahara called for “measures to be taken at the African Union level to require [Ivory Coast] to respect the exceptional status of Western Sahara.” The media communicates the response of a Sahraoui blogger on social media: “the decision taken by the Republic of Ivory Coast to open a consulate in Laayoune constitutes a clear violation of the rules of international law and an obstacle to peace.” The leader of the Polisario Front Brahim Ghali has not yet responded to the matter.

Rabat – A delegation from the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED) visited Morocco on Wednesday, June 26, 2019, aiming to enhance the country’s contribution in the hard-fought battle against terrorism.  The UN delegation, led by the Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, Michèle Coninsx was composed of ten experts from the UN and other international organizations. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the members of the UN delegation met with Moroccan state officials to discuss the global threat of terrorism and how to minimize its risks by promoting the Moroccan efforts on alleviating the current situation.  In December 2018, two Scandinavian tourists were murdered while hiking near Mount Toubkal, located in southwestern Morocco.  Moroccan authorities arrested 24 individuals connected with the brutal murders, including one having close links to “an extremist group.” After the Imlil murders, the UK updated its foreign travel advisory for Morocco? warning British citizens that “attacks could be indiscriminate or target foreigners.” “There’s considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attacks globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria,” said a warning released by the UK government earlier this year. “You should be vigilant at this time.” Following the UK, Canada also updated its travel advisory for Morocco, after officials discovered the murdered bodies of the Scandinavian victims. Moroccan authorities regularly report the disruption of terrorist attacks across the country. In April, the Moroccan police arrested seven alleged jihadists with links to the Islamic State in the coastal town of Sale, near Rabat.  The raid was led by the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) anti-terrorism squad. Police discovered electronic devices, bladed weapons, and “extremist” documents, belonging to the group. The US embassy in Rabat issued a security alert in April 2019, upgrading its risk assessment to “Level 2” for possible terrorist attacks in Morocco. “Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Morocco,” the embassy stated. “Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, and local government facilities.”  Morocco’s counterterrorism strategy, which was updated in 2015 with the creation of the BCIJ, an elite anti-terrorism police bureau, has contributed to alleviating the threat of terrorism across the nation. Morocco’s counter-terrorism policy is currently resting on three key pillars: Stepping up internal security, eradicating poverty, and making religious reforms. The UN Counter-Terrorism Committee’s new scheme to support Morocco’s endeavors could potentially curb terrorist threats not only inside the borders of the North African country but also on a global scale.

Rabat – More and more Moroccan “brains” are migrating to countries where their skills and qualifications afford more financial benefit or career advancement.  The brain drain has become an alarming issue in the last few years.  MP Omar Hjira of Al Istiqlal party stated, in his speech at the monthly plenary session of the House of Representatives, that more than 10,430 administrative and technical executives left Morocco in 2018.  Hjira, revealed that this number included more than 8,000 administrative and technical executives, 1,200 businessmen, 600 engineers, and 630 doctors. Hjira said that these executives, who have a stable income, would never have left their country if they had received sufficient attention from the government. Hjira further stated that the currency transfer of Moroccans living abroad reached $7 billion, and their deposits in Moroccan banks are estimated at 20% of the total national savings.  Hjira stressed that this brain drain to the United States, Canada, and Europe is due to the lack of consideration given to these competent individuals in Morocco and the government’s lack of responsiveness to their expectations.  This phenomenon is all the more worrying, adds the MP, as 70% of Moroccans living abroad are of different nationalities or are being naturalized. Hjira also specified that half of Moroccans residing in more than 100 countries were born abroad. More than 70% of Moroccans wish to leave the country for several reasons such as financial pressures or the corruption within the country, according to an international survey conducted by Arab Barometer.

It adds an extra 6 million container capacity (calculated in TEUs, or “twenty foot equivalent unit”) to Tanger Med, which is already the biggest port in Africa. Tanger Med 2 port will contain two container terminals, TC3 and TC4. Marsa Maroc, the main operator of ports in Morocco, will operate TC3, which has a capacity of 1 million TEUs. TC4 is licensed to APM Terminals, an international container terminal operating company headquartered in the Netherlands. TC4 has a capacity of 5 million TEUs. Tanger Port Med already operates more than 50% of Morocco’s exports. The port handled an aggregate value of $33 billion of products in imports and exports in 2018.  The Tanger Port Med 2 extension will only increase Morocco’s trade capacity, offering a stronger platform for exports by local production plants including French car makers Renault and Peugeot. Renault already has a dedicated terminal. In 2018, the port handled 351,191 Renault’s for export from the Moroccan factories. PSA Peugeot Citroen, which inaugurated its first factory in Morocco on June 20 in Kenitra, will also export through the port this year. In April, DHL Global Forwarding, the leading international provider of air, sea and road freight services, signed a deal with Tanger Med to set up its new Africa-Europe Logistics Hub in the Tanger Med port. “The strategic location of Tanger Med presents a huge opportunity for us. Its ability to support multi-modal connectivity, especially its maritime, as well as road connections to Casablanca and the South, will allow us to expand and enhance our customer service offering,” said Christelle Fadel, General Manager, DHL Global Forwarding, in a press release.

Rabat – The refraction test, also simply called a vision test, determines what type of prescription is needed for glasses or contact lenses.  A controversial legal provision proposal, Article 6 of Law 45-13, states opticians will no longer have the right to perform vision tests, unless permitted by regulations. Opticians are furious. They are currently able to perform vision tests and prescribe glasses to their clients, and they want to retain that right. On the other hand, ophthalmologists claim that refraction is a medical procedure, which therefore falls in their field of expertise, in accordance with law 131-13 on medical practice. They claim on that basis that opticians should not have the right to perform vision tests. They also argue that opticians have a conflict of interest by both performing vision tests and selling glasses. They warn against the free vision tests offered by opticians, in a bid to boost glasses sales. While the conflict between the two professions only gathered momentum at the start of 2019, the plan to amend the law started back in 2015. In 2015, the Ministry of Health proposed a law which allowed opticians to perform refraction tests in certain specific circumstances. Opticians criticized the proposal as it made its way through the parliamentary process. Ophthalmologists only became aware of the proposal in early 2019, so until then were absent from the debate. On finding out about the law, they jumped on an opportunity to seek an amendment before the amendment deadline in March 2019.  A legislative battle followed, with opticians and ophthalmologists each proposing amendments. On June 3, opthamologists protested outside the Ministry of Health in Rabat. On June 4, the Ministry of Health proposed the latest version, under which opticians will no longer have the right to perform the vision tests. On June 12, over 2000 opticians this time, from across Morocco, protested outside the Ministry, and again on June 19. The law is currently sitting with the House of Representatives. The date of the second reading has not yet been set. The law could again be modified. In the meantime, opticians are ramping up their protests. The Moroccan National Syndicate of Opticians argues their right to refraction comes from training approved by the Ministry of National Education. They emphasize that they have been exercising it for 65 years, under a decree from 1954 regulating their profession. On June 26, the opticians syndicate organized another strike and a sit-in outside Parliament in Rabat. A further strike and sit-in will take place on July 3 and July 10.

Rabat – Every summer thousands of visitors descend on the coastal town of Essaouira for the Gnaoua Music Festival. Unfortunately, the crowds don’t necessarily mean business for local merchants. In the late 1960s, Essaouira morphed from a sleepy Moroccan fishing town to a magnet for hippies and travelers. Musicians like Jimi Hendrix and Cat Stevens spent time in the city, drawing visitors in their wake looking to walk in the footsteps of their icons.  But music was a part of the region’s history well before any foreign rockstar passed through the gates of Essaouira’s centuries-old medina.  Local Gnaoua music has its roots in the slaves brought to the area hundreds of years ago. They practiced a mystical, syncretic form of Islam where music was played to put the listener into a devotional trance. Popularized by bands like Nass El Ghiwane in the 1970s, today Gnaoua music remains revered throughout Morocco. Now in its 22nd year, the Gnaoua and World Music Festival draws up to half a million people to Essaouira in late June, including the shaggy-haired hippies that have flocked to the city for decades. Visitors come from near and far to see local Gnaoua musicians perform side-by-side with international superstars at the four-day festival.  The streets are packed, pedestrian traffic jams abound, and the main square full of music fans lounging about, dancing, and making tea.  Despite the massive crowds, local merchants said they don’t always see the annual festival as a boon to their businesses. On Friday evening cafe Chez Mermoz was empty, save for a single table where three young Moroccans lingered after their meal. Moulay Hassan Square, home to the largest festival stage, was just a short walk away. Mohammed sipped tea in his cafe and waited in the hope that more customers would arrive.

Mohammed came to Essaouira 27 years ago, before the festival had started. “It’s changed, it’s changed a lot,” he said, admitting the event is not the same relaxed affair it used to be. These days branding and corporate sponsorship are as present as the giant backpacks lugged around by freewheeling travelers. When asked about the hippies he laughed and waved his hand to dismiss them. They weren’t the ones coming to eat at Chez Mermoz. According to a study published on the Gnaoua Festival’s official website, each MAD 1 invested in the festival, in turn, generates MAD 17 for the city of Essaouira.  The study, conducted in partnership with a Morrocan consulting firm called The Valyans Foundation, also showed overnight stays rose 30% between 2001 and 2013.  Concertgoers could purchase a ticket to watch the shows from a fenced off area right in front of the stage. Or they could watch the show for free from further back in the square.  The area reserved for attendees with tickets was dwarfed in size by the space in Moulay Hassan Square where people enjoyed the music gratis. Not far from the square, Latif, who is also a musician, runs a shop selling textiles. He said he liked the festival for the music, which he said “brings people together from all over the world.”  “It encourages tolerance between people, Muslims, Christians, Jews, everyone,” Latif said. “We need that here in Essaouira. And everywhere else too.” While he appreciates the openness the festival brings, Latif said his sales don’t increase much during the long weekend. “The people that come here for the festival don’t come here to buy,” he said. “They only look.”  Elsewhere in the medina, some entrepreneurs took matters into their own hands. Some hawked clothing or busked for change. Atman Hawari brought his pet peacock. Atman has lived between Essaouira and Marrakech for 50 years. He has lost count of how many times he’s attended the festival. Instead of selling goods, he offered passersby a photo op with his peacock, named Nasim, in exchange for a small donation.  “It’s good to come together and dance and forget about all the s**t,” Atman said. He agreed that like other attendees, he wasn’t there to shop. Only for the music.  Further from the square, Mustafa works at a shop selling jewelry and other souvenirs. Like the other merchants, he didn’t see the presence of festival goers translating into more sales.  “It’s a right of passage, people hitchhike here, they even walk,” Mustafa said. “They come here for the music. They don’t come here to buy anything.”

Rabat – Fabrice Leggeri, the executive director of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) said that Morocco is making “considerable” efforts to fight against irregular migration. Allegri told the press on Tuesday, June 25, in Rabat that Morocco is an “important and strategic partner for the EU, which has been ensuring stability at the borders. Leggri was in Rabat for a meeting with Minister delegate for the Interior, Noureddine Boutayeb, and director of migration and border surveillance at the Interior Ministry, Khalid Zerouali. Leggri said that hosting the African observatory for Migration and Development  in Morocco is a tangible proof of the very important responsibilities it carries out at the regional level. He also spoke about the pressure Morocco is facing due to the “very high financial cost” of fighting irregular migration. He emphasized that he discussed with officials  of the Ministry of Interior and concerned parties “the means of developing, ‘in a very practical way,’ co-operation for the mutual benefit of Morocco and the EU,” Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. In February, a Frontex report said that the number of irregular migrant departures from Morocco had ‘increased fivefold.”  “Most of the migrants taking this route last year came from sub-Saharan countries, but the number of Moroccan nationals also increased significantly,” added Frontex. The report also acknowledged the pressure faced by both Morocco and Spain due to irregular migration. “The Western Mediterranean became the most frequently used route into Europe. The pressure on Spain has been rising over recent years, and the number of detections in 2018 reached 57,  034, double the number from 2017.” The Moroccan government announced in May that Morocco’s security services have thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, compared to 88,761 of foiled attempts in 2018. The issue of irregular migration urged Morocco and Spain to strengthen their cooperation to fight the issue. Spain has been supportive of Morocco’s efforts on migration, calling on the European Union repeatedly to help the North African country in the Mediterranean. Earlier in June, the Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister, Josep Borrell, described the EU’s financial contribution to Rabat as  “insufficient.” “Spain urged the EU to support Morocco in facing the increased inflow of migrants, especially after the migration pressure shifted from the east to the west of the Mediterranean,”  he said during his visit to Morocco earlier this month. Borell made his statement during a joint press conference with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita.

Rabat – The number of Moroccan students enrolled at UK universities increased by 13% between the 2014/15 and 2017/18 school years.  The statistics were published by Studying-in-UK.org, a news and information site for the UK’s higher education system. The potential to gain global recognition, professional development, and more career prospects for the future are some possible explanations for the increase in Moroccan students studying in the UK, as cited by the study. Nearly two-thirds of Moroccan students are pursuing undergraduate degrees, while the rest take postgraduate courses. A large majority are studying business – the most common field for international students to pursue. Countries, where Moroccans make up a significant portion of the international students, are also seeing an increase in Moroccan enrollment.  In France, where Moroccan students account for over 40% of international students, there was a 17% increase from 2011-2016 to 2016-2017. Morocco’s 690 students studying in the UK, the world’s second most popular destination for international students, still make up less than 1% of the country’s total international students. Education authorities hope to further increase international enrollment by 30% in the near future, potentially opening the doors to greater numbers of Moroccan students.

Rabat – The 14th session of the European Union-Morocco Association Council will be held on Thursday, June 27, 2019 in Brussels, as stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.  The meeting will be co-chaired by Moroccan Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Minister, Nasser Bourita, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. Bourita will lead the Moroccan delegation. According to the Ministry, the session will be an opportunity to confirm the renewed impetus of the multidimensional partnership between Morocco and the EU, and give it a fresh boost In 2018, the EU decided to support Morocco by announcing the inauguration of a three-part project worth a total of €190 million, to improve the nation’s governance, expand its regional development, and empower its youth. Although Morocco adopted a new Constitution in 2011, its reforms have not fully materialized and the North African country struggles to coordinate its national policies with its commitments to the international community.  “The European Union is ready to support Morocco and its national priorities in this context,” said Mogherini in January 2019.“ “I am convinced that the coming months will be an exceptional opportunity for us to open an even more productive and intense chapter of cooperation between the European Union and Morocco.” Earlier this month, experts from the UK and EU met in Skhirat, Morocco to prepare for the upcoming meetings and discuss the relations between the two parties. An informal session in this regard was also attended by Bourita and his Spanish counterpart, Josep Borrell. In the upcoming meeting, the Association Council will discuss the reinvigoration of relations between the EU and Morocco by addressing the EU-Moroccan partnership’s priorities and themes for 2019-2020 and the future of the bilateral relations.  The discussion will include topics such as economic and trade relations as well as questions related to mobility and migration. Regional and international policy issues will also be debated by Mogherini and Bourita. Combating climate change and cooperation on environmental issues will be included on the discussion’s agenda, as will strengthening regional and Euro-African cooperation.

Rabat – An extremely graphic photo of a 23-month-old girl and a father lying face down in the Rio Grande, a river that runs through the US and Mexico, is circulating. The photo, which shows the girl still clinging onto her father, was taken by journalist Julia Le Duc and published by Mexican newspaper La Jornada. The man, identified as Oscar Alberto Martínez, was attempting to enter the US on Sunday, June 23, by crossing the Rio Grande and turned around to get his wife when his 23-month-old daughter, named Valeria, saw him swimming away and jumped after him. Julia Le Duc told the Mexican newspaper that father clung to the little girl after she jumped in, but a strong current swept them to their deaths. Martinez’s wife, who watched the whole devastating scene unfold, alerted authorities and a 12-hour search ensued to find the bodies. The family originally hailed from El Salvador and entered Mexico two months ago on a humanitarian visa. Reportedly frustrated by the wait time for immigration services to process the family’s case, they went to a point of entry on the easternmost part of the border to request asylum. Upon realizing the Mexican border office is closed on Sundays, the family then set out on foot along the river, until they reached the point where they tried to cross. Martinez’s sister told Salvadoran daily newspaper El Diario de Hoy that “they said they were scared of how the situation of migrants was unfolding, under Trump’s pressure. That is why they decided to cross.” Rosa Ramirez, the mother of Martinez, told the same newspaper that she had begged the family not to leave, but could not get them to “give up their hopes of the American dream.” Since becoming elected, US President Donald Trump has focused on deterring migrant crossings, increasing deportations and the level of migration to the US. As a result, it is now harder for asylum seekers to turn themselves in at ports of entry, pushing more migrants to take deadly risks and cross in more dangerous areas. US Border Patrol reported 283 migrant fatalities along the border in 2018, although the number may be higher. The photo has caused outrage both in the US internationally over the human suffering at borders. Democratic presidential candidates took to Twitter to denounce the situation, with candidate Kamala Harris calling the situation “inhumane.” “These families seeking asylum are often fleeing extreme violence,” she tweeted. “And what happens when they arrive? Trump says, ‘Go back to where you came from.’ That is inhumane. Children are dying. This is a stain on our moral conscience.” Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke tweeted: “Trump is responsible for these deaths.” “As his administration refuses to follow our laws — preventing refugees from presenting themselves for asylum at our ports of entry — they cause families to cross between ports, ensuring greater suffering &amp; death. At the expense of our humanity, not to the benefit of our safety,” O’Rourke continued. El Salvador is also mourning for the deceased father and daughter. El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele expressed sorrow for the deaths and has begun the procedure for repatriating the bodies. “Someday we will finish building a country where migrating will be an option, not an obligation,” Bukele said in a statement. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released a statement saying it was deeply shocked to see the “heart-breaking” photos of the two victims. UNHCR also pointed out the similarities between the photo of the father and daughter and a tragic photo that circulated in 2015. The photo showed the body of a 3-year-old Syrian boy, named Alan Kurdi, who drowned off the Greek island of Kos. The image defined the Syrian refugee crisis, shocked EU leaders, and led to increased concerns about the refugee crisis. “We are once again confronted with powerful visual evidence of people dying during their dangerous journeys across borders, ” the UNHCR said on Wednesday. One Twitter user dubbed Monday’s devastating photo the US’s Alan Kurdi moment and called for it to be put on the front page of every newspaper so the situation can no longer be ignored. This is America’s Alan Kurdi moment. Put this picture on the front page of every newspaper in America. https://t.co/ZBJwT8AjfD — Antonio De Loera (@AntonioDeLoeraB) June 25, 2019 Trump did not directly comment on the tragic incident, but he may have indirectly addressed the situation when on Tuesday he blamed Democrats for wanting “open borders” and tweeted that migrants were flocking to the US because of its good economy. Too bad the Dems in Congress won’t do anything at all about Border Security. They want Open Borders, which means crime. But we are getting it done, including building the Wall! More people than ever before are coming because the USA Economy is so good, the best in history. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2019

Rabat – The Egyptian Ministry of Interior has reported that ISIS members carried out several terror attacks, killing seven Egyptian policemen at different checkpoints, in the North Sinai city of Arish late on Tuesday, June 25. The ministry stated on Wednesday, June 26, that four terrorists have been killed, “including a suicide bomber who set off his explosives at once of the checkpoints attacked.” Police seized several explosive devices and hand-made bombs. Al Jazeera reported that ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. Security sources said that the terror attackers used “10 four-wheel drive vehicles in coordinated attacks at four sites. ” The country, which is hosting the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN), is now on high alert. None of the CAN 2019 football games, which kicked off on June 21, are planned in Sinai region. A month before CAN, Egyptian authorities dealt with a similar attack as a tourist bus was rocked by a roadside bomb near the pyramids of Giza. The attack, according to Al Jazeera, wounded 17 people, including South African tourists and Egyptians. For years, the Egyptian government has been fighting against extremists in northern Sinai. Attacks increased when the government removed former Egyptian President, the late Mohamed Morsi, who died on June 17 in a courtroom.

Rabat – With hundreds of years of culture and tradition behind them, Delgrés brought the sound of the West Indies to Rabat on Tuesday, June 25 with their Carribean blues-inspired performance. On the fifth day of the Mawazine, Delgrés brought the smooth flow of blues as well as the hypnotic energy of rock and soul music to the festival’s “Rhythms of the World Stage” on the banks of the river Bou Regreg. Energetic guitar riffs accompanied with hefty drum beats and tuba sounds has allowed the band to fuse together influences from a myriad of genres. From blues and rock to reggae and soul music, the band’s sound represents a melting pot of rhythms from around the world. However, despite the influences the band has adopted, it remains firmly dedicated to its Caribbean sound and origins, distinguishing it from other artists performing at this year’s Mawazine. This Carribean influence can be seen upon first look at the band’s name: Delgrés. Selected shortly following the release of their track “Mo Jodi” (I’ll Die Today), the band’s name is a reference to Louis Delgrés, who died after revolting against French Napoleonic troops attempting to reintroduce slavery to the West Indies. “The piece Mo Jodi (I’ll Die Today) pays tribute to his sacrifice. As a result, the figure of Louis Delgrès was ever-present as the band slowly matured, to the extent that it seemed obvious they should take on his name,” said Pascal Danaë, the band’s lead singer. Meanwhile, the band’s use of the dobro guitar, accompanied by drums and brass instruments, helps to further entrench the Carribean vibes given off by their musical performances. Delgrés has routinely used their music to convey messages that are difficult to state with just words. Songs such as Mr. President, venting frustration with the world’s treatment of the marginalized, and Ramené Mwen, emphasizing feelings after rejection, help to creatively express many emotions collectively felt around the world. Whether or not every member of the audience could understand the band’s creolized French, the music’s message was universally understood and its emotional weight was universally felt by all in attendance.

Rabat – The Moroccan High Commission for Water and Forestry and the Fight Against Desertification plans to promote hunting tourism in Morocco, using it as a tool for rural development. According to Abderrahim Houmy, the Secretary General for the commission, hunting has real social-economic potential Approximately 3000 tourists per year currently come to hunt in Morocco and the commission wants to increase this number to 15,000 by 2024, Houmy stated at the annual Game Fair in Lamotte-Beuvron, France, held between June 14 and 16. For Chafik Jilali, the president of the Moroccan Royal Hunting Federation, Morocco is a prime destination for hunting tourism. “Morocco is very close to Europe. It already has accommodation infrastructure on par with that of Europe. We also have good transport networks, including airports in the south of the country for tourists wanting to hunt in that area,” he told Morocco World News. Diversity of game is also an asset. Hunting game includes wild boar, hare, rabbit, partridge, and water birds. The commission has set up hunting reserves across the country. To increase the amount of tourists engaging in the sport, a number of investments will have to be made, noted Houmy at the Game Fair. “Hunting is not just about the game, it’s also about accommodation, transport, culture, local produce, gastronomy…A real promotional effort must be made,” he added, as quoted by Moroccan newsource Media24. Around 80, 000 Moroccans also practice recreational hunting in Morocco, which generates over MAD 1.2 billion ($125.6 million) per year in revenue.  According to Houmy, a hunter spends on average MAD 15,000 ($1570) on the sport, taking into account transport, accommodation and other costs. The direct revenue from hunting permits and license taxes reached MAD 43.5 million (approximately $4.5 million) last year, up 4.5% from 2017. Houmy adds that hunting also plays an important role in rural employment. For the 2017/2018 season, hunting generated 995,000 days of permanent work and 213,000 days of temporary work according to the commission. Houmy was not available for further comment on the proposal. Morocco’s participation at the Game Fair was a step towards promoting hunting opportunities to an international audience, so opening up the sector. The Game Fair is the largest hunting trade show in France, bringing over 80,000 visitors. Morocco attended the event for the first time this year, as guest of honour. The Moroccan pavilion displayed information on the country’s game, gastronomy, and culture to attendees.

Rabat – The Royal Air Maroc (RAM) luggage handler’s strikes, which have plagued the airline since April 2019, caused further chaos on June 21, at the Mohammed V International airport in Casablanca.  Unwilling to wait, passengers invaded the staff-restricted area of the airport and even the tarmac to retrieve their luggage. RAM subcontracts the loading and unloading of checked luggage at the Mohammed V-Casablanca airport to General Private Interim (GPI).  GPI workers have been involved in a string of untimely and repetitive strikes over the past 3 months. The airline affirmed in a statement early June 2019 that the repetitive strikes have caused disruption of traffic at the Mohammed V-Casablanca airport. The handlers’ strike has tainted the image of Morocco’s leading airline, RAM. The company has responded to complaints by systematically pointing fingers at its subcontractor, although the airline ticket is a contract between the passenger and the company, not the luggage handlers. A GPI officer confirmed that “an agreement is in the process of being signed with the representatives of our employees so that the strike ends and that the peak season proceeds normally in terms of luggage delivery.” The current conflict possibly originates from the approaching end of the contract between GPI and RAM Handling, expected in September 30. The National Office of Airports (ONDA) launched earlier this month, an international call for proposals to companies willing to manage baggage handling in Moroccan airports. This handling market alone accounts for 75% of the handling of luggage in Moroccan airports. The remaining 25% is provided by two international companies that do not experience any strike action. GPI, on the one hand, aims to win this market of nearly 2,000 people (luggage transport, cleaning, security).  On the other hand, it faces a union whose representatives are pushing staff to multiple strikes in order to force their employer (GPI) to get better wages from their client (RAM Handling) under the new contract.

Rabat – The Peace and Security Council (PSC), the African Union’s foremost organ tasked with championing stability and peace across the continent, met in Skhirat, a coastal town between Rabat and Casablanca, on June 25-26. As part of the 12th PSC retreat of its kind, the 15 member states of the AU organ discussed the need for security reforms in line with the AU’s professed goals of pushing for an integrated continental security umbrella to deal with a variety of emerging challenges for the African continent. Mohcine Jazouli, Morocco’s Delegate Minister for African Cooperation took the opportunity of the PSC conclave in Morocco to recall the body’s institutional commitment to the spirit of the UN Security Council’s agenda on peace and stability in some of Africa’s crisis zones. Hinting at the ideology-based divergences that have often characterized—and limited—the PSC’s actions in resolving crises on the continent, Jazouli said that the body should move away from fueling internal disagreements. Instead, he pointed out, the body should invest more in the search for “practical impact.” Morocco, Jazouli noted, “is resolutely convinced” that making the PSC effective and successful requires an unwavering allegiance to “fundamental parameters without which all talks of reforms will simply be glimmers of hope with no real impact.” According to the Moroccan minister, key to the body’s success is a sense of commitment to the AU’s agenda and principles. Such a commitment, he explained, passes necessarily through the adoption of an action plan that is the reflection of the global aspirations of AU member states. This, Jazouli maintained, can only be achieved if PSC member states work in a participative, coherent, and integrated fashion with the rest of the AU. As far as Morocco is concerned, working in a concerted manner will prevent situations of deadlock and internal divergences that the continent has witnessed in some crisis situations. Being clear about the prerogatives of the PSC and its subservience to the AU Commission will help to “avoid contusion and unnecessary ambiguity.” In his closing statements, Jazouli was emphatic about the prominence of the UN’s agenda over the AU when it comes to some hot button security topics on the continent. The allusion was clearly meant as a reference to the Western Sahara question. In an unprecedented move in July of last year, the AU agreed to commit to the UN-led negotiations on Western Sahara. In subsequent declarations and decisions, the AU Commission said it would pledge total allegiance to the UN Security Council’s agenda on Western Sahara. This came despite the insistence in some AU quarters—mainly spearheaded by Algeria and South Africa—to let the AU set its own agenda on African matters. In spite of recent developments in the AU-UN joint front on Western Sahara, South Africa has continued to push for an agenda other than the one championed by the UN. In March, Pretoria laid bare its blunt dismissal of what it sees as an imposition of a foreign agenda on an African crisis. Defiantly oblivious to AU’s warnings against “pushing for a parallel agenda” in the Western Sahara dispute, Pretoria organized a “Western Sahara solidarity conference” on March 25-26. The conference, which was co-hosted by Namibia, also a champion of the “Sahrawi cause,” was set to reiterate the two countries’ “commitment to the struggle of the Sahrawi people.” “We want to emphasize that the solution to the question of Western Sahara should be based on the principle of self-determination and decolonization,” South Africa’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, said at the time. Most recently, South Africa’s UN representative took a jibe at the latest UN resolution on Western Sahara by decrying the document’s insistence on notions of compromise and feasibility. In Pretoria’s reckoning, any resolution route that leaves out “decolonization” and “self-determination” is un-African and a further proof of third parties’ projection of their will and agenda on the continent. For Morocco, South Africa acting in a somewhat self-entitled way, is letting its militant fervor cloud its senses of historical facts, political feasibility, and continental commitments. With both countries boasting substantial support for their positions—although Morocco seems to have a slight upper hand since its return to the AU in January 2017—it is difficult to say which party is really prevailing at the moment. But whatever the final play might be, that Jazouli felt compelled to remind participants at the recent PSC meeting of the spirit of the latest AU commitments to ensure an “effective, integrated, and coherent” continental take on the continent’s hottest crises was telling in its own right. It was the quintessential signal that despite the overwhelming consensus within the AU to “respect and accompany” the UN-led agenda, Western Sahara is set to remain a thorny question for the continent. And perhaps that was Jazouli’s point when he mentioned the “search for real impact” on the ground: It will take more than written commitments to broker the Western Sahara diplomatic stalemate.

Rabat – A new survey from BBC News Arabic and the Arab Barometer shows that more than 40 % of Moroccans dream of emigrating. The survey’s findings are the result of more than 25,0000 interviews in 11 countries from late 2018 and spring 2019. “In every place questioned, research suggested that at least one in five people were considering emigrating,” the survey said. The interviews found that those with the desire to leave their countries wanted to do so due to financial considerations. “Economic reasons were overwhelmingly cited as the driving factor,” the report said. In Morocco, the overall unemployment rate rose from 9.8% in the last quarter of 2019 to 10% in the first fiscal quarter. The survey shows that 64% of the people interviewed in Morocco said that they would emigrate to Europe, while 12% of them would go to North America if they could. The report adds that 5% want to emigrate to Gulf countries. The report’s findings back other statistics, which indicate that the majority of Moroccan young people would like to emigrate for better living conditions due to a lack of job opportunities. A recent report from Moroccan marketing agency Sunergia showed that four out of ten Moroccans would emigrate if they could. The study, which interviewed 10,000 people, revealed that women were more inclined toward emigration than men. Morocco has also been hit by the brain drain phenomenon as more than 600 engineers leave the country every year due to the lack of job opportunities. In addition to Morocco, the BBC and Arab Barometer research network covers other Arab countries where citizens welcome the possibility to leave their countries. Overall, the statistics found that at least 20% of those interviewed in all 11 countries wanted to emigrate, with an even higher number wanting to emigrate from countries including Sudan.  The survey reports that “in Sudan, this accounted for half the population.” In addition to emigration, the findings of the survey also indicate that a growing number of people across the Arab world are turning their backs on Islam. The report shows that close to 15% of Morrocans identify as not religious, an increase from under 5% in 2013. The decrease in religious identity paralleled a waning trust in religious leaders.  The survey shows that faith in religious leaders dropped considerably in Morocco, down from about 45% in 2012-2013 to 25% in the most recent survey.

Rabat – Anderson publicly announced her split from 33-year-old football star boyfriend Adil Rami on her Instagram account on Tuesday, June 25.  The 51-year-old model and actress accused her ex of leading a “double life,” and said the relationship had been a lie. Rami fired back on social media, denying that had he cheated on Anderson. “I don’t think I’ll recover easily from this,” Anderson said, commenting on her post.  Anderson first gained international fame after being chosen as Playmate of the Month for Playboy Magazine in February of 1990.  The Canadian-American actress was a popular cast member in the TV show Baywatch in the 1990s before going on to star in films including Barb Wire and Raw Justice. Born in Corsica to Moroccan parents, Adil Rami was courted by Morocco before the football player opted to play for France, the country of his birth. Rami was on the French Squad when they won the 2018 World Cup, but stayed on the bench throughout the tournament. Although Anderson and Rami began dating in 2017, the relationship did not go public until Anderson showed up to support Rami in person during France’s winning match against Belgium during the World Cup in July of 2018. Following the break-up Anderson unleashed a barrage of accusations against Rami on Instagram, alleging he had carried on a relationship with his former partner. The actress also claimied she suffered “physical and emotional torture,” providing a link to a domestic violence hotline in her post. Calling Rami a sociopath, Anderson said she had hired a bodyguard for protection and that she would “run for my life.” Rami responded on Instagram, using the same black and white photo of the couple Anderson used in her post. “A break is never easy,” he said. “As often in these situations, emotion can take over.”  Rami continued by denying Anderson’s accusation his of leading “a double life.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior and associated administrations are currently reviewing over 130,000 application forms for military service from Moroccan youth aged between 19 and 25 years of age. These forms include 13,000 applications by women. Administrations are also reviewing 30,000 exemption requests from candidates who submitted application forms but now wish to retract their applications. Despite these withdrawals, the number of applicants for military service far exceeds the annual quota, which the Ministry of Interior set at 10,000 this year, then increased to 15,000. The Ministry of Interior launched military service recruitment operations on April 9, with forms due by June 7. Under a law passed in February this year, 15,000 Moroccan youth received notifications for compulsory military service, requiring them to sign up through a new online portal.  Potential recruits were also able to submit exemption requests within 20 days of receiving notification of conscription, on the basis of health, family reasons, or study. Youth who did not receive compulsory service notifications but who nonetheless wished to enrol in the military were also able to sign up via the portal. The large number of applications, far exceeding conscription numbers, shows that Moroccan youth are interested in participating in military service.  During the year-long program, participants are paid on a monthly basis, between MAD 2,100 ($220.25) and MAD 1,050 ($110.13) depending on their rank. The military also covers housing, food and transport costs for the duration of training.

Rabat – A group of teenagers shouted with pride as their friend jumped into a Rabat swimming pool while on his bike. A video capturing the scene has gone viral. The footage shows a teenager jumping into the swimming pool with the bike as his friends spur him on with shouts of support. Recently inaugurated, the swimming pool is the largest in Morocco and among the widest pools in Africa.  The project, which was built in a space of 22 hectares, is part of the Rabat: the City of Lights, Capital of Culture project which aims to ensure sustainable development in the city. The video of the young man jumping into the pool has been met with backlash from many Moroccans on social media. The encouragement he received from his friend portrayed the reckless behavior as a heroic action. However, the pool was being used by several children and their parents making the jump a risky stunt. Reacting to the video, a Facebook user said that authorities should take the “necessary measures to stop such reckless behavior, otherwise we will find many people doing the same actions with no fear.”

Rabat – Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has responded disparagingly to new sanctions imposed on Iranian officials by US President Donald Trump. The new sanctions come partly as a response to a US drone being shot down last week. Trump said the measures will deny Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as his office, and those closely affiliated with him, access to key US financial resources and support. The US Treasury said it was also imposing sanctions on eight senior commanders of the IRGC’s navy, air force, and ground forces, including the head of an air force unit that the US said ordered the US drone to be shot down. “The supreme leader of Iran is one who ultimately is responsible for the hostile conduct of the regime. He’s respected within his country. His office oversees the regime’s most brutal instruments, including the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will also be targeted later this week, according to the US treasury. The Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did not take kindly to the sanctions, to say the least. In a speech broadcast live on Iranian state television on Tuesday, he called the sanctions “useless” as Khamenei has no assets abroad. “They said they want to confiscate the leader’s property. The leader owns a Hoseyniyyeh [prayer venue] and a simple house. Our leaders are not like the leaders of other countries who have billions of money on foreign accounts that you could appropriate,” Rouhani said of the sanctions. Rouhani said “the White House actions show it is mentally retarded,” calling them “outrageous and idiotic.” He also accused the US of lying about wanting to resume talks between the two countries. “You say you really want to hold talks with us, but at the same time you’re saying that you want to boycott and sanction our foreign minister, so you’re lying,” he said. Donald Trump explained the sanctions placed on Iranian officials as a response to “aggressive behavior from Iran.” Just last week, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming that it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. However, the US insisted the drone was flying over international waters. In response to the drone being shot down, Trump approved air strikes on Iran but called them off just minutes before the military action was meant to take place, on the morning of Friday, June 21. US planes and ships were already in position when Trump called off the attack, according to the White House. Trump’s motivation behind calling off the attack, or whether it will be carried out at a later date, remains unknown. Iran shooting down the drone and Trump’s planned military action was just the most recent events in tensions that have been escalating for months. In May, things escalated further when Washington ordered all countries halt imports of Iranian oil. In response the US’ call for a boycott, Iran pulled out its international nuclear agreements on May 8, as well as giving Europe, China and Russia a two-month ultimatum to help Iran circumvent US sanctions and sell its oil or it would abandon two more commitments. Trump also accused Iran of being behind two sets of explosions that damaged six oil tankers in the Gulf region. Iran has denied the allegations. The US, in turn, announced that it is building a coalition with unnamed allies to protect Gulf shipping lanes.

Rabat – On the fourth day of the festival, Mawazine’s Bouregreg stage experienced a taste of West African music with the performance of Les Amazones d’Afrique, a band made up of artists from a myriad of countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Playing unconventional instruments and complemented by the singers’ combined vocal talents, Les Amazones d’Afrique gave a uniquely mesmerizing and calming performance just beside the equally calm river Bou Regreg. Les Amazones d’Afrique formed in Mali in 2015 as a world music supergroup composed of members from several West African countries, including Mali, Benin, Nigeria, and Gabon. Fusing traditional folk and ethnic music with Western popular music, the band has managed to produce a unique blend of old and new with their songs. The group quickly gained popularity following the release of their first song, titled “I Play the Kora.” In the track, the band encourages women to “rise up and fight injustice because we’re all equal.” In addition to the empowerment of women with the song’s lyrics, all profits from the track were donated to The Panzi Foundation, an organization focused on providing support to tens of thousands of women, the majority of whom are victims of sexual violence. Symbolic of the band’s dedication to women’s rights is its use of the kora instrument in their music. Women were historically prohibited from playing the kora, an instrument originally from West Africa; however, by bringing the instrument into their music, the band further pushes their message of equality and women’s liberation. Despite the empowering nature of the band’s lyrics, throughout the crowd, a wave of peace and tranquility swept during the performance, with the band’s soothing instrumentals and vocals leaving the audience calm yet enthusiastic. With other Mawazine stages such as OLM SOUISSI and The Mohammed V National Theater giving the spotlight to modern and energetic music, the Bouregreg stage maintains its toned down atmosphere and has become the hub for lovers of world music and positive vibes.

Rabat – Known for being a well-liked and respected member of the team, Nordin Amrabat is sometimes called “El Mahgreb,” referencing his attachment to Morocco and capturing his popularity among Atlas Lion fans. Amrabat has impressed fans with his determination to play, despite injuries that might take other players off the field. They praised his performance in Morocco’s match against Portugal, where he took to the pitch despite having suffered a concussion in an earlier match against Iran, during the 2018 World Cup in Russia.  While the decision to allow him to play drew criticism from FIFA, it earned him the title of “warrior” from fans. The 32-year-old right-winger has been playing football since he was young, occasionally taking on positions as left-winger or center-forward. Amrabat was born in the Netherlands to Moroccan parents and started out playing in amateur leagues within Europe. It was Amrabat’s father who encouraged him to keep up with the sport, though Amrabat himself assumed he would stay in the amateur league and pursue a career outside of football. He eventually joined PSV Eindhoven, who were champions of the Dutch football league at the time, and has since played for numerous clubs such as Tukey’s Kayserispor and England’s Watford. In 2018 he signed a three-year contract with Saudi Arabia’s club team, Al-Nasr Riyadh. Amrabat made his debut with the Atlas Lions in Marrakech’s LG CUP in 2011. He scored his first goal for the team in their last match and was elected “man of the match.” He later went on to play in the Africa National Cup (CAN) in 2012 and 2013. Despite concern that a knee injury earlier this spring would prevent his participation, Amrabat has been on the field throughout CAN 2019. The Atlas Lions’ next match is Friday, June 28, when they take on the Ivory Coast Elephants.

Rabat – Born and raised in a poor family in Casablanca, among his ten siblings, Nabil Dirar had a harsh childhood which made him a fighter from a young age. “A lion never dies,” Dirar has said referring to his recovery from a severe injury in 2018. Professional Career Having expressed his dislike for school early in his life, Dirar moved to Belgium as a teen to begin his football career with Belgian football clubs RWD Molenbeek and Saint-Gilloise. Dirar then transferred to Diegem Sport, still in Belgium, which placed him in the limelight as his performances drew the attention of various clubs, including Westerlo which signed him in 2006 which officially began his professional career. Throughout his two-seasons with the Belgian football club Westerlo, Dirar suffered injuries which restricted his appearances with the club, but he still managed to attract interest from other clubs and ended up joining Club Brugge with a five-year contract in 2008. After staying with the team for four seasons, Dirar decided to move away from Club Brugge which signaled the beginning of his international career The Association Sportive de Monaco football club, AS Monaco, made a bid for him and Dirar joined the Ligue 2 side in 2012. The €7.5 million was the highest transfer fee ever received by Club Brugge. Dirar stated that leaving Club Brugge for AS Monaco was an offer he could not decline, though he made an apology to the team’s then manager Christoph Daum. In May 2017 Dirar decided to leave AS Monaco, seeking a new adventure on his international career path. Despite rumors sparking last year about his departure to France’s Toulouse or Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal, Nabil still remains with Turkey’s Fenerbahçe today. “Nabil Dirar is still under contract with Fenerbahçe. He is focused on this season with his club,” said Fouad Ben Kouider, his agent. Playing for the Atlas Lions Dirar’s Belgian and Moroccan citizenships make him eligible to play for both national teams. The winger initially decided to play for the Belgian national football team back in the 00s and repeatedly declined Morocco’s offers, until finally joining the team for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification against Mauritania in 2008. His international career was then in doubt after he was left out of the national team’s squad. Dirar later revealed that he was not getting along with the team’s then manager, Roger Lemerre, reporting that he was “treated like a dog”. In 2012, Dirar was welcomed back to the team and was invited to the Africa Cup of Nations; an offer he declined thinking that he would once again not be included in the national team squad. While at AS Monaco Dirar became a father when his wife gave birth to their daughter, Layana, which led him to cancel his international commitment for Morocco. Dirar made his official Morocco national team come-back in March 2015, where he played as a right–back in the team’s loss against Uruguay. Today, he plays for the Moroccan national team and has stated that he considers himself more Moroccan than Belgian. Dirar’s history of injuries caused Moroccan fans to worry about his most recent injury which caused him to take a break from training just 10 days before the beginning of the African Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019 tournament. Head coach, Herve Renard, has allayed fears saying “Nabil Dirar had a small calf alert and there is no point taking unnecessary risk.” Dirar’s injury did not hold him back and he played in Morocco’s opening game against Namibia in the CAN tournament, with the Atlas Lions clinching a win in the final 45 seconds.

Rabat – The United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP) said that  Saudi Arabia sent 350 tonnes of dates to Sahrawis living in the Tindouf camps during the month of Ramadan 2019. The statement said that Saudi Arabia’s dates donation was worth $ 725,000. WFP announced that each refugee received two kilograms of dates. “Over the last few years, Saudi Arabia has been keen to donate dates distributed to Sahrawi refugees in [Tindouf] camps in Algeria,” said WEP. The report added that the Saudi contribution was “officially presented during the ceremony held at the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Algiers in the presence of Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to Algeria Abdulaziz bin Ibrahim Hamad Al Omairini.” WFP expressed gratitude to King Salman and the Saudi people for their “generous contributions.” The statement added that dates are important, especially during Ramadan. “Saudi Arabia, is one of the most significant donors to WFP in Algeria, contributing about $ 5.7 million since 2010. Since 2008, Saudi Arabia has contributed more than $ 1.5 billion to support WFP operations around the world,” added the statement. Embezzlement of humanitarian aid  In the 2018 report on Western Sahara, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the lack of progress in the political process to end the conflict as well as “persistent difficulties, such as malnutrition, brought about by the steady reductions in humanitarian aid” were both contributing factors to the poor conditions in the Tindouf camps. In the sixth section of the report, the UN chief warned that “malnutrition and anaemia prevalence remained public health concerns.”   What the UN report failed to mention is that the Tindouf camps have witnessed  several food embezzlement scandals. In 2014, the European Anti-Fraud Committee, known as OLAF published a report in which it detailed how Algerian officials and the Polisario leadership have embezzled the humanitarian aid intended for the Tindouf camps for the past four decades.  Earlier in 2019, The president of the Canary Sahrawi Forum, Miguel Angel Ortiz,  wrote an opinion piece published by La Provincia to condemn what he called Polisario’s embezzlement of aid and corruption. The  author said that a new scandal broke within the Tindouf camps following the misappropriation of some €2.5 million of humanitarian aid from the international community for Sahrawis living in Tindouf camps.

Rabat – The Collective Retirement Benefit Scheme (RCAR) announced the acquisition of 16,229,447 shares from the Moroccan telecommunications company, Maroc Telecom. RCAR announced the acquisition on June 17, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. RCAR exceeded the threshold of 5% stake in Maroc Telecom. The buyer, managed by Morocco’s Caisse de Depot and Gestion (CDG), now owns 51,060,810 shares (5.81%)  in the operator’s capital. RCAR also plans to continue to purchase more shares within a year of meeting the threshold. Morocco’s government has been looking for local investors to buy shares from the company since the sale of 8 % of the company’s shares would inject MAD 8.87 billion in the government’s budget. The government’s ownership would drop to 22% from 33 % following the sale of 8 % of the shares. The company is one of the most influential communication firms as it owns subsidiaries in a number of African countries, including the  Central African Republic, Niger, and Mali. The sale is part of Morocco’s privatization program to slash the budget deficit by 0.6 %. Morocco’s government also seeks to sell their holdings in La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech as well as the Tahaddart power plant in northern Morocco.

Rabat – A 24-year-old Moroccan accused of fraud, scams, and sexual blackmail via social networks stood trial in the Court of First Instance ofEl Jadida, Morocco on Monday June 24. The young man was able to successfully entrap more than 500 victims, mostly foreigners. “The young man’s trick was to film his victims in indecent positions via webcam and video calls, before blackmailing them,” according to Assabah newspaper. The accused, who was arrested Saturday June 22 by the judicial police of El Jadida, was targeting foreigners from the Gulf, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and other countries such as Italy, Great Britain, and Hong Kong. Although based in El Jadida, he gave addresses located in Oued Zem to collect the money transfers from his victims. The blackmail victims paid out of fear of seeing their sexual videos published on social media. The accused was able to collect more than MAD 1 million. His trick was to play “a wise girl” who  “collected information about the victim, before reaching eroticism.”  More than 500 compromising videos of his victims were allegedly found on his computer, which was seized on the day of his arrest.  The police carried out the arrest after a Gulf businessman had learned that one of his friends in Saudi Arabia had been blackmailed by a young Moroccan.  Once the complaint was filed, the police were able to locate the scamer’s point of access to the web in Oued Zem, specifically in the neighbourhood Lokréa where they carried out the arrest.

Rabat – The feature documentary Amussu, about an Amazigh (Berber) resistance movement against a silver mine in Morocco, has won the “Nouzha Drissi Grand Prix” at the 11th Agadir International Documentary Film Festival (FIDADOC). Amassu, by director Nadir Bouhmouch, tells the story of a protest by the villagers of Imider, a remote Amazigh village in south-east Morocco, against the exploitation of water resources by the mining giant Managem. It was filmed in 2016, five years after the protests first began. Yesterday, Bouhmouch expressed his gratitude for the prize. He added however that the award “can never replace [his] real objective: to defend the environmental and social rights of the community, to push for concrete change, to expose Managem corporation and force it to accept the demands of Amussu, and ultimately […] to challenge capitalism and the state everywhere.” As part of its silver mining operations, Managem was siphoning groundwater, drying out crops and almond groves, and polluting drinking water with cyanide. Despite promises from Managem that the mine would bring economic growth to the community, few of the Imider villagers were employed by Managem and the area remained one of the poorest regions in Morocco. In 2011, the villagers decided to occupy a major pipeline to the mine, shutting off Managem’s water supply in protest for their right to water, land, and economic opportunities. This marked the start of a six year sit-in. “Amussu” was filmed in Tamazight (Berber) language, and adds to a small, but growing body of Amazigh cinema. Bouhmouch created the film in collaboration with the Imider community, who wrote the screenplay and produced the documentary. The film was applauded by a near full house at the FIDADOC screening in Agadir on June 20. Villagers from Imider attended the event, answering questions about the film and the protest movement. Members of the audience, in solidarity for Imider community’s fight for their rights, stood up and shared the hand gesture of Amazigh identity, raising their hands and forming the number “3” with their fingers.

Rabat – Mohamed Ould Ghazouani has won 52 % of the vote in Mauritania’s presidential election.  The president-elect was born into a Sufi family in the central Mauritanian town of Boumdeid. After he reached adulthood in the 1970s, Ghazouani volunteered in the military. His postings included commander of the Armored Corps and head of the Homeland Security Department. Ghazouani participated in multiple coups during his time in the military. In 2008, he and outgoing president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz participated in the coup that overthrew Mauritania’s first democratically elected civilian president, Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallah. After the coup, Abdel Aziz resigned from the military establishment in favor of launching presidential bids.  In 2012, Ghazouni was promoted to Lieutenant General by Abdel Aziz, who won the presidency in 2009. A year later, Ghazouni became the military chief of staff. Abdel Aziz was re-elected president in 2014 after his first five-year term.   Ghazouni became Mauritania’s defense minister in October 2018 but soon left the government to pursue his presidential campaign. His presidential platform included promises to create a calm political climate, build strong state institutions, and fight corruption.  His victory comes as no surprise in Mauritania, where he holds the favor of the former head of state.   The outgoing president considers Ghazouani as representing a future of “security, development, and progress.”  Conversely, the opposition threatens “a return to insecurity, bad management and corruption where there is hate, racism, and destruction of national unity,” according to Abdel Aziz.  In the early morning of June 23, a confident Ghazouani declared himself the winner of the election to Abdel Aziz, his supporters, and journalists. The official results were announced later that day, with Ghazouani receiving a clear majority of the votes. The Independent National Electoral Commission listed voter turnout at 62.66 %.  Meanwhile, opposition candidates are rejecting the outcome of the election.  Third-place candidate Mohamed Ould Boubacar has vowed to use “every legal means” to challenge the results, which were apparently preceded by “worrying signs” of fraudulence.  Second-place candidate, and anti-slavery campaigner, Biram Dah Abeid has called on the Mauritanian people “to resist, within the bounds of the law, this umpteenth coup d’etat against the will of the people.”  Mauritania’s politics have long been ravaged by coup d’etats, and Ghazouani’s win represents the country’s first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected president to another.

Rabat – The World Bank announced, on June 20, its MAD 500 billion program in support of Morocco’s 2015–2030 Education Reform. The program aims to act on key elements of the vision to drive the sector’s transformation and boost human capital for every Moroccan child. The Reform has been written into legislation for new framework laws in the education system. The funding comes as the submission of the framework law advocating the introduction of foreign languages ​​into the teaching of science subjects has divided parliamentarians, even within the majority. Although validated by the Strategic Vision, developed by the Higher Council of Education, the framework law remains controversial. Despite the support of other parties for the new framework law, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) remained opinionated and a “strong defender” of teaching these subjects in Arabic just like Al Istiqlal party. In March 2019, the parliamentary groups had found a consensus on the article related to teaching scientific and technical subjects in foreign languages.  The article aims to avoid the linguistic break between high school and higher education by adopting the same language for both levels.  The situation fell back to ground zero soon after. The reason was a video posted online the day before the meeting of the Commission, in which Abdelilah Benkirane, the previous head of government, calls the deputies of the PJD to vote against the draft law. Despite the controversy, the government agreed to obtain funding of MAD 500 billion from the World Bank in order to carry out the strategic vision of the framework law and to support the 2015–2030 Education Reform. The Education Reform aims to emphasize the importance of education, training qualified teachers, creating new standards for those who wish to work in the sector, as well as securing employment through vocational training. “The education sector represents 6.4% of Morocco’s gross domestic product, an essential tool for strengthening human capital in the country,” the Bank noted. “In less than 20 years, the country achieved universal access to education for girls and boys, a notable MDG achievement. However, learning outcomes have remained stubbornly modest.” The fund appears to allow the implementation of the requirements of the framework law without voting for it. The fund will specifically help implement the part related to access to the public education system and the promotion of language teaching.

Rabat – Wedding contracts have long been used by Saudi women to protect their rights after marriage. These contracts are traditionally used to guarantee new brides the right to continue their studies, work, or own property. However since the ban on female drivers was lifted in June of 2018, women have been using their marriage contracts to enshrine their right to drive. The new trend has emboldened Saudi brides and their contracts have been making a stir on social media. One groom told Agence France Press (AFP) that his bride, a member of his extended family in the eastern Al-Ahsa city, had used the contract to make him give up smoking. Another case, which went viral on social media, was that of a woman who posted her contract on the internet. The contract prohibited her husband from taking a second wife, since Islam allows men to marry up to four wives. The soon to be husband was met with significant backlash online for accepting the conditions. Cases shared on social media have seen brides stipulating that they will not share their salaries with their husbands and even specify that they want to wait to get pregnant. The contracts stipulate that breaking these conditions is grounds for divorce. Many husbands are supportive of their brides stipulations, citing their right to independence. Majd, a 29 year old man from Saudi Arabia told Gulf News “She said she (would) like to be independent,” “I replied: ‘sure, why not?'” said the groom, who asked for his family name to be kept out of the press for privacy. Men have also begun to take part in manipulating these contracts with conditions that the “wife will never work,” or that she must agree to live with his mother, senior cleric Adel al-Kalbani told AFP. The contracts are serving as a catalyst to grant women more rights. These new strides towards women’s independence may seem groundbreaking, but they might also serve as a hindrance to traditional marriages in a society where conditions are deemed an insult or lack of trust for one’s husband. “In the past, society did not listen to women. Husbands would turn around and firmly say ‘No’,” Said senior wedding cleric Abdulmohsen Al-Ajemi told Gulf News. “But now they are listening to the aspirations of women.”
So far there are no official statistics regarding the marriage contracts.

Rabat – A recent video showing a mob of young Egyptians harassing female Moroccan fans has gone viral. The video was taken in front of the Al Salam stadium after the victory of the Moroccan Lions game against Namibia on Monday, June 24. The video shows the mob of Egyptian men following the Moroccan women who were in Egypt to support their national team.  The mob included between a dozen and 20 men who surrounded the women and followed them. In the video, one of the harassers sarcastically asks the others: “guys, have you never seen red before?” referring to the women’s red shirts (the Moroccan national team’s color). He then added, with the same sarcasm, “enough guys, that’s enough”, jokingly asking the others to leave the women alone.

Rabat, Morocco – Italian construction company Impresa Pizzarotti &amp; CSpA, which won the contract for the construction of a road tunnel in Morocco, has entered into a dispute with state-run Bouregreg Valley Development Agency (AABV).  The road tunnel construction, over a twin tunnel connecting a coastal entry and the historical centre of Rabat, was initiated in 2007 and completed in 2010.  Pizzarotti claims that AABV has failed to pay for the cost of construction and the penalties for the delayed payment. The Italian company is suing AABV for €50 million.  Despite the case going to the Moccocan Supreme Court, the end result has failed to satisfy Pizzarotti.  According to Pizzarotti’s complaint, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) claims that Morocco has breached the 1990 Italy-Morocco bilateral investment treaty provisions. This includes the fair and equitable treatment (FET) and expropriation standards.  Pizzarotti also alleges that the Moroccan court’s response is a failure of justice.  AABV has not appointed specific council to counter this dispute with Impresa Pizzarotti &amp; C, but rather has been coordinating with several counsels at the same time in order to counter the dispute with Pizzarotti along with other issues at ICSID.

Rabat – The Moroccan Secretary of State to the Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Sustainable Development, Nezha El Ouafi, released the annual national report on the cleanliness levels of Moroccan beaches, at a press conference in Rabat on June 24. The report reveals the results of tests at 451 coastal resorts, across 169 beaches throughout Morocco. It identifies whether they meet Moroccan standards of water quality, and compliance with norms set by the Ministry for Environment in relation to bacterial and fecal content in seawater. The report finds 98.3% of the resorts evaluated comply with water quality norms. The major beach destinations of Agadir, Imsouane, and Essaouira all meet the standards, as does the Ain Diab beach of Casablanca. The report identifies the cleanest beaches in the country, those with the international “Blue Flag” award. This year, the international Foundation of Environmental Education awarded the “Blue Flag” to 21 Moroccan beaches, including Sidi Ifni, Essaouira, Safi, Bouznika, and Skhirat, for cleanliness and sustainability. At the press conference, El Ouafi noted that the Blue Flag awards “represent the international recognition of the considerable efforts made by the stakeholders of Moroccan beaches.” The report also finds seven resorts in Morocco do not meet the standards for safe swimming. These resorts are located at the beaches of Oued Merzeg, 25km south of Casablanca, Ain Atiq beach, near Temara south of Rabat, and Jbila III near Assilah, in the north of Morocco. The beaches do not conform with norms due to water contamination or due to the high recorded number of swimmers in comparison to the toilet infrastructure in the area. The report recommends that Moroccan communes set up more sanitary infrastructure along all beaches, including toilet blocks, showers, and rubbish bins. The report is published annually by the Ministry for the Environment. As noted by El Ouafi at the press conference on Monday, the results are a tool to encourage citizens and stakeholders to continue with their efforts to improve seawater quality, through the installation of appropriate infrastructure along beaches.

Rabat – The leaders of the European Union (EU) failed to reach an agreement and commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at a European Council summit on Thursday, June 21. Even though a measly eight countries out of 28 committed to the target at the last summit in March, global protests worldwide advocating for the environment raised hopes that the number would increase. For the deal to have passed, member states needed to all agree in complete unity, but four countries- Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Hungary – blocked the proposal, meaning the 2050 goal was not included in the EU’s strategic agenda for 2019-2024. The four countries reportedly blocked the proposal for fear it would hurt their economies, which depend on nuclear power and coal. “Poland … must first have very detailed compensation packages. We must know how much we can get for modernization,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters in Brussels following the summit. The proposed deal would have seen the EU commit to a net zero carbon footprint by 2050 by either reducing emissions from transport, homes, and industrial or other economic activity, or offsetting emissions with projects aimed at soaking up CO2. Although the EU dropped the 2050 goal, the 28 member states reinforced their commitment to the 2016 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT), most governments are not taking enough action to meet the target. Morocco is one of only two countries on track, with the Gambia being the second. The council also pledged to “scale up the mobilization of international climate finance from a wide variety of private and public sources and to working towards a timely, well-managed and successful replenishment process for the Green Climate Fund.” The EU Council’s failure to strike a deal comes amid worldwide marches advocating for global change in order to prevent climate change. In March, Youth for Climate called for students in over 100 countries to go on “strike,” leaving their school desks behind to instead take to the streets. Tens of thousands of students worldwide participated.

Rabat – While studies suggest Islam is the fastest growing religion on the planet, a recent survey released by the BBC Arabic showed religion has declined throughout the Arab world. Currently 18% identify as “not religious”, compared to 11% in 2013.  The report, conducted for the BBC by the research group Arab Barometer, was the largest and most in-depth survey undertaken of the Middle East and North Africa. Over 25,000 people were interviewed from 11 Arab countries, including Morocco, Algeria, Sudan, Yemen, and Lebanon.  With the exception of Yemen, every country surveyed showed a decline in faith. The North African countries of Tunisia, Libya, and Morocco showed the largest shift away from religion. Currently close to 15% of Morrocans identify as not religious, an increase from under 5% in 2013. The decline in religious identity paralleled a waning trust in trust religious leaders.  In Morocco, faith in religious leaders dropped considerably, down from about 45% in 2012-2013 to 25% in the most recent survey. Trust in religious leaders for fellow North Africans living in war-torn Libya is almost non-existent, polling at below 10%.  The most dramatic decline was further to the east in Iraq, whose trust rate hovers just over 10%. This was a drop of almost 30% since 2012-2013. Again the outlier, Yemen, showed an increase in trust of its religious leaders. Currently in the grip of the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet, the Gulf state’s trust inched up from 36% to 38%.  Distrust of political leaders The survey also showed that the Arab world held a general distrust toward international political leaders. President Donald Trump fared the worst among the world leaders covered in the survey. Only 12% of participants expressed a positive view towards Trump. This number was close to 0% in Morocco. Overall, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fared better in the Arab world at 28% and 51% respectively. 

About a quarter of the countries in the survey, including Lebanon and Egypt, showed a preference toward Putin over Erdogan. None of the 11 countries favored Trump. The view of who can be a leader was also shifting. Ranking second only to Lebanon, the survey showed almost 75% of Morrocans said a female president or prime minister was acceptable.  Homosexuality remains largely taboo in the Arab world. Morocco was more accepting of homosexuals than most of its neighbors with 21% of Morrocans saying homosexuality was acceptable.  In Algeria, the most tolerant country surveyed, 26% of the population tolerated homosexuals. On the low end, just 5% of Palestinians found homosexuality acceptable.   Morrocans also ranked among the highest in desire to emigrate at 40%. While the majority of these Morrocans said they would head to Europe, others in the Arab world expressed a desire to migrate elsewhere. Participants from countries like Algeria and Jordan said they would move to the United States, while those from Sudan and Egypt would head to a country in the Gulf. The anonymous interviews took place in private spaces, with randomly selected participants from both urban and rural areas. Arab Barometer, who has conducted the survey since 2006, developed its methodology to represent communities fairly in the data.

Rabat – With the US-sponsored economic forum in Manama, Bahrain set to begintoday, tens of thousands of Moroccans have taken to the streets across the country in protest against the so-called “Manama betrayal conference.” On Sunday, May 23, Moroccan intifadists marched from the gates of Rabat’s medina to the square in front of the Parliament building. As Palestinian and Moroccan flags flew side-by-side above demonstrators, chants of solidarity with Palestine rang through the streets of the city. Trampling torn Israeli flags and brandishing signs condemning the occupation of Palestine, protestors demanded that the US end its ongoing interference in the Middle East, and that Israel end its dominion over the Palenstinian territories. Moreover, as protestors burned Israeli flags in collective opposition to the American vision for the MIddle East, shouts of “Death of Israel” and “Death to the United States” became deafening cries of Moroccans’ solidarity with the Palestinian people. With recent events such as White House adviser Jared Kushner’s suggestion that the US would be abandoning plans for a two-state solution, protests against Israel have consequently become protests against the United States.  This has become especially true following the reveal of Washington’s plan for achieving peace in the Middle East, with several protests over the last month being sparked from the announcement of the so-called “Deal of the Century.” Developed over the course of the last two years by the Washington administration, the Middle East Peace Plan has routinely been touted as a panacea for the complex issues currently facing the Middle East. However, the American dream of bringing peace to Middle East has been received as a nightmare by millions across the Arab world, who see the plan as a plot to further entrench the Israeli government as a regional influence, at the expense of the Palestinian people. The first stage of the so-called “Deal of the Century,” an upcoming economic forum in Manama, continues to be at the center of this controversy, over a month after initial plans for the forum were revealed in May. In an attempt to rally support for the plan and reduce opposition to the conference, Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of American President Donald Trump, visited several Arab countries last month, including Morocco. Despite this, the Arab World remains firmly opposed to the forum, with reactionary protests against the Bahraini conference continuing to increase in both severity and frequency with each passing day. Condemning the proposed plan, as a “consecration” of Palestinian suffering, the Palestinian Authority vowed to boycott the forum, and encouraged other nations to follow suit. “The US ‘deal of the century’ is the consecration of our century-old ordeal: no independence, no sovereignty, no freedom, no justice,” said Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki. “And if they do not think that this situation will have an impact on the future of Israel and the region, one way or the other, they are the ones that are delusional, not us.” Standing behind the Palestinian Authority, hundreds of thousands of Moroccans have rejected the plan, viewing the conference as an attempt from the West to undermine the territorial legitimacy of Palestine. United under the slogan “For Palestine, against the deal of shame, against the treachery workshop in Bahrain,” demonstrators from several of Morocco’s civil organizations voiced their solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for independence in the face of continued Israeli occupation. A “consecration” of Palestinian suffering It has been barely more than a month since Washington announced its long-awaited Middle East Peace Plan, spearheaded by American President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, on May 19. However, time has had little to no effect in raising support for the plan across the Arab World, which remains fervently opposed to the “Deal of the Century.” The first stage of the plan, beginning on June 25 with a forum in the Bahraini capital, is focused on improving the economic conditions in the Middle East. The conference is planned to promote investment and development in the West Bank and Gaza, funded by wealthier Gulf and Arab states. Despite a focus on improving the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh condemned the workshop, claiming that the Palestinian Authority had not been consulted during its planning. “The cabinet wasn’t consulted about the reported workshop, neither over the content, nor the outcome nor timing,” Shtayyeh said on Monday. The Palestinian Authority has also protested against the exclusively economic focus of the conference, arguing that the meeting is merely an attempt to have Palestinians sell their independence to Israel. “We will inform Bahrain that we will not take part in such a conference,” said Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian State President Mahmoud Abbas. “We will not sell our country based on an economic project.” As a result, the Palestinian Authority has refused to take part in the workshop, and has encouraged other Arab countries to follow suit and oppose the so-called “Deal of the Century.” “There will be no Palestinian participation in the Manama workshop,” said Ahmed Majdalani, Palestine’s Social Development Minister. “Any Palestinian who would take part would be nothing but a collaborator for the Americans and Israel.” Brotherhood with Palestine Although Morocco will reportedly be attending the conference, Moroccans continue to maintain strong, brotherly ties with the Palestinian people, which has driven thousands across the country to take issue with the government’s decision to participate in the forum. Last year, in response to Trump’s decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Morocco condemned America for its support of the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  In a letter to the American president, King Mohammed VI said: “The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all.” “The city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism,” he added. More recently, in May, Sheikh Muhammad Hussein, Jerusalem’s Grand Mufti, expressed his thanks to King Mohammed VI for his unyielding support for the Palestinian people and their struggle for independence. Morocco was also praised by Palestine earlier this year following a substantial donation from the king towards restoration work in the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock in East Jerusalem. With the brotherhood between Morocco and Palestine remaining among the strongest bonds in the Arab world, thousands of Moroccans will continue to oppose the US-Israeli “Deal of the Century,” so long as Palestine’s independence is not guaranteed as part of the plan. Meanwhile, as other so-called “Arab Traitor Regimes,” such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, plan to attend the conference, protestors remained adamant that every country in the Arab world stand with Palestine in opposition to the “Deal of the Century,” Morocco included. The self-styled “sons and daughters of the free Moroccan people” voiced their solidarity with the Palestine Authority in a statement condemning Israel and the so-called “Manama betrayal conference,” “We, the undersigned of the sons and daughters of the free Moroccan people, declare to the local and international public opinion our complete rejection of the terms of the Deal of the Century, and our boycotting of the Manama betrayal conference, which seeks to liquidate the Palestinian cause,” the statement read. The signatories also rejected “normalization with the racist Zionist entity” and called for Moroccans to “continue to defend the rights of the Palestinian people.” Concluding with “Long live free Palestine” and “Death to Israel, the enemy of the people, the warmonger,” the statement has sent an unignorable message to the world that Moroccans, in every corner of the country, continue to stand alongside the Palestinian people in their fight for independence.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has confirmed Morocco’s participation in the US-sponsored economic conference in Bahrain, which begins on Tuesday, June 25. The foreign ministry said on Monday that a member of the Moroccan Ministry of Economy and Finance will represent the country.  The statement also reiterated Morocco’s position on the Palestinian cause, emphasizing that the kingdom remains attached to the “two-state solution.” The confirmation of participation comes following several calls from Palestinian officials urgingArab states to boycott the symposium. Spokesperson of the Palestinian government, Ibrahim Melhem, said last week that his country rejects any proposal that opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Melhem also called on countries, including Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan to protest the conference. The three countries confirmed their participation, along with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Palestine has reaffirmed its  rejection of the event, stating that any Palestinian who chose to participate would be nothing but a “collaborator for the Americans and Israel.” Ahmed Majdalani, Palestine’s Social Development Minister said that “there will be no Palestinian participation in the Manama workshop.” On Sunday, June 21, in Rabat, thousands of Moroccans rallied against the conference to express solidarity with Palestinians. Protesters called on the Moroccan government to boycott the conference. Despite Morocco’s participation in the conference, Palestine considers Morocco as a key supporter as it has opposed several provocative moves from the US. In 2018, Morocco criticized the US support for the Israeli occupation of Palestine, with King Mohammed VI addressing letters to both US President Donald Trump and the United Nations to warn against any move that would threaten the status of Jerusalem. Following the US decision to move its embassy rom Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, King Mohammed VI said in a letter to Trump that “the city of al Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all.” “The city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism,”  the monarch said in the letter submitted in January 2018. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner will chair the forum, which seeks to “encourage” investment in Palestine as part of the US Peace Plan.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) has dismantled a four-member terrorist cell in Al Haouz, in a province in the Marrakech-Safi region. The extremist suspects, aged between 25 and 40 were arrested for their alleged links with ISIS. A statement from the BCIJ said that the arrests enabled the security services to monitor a farm in Ourika, 30 kilometers from Marrakech which is owned by one of the cell members. The cell used the farm to manufacture explosives. BCIJ announced that they seized several chemicals and suspicious liquids during the raid. BCIJ also seized electronic devices, knives, telescopes, and an unspecified amount of money. A preliminary investigation shows that the leader of the terror cell has forged “suspicious relations with active members in order to plan terror attacks in the kingdom using explosive devices.” The leader, according to the statement, recruited and trained the other members of the cell. The suspects are in police custody pending further investigation. The arrest comes a week after another BCIJ operation to crackdown on a five-member cell on June 18 in Tetouan, Northern Morocco. Investigations showed that the suspects had pledged allegiance to the self-styled “emir” of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The operations are part of Morocco’s strategy to counter terrorism.  Today’s operation is the third of its kind this month as the first took place on June 3, when BCIJ dismantled a three-member terrorist cell operating in several cities in the region of Draa-Tafilalet.

Rabat – In February 2019, Lebanese global waste management company Averda and French maintenance company Derichebourg won the tender to collect household waste in Casablanca.  On 25 June, the new seven year contracts for waste collection will come in to force, bringing about some key changes. Under the new agreement, the city of Casablanca will pay the two companies for waste collection on an annual basis, rather than per tonnage. This ensures the city can control the budget allocated to waste management.  From now on, waste collection in Casablanca will occur exclusively at night, between 10pm and 6am, preventing traffic congestion from garbage trucks, and facilitating the work of waste collectors. All waste collection and cleaning vehicles will be fitted with GPS devices, to track progress of work. Waste containers will be fitted with electronic chips, preventing theft. The contracts require the two companies to immediately clean any waste that falls onto the street from their vehicles. No waste must be left on the street after the vehicles have cleaned the area.  The contracts also require the companies to set up bins in public places, and to empty these bins on a regular basis. While the city of Casablanca is clearly making efforts to clean the streets, it has not yet resolved the issue of waste management.The waste currently goes to the infamous open air Mediouna landfill, where piles of rubbish up to 42 meters high are causing serious environmental and social problems for the area.

Rabat – Morocco’s House of Representatives adopted unanimously on Monday draft law 1419 approving the Morocco-EU fisheries deal. Morocco and the EU signed the agreement to renew the fisheries deal on January 14. In addition to adoption of the bill, the House of Representatives adopted the Protocol of Implementation of the Agreement and the Exchange of letters relating thereto. The “protocol, according to Maghreb Arab press (MAP), forms an integral part of the agreement signed between Rabat and the EU in Brussels. The exchange of letters relating to the agreement confirms that Morocco’s southern provinces in Western Sahara are an integral part of the kingdom.   MAP reported that both the EU and Morocco committed to developing sustainable finishing in the fishing zone on the basis of the principle of non-discrimination between the different fleets. The agreement also aims to set up the framework for legal, environmental, economic and social governance of fishing activities carried out by the EU fleets. The deal covers the fishing area from parallel 35 and Cap Spartel in northern Morocco to parallel 22 and Cap Blanc in southern Morocco, including the waters off Western Sahara. The agreement specifies the fishing areas and access conditions for EU vessels. It also increases the EU’s financial contribution from the previous agreement’s annual payment of €40.0 million to €52.2 million.

Rabat – Italian security services have arrested seven people suspected of smuggling more than 80 irregular migrants in the Mediterranean sea. The European Union’s border force, Frontex, released a video captured by a surveillance plane showing a fishing boat transferring a group of migrants to a smaller vessel in the Mediterranean sea. Frontex posted several tweets with the footage during the operation “Wait, wait. Why is that fishing trawler towing an empty wooden boat at high seas?” Frontex added that its plane and drone “kept observing the fishing trawler and the boat with migrants over several hours, alerting Italian and Maltese authorities.” The agency added that the operation was “clearly the case of a ‘mother boat’ used by criminals to carry a large group of migrants across the sea towards their destination before unloading them onto a smaller boat.” The vessel, according to Euro News,  was heading towards Italy, while the fishing boat attempted to return to Libya.   Italian security services, however, managed to arrest the crew in the fishing boat. Euro News added that the crew in the fishing boat left the migrants in the Mediterranean sea without water or “any other supplies.” Authorities rescued the migrants and took them to Lampedusa, an Island in the Mediterranean sea. The majority of the irregular migrants  rescued  reportedly came from Morocco, Libya, and Bangladesh. In recent years, significant numbers of migrants from North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa found themselves trapped in detention centers across Libya, following their illegal attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe By the end of  2017, the number of irregular migrants reached 700,000. Many Moroccans were among the irregular migrants trapped in Libya, with some of them calling for help from the Moroccan government. The migrants shared videos in 2017 and 2018, urging the government to bring them back home The Moroccan government has launched several repatriation programs to bring back the migrants stranded in Libya.

Rabat – The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has released statistics for the first five months of 2019, which show a decline in  crime rate in Fez. The statement from DGSN shows that police in the northern city of Fez tackled 12,967 criminal cases in the first five months of this year, 15% lower than in the same period of 2018 which saw 15,222 cases.

A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said that police arrested two suspects for their alleged involvement in a drug trafficking network. The suspects are aged 25 and 30. Police seized the cannabis, found in  sewage channels, in the rural district of Taghbalt after information provided from the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST).

Rabat – Egypt and Jordan have announced their decision to take part in the US sponsored economic conference, to be held in Manama, Bahrain this week. Delegations of high level officials from the US, Gulf countries, and the Middle East are expected to attend. Spokespersons from both governments confirmed that their countries will send delegations to attend the symposium from June 25-26. The US claims that the conference will serve as a workshop to boost the Palestinian economy. The event will also serve as a platform from which the US seeks to unveil the economic part of its Middle East peace plan, known as the Deal of the Century. Palestinians urged Arab states, including Morocco, Jordan, and Egypt to boycott the meeting, emphasizing that its government was not consulted. Ibrahim Melhem, a spokesman for the Palestinian government said: “The Palestinian Authority urges Egypt and Jordan not to attend the Bahrain conference.” “All brotherly and friendly countries to withdraw,” he said, adding that their participation “would carry wrong messages about the unity of the Arab position” on rejecting the US plan. Jordan and Egypt are the only Arab states to have signed a peace deal with Israel. Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman Sufyan al-Qudah said that his country will send the secretary general of its Finance Ministry to the event, emphasizing that Jordan refuses any economic proposal that might replace a political solution to end “the occupation” of Palestinian territories by Israel. On June 12, a White House official claimed that Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco had all confirmed their participation in the symposium. Morocco’s government has not, however, indicated whether the country will be sending a representative to the conference. Several other Arab states have already confirmed participation in the event, including Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. On Sunday, June 23, hundreds of Moroccans flocked to Rabat’s streets waving Palestine flags to protest against the deal of the century plan, urging the Moroccan government to not participate in the event.

Rabat – The US State Department released its 2018 report on religious freedom. The report cites Morocco’s efforts in promoting peace and interfaith dialogue between all citizens of the three Abrahamic religions. Coexistence and interfaith dialogue aim to promote tolerance among all religions for unity and prosperity. The report starts by outlining how the Moroccan constitution guarantees all citizens the freedom to “practice” their religious affairs. The report also explores the challenges that face religious minorities in the North African country whose constitution stipulates that Islam is the religion of the state. The US State Department quotes Christian citizens, community leaders, and activists who claimed that they face pressure from “non-Christian family and friends to convert to Islam or renounce their Christian faith.” Constitutionally, Morocco only recognizes Sunni Islam and Judaismas native religions. Moroccan law does not tolerate conversion to Christianity from Islam. The US religious freedom report emphasizes that Morocco’s law “penalizes anyone who ‘employs enticements to undermine the faith’ or convert a Muslim to another faith.” Conversion to  Christianity is criminalized within Moroccan law. Those charged face a sentence ranging between six months to three years in prison, in addition to fine of MAD 200 to 500 ($21 to $52). The law also  provides the right to try in court suspects accused of incitement to undermine someone’s faith.   “Voluntary conversion is not a crime under the law,” says the report, adding that the law “permits the government to expel summarily any noncitizen resident it determines to be ‘a threat to public order,’ and the government has used this clause on occasion to expel foreigners suspected of proselytizing.” Extremism, a red line The  report also explains Morocco’s efforts to counter extremism, recalling that the country issued textbooks aiming to fight extremism. “The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (MEIA) continued to guide and monitor the content of sermons in mosques, Islamic religious education, and the dissemination of Islamic religious material by broadcast media, actions it said were intended to combat violent extremism,” according to the report. A global and regional counterterrorism leader, Morocco has been involved in several international bodies to fight extremism and religion-based violence. Coexistence  Morocco has continued to prove its commitment towards peace and prosperity among all citizens of every faith. The US report recalls King Mohammed VI’s speeches  in which the monarch emphasized his approach of coexistence between all religions in Morocco. The State Department’s report highlights King Mohammed VI’s speech during the second International Conference on Intercultural and Interfaith Dialogue, held in Fez from September 10 to 12, 2018. “King Mohammed VI delivered remarks underscoring the tradition of coexistence in Morocco between Muslims and Jews and openness to other religions,” according to the report. “My country is sending a strong signal, reflecting its determination to set off a new dynamic – one that would enable us to pave the way, together, for innovative pathways to ensure respect for cultural and religious diversity as well as a common commitment to the virtues of dialogue and respect for others,” King Mohammed VI said in his speech. The US department reports that there are currently a significant number of Jews and Christians living in Morocco. The  report estimates that between 3,000 to 3,500  Jews live in Morocco, and between 2,000 and 6, 000 Christians are spread across the country. The Moroccan Association of Human Rights Report for 2017-2018, however estimates that there are 25,000 Christians across the country. The report also quotes Moroccan Shia Muslim leaders, emphasizing that there are an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 foreign-resident Shia from Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. Shia citizens claim that they face pressure from the government, according to the report. “Local Christian and Shia leaders reported the government detained and questioned some Christian and Shia citizens about their beliefs and contacts with other Christians and Shias.  Christian and Shia Muslim citizens also stated their fear of government and societal harassment led to their decision to practice their faiths discreetly.”  Morocco promotes interfaith dialogue The text recalls how the Moroccan government allows  Jewish and Christian schools, run by private institutions, the choice to either include or exclude Sunni Islam, or even to entirely exclude religious instruction. It also explains that private Jewish schools may teach Judaism. The report also comments on the signing of a cooperation in May 2018 between the Archives of Morocco and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) to facilitate the sharing of documentation on Jewish history in Morocco. The US Statement Department makes mention of King Mohammed VI’s message to the UN roundtable on the “Power of Education in Preventing Racism and Discrimination: The Case of Anti-Semitism” held on September 26, 2018. During the event, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani conveyed King Mohammed VI’s message to the participants, underscoring Morocco’s preservation of synagogues. “Anti-semitism is the antithesis of freedom of expression. It implies a denial of the other and is an admission of failure, inadequacy and an inability to coexist,” said King Mohammed VI.

Rabat – Algerian rapper Soolking has apologized to Moroccan fans for waving the flag of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) at a concert in Bilbao, Spain on Saturday June 22. A separatist fan handed him Polisario’s flag tied to the Algerian flag. In an attempt to apologize to his Moroccan fans, the rapper claimed that he thought that the flag was that of Palestine. Soolking waved the separatist flag while singing his latest song “La Liberté” (Freedom) . Ah bon @Soolking? Tu portes tous les drapeaux? S’ils t’avaient donné le drapeau israélien tu l’aurais porté aussi🤔?Le fait que tu portes le drapeau d’une entité séparatiste tu te mets d’ores et déjà dans un débat politique! Bien essayé mon frère mais fini les concerts au Maroc! pic.twitter.com/CcMrXPoO0t — Soufianovitch 🇲🇦 (@Morocco_4ever) June 22, 2019  “I am doing this video to explain the situation for Moroccans.  This concert in Bilbao where I sang was organized by a Moroccan.” “I was given a Moroccan flag, I raised it on stage. Look at the video carefully,” he said. Soolking said fans who attended his concert were from the Maghreb region, including Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians. In his apology tweet, Sookling claimed to have not recognized the Polisario flag, mistakenly thinking it was the Palestinian flag. The rapper said that someone handed him an “Algerian flag and a flag of Western Sahara, I took it without really looking while singing, because for me it was a Palestinian flag.” Sookling went on to say  that when he is handed a flag by an audience member, he cannot leave it on the ground. “I am obliged to raise it with all the flags.” The rapper also justified his move, emphasizing that he does not like politics. The move, however, did not go unnoticed as Moroccan fans took to social media to react. “If he had given you the Israeli flag, would you have taken it too? The fact that you are wearing the flag of a separatist entity is already putting you in a political debate!” one Twitter user said. “That’s how we thank people who welcomed you? We want you no more in our territory, you started to ruin the relationship between two peoples!” said another. The Polisario flag was also ‘mistakenly’ shown in the CAN 2019 official music video, CAN’s organising committee have since released an apology to Morocco.

Rabat – The Parliamentary Network held a one day conference on June 21 in the French Senate, inviting G7 parliamentarians and partner countries to discuss France’s priorities in anticipation of the upcoming G7 meeting to be held in August.   Moroccan Lahcen Haddad, a long-time member of Moroccan Parliament and vice-chair of the Parliamentary Network, used the conference as an opportunity to address global inequality and accountability. The Parliamentary Network on the World Bank &amp; the IMF is an independent NGO that aims to foster collaboration among legislators from around the world to address poverty – both in their home countries and abroad. They also advocate for increased transparency of international financial institutions.   The organization is open to all elected parliamentarians from World Bank member states. While participating in the Parliamentary Network, parliamentarians represent themselves and their constituents, not their countries’ governments. While the Parliamentary Network held its main conference in Washington earlier this spring, similar goals were discussed at the recent meeting in the French Senate. Development, good governance and accountability, and fighting inequality were high on the agenda. The conference was centered around France’s goals coming into the G7 meeting, with an emphasis on global inequalities, in addition to addressing how to align its national goals with G7 priorities. “The rise of inequalities is a serious threat to the cohesion of societies and economic development which benefits a large population. France places the reduction of inequalities and the social dimension of globalization at the heart of the debate. The promotion of such a model is a major political choice and will be the main concern of the French presidency of the G7,” Haddad said in a statement to Morocco World News. The conference also served as an opportunity to discuss uses for the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) fund, which is approaching its renewal for the next three years.  IDA funds are the largest source of financial resources and support for developing and impoverished countries and rely heavily on donations from G7 countries.  Haddad has been a member of Morocco’s parliament since 2011 and is a long-standing supporter of improving inequality through sustainable and accountable action.   He was recently elected vice president of the international governing council for the Society of International Development (SID), an international network focusing on development, policy, and governance. From 2012 until 2016, Haddad served as the Minister of Tourism and oversaw Morocco’s shift to becoming a leading tourist destination in the MENA region, specifically in sustainable tourism. Before joining the government, Haddad worked for USAID as an international expert in human and social development and has taught at universities both in Morocco and the US.

Rabat – The Trump presidency has largely been reproached for the hawkish and undiplomatic turn the US is taking in world affairs. Washington has especially been lambasted for its overt preference for a confrontational and threats-saturated approach in crises in the MENA region, instead of using alternative strategies to reach its goals without causing further havoc in a mostly troubled region. According to President Trump, however, America’s relationship with the World would have been far more concerning and tempestuous if John Bolton, his senior national security advisor, had the US administration grant him all his wishes. Speaking on Sunday, June 24, to Chuck Todd, the host of MNSBN’s Meet the Press broadcast, President Trump said that Bolton is “absolutely a hawk.” The subtext of Trump’s message, many have observers have since argued, is that the president’s perceived inclination towards bombastic threats—both verbal and military— which often confuse “enemies” and allies alike very much boils down to having John Bolton serving as his senior national security advisor. Escalating for immediate results The Bolton Effect, the argument goes, consists in preferring escalation in the search of immediate results rather than in investing in in-depth, time-consuming, and intricate diplomatic maneuvers. President Trump said, referring to the team of senior officials in his inner circles on foreign affairs: “I have two groups of people. I have doves and I have hawks. John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he’d take on the whole world at one time.” If Bolton had his way, Trump went on to argue when assessing the US’ role in the Middle East, the situation with challengers like Iran would have reached by now a far more serious juncture. The US would have already gone to war with Iran. But, Trump elaborated, there is no need to worry because he usually tempers Bolton’s fervor. Also, he added, “That doesn’t matter because I have both sides.” The idea is that by listening to “both sides” on a variety of foreign policy objectives, the president usually ends up not taking Bolton’s method of escalating and wrecking in order to reap immediate results. Writing on May 15 on the risk of a breakdown in the US-Iran crisis, the Guardian’s Owen Jones presented Bolton as the mastermind behind much of President Trump’s ill-conceived and ostensibly hawkish foreign policy moves. “The principal driving force behind this is Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, a man who thinks there is no problem to which the answer isn’t war,” Jones said. The ongoing crisis with Iran is not the only instance where observers took notice of the now infamous “Bolton Effect.” Ron Paul, a retired US congressman and the initiator of the Liberty Report, a broadcast on US diplomacy, is vigorously critical of Bolton’s “bad influence” on US foreign policy. According to Paul, the “Bolton effect” is the main reason why President Trump’s historic diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea ultimately failed. “It looks like Bolton is living up to his true colors,” Paul said as he argued that he expected that the Trump administration’s North Korean overture would eventually fail “because of Bolton.” In Western Sahara, the decades-long territorial conflict between Morocco, a historic US ally, and the Polisario Front, the militant group spearheading separatism in the disputed regions, has also had its dose of the “Bolton Effect.” Presenting the US’s new agenda in Africa in December 2018, Bolton emphasized the need for the US to cement its presence on the African continent. To do this, Bolton proposed, Washington has to “contain” and thwart Russia’s and China’s growing influence in African affairs. More importantly perhaps, Bolton said he was profoundly “frustrated” with the way successive US administrations have dealt with the Western Sahara question in recent years. A professed critic of MINURSO, the UN’s peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, Bolton has time and again decried both the US’ and the UN’ insistence on a long-term-oriented and intricate trust building in Western Sahara. The “peacekeeping first” method, he argued, amounts to investing years, energy, and financial resources in “ineffective” peace-keeping operations. The best way to act in Western Sahara, he has suggested, is to be implacably confrontational towards actors—especially Morocco—and compel them to have no choice but to let go of their decades-long enmity. “The conflict has not been handled well, and that’s why it continues to persist. There are two Americans who really focus a lot on the Western Sahara: one’s James Baker, the other’s me,” Bolton said. He added that only though exerting “intense pressure on everybody involved” can the Western Sahara question be solved. In the meantime, President Trump credits Bolton with “doing a very good job,” although he personally “disagrees very much with him” on how the US should behave in the Middle East. Critics, however, have vehemently argued that Bolton’s way of doing diplomacy is a relic of the Cold war rationality and should be shunned in a multipolar world that no longer revolves around the US alone and where “soft power” and “smart power” are more effective than Bolton’s apparent obsession with war and muscular diplomacy.

Rabat – Morocco’s Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced on Monday, June 24, that his cabinet is “exerting special efforts” to improve the conditions of Moroccan diaspora through a range of programs and strategies. Speaking at the House of Representatives, El Othmani said that the program aims to “strengthen”  the community’s national identity and to protect their rights and interests. According to El Othmani, the strategies, also aim to solidify ties of connection between Moroccans living abroad (MREs) and their motherland, especially the younger generation. El Othmani said that the first pillar the government is working to promote is the “educational aspect,” which aims to strengthen the national identity of Moroccans across the world Education is “the safety valve to preserve national identity with its cultural and linguistic dimensions,” he said. The Head of Government emphasized the importance of the Arabic language in both formal and non-formal education, adding that the government has put in place programs for 75,000 Moroccans living abroad. He said that the government has hired 529 teachers for this program. The government programs also include support provided to economically disadvantaged families in African countries, supporting 900,000 students through a program of vocational training. The head of government also cited the 2019 Marhaba initiative, to facilitate the annual transit of Moroccans living abroad, as part of the government’s program to ensure the rights of MREs. Earlier this month, Spanish  Minister of Interior Fernando Grande-Marlaska said that the operation  is the “largest of its kind in Europe and one of the most important in the world.” He also described the operation as an “example of good coordination between different public administrations and between neighboring countries.” The number of Moroccans residing abroad is estimated at five million.

Rabat – Head coach of Morocco’s national football team,  Herve Renard, told reporters that the first match of a tournament is always tough. “What happened today proves this” explained Renard after the Atlas Lions game against Namibia on Sunday, June 24.  He also congratulated Namibia and their coach Ricardo Mannetti for his team’s performance. The game against Namibia was the team’s first match in the African Cup of Nations (CAN) 2019 tournament. Morocco won Sunday’s game thanks to a late own goal scored by Itamuna Kemuine, giving Morocco a three points. Morocco’s next CAN match will be against Ivory Coast on Friday, June 28. “We face Cote d’Ivoire next and we have to get ready for that important match,” Renard said. In addition to his comment on the performance, Renard also expressed surprise at the lack of water breaks during the game. “Why were the players not allowed to drink during the first half and the second half? How is it possible?” Renard said. Renard referred to the  decision of the referee to not to provide players with ‘minutes off’ for water, amid soaring weather in Egypt. “I was very surprised. Strange. If you play football you know you need to drink something, especially after 20 to 25 minutes.” He called on organizers to “think” about the players.

Rabat – American model Ashley Graham is receiving backlash for posting a photo of her and her mother riding a camel in Morocco. The photo was taken during the model’s recent vacation to Agadir, a city along Morocco’s southern Atlantic coast, and was uploaded to Instagram.      A post shared by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@ashleygraham) on Jun 22, 2019 at 4:54am PDT The post was quickly inundated with comments condemning Graham’s decision to ride a camel. “Poor camel. Please don’t support harmful animal tourism,” one of the top comments read. “I hope you read your comments and start to understand that half of your followers are against riding animals and it is a form of animal cruelty! These animals have no choice when it comes to being ridden, they are slaves to their masters who only care about their bank accounts and not the animals themselves. I hope you educate yourself about these industries and how these animals suffer year after year for humans to get their video/selfie. #animalsarenotentertainment,” commented one of the most disappointed users. In recent years, animal activists have been questioning the morality of “animal tourism,” as camels often have to be trained to bear riders through discipline and whipping.  Another user commented that the constant tourist rides are bad for the camels’ knees, although very little research has been done into the subject. “I went to Morocco and people were getting on and off camels every couple minutes and they were forced into their knees repeatedly and you could just tell they were hurting plus. Basically trying being forced to do squats incorrectly every day all day, you’re going to ruin your knees,” said the user. “I refused to get on them. I’m all for horseback riding and other things in moderation, I don’t think that’s abusing animals, however the way I’ve seen camels be treated, I would have to say I think it’s very inhumane,” the user continued. Where do animal rights groups stand on the issue? Although nomads have used camels to travel through trade routes in the Moroccan desert for thousands of years, it is the commercialization of the practice for the benefit of tourism animal activists are criticizing. PETA (People For The Ethical Treatment of Animals) has taken the stance that all forms of camel riding are cruel and abusive. However, the group is known for their extreme views and the issue may not be so black and white. More reputable groups, such as the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA), rather than condemning camel riding altogether advise travelers to only ride camels that are kept in responsible and ethical conditions. SPANA, along with other NGOs, have established basic five standards that must be met for the camels: food and water, a suitable living environment, good health, an opportunity to exhibit natural behaviors, and finally protection from fear and distress. The general advice for travelers to ensure they are not participating in unethical animal tourism is to do research and know what to look out for, ask questions, and use critical thinking.

Rabat- In support of the Palestinian cause and in opposition of the “Deal of the Century,” hundreds took to the streets of Rabat yesterday, June 23, to protest. The protest comes after eight Moroccan associations issued an appeal for a national march to denounce US policy in Palestine. The protests are a direct response to US President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan, known as the “Deal of the Century”, which the authors of the appeal called an “organized, shameful, and humiliating sell-off” of Palestine. The protesters say that they are denouncing the “maneuvers aimed at the Palestinian cause to liquidate the rights of the people, including hostilities in Al-Quds and the Golan and in the rest of the occupied territories.” The signatories also dubbed the “Deal of the Century” a “collusion between US imperialism and the Zionist entity, as well as some of the regimes and tyrannical agents of the region.” They also reiterated that the peace plan proposed by the Donald Trump administration not only “goes against a fair and equitable peace process,” but also “the will of the Arab and Muslim people, including that of Morocco, who reject any form of normalization with Israel.” The protest comes just days before the US is expected to disclose further details of the already controversial deal at the Manama Economic Summit from June 25 to 26. The protest’s organizers said that today’s demonstration “marks a clear expression of the refusal of any participation of the Kingdom whether formal or informal at the conference in Manama.” It is also “a sign of the firm and unwavering support for the position of Palestine and the Palestinian people in their courageous and legitimate struggle for their land and their rights,” the organizers said. The collective behind this initiative includes the Moroccan Association of Support to the struggle of the Palestinian people, the Moroccan collective of Moroccan human rights bodies, and the Moroccan Observatory against Standardization. Also part of the initiative is the Moroccan Collective for Solidarity, the National Action Group to Support Palestine, the Moroccan Democracy Network for Solidarity with Peoples, and the Moroccan Instance of Support for the Causes of the Ummah as well as the Committee of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. The Moroccan government has so far made no announcement on whether or not it will attend the conference.

Rabat – Once an economic flagship, Morocco’s single oil refinery has been in decline since 2015 and now faces permanent closure in less than a month.  In 1959, the Moroccan government established the refining company, SAMIR, in Mohammedia. It was sold to the Corral group, a Saudi-Swedish enterprise, in 1997.  Unable to honor $4.5 billion in borrowing, the firm was then liquidated by a Casablanca court in 2016.  The court has extended the deadline to keep the refinery open a dozen times, with the final extension set to expire on July 18.  The refinery once had a capacity of producing more than 150,000 barrels a day, but work at the plant slowed to a stop in 2015.  Since then, a self-titled “national front” of employees, economists, and union leaders have been pressuring the government with sit-ins and press conferences to revive SAMIR.  Staff representative Houcine El-Yamani has lead the efforts of the “national front” to salvage the plant. In 2018, his team issued a report to Moroccan authorities denouncing the 1997 privatization and sale of the refinery, which was “totally lacking in transparency.”  The report accused the Corral group of disrespecting its contract and triggering the demise of SAMIR.  The report also claimed that the government has no interest in salvaging the country’s sole national refinery. Minister of Energy and Mines Aziz Rebbah dismissed these allegations.  Meanwhile, a trade court has been actively seeking a new owner. Around 30 international groups have expressed an interest in SAMIR over the years, but nothing has come to fruition.   As recently as June 2019, Exol Lubricants Morocco offered $8.23 million to obtain the assets of SAMIR. However, the offer was not well received by the refinery’s shareholders or by SAMIR employees, who consider the price to be “below market standards.”  Other contenders include Swiss-British Glencore and Geneva-based Trafigura, who have offered $14.99 million and $11.70 million, respectively.  Earlier in 2019, a report by the International Energy Agency detailed Morocco’s dependency on coal, oil, and gas imports to meet most of its energy needs. “The closure of the country’s only refinery . . . has clear implications for the security of [Morocco’s] oil supply,” the report reads, recommending the development of domestic energy resources. 
 Around 800 employees are still on the company’s payroll, with the upcoming closure of the facility posing a dire threat to their livelihoods.

Rabat – On Wednesday, June 19, in Paris, the President of the Louvre Museum  Jean-Luc Martinez and the chairman of Morocco’s National Museums Foundation (FNM) Mehdi Qotbi signed an agreement stating that the works of French artist Eugene Delacroix will come to Rabat. The exhibition of Eugene Delacroix’s works will be held at the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rabat in spring 2020, according to the agreement. Eugene Delacroix, born in 1798 in Paris, is known for being one of the founding fathers of French romanticism. His illustrious artistic career was particularly marked by a diplomatic mission to Morocco in 1832, which the upcoming exhibition will focus on. The exhibition will not only feature Delacroix’s paintings during his mission but also objects he brought back to Europe, to show the Morocco Delacroix “so dreamed of,” Martinez told MAP. Delacroix’s diplomatic mission came just after France invaded Algeria, and was seeking to form good relations with Morocco, which was ruled by Sultan Moulay Abderrahman at the time. Although he was there for diplomatic reasons, Delacroix’s painting flourished during his 6 month trip to Morocco. He returned to France with eight albums of drawings and annotated sketches, which are now some of his most famous works. Some of his most famous works include “The Jewish Wedding in Morocco,” and “Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable,” “The Lion Hunt,” “The Fanatics of Tangiers,” as well as a portrait of the Sultan. “The images of Morocco stuck with Delacroix,” said Martinez at the signing ceremony, which was also attended by the director of the Eugene Delacroix Museum, Claire Bessede. “Inspired by Morocco, Delacroix, in turn, inspired Moroccan artists,” Martinez added. He also announced that a symposium will be held before the exhibition in collaboration with Morocco’s Royal Academy to examine this two-way influence further. For his part, the chairman of Morocco’s National Museums Foundation (FNM) Mehdi Qotbi thanked the Louvre for its support and collaboration, recalling that the first ever convention signed by the FNM was with the Louvre in 2014. “It is thanks to this prestigious institution that we have been able to catalog the works we have,” said Qotbi. Wednesday’s agreement also promised the strengthening of cooperation between the Louvre Museum and the FNM, particularly on scientific and technical issues, as well as on staff training. The 2014 collaboration led to the Louvre hosting its “Medieval Morocco: An Empire from Africa to Spain” exhibition. The exhibit focuses on Morocco from the 11th to 14th centuries, a time when “the western Islamic world was at the height of its glory, as much in terms of its artistic production as its place in history.”

Rabat – The new Mylan Pharmaceuticals Maroc (MPM) factory is valued at MAD 120 million ($12 million). Approximately MAD 60 million ($6.5 million) will be invested by the end of 2019, MPM announced in a press release. The MPM, the Moroccan subsidiary of the American pharmaceutical giant Mylan Inc., will produce “Myhep All,” a generic medication for the treatment of hepatitis C.  The drug is the first of its kind to provide single-dose antiviral treatment to all strains of hepatitis C. It is currently being imported into Morocco from the Mylan factories in India, pending final authorizations for local production. The factory covers 1500 square meters for the production, analysis, stocking and distribution of the drug. MPM intends to expand the factory by 900 square meters, and to also start producing generic treatments for hepatitis B, cancer, and diabetes. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 1.2% of the global population suffers from hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus which can lead to lifelong liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. According to WHO, antiviral medicine can cure more than 95% of hepatitis C infections. In February and April this year, the Moroccan Ministry for Health launched a study to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C across the country, in partnership with the WHO, UNICEF, and local authorities.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani extended Morocco’s gratitude to the government of Barbados for its decision to withdraw recognition of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Following the June 21 announcement, Barbados joins the growing list of countries which support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan submitted to the UN in 2007 as a political solution to end the Western Sahara conflict. The decision came during the visit of Barbados’ Prime Minister Mia Mottley who paid a working and friendship visit to Morocco.  Mottley was accompanied by a large delegation of politicians and economic operators. Satisfied with Barbados’ decision, El Othmani said that the two countries share the same challenges related to the promotion of health sector, education, and economic development. El Othmani also reiterated Morocco’s decision to strengthen diplomatic relations and cooperation in several fields for the interest and prosperity of both countries. During the visit, Moroccan officials and the Barbados delegation discussed the ties of diplomacy and friendship which bind the two countries. The statement from Morocco’s Head of Government added that talks were also held on the opportunities for partnership, investment and sharing of expertise, particularly in the sectors of tourism, air transport, and training in the medical field; and in the fisheries sector. The decision from Barbados comes as support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan gains international support, with Brazil and El Salvador most recently declaring their support for Morocco’s position.

Rabat – Moroccan company Tekcim has signed a financing agreement to build a MAD 2.6 billion ($274 million) cement plant in Ouled Ghanem in the province of El Jadida, 150km south of Casablanca. The project will be financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), BMCE Bank of Africa, the Banque Centrale Populaire and Societe Generale Maroc. Tekcim has subcontracted the construction of the plant to two companies; Societe Generale des Travaux du Maroc (SGTM), a large Moroccan construction company specialized in public projects and the global engineering company FLSmidth, based in Denmark.  The plant is expected to begin operations in 2022. The cement plant will produce 1.4 million tons of cement per year and 1.1 million tons of clinker. The production will meet the increasing demand for housing and infrastructure projects in Morocco and across Africa, stated the ADB in a press release. “This is an important project that will contribute to the industrial acceleration of Morocco, and to the reinforcement of its strong economic ties with the continent,” said Leila Farah Mokaddem, the AfDB representative in Morocco, at the signing ceremony.  Mokaddem added that thanks to the transport infrastructure in the region, the plant will easily be able to respond to local market needs and, beyond this, to the needs of regional markets in West Africa including Burkina Faso, Cote D’Ivoire, and Niger, reports the Maghreb Press Agency (MAP).  The project, Mokkadem said, will create jobs to benefit rural populations. The AfDB has financed more than 160 projects in Morocco, across the water, energy, transport, agriculture, and social development sectors, to a value of over MAD 95 billion ($10 billion) over the last 50 years. For SGTM, the financing of the project is “an important turning point”. It will allow the SGTM to continue its development in Morocco and in Africa, the president of SGTM M’Hammed Kabbaj stated. For the deal, Tekcim was advised by banking group Ascent Capital Partners and the law firm Gide Loyrette. Allen &amp; Overy advised the financing consortium.

Rabat -Panic broke out at dawn on Monday morning June 24, when a masked attacker on a motorcycle opened fire on a Mosque in the city of Ceuta. According to reports the assailant approached Muley El Medhi Mosque as people exited the building following Fajr, the first prayer of the day for Muslims.  The gunman fired four shots from his motorcycle and then fled the scene. At least a dozen people were inside the mosque at the time of the incident, which occurred around 3:30 am. Worshippers ran for cover as bullets hit the facade of the mosque near its entrance. Reports say that at least one bullet impacted the interior of the building. The gunman, who escaped after the shooting, is being sought by the Spanish police. No one was injured in the attack.  Inaugurated in 1940, Muley El Medhi is one of the most important mosques in the Spanish autonomous city of Ceuta. Funded by the Spanish state, the Franco-era mosque was dedicated to the Muslim troops who supported the national side during the Spanish Civil War. Authorities cordoned off the area around the mosque, which is located on Avenue de Africa in the northern coastal city.  The incident is currently under investigation by the National Police of Ceuta.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Nasser Bourita has reiterated Morocco’s support for all actions in favor of the Venezuelan people’s legitimate aspirations to democracy.  Bourita announced Morocco’s support after his talks with Colombian counterpart Carlos Holmes Trujillo in Rabat on Friday, June 21. During the meeting with Trujillo, the Moroccan minister discussed the worsening situation in Venezuela. Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro named himself president for a second term in January of this year, following a widely boycotted election. International commentators and activists within Venezuela continue to call for a fair and democratic election, with most supporting the leader of the opposition, Juan Gaido.  Bourita said that Morocco continues to closely monitor developments in Venezuela. “It [Morocco] maintains regular contact with those who carry the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people to democracy and change,” Bourita said. Bourita also announced that he received Jose Ignacio Guedez, Guaido’s special envoy on Friday, June 21. During the meeting, Bourita announced Morocco’s readiness to “listen to the latest developments in the political and humanitarian situation in Venezuela and to work in a regional setting.” Bourita also recalled that he had a telephone interview with Venezuelan opposition leader Guaido. The phone interview is the second of its kind. The first took place on January 29. During the conversation, Bourita informed Guaido of Morocco’s support for the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people. Earlier this year, Guaido reiterated his determination to renew relations between Morocco and Venezuela on a “healthy and serene basis” and to remove the obstacles that hindered their development, including Maduro’s presidency and its position on the Western Sahara conflict. Guaido’s supporters in the interim government also informed Morocco of its determination to reconsider their recognition of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi republic SADR. The foreign affairs advisor at the Venezuelan National Assembly, Manuel Avendano, said that recognizing the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) was more in line with “left ideologies, like those of Nicolas Maduro’s regime” rather than “a real quest for a peaceful and political solution to the dispute over the Sahara.”

Rabat – There was a flair of diminished confidence and unattended doubts as Morocco took on Namibia’s in the opening game of Group D. For a team that has been repeatedly hailed for its enormous reserve of talented players but dismally failed to captivate in its latest displays, this was the opportunity for the Moroccan Lions to register a successful entry into this year’s Afcon. Perhaps that is why the Moroccan Lions immediately went for possession and bold dominance right at kick off, passing deep into the Namibian half, connecting the vivacity on the flanks with the creativity in the middle. Or at least so they tried, with Hakim Ziyech, the team’s professed creative mind one of the continent’s most gifted players, touching more balls than anyone on the field in the first half.  For much of the first half hour, however, the match was rather an exercise in caution and risk management. Like two boxers holding back their most lethal punches until they uncover the opponent’s weakest spots, Morocco and Namibia played it nice in the first half, investing more in neutralizing each other rather than in being a threat. No high intensity, no usual outbursts of over-patriotic subtext.  Namibia, forever composed, defended high and well. Putting up a compact defensive wall from the midfield, they seemed to have no issues with granting Morocco more possession. They were confident in the pace and vigorous on the wings, and chose to strike Morocco on counters should opportunities arise. It was the kind of matches you get when other underdogs have already beaten some favorites at this tournament, making other favorites more reserved. Intermittently, though, there were flashes of deftness that indicated what the second half could be: completely different. Morocco, growing confident as the game drove on, played with the flawed intensity of a side aware that this opening could be the game that defines the rest of its tournament.  But the Moroccans failed time and again to effectively exploit the spaces that Namibia’s surrender-to-strike-back-better performance granted them. And so for 45 minutes, the Atlas Lions controlled and dominated unconvincingly. At times, however, the sheer sight of cases like Ziyech’s, Hakimi’s, or even Boufal’s, was enough to suggest that this was a squad with enough talents to make things fall apart for the opposition at any moment.  Whatever happened in the Moroccan dressing room at half time, it looked game-changing for the first 20 minutes into the second half. The Lions came with renewed vigor and much more aggressiveness. And, on second thought, saying “even Boufal” was perhaps the most jarringly inaccurate assessment of Morocco’s reserve of lethal players.  Slightly eclipsing the genius of Ziyech and frontally taking on the entire Namibian defense during moments of rare brilliance, the Celta Vigo man was the most important, threatening player for most of the second half.  Lively, deft, and implacably focused, Boufal was singularly the origin of the few riveting moments in the later part of the game. The most telling illustration was perhaps with his exquisite 59th minute shot that elicited an equally first-rate save from LIoyd Kazapua, the Namibian goal keeper.  Having magisterially flounced past two Namibian defenders, Boufal registered a superb diver shot. The beauty of the move was enough to take Moroccan fans at the stadium off their seats. But they would have to wait longer to actually live the joy of winning, the excitement of a late-minute winner when everything seemed to suggest a scoreless end. If Namibia’s composure was somewhat attractive in the first half, the South Africans seemed utterly, irreversibly overwhelmed in the second. They created zero goal chance and spent over 80 minutes trying to keep Morocco’s most attacking players at bay.   And so, even as Morocco played a rather impeccable second half, there was a lingering feeling, as the clock read 89 minutes, that the game was marching toward a scoreless draw, yet another disappointing outcome for Moroccan fans. However, just as Moroccan hopes seemed to flatten, Namibia’s Keimouine stepped in—rather unfortunately for him—to score a last-minute winner from a Hakim Ziyech cross.   Even as they claimed three very important points to take the lead in the tournament’s “group of death,” the game was the quintessence of what the Moroccan Lions have become of late: A team with everything to succeeded but going through a long moment of doubt they will have to conquer to rise to the overload of expectations weighing on their shoulders.  “I know so much is expected of me, of us,” Morocco’s Herve Renard said in the pre-match press conference. Perhaps that should be the spirit as the Lions prepare to take on tougher challenges as this competition takes on more intense, aggressive undertone.

Born in Courcouronnes, France to Moroccan parents, Benatia began his professional football career at Olympique de Marseille. While at Marseille, he also loaned his time out to Tours FC and FC Lorient-Bretagne Sud. He joined Clermont Foot 63 in 2008, Udinese Calcio in 2010, AS Roma in 2013, and Bayern Munich in 2014.  Benatia began his career with Italian champions Juventus in 2016, originally on loan. He was signed permanently to the club in 2017 after “demonstrating his qualities of physical prowess, class, and defensive vision.”  Throughout his two-and-a-half seasons with the prestigious Italian club, Benatia earned a reputation as one of the best center-backs in Serie A.  Benatia first appeared with the Atlas Lions on November 19, 2008 during a match against Zambia in Casablanca. He scored his first Moroccan goal on June 4, 2011 against rival Algeria. The 4-0 win for Morocco qualified the national team for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN).  Benatia’s debut as Morocco’s captain was at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. Later in the year he qualified the Atlas Lions for the 2018 FIFA World Cup after scoring against the Ivory Coast. This was “the most beautiful moment of my career,” the 32-year-old said.  Benatia first played for al-Duhail in February 2019 in a 1-0 home win over Al Sailiya in the Qatar Stars League. He received intense criticism from Moroccan fans after choosing to play for Qatar, with accusations of greed, and many still believe that money was the main reason for his transfer.  “I’m not here for the money,” Benatia declared on Qatari television in early 2019. “Whoever thinks that I came for the money, he must look at my career, the choices I made,” he continued. “All my career I gave priority to football. All my life I gave priority to football.” He later added that Qatar presents the best option for “his children to live in an environment where they can learn Islam properly.” After the 2018 World Cup, Benatia appeared to put the Moroccan national team on the backburner as he concentrated on his club commitments. His distance drew some resentment, but Morocco’s team manager Herve Renard still considers Benatia to be “one of the greatest players in the history of Moroccan football.” Since launching his professional career, Benatia has received many notable awards including two Serie A titles with Juventus and two Bundesliga crowns at Bayern. He was named Best Moroccan Player in 2013 and 2014 by Mars D’or and Best Arab Player in 2014 by the Globe Soccer Awards.   In May, Benatia revealed his favorites for the final square of CAN, naming Senegal, Algeria, and Egypt as the competition’s top contenders. In this year’s CAN, Morocco is in Group D, and will have to face Namibia, South Africa, and the Ivory Coast. While aware of the difficulty his team will face, the “Lion of the Atlas” is still optimistic about Morocco’s potential to pass the second round of the competition.

By Marius Bordat Rabat – When I decided to try to fast during Ramadan this year, I didn’t think that I was capable of lasting the entire month. I didn’t even plan to complete the whole month of Ramadan, especially since I had never fasted before. My idea was to try fasting for the first few days and then stop. As a 16-year-old French-American, born in Morocco, I am going to talk about my experience of fasting for the first time. I first decided to observe Ramadan in solidarity with my friends. I also wanted to live the experience of fasting. The first day of Ramadan fell on a school day. Some of my friends presumed that I wasn’t fasting. But when I explained my intention to try it, at first they didn’t believe me, and then they were very surprised and proud of me. What’s more, on that first day I had sports. It felt a little difficult at the time to not drink but it wasn’t impossible. For the breaking of the fast on my first day, I went to the Rabat medina to have a traditional Moroccan iftar. The first few days were the most difficult for me. My body had to get used to not eating and drinking during the day until sunset – about 7:30 at night. They were also the hardest because, at the beginning of Ramadan, I only drank water instead of eating when I woke up at three in the morning for the last meal of “suhoor,” before the sun rose. That made me a lot hungrier during the day. It was also harder for me during the first few days because I didn’t have a complete iftar. Since I was the only one in my family fasting, sometimes I waited until 8 pm to eat when my family had dinner, or I ordered food in advance. The problem was, it wasn’t Moroccan food. One week into Ramadan, my neighbors heard that I was fasting. They called me and told me to come to their house just before the iftar to come to try traditional harira soup. When I went to their house, the family gave me a tray of homemade Moroccan food with harira and some Moroccan sweet and savory pastries. They told me to come every evening and get my tray of iftar. At first, I didn’t want to because I thought it was impolite. But they said that I had to come each day or they would be mad at me. So each night I went to my neighbor’s house and discovered something new on my tray. They even included some extra cake for me to eat at three in the morning. That helped me a lot during the day, and I was less hungry. After that, the whole neighborhood knew that I was fasting. Each time someone saw me, they told me that they were all proud of me. Because of Ramadan, the school schedule changed and I got to get up a bit later. Even with Ramadan I didn’t find school more difficult or feel more tired. I found it a little bit challenging at the end of the day, one hour before breaking the fast. So I usually took a nap or rested after coming back from school. One thing that I noticed is that Moroccans go out a lot after the sun sets and nighttime is very lively. A couple of times during the month I went out to have dinner at 10 pm with my friends, I also went many times to play soccer with them until 1 am. One night I went to my girlfriend’s house to break the fast with a lot of delicious Moroccan food. I was very lucky to share the iftar with her and her family. Having an iftar with a Moroccan family was a very meaningful experience. The next night was the Champions League Soccer Final, so I invited three of my friends to come over to watch the game and break the fast together. My friends brought some sweets and pastries to eat and my mother made us a lot of different Ramadan specialties. Fasting for the whole month of Ramadan was a very good experience for me. I am proud of myself for having succeeded, and people were also very proud of me. I really appreciated the sense of sharing from the neighbors and the culture of generosity. This experience also made me learn how lucky I am to eat every day when so many still go hungry. I didn’t find it as difficult as I had expected, and I practiced self-control. I am happy that I’ve done it and look forward to next year.

Washington D.C – In March, I gave a series of lectures at seven Moroccan universities. The lectures mainly focused on three principal topics: “Trumpism as a Political Philosophy and its Impact on Contemporary International Relations” (presented at universities in Rabat [Souissi and Agdal], Casablanca, Tangier, Oujda, and Fez), “The dialectical Relationship between University, Development, and Democracy” at Chouaib Doukkali University in El Jadida, and “The Future of Islamists in the Arab Region: The Lessons learned from the so-called Arab Spring” at the Moroccan Center for Studies and Modern Research in Rabat.  During this tour, I unfortunately did not have enough time to visit other universities, and apologize to my fellow professors and students in Marrakech, Agadir, Kenitra, and Settat for postponing the visit. I did have the chance however to engage in discussions with a considerable number of deans, professors, researchers, and students on a range of issues related to scientific research and the challenges facing higher education in Morocco, a country that finds itself debating a century-old question: whether to make Arabic, French, or English the primary language of instruction in the education system.  Should university curricula be written in the most widely spoken language in the country, Moroccan Arabic? Or should Moroccan universities choose between retaining colonial French as the language of academia, or letting English, an increasingly dominant global language and lingua franca of social and natural sciences, take its place? The questions that are perhaps missing from the debate are: what do Moroccans want and foresee from their education system, and what is expected from students and graduates of Moroccan universities in 2020, not to mention 2030 or 2040?  A professor at the Faculty of Law at the Souissi University in Rabat recently shared with me a photo of the oldest degree in human and veterinary medicine, which was awarded to Abdullah bin Saleh El Kattami by the University of Qarawiyyin in Fez 712 years ago, during the Almohad era.  The degree was awarded in the presence of the notary Abdullah Taher and three doctors: Ziauddin Abu Muhammad Abdullah bin Ahmed Al-Malki, known as Ibn Al-Bitar; Abu Abbas Ahmed bin Mufraj, known as Nabatti; and Abu Omar Ahmed bin Mohammed bin Hajjaj, known as Achbili. Seeing the photo filled me with a perplexing mixture of feelings. At once, I felt a huge amount of pride for what was a brilliant era in Moroccan history and for the impact this era had on the rest of the world; but, I also felt frustrated about how much the state of academia in Morocco has since deteriorated.  The transformation from the peak of academic excellence in the Kingdom in the 13th century, to the hugely weakened state of modern academia in the 21st century is stark.  The two eras represent distinctly different moments in Moroccan history: one was a period of cultural prosperity and exchange of scholarly knowledge, and the other has come to reflect a decline in academic excellence and innovation, which has in turn had detrimental repercussions on healthcare, justice, and even politics.  Over the course of the past two years, I have become more and more frustrated and disillusioned by an increasing sense of stagnation in Morocco. I left the country troubled by the state of the Moroccan university system, which I have always considered a crucial step in the formation of the next generation of scientists, thinkers, and reformers, and a real opportunity for Morocco to develop and achieve its aspirations regionally and internationally. However, Moroccan universities today are overburdened by a seemingly endless series of intellectual, methodological, and structural dilemmas. In particular, they are plagued by prevalent corruption and ethical degradation in a place that is meant to embody integrity and moral responsibility.  In the years that followed Morocco’s independence from French colonialism in 1956, Moroccan higher education was driven by a sense of national pride and commitment to the country. Universities contributed to the modernization of the country, produced new ideas and strategies, and vocally criticized any attempts made by the government to manipulate knowledge. In more recent times however, rather than competing to publish the best book or most important study, or just succeed academically, measures of success for the majority of professors and deans is valued by the worth of their real estate or the type of the car they own; and they insist on students buying copies of their books or academic texts.  Nonetheless, more than 55 percent of Moroccan university professors have not published a single line in their entire career, with seemingly little interest in the commonplace phrase in the world of academia, “Publish or perish,” which refers to the pressure faced by academics to continuously publish works to further their career. Most Moroccan Universities are corrupted by “knowledge brokers” who accept students onto Master’s and PhD programs in exchange for bribes of around MAD 20,000 ($2,105) or MAD 40,000 ($4,210) respectively.  The amount of the bribe is subject to the law of supply and demand. In addition, there is a black market for Master’s and PhD research papers. Some professors are even ready and willing to write research papers for their Gulf students in exchange for the highest price.  Some professors that I met with said that even government officials paid large bribes for degrees in the field of security and strategy studies in a bid to get promoted to positions of higher responsibility; their desire to further their career far outweighing their desire to improve their intellectual skills or scientific knowledge. Universities have become a surreal place where hundreds of PhD students have obtained degrees that do not reflect their actual academic or methodological capabilities. During my tour, I was at a university where the number of students enrolled in PhD programs in just one school was around 1,000. Although of course most of these students were there on their own merit, doubtless, the increasingly murky politics of the world of academia means that a proportion of them entered under morally ambiguous circumstances. Sadly, sexual harassment also plagues universities, with female students resisting or tolerating abuses of power until they hold the title of ‘Doctor’ or ‘Professor.’ Moreover, the corruption that is rife in Moroccan universities determines who gets to be a professor; professorships are often granted to those who can offer the highest price.  Unfortunately, corruption is not limited to academia, and can be found across Moroccan society.  Following increased rates of crime and violence, and reduced rates of civic participation, Moroccan society has become characterized by mistrust and hopelessness. Most Moroccans do not have faith in their country anymore. 91 percent of young people aged between 25 and 34 years old are keen to move abroad for a better quality of life.  The deepening chasm between the people, the state, political parties, and public institutions, has been caused by this growing mistrust of the current political structure. ‘Official’ rhetoric does not resemble the daily reality of most Moroccans and positive slogans and ambitious development plans feel hollow for people, for whom corruption and success through nepotism feel much more familiar. With people achieving success using connections and money and often bypassing the law to do so, it is unsurprising that Moroccans feel like there are some who are above the law and others who are very much subjected to it.  There are doubtless huge strides being made in terms of the improvement of infrastructure in Morocco.  The push for urbanization has involved numerous ongoing construction projects, the creation and development of highways and the high-sped ‘Al-Boraq’ train, and the improvement of airports and train stations. Nevertheless, there is a strategic question: why is the government spending all of its resources on buildings and projects but not investing in its people?   For instance, the lack of investment in human capital manifests itself most clearly in the limited employment opportunities for an entire generation of people; but, also the undermined rights and reduced financial security of public sector employees i.e. the “contract teachers” who have been protesting in previous months over their mistreatment.  Besides the lack of investment in human capital, Morocco is also experiencing a decline in social capital. During the 1980s, a number of countries (namely Spain, Turkey, and South Korea) experienced a similar trend to the one that Morocco is currently experiencing.  But unlike these countries, which believed in the potential of future generations and their dreams and ambitions, and adopted policies of accountability, thus achieving both human and infrastructure development, Morocco does not seem on track to doing the same.  When are we going to build the ‘Al-Boraq’ that will take us to a renewed golden era of Moroccan academic excellence? Dr. Mohammed Cherkaoui is professor of Conflict Resolution at George Mason University in Washington and senior fellow at Al Jazeera Center for Studies.

Rabat – Royal Air Maroc (RAM) inaugurated its new direct Casablanca-Boston flight on Saturday, June 22. The flight makes Royal Air Maroc the first airline to fly directly from Africa to Boston. The company will provide the direct air service three times a week: Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Royal Air Maroc aims to strengthen its presence  in the region with several direct flights, including the recent inaugurated direct flight between Casablanca and Miami in April 2019. In addition to Boston and Miami, the company also serves New York,  and Washington. The Casablanca-Boston flight will bring to seven the number of direct flights operated by the company across the Atlantic with Montreal, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. “The launch of the Casablanca-Boston airline is in line with the strategy of RAM’s development in the United States,” RAM’s airline representative for the Americas Amine El Farissi was quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), as saying. El Farissi added that Boston has the “distinction of having a large number of Moroccan and African students and researchers.” “Many tourists go to Morocco” from Massachusetts, he added. He pointed that Casablanca is able to serve as a suitable stopover for American travelers thanks to its geographical proximity to Europe. Director of Aviation at Logan International Airport David S. Ishihara said that RAM’s presence is “very important to us.” “We are particularly proud of this because it is our first direct flight not only from Boston to Casablanca, but from Africa in general,” he said. He added that Boston has a large Moroccan community. “People will be able to take this flight not only for education or business, but also for tourism. Tourists can go around the Sahara, stroll through the alleys of the medina of Fez and enjoy the cultural wealth of Morocco.” Acting CEO of the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) John Pranckevicius also expressed satisfaction with the inauguration of the flight. Pranckevicius said that the partnership with Royal Air Maroc will “open up new opportunities for leisure travel, educational tours, and development between the New England region and the kingdom of Morocco.” He added that Massport is looking forward to offering passengers a new gateway to Africa.

The only coach to have won the CAN title twice with different teams, having first won with Zambia in 2012 and then with the Ivory Coast in 2015, Moroccan fans are hoping for a hat-trick from the French veteran.

Rabat – Even as a series of dismal performances have raised lingering doubts on Morocco’s championship aspirations for the ongoing AFCON in Egypt, Moroccan fans’ confidence in Hakim Ziyech has  remained untainted.  In fact, the 26-year midfielder has established himself as the creative mastermind of Morocco’s increasingly attack-minded team under coach Herve Renard. So significant has he become for Morocco’s Atlas Lions that his absence is immediately felt, with the most striking sign being a wobble connection between the midfield and other departments of the Moroccan squad.   Ziyech was born on 19th March 1993 in Dronten, the Netherlands. He grew up with his elder brothers, Faouzi and Hicham, both born in Berkane, in North-eastern Morocco.  His father left his native Rif region with wife and two elder sons for greener pastures in the Netherlands. Ziyech was born in the Dronten Municipality in Central Netherlands.  As his family struggled to make ends meet, the young Ziyech quickly caught the attention of the Dutch footballing with his technical prowess and attacking flair.  Ziyech currently plays midfielder Ajax, the top team in the Dutch league. And although the 26-year old footballer was already a star of Dutch football with Heerenveen and Twente before making a beeline for Ajax in 2016, there were trying times in-between.  For kids from poor-income families living in peripheric, marginalized, neighborhoods, the road to stardom is a saga of resilience, fraught with moments of self-doubt, financial difficulties, a couple of poor life choices, and the need to break away from bad company to focus on one’s passion.  Ziyech was no different, and the ordeal was often exacerbated by an extreme lack of resources to afford the needed equipment to achieve his passion. The football star has said on numerous occasions that he is “a pure product of my neighborhood,” crediting the street with his formative years despite the “many [bad] friends I had to part ways with.” In interviews, his relatives often speak of the improbability of success despite the young Ziyech’s remarkable technical skills with the ball at his feet. But also of how, by age 10, football had become his passion, the center of his waking hours, and the ultimate route to meet the great expectations his family had for him. “Hakim was all that we had left,” his mother once said, noting that his elder brothers, Faouzi and Hicham, had already “derailed.” Ziyech made his professional debut at age 17, and his career has since been marked by many downs and many more ups. Success with Dutch youth team and the Ajax years  A solid debut with less glamorous Dutch clubs (ASV Dronten and SC Heerenveen among others) and equally brilliant performances with the Dutch youth team between  2013 and 2014 quickly catapulted Ziyech in the highest firmament of Ducth football. Offers flew in flocks from more accomplished Ducth clubs and, ultimate validation for a young player, the Dutch football federation began took notice.  By 2014, Ziyech secured a move to Twente, a relatively respected club. By then, the promising star was already, unmistakably, in the radar of the Dutch federation as a serious contender for the A team, especially with the brilliant generation of the likes of Arjen Robben, Van Persie, Wesley Sneijder approaching its end.  Traded by AFC Ajax with the exchange charge of €11 million on August 30, 2016, he has so far scored 16 goals in 62 appearances. Ziyech has a contract with the club which ends in l June 30, 2021.  Ziyech has won several awards for his footballing prowess while playing for the Dutch team. He was named Best Moroccan player in 2016 , AFC Ajax Player of the Year for 2017-018, and in 2018 was winner of the Golden Boot in the Netherlands. This season the midfielder has made 24 assists and scored 21 goals for Ajax, drawing attention from other European sides. Even though, according to Verbal International,  Ziyech may leave the Dutch club this late spring on payment of his transfer clause, his Ajax years have been an enormous success story. A consistently excellent presence in the Ajax midfield has attracted interest from some of Europe’s most revered footballing powerhouses, including Liverpool, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich, among many others. Ziyech’s double citizenship meant he was qualified to play for the national teams of both Morocco or the Netherlands. And with sustained interest from both countries, Ziyech–to the Dutch fans’ surprise and dismay–chose Morocco.  The Ajax midfielder, got his first international cap with the Netherlands on February 29, 2012, in a 0-3 win against Switzerland. Following this impressive debut, he played 3 matches for Netherlands Under 20 team and 2 goal in 3 games for Netherlands U-21 squad.  Ziyech had robust chances of making it to the Netherlands’ A team, but he made the surprising move to embrace the Moroccan Atlas LIons at the expense of the Dutch Oranje.  In 2015, Ziyech announced via social media that he wanted to represent Morocco’s national team. On October 9, 2015, he earned his senior cap with Morocco in a 1-0 triumph over the Ivory Coast in an international friendly game.  In May 2018, Ziyech flew to Russia to represent Morocco in the FIFA. While playing for Morocco, Ziyech has scored 14 goals in 25 appearances.  Fans of the midfielder are now looking forward to see him play this summer in Egypt, as he will once again represent Morocco, this time in the CAN 2019 tournament. Ziyech appeared this year on the Guardian “10 to Watch” in this year’s CAN.  Under Head Coach Herve Renard, Ziyech has established himself as the undisputed creative genius of the Moroccan team.  Even as the side boasts formidably talented players like Noussair Mazraoui, Younes Belhanda, and Achraf Hakimi, for example, Ziyech has singularly won the hearts and minds of Moroccan fans on numerous occasions. With his pace and ease with the ball at his feet, he is the heart of Herve’s team’s ball circulation.  “Zambia punishes Morocco in spite of Ziyech,” France Football recently headlined its match report on Morocco’s 3-2 loss in its last pre-Afcon friendly.  Despite Ziyech’s constantly frightful presence in the midfield and on the flanks, as well as his tactical genius, were not enough to help Morocco pass the Zambian’s defensive citadel in some crucial moments, the newspaper remarked.  Morocco, which later today takes on Namibia in the opening game of the 2019 AFCON’s most lethal group, expects to finally end more than three decades of trophy drought. And should Ziyech inspire the Atlas Lions to a continental exploit this year, he will claim a golden spot in the hearts of Moroccan fans. Now hailed as the heart of Herve’s squad, the Ajax man may well leave Egypt  as one of the most important players in the history of the Moroccan national team.

Rabat – Abdullah, a son of the late former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, is pointing fingers at President el-Sisi and a number of senior Egyptian officials in the death of his father. Abdullah said on Twitter on Monday that his father did not die of a natural death. Instead, he said, Morsi was “murdered” by Egyptian authorities. Morsi collapsed in a Cairo courtroom on Monday, where he was facing espionage charges. Since 2013, when his then defense minister and current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, stepped in to overthrow Egypt’s first and only democratically elected government, Morsi had been detained in conditions that critics and man international organizations decried as “arbitrary” and “politically motivated.” Elected to power in 2012 after what was back then considered a successful Arab Spring ousted the dictator Hosni Mubarak, Morsi embodied the hopes and aspirations of a post-Spring Egypt with the dream of consolidating the country’s hard-fought democracy. But his appeal quickly dimmed after a year in power, with critics reproaching him his extremely Islamist and anti-secularist agenda.
Morsi was left to solitary confinement after the coup d’état that saw President Sisi depose him. His supporters repeatedly denounced the “inhumane” treatment he faced while in detention. Abdulla’s Monday’s tweet recalled his father’s abysmal detention conditions, pointing accusatory fingers at the Egyptian state apparatus for his “murder.” In his tweet, Morsi’s son singularly accused President el-Sisi, as well as current and former interior ministers Mahmoud Tawfiq and Magdy Abdel Ghaffar. He also pointed fingers at judges Shirin Fahmy, Shaaban al-Shami and Ahmed Sabry, as well as Attorney General Nabil Sadek and the head of the Egyptian intelligence, Abbas Kamel Abdalah. He said these officials were the “partners” of President of el-Sisi “in killing the martyr president.” Abdalah is not alone in accusing President el-Sisi as the primary culprit in the “murder” of his father. In Turkey, where the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has remained an outspoken ally of the Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi’s political and ideological family which has since been outlawed in Egypt, there was a strong perception of political murder after news emerged of Morsi’s death. “Mohamed Morsi flailed on the courtroom floor for 20 minutes and the authorities did not help him. This is why I say Morsi did not die, he was murdered,” Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said at a mournful AKP rally on Wednesday in Istanbul. “We, as Turkey, will follow this issue and do everything possible for Egypt to be tried in international courts for Morsi’s death.” At the global level, while there appeared to be an overwhelming consensus that Morsi’s trial and years of tribulations in an Egyptian prison were politically motivated, his political legacy has remained a contentious topic. Supporters have come out en masse to describe him as a “martyr” and the undeniable icon of Egypt’s short-lived democratic experience. Others, sounding more neutral, have pointed out that he was at the same time the quintessence of “the hope and flaws of Egypt’s revolution.” Meanwhile, despite the diverging assessments of Morsi’s short-lived presidency, there remains a deep sense that his demise was the denouement in Egypt’s current regime’s determination to kill of any democratic aspirations. “To remember Morsi, then,” the Brookings Institution’s Shadi Hamid recently wrote, “is to remember what was lost.”

Rabat – Following in the footsteps of an increasing number of other Latin American countries, Colombia has renewed its commitment to friendship with Morocco and Morocco’s position on Western Sahara. Speaking on Friday in Rabat at a joint press conference with the Colombian Foreign Affairs Minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, Morocco’s Nasser Bourita extolled the “historic significance” and diplomatic weight of Colombia’s support for Morocco’s Western Sahara stance. Bourita, who spoke in the most genial terms of the “infallible friendship” and “reliable partnership” binding the two nations, suggested their bilateral relationship is experiencing a particularly upbeat moment underpinned by a “constructive political dialogue.” Bourita presented the growing friendship as a two-way street, a junction of both convenient and genuine commitments where both parties advance their own agenda while staying robustly loyal to each other’s most vital concerns. “Morocco can be Colombia’s most reliable friend in Africa and the Arab world,” Bourita said. Meanwhile, he elaborated, “the kingdom wishes to count on Colombia a reliable partner in Latin America.” Trujilo, who recently paid a visit to Morocco, had come to address King Mohammed VI a message from Colombia’s President Ivan Duque, according to Morocco’s official outlet MAP. The newspaper did not provide details about the content of the Colombian presidential message to the King, however. Judging from Bourita’s subsequent comments, though, the message had to do with the Latin American country’s readiness to consolidate the growing friendship with Morocco. While Colombia pledges to accompany Morocco’s efforts towards a politically negotiated settlement, Rabat promises to “support President Duque’s actions for peace and stability.” Bourita explained that Trujilo’s visit to Rabat coincided with the 40th year since Rabat and Bogota established diplomatic ties. The commemoration, he said, was a further occasion to stress “the importance of giving a new impetus to the bilateral relations” by being more active on each other’s side when it comes to crucial issues on the world stage. “We are like-minded countries on a variety of issues, and I hope that the outcome and decisions we arrived at today will give more depth to our relationship,” Bourita said, noting the spirit of “mutual dialogue” that has traditionally characterized the ties between Morocco and its Latin American partner. He concluded by stressing that Morocco is “grateful” to both the Colombian government and Congress for “constantly supporting Morocco’s [Western Sahara] position.” Colombia’s renewed commitment to friendship with Morocco comes in the midst of what looks like a series of impressive diplomatic victories for Morocco in Latin America. Just last week, Bourita embarked on a Latin American tour with the overt goal of collecting both diplomatic and political momentum in the region, especially on the intricate Western Sahara question. An outpouring of positive signals has since come from the region, with Brazil, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Barbados all announcing support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.

Rabat – Many come to attend one of the myriad festivals Morocco has to offer, alongside local music fans. In Fez, the Festival of World Sacred Music is already in full swing. This week marks the start of the Mawazine Festival in the capital of Rabat, and the Gnaoua Festival in Essaouira. Here is a breakdown of events for the summer of 2019: From June 14 to 22 The Festival of World Sacred Music in the ancient city of Fez has been recognized by the United Nations as “an event contributing significantly to dialogue among cultures.” Every year it draws music fans from around the globe to experience performances by internationally famous rock stars as well as Sufi musicians. Now celebrating its 25th anniversary, this year’s festival will feature performances by Nass el Ghiwane and Youssou Ndour. From June 20 to 23 The annual Gnaoua Festival in Essaouira has drawn up to half a million visitors to the seaside city with a mix of jazz, rock, pop, and traditional Gnaoua acts. Indigenous to North Africa, trance-inducing Gnaoua music is a fusion of pre-Islamic African and Sufi elements.  In addition to a full roster of traditional Gnaoua performers, artists including Baloji, Moh! Kouyaté, and desert blues superstars Tinariwen will take the stage this year. From June 21 to 29 This festival, started in 2001, boasts six stages located in the capital of Rabat and the city of Sale across the river. Each stage has a different focus, including international, discovery, world music, and an oriental stage dedicated to regional artists.  The popular festival lasts eight days and draws millions of music fans. This year the event features artists such as the Black Eyed Peas, Mashrou Leila, and Najwa Karam. From June 28 to July 1 Held at the end of June every year, the Sefrou Cherry Festival is on the Unesco List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Located about 20 miles from the city of Fez, every year Sefrou hosts a range of performances and cultural experiences during its Cherry Festival. Popular amongst locals and tourists alike, the festival started in 1920 and features a beauty contest to crown the annual Miss Cherry.   From July 3 to 6 The Timitar Music Festival showcases local Amazigh (Berber) musicians and international acts every year in Agadir. The festival website states the event is “dedicated to the dialogues between Amazigh artists and musicians from various horizons.”  Now in its 16th year, this edition of the festival will include performers such as Najat Aatabou, DJ Ali T, and Eugenio Bennato. Stars late July Every year artists and visitors flock to Asilah’s medina for a month-long art festival. The event serves both as an opportunity for artists to sell their work, and as a forum for dialogue between cultures.  During the festival, the Hassan II International Forums Center offers a series of lectures for writers, musicians, artists, and spectators alike. Located in the Atlantic Coast about 40 kilometers south of Tangiers, Asilah’s walled medina features murals painted annually by local and international artists, a fitting complement to the annual festival.
 September 13 to 15 As the summer begins to fade, the Oasis Festival descends on Marrakech in mid-September. A new edition to the festival roster in Morocco, the electronic music event made its debut in 2015. Oasis quickly earned recognition, and ranked among the top music festivals that year. Performers are still being added to the program, but currently Four Tet, Jayda G, and François X are among the artists scheduled to perform during the three-day event.

Rabat – On June 18, Mr. Valerian Shuvaev, Ambassador of Russia in Morocco, met with the delegation from tr.  The delegation was visiting Morocco from June 17 to 20. The Russian Embassy in Morocco tweeted about the visit via its official Twitter account. The tweet included photos of the reception organized by Shuvaev in honor of the delegation from the Military Academy.  This visit comes at a time when Morocco is making intense efforts to set up a local military industry through joint-ventures with Spanish, Belgian and British companies specializing in the manufacture of weapons. During King Mohammed VI’s visit to Russia in March 2016, the two parties discussed strengthening economic and political ties. Morocco aimed, indirectly, at securing Moscow’s support for its position on the Western Sahara conflict and the country’s Autonomy Plan. The two countries signed a cooperation agreement during the king’s visit. The agreement concerns the mutual protection of classified information in the military and military-technical field, as well as a joint statement on the counteraction of international terrorism. The accord aims at guaranteeing mutual protection of secret information exchanged or produced within the framework of military and military-technical cooperation between the two countries.

Rabat – Abdeljalil Lahjomri, the Permanent Secretary of the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco, received the 2019 “Grand Prix de la Francophonie” from the French Academy.  The Academy annually awards one intellectual who has contributed to the development of the French language throughout the world. The current director of the Collège Royal of Rabat was praised for his academic career and achievements as the head of the Academy of the Kingdom of Morocco, and received €15,000. Lahjomri was awarded, on June 20, the highest distinction of the 64 prizes and medals that make up the 2019 Palmarès of the French Academy. The Moroccan intellectual tied with the Czech poet Petr Kral. The Academy chose the winners on merit, without any application submissions, on the basis of the academic performance of each intellectual. Lahjomri said he was “honored to win this prestigious distinction which recognizes Morocco’s place on the international level and is a credit to the academic work done by and in Morocco.”  He added that he is “even happier because it is a recognition of Morocco, the Kingdom’s Academy, and the rich and ancestral Moroccan culture.” The French Academy, founded in 1635, is an assembly of 40 members elected for life by vote of the members of the Academy. These 40 ‘Academicians’, a term specific to the Academy, carry the name of ‘Immortals’ as death is the only way they lose their title.  The Academy is the guardian institution of the French language and the updating of its dictionary. It is composed of poets, novelists, playwrights, literary critics, philosophers, historians, scientists, and, by tradition, high-ranking military men, statesmen, and religious leaders, who have “all particularly illustrated the French language.”

Rabat – Some words remain unaltered, while others have been changed to varying degrees. Additionally, some Arabic words used in Morocco are used in a different context than within Moroccan Standard Arabic (MSA). Although many Moroccans can understand speakers from the Arabian Peninsula, the reverse cannot always be said. There are some Arabic speakers who argue that Moroccan colloquial Arabic, also called Darija, is not a “true” Arabic dialect, but rather a variant of North African languages. Making matters more complex, each region also has its own distinct dialect. This is probably why it’s one of the most obscure dialects to learn since it’s the most geographically limiting variety of Arabic. It is also probably the most difficult Arabic dialect to understand. When I first heard it, Moroccan Arabic sounded like the people are always appalled. It has a characteristic cluster of harsh consonants that once made me think the lives of Moroccans were soap operas. After two years of living with the language, I learned to at least listen for “sdemtini” before making that assumption (“How could you say that to me?”). Over time, I understood it’s just a very strong language. I think it’s worth learning because it brings me closer to people and the culture that I wouldn’t otherwise get to know. When I arrived, people taught me the curse words. People I’d just met had me echo profanities, which turns out to be a great way to make friends. My new friends insisted I wasn’t prepared for life in Morocco until I could call someone a sonofa and then tell them to screw off. These words have turned out to be useless. When my mouth mimics “Khara” (crap), it’s like telling a one-liner. It could make a robber with a knife to my cheek laugh. I can’t intimidate in Arabic and it doesn’t make sense to be so serious in a language I don’t understand. Besides, people don’t say those words to me. On the streets of Tetouan (near Tangier), they sing at me, “mon amie” or use racial slurs, which none of my new friends had had the courage to teach me. Standing out in the small city has its own joke and the punchline, or whatever people are calling out when they see me, is in Arabic. For this reason, I learned to appreciate the language barrier. Still, there’s real value in learning individual words. I know about a hundred and fifty. I say what I want by stringing words together: “(Srwall dyali sreer ‒ lioum shems schroona bzef!) My pants too small ‒ today sun very hot! ” It makes friends giggle. I lie to the people selling roses in the street, “(Hedi? Ana feeya assassiya) This? I am allergic.” There are slang expressions that primarily men use. Men and myself: “deka” for “beverage,” “tcharreyah” for “calm down,” and “la-az” for “hell yeah.” Then there are times when I make my own expressions. “You are the fish of my love,” (unta l’hout dial hobbi) I told a man. In his near-native English, he told me that was so sweet. In the break room at work, I explore things like syllabic stress and word choice. Once, my coworker, Mounir, and I got on to the topic of surviving prison in Morocco ‒ talking hypothetically ‒ and he demonstrated how to say “Salam Walaikum” with the right intonation and stress to be taken as a top dog. He puffed up his chest, “Sah-lahmu-Walaykoum,” his torso said. I just laughed. I could never. Non-verbal communication is still reliable. There is a gesture that looks sort of like a cupped hand while the other hand goes over the heart. It is a kind way of asking, “lebess?” or “are you doing well?” A good answer, if not  “humdulilah” is to return the gesture with more assurance. Because most Moroccans are multilingual, it’s possible to get around on English or French. However, without learning Moroccan Arabic, or at least establishing solid listening comprehension skills, I can see that there’s a side of Morocco I’m missing out on. It’s the side that includes what the hell anybody’s ever talking about. For example, I don’t know what the homeless woman on my block, Fatima, is always screaming about and because her distressed voice pulsates in the background of an otherwise quiet neighborhood, I’d like to. When I am out, I want to know things like, why are those guys laughing? What does the Call to Prayer actually sound like? Did the cashier’s tone imply something rude? Why is that couple yelling and whose side should I be on? If I nod will it be obvious I have no idea what’s happening? How much did he say that soap was? Why are those guys still laughing? This is the Morocco I don’t yet have access to. Instead of getting serious about Arabic, I just use it as a tool to bring others closer. With a cheesy smile and sloppy pronunciation, I use my Arabic to jokingly hit on friends, greeting them by enthusiastically saying, “Rzella!” “gorgeous!”

Rabat – While planning our weekend getaway to Fez, we read blogs and traveler’s tips for the city. Some claimed it was absolutely necessary to hire a tour guide in order to effectively see the city, and others warned of potential scams and emphasized the value of exploring on your own.  A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Fez’s medina is over a thousand years old and is Morocco’s biggest and arguably most complicated medina.  The narrow streets are lined with vendors selling leather shoes, lanterns, argan oil, spices, and food of all kinds – even camel meat. Because of Fez’s size and complexity – and since we only had one full day in town – we ultimately decided to hire a guide for Saturday afternoon but explore on our own until then.   We arrived on Friday evening and wandered the streets before dinner.  Without a guide, and often without a map – since even an online map can’t keep track of all Fez’s twists and turns – we made our way to and from dinner and took in the sites along the way.   On Saturday morning we continued exploring on our own.  We wanted to check out an overlook of the city and knew this wouldn’t be part of a tour.  While having a guide has benefits, going without one is a great way to see the city. If you go alone, you’re able to dictate what you see and when – and if you aren’t in a rush you can get lost along the way, likely finding some shops and streets off the beaten path. Saturday afternoon we made our way to Bab Boujeloud and found a guide to accompany us – many of them gather around this main entrance to the medina and offer to lead groups of tourists. It’s possible to prearrange tours, but we felt we could better negotiate a price and dictate what we wanted to see if we met up with one at an entrance. Our guide was friendly and outgoing. His English was excellent, and he told us he spoke six other languages.  He was able to bring us from place to place and ensure we saw the top attractions – ancient schools, tanneries, the university – without wasting time getting lost. While walking from stop to stop he shared facts about Fez’s architecture and history that we wouldn’t have otherwise learned.   Some of the blogs we read while researching warned that tour guides are only in this business for the commission they receive from your purchases along the way.  While this was certainly part of the experience – we were brought to numerous stores where it was obvious our guide knew the owners – as long as you know what you’re getting into, this shouldn’t be a problem.  We told our guide we weren’t so much interested in shopping as we were in seeing the city and, for the most part, he respected this request. Following the end of our tour and feeling confident in our ability to navigate out of the medina, we let our guide leave us alone to walk around a little longer, only to end up walking in a large circle- instead of exiting the medina.  But getting turned around just meant we got to see more. Exploring Fez with or without a guide presents an opportunity to interact with Fez locals while you travel – either by talking with your guide or inevitably asking someone for directions. All of us felt people in Fez, compared to other Moroccan cities, were particularly willing to help tourists find their way. On reflection, we were happy we found a guide but equally thankful to have had a chance to wander around by ourselves.

By Madeleine Handaji Rabat – A crashing sound comes from outside the window as the man selling bread overturns his cart for the third time today, to shrieks of chastisement from his elderly mother.  The Thursday delivery of carcasses adds to the chaos as shouts of instructions join the angry mother’s cries. On the side street, a fight breaks out as the man who sells used cardboard boxes knocks over the local drunk’s liter bottle of cheap Spanish wine. A British woman married to a Moroccan, I spent the last two years living in Casablanca’s Derb Sultan, to be more specific the butcher and grill shop square known as Baladiya.  Kindly taxi drivers often ask me if I’m sure I want to go there, offering alternative destinations and my husband’s Aunt waits in the car when she comes to drop off Mechoui or to take me to the more high-class area of Maarif or the Corniche.  None of my family members or friends visiting Morocco have ever seen my flat above a school in a smoke-filled, noisy, grubby, backstreet but they are missing out. Since having a baby we have moved closer to my in-laws (this is a good thing), and are enjoying the quiet life in the countryside close to Essaouira.  My friends are already queuing up to visit and I think my mother may have bought a Royal Air Maroc season ticket, if such a thing exists.  While I love walking amongst the Argan trees with my son and sitting on our roof terrace in the evenings listening to the silence and the crickets, I find myself missing a key element. I don’t know our neighbors. When I said my friends coming over to visit are missing out, I mean that they will never have the opportunity to meet Khaled Saaydi, 34, the butcher who runs an illegal grill shop next to our building in Casablanca. A genial giant, he smiles and jokes with everyone, but has a very, very short fuse.  This said, his explosions of rage are strongly bedded in his sense of community and a will to protect those around him. He is often seen sharing a mint tea with the local parking attendant after a good long row over cars parked in front of the school at picking-up time. Nor will they have the chance to get to know Mohamed Alloui, 80, a tiny, bent over an old man who has lived in the building opposite ours since he was born. Having spent 10 years in prison for dissidence, Mohamed lives a hand to mouth existence, relying largely on the generosity of his neighbors to survive.  Throughout the year, but more particularly during Ramadan, my husband and I take him food and sit with him in his filthy, small salon as he eats. He tells stories of life before prison, his failed attempts to become an undocumented migrant (on one occasion he ended up in Albania having got on the wrong boat), and growing up during the French protectorate. They miss out, too, on seeing Khadija Oufikir, 67, a fierce local matriarch who once broke into my flat when we were traveling. Her criminal endeavor had one goal; thoroughly cleaning the flat and doing our laundry before we returned from the UK. Khadija becomes poorer and poorer every day as her eldest son, the breadwinner, is in prison for unpaid cheques but this does not dampen her generosity.  Every Friday, she offers to make couscous (knowing that I have only managed once to successfully produce the Moroccan delicacy), every holiday she brings a lavish breakfast of honey dripped cakes and biscuits, and every time I see her she gives her cheeky smile and her dark eyes twinkle. These are just three of the twenty or more people I could mention. What I miss about Casablanca’s bustling streets is the interactions with my neighbors who, despite the barriers of culture and language, made me feel like a valued member of the community. Having lived in London, Oxford, Calais, Marbella, Strasbourg, and the English countryside, I can say from experience that the Moroccan sense of community is without peer. Although many interactions with my neighbors were, at best, bizarre, I hope to be able to get to know my community in Essaouira and learn to love them as much as I did those in Casablanca. While I hope no one brings me half a dead, unplucked chicken at midnight (yes, this did happen), and there will be no need for the local car parking attendant to chase a rat out of my office with a carving knife, I am sure that the generosity and warmth of Moroccans is not limited to the backstreets of Casablanca, and that we will enjoy making memories in our new community.

Rabat -A Moroccan national has been detained in Germany on suspicion of anti-semitic hate speech, which is a criminal offense in the European country. On Friday, June 21, police announced the arrest of the Moroccan national, who is accused of “threatening, insulting and spitting” at two Jews in Hamburg, a port city in northern Germany. The two Jewish men called the police for help, according to Associated Press After a confrontation with a police officer, the Moroccan national allegedly tried to escape. “He turned to the two men and spat at them,” AP reported. The security services added in their statement that the Moroccan national, who spoke in Arabic and German, attempted to resist, which caused them to handcuff him. German media said that the two men involved in the incident were a rabbi and a member of the German Jewish community. While police initially detained the Moroccan national for anti-Semitism, he was then released pending further investigations into the circumstances of the case. Volksverhetzung, or incitement to racial hatred, is a punishable offense in Germany under section 130 of the country’s penal code. The crime includes any insulting or denigrating speech in a public place to other citizens reasons for race or religion. Section 130 applies to non-German citizens when the hate speech occurs within German territory. If found guilty of Volksverhetzung, the Moroccan national could face up to five years in prison.

Rabat – The government of Barbados has decided to withdraw its recognition of the self proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). The decision comes after seven years of frozen diplomatic ties between Barbados and Polisario.

Rabat – With over 8,000 refugees from more than 50 countries currently residing in Morocco, the North African state has become both an important transit country for migrants making their way to Europe and a country of permanent residence for thousands fleeing violence and persecution. From Syria, Yemen, Libya, and other inhospitable countries, refugees make their journey to Morocco in search of security and with the hopes of a better future. While many of these migrants simply use Morocco as a temporary stop in the route to Europe, a large number choose to build a life in the North African country. As the first African signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Morocco has historically played an important role in protecting vulnerable peoples searching for a better home. Every year on June 20, the world recognizes World Refugee Day, which was created in 2000 to raise awareness about refugees and migrants around the world. In Morocco, Ministry Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in Charge of Moroccans Residing Abroad and Migration Affairs and High Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Morocco work together to host a series of events for the day every year. Primarily organized by and for refugees in Morocco, the activities are designed to recognize and highlight the achievements of refugees in the country. Recognizing achievements ranging from the best socio-economic integration projects for refugees to the “Refugees Got Talent” art competition, the Ministry honors the efforts of refugees and organizations within Morocco dedicated towards protecting and facilitating the integration of refugees. Aside from recognition, the activities are also designed to raise awareness and help refugees in more direct ways.  Caravans travel to different cities in the days leading up to the celebration to raise awareness about refugees across Morocco and a scholarship for refugee students are also part of the celebrations. Collectively, the activities are designed to reinforce Morocco’s culture of accepting and integrating refugees, and helps to celebrate the achievements of refugees in Morocco and the achievements of the organizations which bring hope and security to these refugees.

Rabat – On June 13, a Turkish observation tower was hit by mortar shells in Idlib, a supposed buffer zone in northwestern Syria still under rebel control.  The attack wounded three Turkish soldiers and damaged facilities and equipment.  Turkey’s Defense Ministry has called this a deliberate attack by Syrian government forces.  Days after the attack, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem announced that Syria does not want to see fighting with Turkey. “We hope that our military and the Turkish military do not fight. This is our principled stance,” al-Moualem said to reporters in Beijing. “What we are fighting is terrorists, especially in Idlib, which is Syrian territory–part of our country.” The Turkish outpost in Idlib originally emerged under a deal with Russia in which Turkey deployed forces at various posts around the northwestern province to prevent escalations between regime and rebel forces. Idlib is occupied by jihadist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Turkish-backed rebels, and approximately three million civilians. Syria and Russia have been putting pressure on Turkey to assist in the disarmament and removal of the dominant HTS force from Syria’s northwest.  Syria and Russia claim that rebel violations in Idlib have prompted heightened military operations, resulting in the attack on the Turkish outpost.  Shortly before the June 13 attack, Russian news agencies reported that Russia and Turkey had successfully arranged a ceasefire in Idlib.  The establishment of a de-escalation zone in the region significantly reduced violence, according to the Russian military.  However, rebel forces in the area denied the claim, and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had previously said that a full ceasefire in Idlib would be impossible.  The Russian reports of a ceasefire have since been disproven, as Idlib faces mounting violence from Syrian and Russian offensives.  “The question now is: what does Turkey want to do in Syria? Turkey is occupying part of Syrian soil, and has a military presence in certain parts of Syria,” al-Moualem said in his Beijing statement.  Turkey has not announced intent to retaliate against Syria for the outpost attack.

Rabat – The multinational company TE Connectivity, the world’s leading manufacturer of sensor and communication systems, opened its second factory at Tangier Automotive City on June 19.  The new unit will support the company’s commercial and industrial transport solutions in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The company, which has a distribution center in Morocco since 2012, opened its first Moroccan factory in 2015, in the export free zone in Tangier.

He added that the site is closer to the customer base, which improves the group’s ability to deliver orders. According to TE Connectivity, the company has continued to invest and grow in Morocco because it is a strategic country in close proximity to customers and European and African markets.

Rabat – Initially scheduled for June 26, the Baccalaureate exam results (regular session) will now be announced Sunday, June 23. Morocco’s Ministry of Education has decided to move up the date of the announcement thanks to the facilitation of the grading process through the use of a computerized system. The results will be announced at 10 am on www.Taalim.ma. For free candidates, the results will announce the site “Tarchihate ” or via the official website of the Ministry of Education: www.men.gov.ma.  Around 441,065 Moroccan students sat for the Baccalaureate exam this year, according to The Ministry of National Education.

Rabat – The results of the experiment, carried out in 40 countries by a team of international scientists, revealed significant differences between nations.  The experiment showed that Switzerland and the Scandinavian nations were the most honest, while China, Morocco, Peru, and Kazakhstan closed the rankings. France, however, followed close behind the Scandinavian countries coming in 10th place, Spain was in 14th place, while Morocco ranked 39th and China came at the bottom of the list. The experiment, which cost $600,000, is unprecedented.  Research assistants placed more than 17,000 identical wallets in various establishments (hotels, banks, police stations, etc.)  About 400 were planted in each country. On average, 40 percent of the wallets without money were returned, compared to 51 percent of those containing money.  Dishonesty apparently does not increase with the amount of money potentially gained, contradicting the vision of a human being purely motivated by money. A remarkably similar phenomenon was observed in almost all countries: the more money the wallet contained, the more people contacted its owner. “When there is money, people suddenly feel like they are stealing, and the feeling is even stronger when the amount increases,” says Christian Zünd, PhD student at the University of Zurich.  Wealth or poverty is not enough to explain the differences between countries, says Alain Cohn, a professor at the University of Michigan. Local cultural values ​​and the political system seem to influence. For example, the more historically strong family ties are in a country, the less the wallets were returned.  Italy appears less civic than France. This may be because people are more used to worrying about their own family group or close community than strangers, says Christian Zünd. The team of researchers from universities in Zurich, Michigan, and Utah believe that this experiment and complementary surveys demonstrate two fundamental drivers of human behavior: altruism and the driving role of self-image and fear of seeing oneself as a thief. “People are more moral than we think; governments ought to use human morality rather than batons,” Alain Cohn says. As for first-place Switzerland, homeland of three of the four co-authors, Alain Cohn said: “Of course, we were happy to see Switzerland at the top of the ranking”.

Rabat – Algerian security services have made multiple arrests of anti-government protesters, who have been rallying against the Algerian regime since February 22. Despite the resignation of former Algerian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and other elites from his era, protesters are determined to continue their protests. The demonstrators are demanding  a major shift into democracy despite warnings from the military. On June 18, Algeria’s military chief of staff General Gaid Salah issued a warning to the protesters, calling on them to respect the army. General Salah said that protesters “hold grudges and animosity towards the army and its command,” describing them as enemies. Throughout the weeks of protests, demonstrators have carried  banners to speak their minds about the transition period and the crisis their country is facing amid the continued unrest. The  slogans include protests against the army, including demands for the resignation of Salah. Salah has been urging the protesters to respect the date scheduled for the election,  July 4, following a transition period. The Constitutional Council in Algeria, however, canceled the election, emphasizing that the conditions are not suitable to hold an election amid unrest. Protesters have been calling for a free and fair elections, emphasizing that they will not stop protesting until the entire Bouteflika cohort leaves political power to a new generation of politicians. Security services in Algeria have initiated crackdowns on protesters, including a high number of arrests throughout the weeks of protests. The arrest of protesters angered opposition political parties. Algerian political party Socialist Forces Front (FFS)  condemned the “systematic repression and violence used” on the protesters during a peaceful march. The party demanded all individuals detained be released immediately.

Rabat – Egyptian popular singer Hakim has issued a statement to apologize to Morocco, football fans, and the Moroccan authorities for the inclusion of the unrecognized flag of the self-proclaimed SADR in the official music video for the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN), “All Together.” The singer, 44,  took to his Facebook page to first express his satisfaction with his selection to be among the singers who will perform the official song for the CAN, which will begin today on June 21 in Egypt. “I was very upset after I received complaints from brothers from Morocco about the appearance of a hostile party in the music video,” said Hakim. He added that it is true that there was a “ super fast” intervention to correct the “unintentional error” from the concerned parties, “but I would like to explain that my role was to sing only. I have no relation with the content of the music video”. “What is more important, I and 99 percent of the Egyptian people only love the Moroccan flag with the green star in a red background. We have never heard of the other hostile side, and we would never imagine the appearance of its unrecognized flag.”  Hakim concluded his statement, saying “long live Morocco, long live Egypt. Moroccan Sahara, Moroccan Sahara, it will always remain Moroccan.” The video, which was posted on the ticketing system for 2019 CAN, angered Moroccans and the Moroccan government, resulting in a backlash. Despite apologies from the organizing committee of the CAN for the inclusion of the unrecognized flag, the Moroccan government issued a statement to reject any provocations that would undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.  The Egyptian Minister of Sports also extended his country’s apologies. The song, “All Together”,  features Hakim along with Nigeria’s Femi Kuti, and Dobet Gnahore from the Ivory Coast. The theme of the song was the diversity and unity in Africa.

Rabat – Since the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War in 2015, more than 7070 civilians have been butchered, with at least 65 percent of these deaths attributed to Saudi-led coalition forces. Added to this number are thousands more who have died from the horrific conditions resulting from the conflict, including malnutrition and disease. Although it may have been Saudi troops launching the missiles which killed these civilians, the equipment used to carry out these attacks have primarily come as imports from the West, especially from the US and UK. However, weapon imports from these two countries may be coming to a screeching halt in the near future. On June 20, government institutions in both the US and the UK decided to suspend the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia for the foreseeable future, with both countries citing concerns with human rights abuses in Yemen, among other things. Meanwhile, amid escalating tensions with Iran coloring the ongoing Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, the decisions have threatened the kingdom with losing its two largest arms suppliers, as both the US and UK remain divided over selling arms to a regime responsible for perpetuating bloodshed in Yemen. America’s divided branches In the United States, debate and controversy arose last month when American President Donald Trump bypassed Congress to push through an $8 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Arguing that escalating aggression from Iran constituted a national emergency, Trump insisted that the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, one of America’s strongest allies, was a matter of extreme urgency, giving him the authority to approve the sale without Congressional consent. However, the move sparked widespread backlash on Capitol Hill, with legislators criticizing the president for his seemingly unconditional support for a regime complicit in the deterioration of human rights in Yemen. Several members of Congress also voiced their suspicion of Saudi Arabia due to the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered by Saudi agents last year in October. This view was corroborated earlier this week, as a UN investigation concluded that there was “credible evidence” that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and other high ranking Saudi officials were involved with the murder. As a result, the US Senate passed – along bipartisan lines – three resolutions to prevent the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. In response, Trump has threatened to veto the Senate decision, which would allow for the sale to continue as planned and give Saudi Arabia a substantial boost to its military strength. In a statement, the White House said that preventing the weapons deal “would send a message that the United States is abandoning its partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing.” Each of the three resolutions passed by very narrow margins, ranging from 53-45 to as narrow as 51-45. Therefore, it is unexpected that any executive veto could be overridden by Congress. An Un-United Kingdom Right alongside the US in propping up Saudi military strength is the UK, which has sold more than $5.9 billion in military equipment to the kingdom since the outbreak of conflict in Yemen.  Overall, 40 percent of British arms exports are destined for Saudi Arabia, where they are primarily used for the kingdom’s ongoing campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, making trade with Saudi Arabia an essential element of the British arms industry. However, recently there has been a substantial outpour in opposition to Saudi Arabia within the UK, with the Labour and Liberal Democratic Parties both calling for an immediate end to arms sales with Saudi Arabia alongside thousands of activists echoing these calls. “No matter what atrocities it has inflicted, the Saudi regime has been able to count on the uncritical political and military support of the UK,” said Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the activist group Campaign Against Arms Trade. “The bombing has created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.” As the US Senate voted to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia, activists in the UK celebrated a major victory, with the prospects for the UK to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia being challenged by British judges. Under UK trade legislation, military equipment cannot be sold to a foreign country if there is a “clear risk” that the armaments could be used in a “serious violation of international humanitarian law.” However, despite the thousands of bodies lining the streets in Yemen, the UK has continued to sell weapons to the Saudi regime. Presiding over the Court of Appeals in London, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton, the second-most senior judge in the UK, said that the government “made no concluded assessments of whether the Saudi-led coalition had committed violations of international humanitarian law in the past, during the Yemen conflict, and made no attempt to do so.” As a result, the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox promised that the government would not issue any new export licenses to Saudi Arabia and its coalition allies for the foreseeable future. With the decision, Saudi Arabia has potentially lost its two largest suppliers of armaments, especially advanced armaments such as drone equipment and precision-guided rockets.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has warned against any attempts that might undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity and its sovereignty over its southern provinces in Western Sahara. At the weekly government council held Thursday, June 20, El Othmani’s cabinet expressed  its strong rejection of attempts to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity, following a mistake by the Africa Cup of Nations’ (CAN) organizing committee who included the Polisario flag in their official 2019 music video. On June 19,  CAN 2019 organizers released the official music video for the tournament, which will take place in Egypt this summer. The video includes the flag of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), a provocative move against Morocco’s territorial integrity. The CAN organizing committee in Egypt later apologized to the Moroccan government, emphasizing that the video was posted without its approval. The Egyptian of Youth and Sports Minister Acraf Sobhi also extended his country’s apologies. Spokesperson of the Moroccan government Mustapha El Khalfi said in a press conference following the government council on Thursday that Morocco “flatly rejects” such actions that “prejudice the national feeling of Moroccans.” The official said that the “institutions concerned will see to it to completely correct any similar issues.” “The agreements signed by our country at the level of the African Union clearly stipulates that this signature can not be interpreted, explained or put forward as a proof or an excuse to undermine the territorial integrity of Morocco,”he added. The move to include SADR’s flag was not the first of its kind as the committee included SADR in the ticketing system in May. The Polisario Front, an unrecognized entity, will not be taking part in the tournament.

Rabat – The World Bank announced on Wednesday, June 20, a $500 million program in support of Morocco’s 2015–2030 Education Reform. The Education Reform aims to emphasize the importance of education, training teachers, and creating new standards for those who wish to work in the sector, as well as securing employment through vocational training.  The $500 million program objectives are to improve the quality of early childhood education.  The World Bank stated that the program is designed to “support improved teaching practices in primary and secondary education, and strengthen the management capacity and accountability along the education service delivery chain in the Program Areas. Only 50 percent of Moroccan children aged 4-5 attended preschool in 2017. “As a condition for learning preparedness, access to quality early childhood education (ECE) is a major focus of the current program,” said the World Bank.  Marie Françoise Marie-Nelly, World Bank Maghreb Country Director said: “In less than 20 years, the country achieved universal access to education for girls and boys, a notable Millennium Development Goals (MDG) achievement. However, learning outcomes have remained stubbornly modest.” Marie-Nelly also added that “This new program intends to promote a more efficient education sector by supporting access to quality pre-primary education for all…”  School dropouts, a lack of basic knowledge, the failure to teach languages, are some of the problems facing the education system in Morocco.  “Drop-out rates are still high and only 53 percent of students enrolled in middle school continue on to high school and less than 15 percent of first-grade students are likely to graduate from high school.  Low levels of daily attendance, teacher absenteeism, and a multilingual environment at school contribute to the low literacy rates in Morocco”, according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Rabat – After Iran shot down a US drone, Trump approved a response strike against the nation Thursday night, but soon canceled the planned military action. Top US politicians spent Thursday debating how to respond to Iran downing an unmanned US drone the morning of Thursday, June 20, amid growing concern that the shooting down of the drone and its fallout could lead to a larger conflict in the region. Trump told reporters Thursday that “Iran made a big mistake” and his “country will not stand for it.” He ultimately approved a military response strike that was to take place early Friday, June 21, morning to limit the threat to civilians, according to the NYT, which cited senior White House officials. US planes and ships were already in position when he later called off the strike.   The motivation behind the president’s last minute change of plans is unclear. It is also unclear if the strike will be carried out at a later date. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) took responsibility for shooting down a US drone on the Iranian coast along the Gulf of Oman.  Tehran claims the drone crossed into Iranian airspace; Washington claims it was an unwarranted attack as the drone was in international airspace. Both sides say they have strong evidence supporting their argument. Thursday’s events were the most recent developments in escalating tension between the two nations. For the past month, Trump has blamed Iran for the explosions of six oil tankers in the region. This occurred alongside Iran’s announcement to break from the 2015 nuclear agreement, which the US pulled out of over a year ago. Following the drone incident, the US Federal Aviation Administration have barred US airlines from flying over parts of the Gulf region because of heightened political and military tensions.

Rabat – The Sale Court of Appeal closed on Thursday, June 20, the hearing of the 24 defendants involved in the killing of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal in December 2018. Six defendants, including one Swiss-Spanish suspect, appeared before the judge at the hearing. The six defendants denied the charges in the preliminary investigation as well as before the investigating judge. The defendants are facing charges of “planning terrorist acts” inside Morocco, targeting tourists, police and gendarmerie members, as well as some tourism sites. The suspects are also facing charges of failing to report a crime, praising terrorism, and the murder of two Scandinavian tourists. Thursday’s hearing is part of a series of court sessions held since May 2. Some of the suspects previously appeared in court for hearings on May 16, May 30, and June 13. During the trial sessions, the four main defendants confessed to the charges filed against them. The list of charges includes: “forming a gang to commit terror crimes and intentionally assaulting the life of persons premeditatedly.” The main suspects will also face charges of inciting people to commit terrorist acts, praising terrorism, and promoting extremism. The two Scandinavian tourists were beheaded, the Head of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation announced after the murder. In December 2018, Moroccan police arrested the 24 suspects on suspicion of involvement in the crime. The suspects included the Swiss-Spanish defendant, Kevin Zoller Guervos who pleaded innocent. Lawyer of the suspects, Hafida Maksaoui, told Morocco World News that the court session of June 20 took place in “very normal conditions.” Zoller Guervos claims to have broken off relations with the other suspects a year ago now, she said.  While the four main suspects confessed, some of the remaining 20 defendants confessed only to some charges, while others completely deny any involvement in the murder. The court may announce the final verdict on Thursday, June 27, Maksaoui told MWN. The lawyer also welcomed the court’s decision to ensure an interpreter for the Swiss-Spanish suspect. On May 30, Zoller Guervos’ lawyer asked the judge to strike initial interrogation recorded by the police after the initial arrest of his client from the record. He added that the statement session at the police did not respect the investigation standards as there was no interpreter sworn-in during his statement. However, during the court session held on May 30, the public prosecutor requested that the initial interview be kept on record, emphasizing that the judicial investigator was speaking in French, the suspect’s first language. It remains to be seen whether the final verdict will be announced on Thursday.

Rabat – Experts from the US State Department’s anti-human trafficking office have determined that Saudi Arabia has recruited child soldiers from Sudan to fight in Yemen’s civil war. Supported by news reports and assessments by human rights groups, the State Department experts have recommended that Saudi Arabia be added to an official list of countries which recruit child soldiers.  However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has shut down these reports.  The Saudi-led coalition deploys up to 14,000 Sudanese soldiers in Yemen at any given time since 2016. Recruits, some as young as 14, have been offered up to $10,000 for their service.  Some State Department officials have argued that the Sudanese soldiers in the coalition are affiliated with Sudan’s military, not Saudi Arabia’s. Sudan was removed from the list of countries that use child soldiers last year but will now be reinstated, according to State Department sources. Officials from Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have denied the recruitment of minors, but did not comment specifically on activities in Yemen.  The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which is backed by the US, has previously denied the use of child soldiers.  However, an independent group of experts to the UN Human Rights Council reported in 2018 that all sides in the Yemen conflict “conscripted or enlisted children into armed forces or groups and used them to participate actively in hostilities.”  Saudi Arabia is a major ally of the US and a primary arms customer. Pompeo’s move comes as US tensions with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, continue to swell.

Rabat – In October 2018, a new coding school opened its doors in Casablanca having since reached over 1,000 students.  3W Academy Maroc is one of several initiatives to combat Morocco’s 24 percent youth unemployment rate. It was founded by Hamza Debbarh, a board member of Education for Employment, a nonprofit organization that trains Moroccan youths and connects them to regional jobs.  “We really believe that coding is a solution for our youth. It is a skill that is going to open doors,” Debbarh said. “If you have skills in coding or web development, you can easily find work in the Moroccan job market. Or you can get freelance jobs in any job market.”  3W Academy was founded in France in 2012. The group also has a branch in Tunisia, and trains more than 1,000 web developers each year.  Although many students enter the school with varying degrees of self-training, the school also attracts students who have no prior experience with or attraction to coding or the tech sector. With free coding workshops, 3W Academy hopes to capture the attention of those otherwise uninterested in the field.  3W Academy offers a three-month web development program, which has a fee with flexible payment options. The school promises prospective students that they will become web developers in four months regardless of their background. Students are also promised employment upon completion of an internship, thanks to a strong network of recruiters and pre-hiring training. One of 3W Academy’s goals is to improve the representation of women in tech, and women make up almost 50 percent of participants in the free coding classes. The three-month program is composed primarily of men, something Debbarh hopes to reform in the future.  3W Academy is looking to establish more campuses in Morocco, ideally in city centers. Debbarh and his team are also planning to make the program accessible to students throughout the Middle East and North Africa by 2020 by launching an online platform. This initiative will also reach the rest of Africa.  Several low-cost or free coding schools have been established throughout Morocco in recent years. The latest is the second branch of 1337 School, which opened in Ben Geurir near Marrakech, joining the ranks of 3W Academy and YouCode in Yousoufia.  “Morocco has joined the freelance revolution,” believes Forbes contributor Jon Younger. “Greater youth technical competence and participation in the tech sector . . . is part of a comprehensive solution to the country’s economic and social problems.”  Professional training in high-demand skills is becoming increasingly accessible to Moroccan youths, of which one in three are university-educated and unemployed. As Morocco’s tech sector rapidly develops, future employment prospects for coding school students are promising.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI today chaired the inauguration of the “Atlantic Free Zone” industrial platform in the Kenitra region, an hour drive from the capital Rabat. An initiative of the French automobile giant PSA Group, the platform is presented as the culmination, but also the start, of a scheme of projects to boost Morocco’s promising automotive sector. Reporting on Thursday’s opening ceremony chaired by King Mohammed VI, Morocco’s official news outlet, MAP, called the Kenitra plant “a project that spurs the development of the national automobile sector and mirrors the excellence of “Made in Morocco”. PSA new Kenitra plant is expected to increase Morocco’s automotive sector’s output to reach an annual production of 100,000 vehicles and “related engines.” During his visit to the French giant’s Kenitra site, the Moroccan King also oversaw the ongoing extension works which are meant to double the group’s current output by 2023. But the staggering output goals were not the only talking points the Kenitra plant’s inaugural day. On the employment front, PSA expects its Kenitra plant to generate as many as 4000 jobs by—also by 2023. After screening the stages of the completion of the Kenitra facilities, PSA shared with guests its vision and goals for the advancement of Morocco’s automotive sector. The group said its ambitions were consistent with Morocco’s leadership goals: Making the country a vibrant investment hub and a full-throated participant in the growth-driving automotive sector at the global level. But the ceremony’s most eventful moment was the unveiling of the Peugeot 208, courtesy of Kenitra factory. Sanguine about the prospects of Morocco’s automobile ecosystem and nodding at PSA’s enthusiastic take on the opportunities that Morocco offers investors, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Morocco’s Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, applauded PSA for keeping its side of the bargain in the completion of the new game changer Kenitra plant. “The infrastructure, the PSA factory and the factories of its subcontractors were carried out under the agreed conditions and within the set deadlines,” Elalamy pointed out. After dwelling on technicalities about the success odds, the quality, and the highly encouraging statistics of PSA Kenitra plants, Elalamy highlighted the upside for both the Moroccan economy and the French giant. By 2018, PSA purchases of Morocco-manufactured parts hit 700 million Euros, far above initial plans. Better still, the company expects to reach its dream 1 billion Euro objective well before 2025, the date it had initially set. Morocco, for its part, has gained in competitiveness and job creation. Jean-Christophe Quemard, PSA executive vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, said that Morocco is part and parcel of the group’s growth and global reach strategies. “It is in the Kingdom that our Group has chosen to set up its Regional Decision Center, and to develop a Research and Development Center integrated in the PSA Group’s global R&amp;D network,” he said. While it vows to bring Morocco’s automotive industry to a higher place in the global market, the French giant seeks to take full advantage of the enormous opportunities the sector already offers. The sector, which currently employs almost 190,000 people and amounts to 65.1 billion Moroccan dirhams in terms of investments, is Morocco’s leading export industry. News of the PSA’s Kenitra venture comes as Morocco makes no secrets about its plans to flex its industrial muscles and become a regional hub and a noticeable presence in global transactions. Earlier this week, the North African country signed agreements with France to improve its performances in the aerospace sector, another golden bullet of Morocco’s Industrial Acceleration Plan. Elalamy, who was also present on that other occasion, said that the string of investment-friendly reforms Morocco has made in recent years is making the country a “privileged destination” for many world renowned manufacturers. “Our approach centered on promoting investments seeks to attract them [investors] to invest in the kingdom and help us complete the ecosystem,” he said.

Rabat – Over the years, Morocco’s Mawazine music festival has included more and more musicians from around the globe – as its eighteenth edition nears it continues to foster tolerance and respect of other cultures. Even as the festival has evolved overtime, it holds true to its long-standing goal to “democratize culture.” The festival exposes as many people to different cultures as possible and, to nearly everyone, for free. The Mawazine Festival-Rhythms of the World began in 2001 under direction from King Mohammed VI to encourage cultural tolerance, openness, respect and dialogue. Maroc Cultures Association, also created in 2001, is a non-profit organization in charge of providing cultural experiences throughout Morocco – the Mawazine Festival and the youth music contest, Generation Mawazine are its main events. More than half of Mawazine’s lineup is dedicated to Moroccan artists and it has historically served as a “springboard” for Moroccan musicians, granting local artists a global platform to share their work. Mawazine also features music from throughout Africa, the MENA region, and around the globe.  Over time, the festival has become more international, hosting well-known artists from around the world like Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and The Weekend. The popular international artists included in the lineup have served as ambassadors to Mawazine, drawing greater international attention to the event, Maroc Cultures Association president Abdeslam Ahizoune said in a written statement. Collaborations between international and local artists, like the 2011 Arabic re-release of American Quincy Jones “Tomorrow” co-directed with the Moroccan producer RedOne, adds to the cultural mixing pot that characterizes Mawazine. While the festival directly supports Morocco’s entertainment industry, it has also boosted Morocco’s economy, generating 22 percent growth in Rabat’s tourism throughout the nine days of music. The association is committed to making culture accessible to everyone and 90 percent of the festival’s 2.5 million attendees go for free. As Mawazine draws foreigners to Rabat to listen live, an additional 4 million people worldwide watch broadcast content from the nearly 600 national journalists and 160 international journalists in attendance. “The media popularity is also accompanied by a presence increasingly noticed on social networks, a sign that the festival brings together youth around an ideal that is common to us: growing together and overcoming differences,” Ahizoune said. This year’s festival will run from June 21st through the 29th and take place across six stages throughout Rabat and its neighboring regions.

Rabat – The world’s 163 countries have been ranked according to levels of peace and security, with Morocco placing 90th. This positions the Kingdom as the 7th most peaceful country in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The Global Peace Index (GPI) is determined yearly by the Institute for Economics &amp; Peace.    The data is calculated by considering “levels of societal safety and security, the extent of ongoing domestic and international conflict, and the degree of militarization.” The GPI also measures “the absence of violence or fear of violence,” called negative peace, along with “the attitudes, institutions, and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies,” or positive peace.  Qatar places first in the MENA region at 31, followed by Kuwait (43), the United Arab Emirates (53), Oman (69), and Jordan (77). In the 82nd position, Tunisia beat out Morocco by just nine spots, and Algeria ranks far below Morocco at 111. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, and Turkey trail far behind.  It may come as no surprise that Libya, Iraq, Yemen, and Syria occupy some of the lowest positions on the list. Syria was ranked the least peaceful country in the world in 2018 but has now been replaced by Afghanistan, leaving Syria at 162. MENA as a whole has become more peaceful in the last year due to fewer deaths from conflict and terrorism, but despite this general improvement, most of the region’s countries still have poor rankings.  Morocco additionally has a Water Events Scale (WES) rating of more than 1.2, which reflects “a tendency towards cooperative handling of water-related disputes” amid increased water scarcity. Morocco ranked second in a list of 32 countries across Europe, MENA, and sub-Saharan Africa, while France placed last.  In recent years GPI records have ranked Morocco higher, coming 75th in 2017 and 77th in 2018.

Rabat – In 2000, the United Nations General Assembly established June 20 as World Refugee day.  Morocco, the first country on the African continent to sign the 1951 Refugee Convention, has played an important role in the lives of thousands of refugees who fled their home countries in search of safety.  While these refugees work to establish their new lives in Morocco, challenges remain for some individuals. In 1951, the United Nations (UN) established the Refugee Convention, sometimes referred to as the Geneva Convention.  The treaty, which established an international definition for “refugee”, outlined their rights as well as the obligations of their host countries. This included the right not to be expelled, the right to work, and the right to education. According to UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) statistics, over 8,000 refugees currently live in Morocco. When war broke out in Syria, a new wave of refugees and immigrants began flowing into Morocco.  The country now hosts refugees and asylum-seekers from over 50 countries. Most hail from Syria, Yemen, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, and other Sub-Saharan African countries.  While some of these individuals move on to other destinations, many remain and make Morocco their home. When the Morrocan government recognized this trend, a new immigration and asylum policy was adopted. Under the instructions of King Mohammed VI, the policy offers new protections for refugees under the National Policy on Immigration and Asylum (NPIA). Established in 2013, the policy includes access to education and the job market. The years following the NPIA proved successful for some of these refugees. Integration into Moroccan society Diyaa, a Syrian shoemaker who fled Damascus, set up a successful business in Casablanca. His family had been making footwear for generations back in Syria. Diyaa used his skills to establish a workshop after settling in Morocco with his wife and two children. In 2016, Diyaa was awarded a prize by the Moroccan Association for the Support and Promotion of Small Enterprises.  Diyaa’s business has grown over the years. He has been able to hire employees to keep up with customer demand. Diyaa gave back to his host country by hiring several Morrocans to his staff, whom he considers his “brothers.” In Kenitra, a group of friends who had escaped the war in Yemen created the first refugee cooperative. The group opened the coop in 2017, a kindergarten called “Hope.” The school, which employs several local teachers, holds classes in classical Arabic instead of Darija, the Morrocan dialect. This has allowed refugee children access to education.  Moroccan kindergartens tend to use the local dialect, when instructing young children. This can be a barrier to those from other countries unable to understand Darija. Elsewhere in the school system, some refugees have difficulty navigating the language barrier.  Many Sub-Saharan refugees, like those from the Ivory Coast and Cameroon can speak French but not Arabic. Refugees lacking Arabic language skills cannot attend classes.  Another issue is employment. Jobs in urban areas can already be hard to find, and a language barrier can make this even more difficult. Refugees also count religious and racial discrimination amongst the difficulties they find when trying integrate into Moroccan society. Despite the roadblocks, UNHCR protection chief Volker Türk has praised Morocco for its efforts.  On a visit to Rabat coinciding with the fourth anniversary of the NPIA, Türk spoke about how refugees can drive development. “It is important to see refugees as an opportunity and a catalyst for change,” explained the UNHCR representative.

Rabat – In her report on the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in December last year, Agnes Callamard has provided a minute-by-minute account of the journalist’s execution and dismemberment inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. The report was released yesterday, June 19, prompting immediate backlash from Saudi authorities.  The report painstakingly recounts the circumstances of Khashoggi‘s killing, including names and the movements of the 15-member hit team sent from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul. “Joints will be separated … If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished,” the report quotes one of the murder suspects,  making for grim reading. Hours after the report’s release, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir took to  twitter to denounce the report, saying there is “nothing new” in Callamard’s findings. “The report contains clear contradictions and baseless allegations, which challenges its credibility,” Jubeir said. MeanwhileTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underlined the report’s findings on the Saudis “guilt”, noting that they had “knowledge” and have taken a “wrong” attitude towards Turkey. “They will account for this and they will pay a price,” Erdogan said, rejecting Riyadh’s claim that the murder, which took place in Turkey, was a domestic affair. At the end of her report, Callamard urged the office of the secretary-general (UNSG), to launch an international criminal investigation and called for sanctions against the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). After the release of Callamard’s investigation, a spokesman of Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations said that the UN chief could only launch an inquiry with authorization from “a competent intergovernmental body”. The US administration seems hesitant to move against its Gulf ally Saudi Arabia due to ongoing confrontation with Iran. Despite calling Khashoggi’s murder an “unacceptable and horrible crime”, US President Donald Trump has stressed that he intends “to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia,” the US ally against rival Iran. The policy supports the US administration’s wish to maintain Washington’s business and political interests in the region, including reported multi-billion-dollar arms sales.

Rabat – The organizing committee of the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN) has extended its apologies to Morocco’s authorities, moroccan football fans, and the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) for including the Polisario flag in their official music video.  The committee explained the inclusion as an “unintentional” mistake.  In a statement, the organizing committee offered its apologie for the appearance of  an “unrecognized” flag. The CAN 2019 organizers said that the official video was released “without the approval” of the committee. “The organizing committee of the competition reaffirms its full respect to the brotherly kingdom of Morocco, and its national sovereignty.” Moroccan fans were surprised to discover that the official music video entitled “All Together” shows the flag of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) This is not the first mistake the  committee have made concerning Morocco’s territorial integrity, having initially listed Polisario in ticketing system for CAN 2019. FRMF submitted a letter to the Egyptian football federation, the committee, and the African Confederation of Football (CAF) to protest the move. In response, Egypt removed the separatist group from the ticketing website

Rabat – Waiting at the doorstep of Europe, thousands of migrants and refugees in North Africa see the journey across the Mediterranean as the final obstacle between the hardships of their past and the hope of safety in Europe. Yet, this crossing is a larger obstacle than many first perceive, and the journey across the Mediterranean remains one of the most dangerous routes for migration in the world, with thousands of migrants dying along the path every year. For the most fortunate of these migrants, the journey will be interrupted by an NGO or passerby willing to help them along to Europe. For the least fortunate of these migrants, the makeshift boats in which they attempt the journey become waterlogged coffins in the salty waters of the Mediterranean. Floating adrift in the Mediterranean Sea, 27 migrants were found and rescued by a Spanish passenger ferry on June 20; however, less fortunate were the additional 22 migrants previously on board who did not survive the journey. No bodies were found aboard the ship, and according to the rescued passengers, the deceased were thrown overboard into the sea during the course of the journey. Corroborating this claim, an NGO confirmed that a migrant ship carrying 49 people did indeed leave from the Moroccan city of Al Hoceima en route to Spain. Fleeing from violence, poverty, and persecution, tens of thousands of migrants attempt to make their way to Europe each year, their resolve called into question each time one of their traveling companions falls along the way. Though thousands continue to attempt the crossing, the journey across the Mediterranean has never been more dangerous, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reporting that nearly two percent of migrants and refugees who attempt the crossing will never reach their destination. Despite the risks, the hope for a better future is still enough to drive thousands to attempt the journey, regardless of how grim their chances of survival are. With little sympathy from either the Moroccan or European governments, many of these refugees are left to fend for themselves, constantly threatened by human trafficking, violence, arrest, and harassment. While these deaths are not the first, nor will they be the last, they serve as a painful reminder of the lengths to which migrants are willing to go in the hopes of securing a better future for themselves and their loved ones.

Rabat – Iran-aligned Yemeni Houthi rebels attacked a power station in Saudi Arabia’s southern province of Jizan with a cruise missile on Wednesday, June 19. The attack, which was reported by the group’s Al-Masirah TV has, further fueled the bitter standoff between Iran and the United States. On Thursday, June 20, the Saudi-United Arab Emirates (UAE) led military coalition in Yemen confirmed that rebel Houthi forces had launched a projectile into a desalination plant in Al Shuqaiq but reported no fatalities or damage to the facility. “The conflict is escalating… and, according to the Houthis’ military spokesperson, the coming days will witness more surprises for Saudi Arabia, especially via reprisal attacks by cruise missiles and drone operations,” said Al Jazeera’s Mohammed al-Attab, hinting that there is “no end in sight” for the ongoing conflict. The Houthis have been at war with the Saudi-UAE led military coalition in Yemen since 2015, when the coalition launched a massive air campaign. The campaign was aimed at reinstalling the internationally acknowledged government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was overthrown by the Houthis. The group has stepped up missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia in recent weeks as tensions continue to increase between Iran and the United States, with the Houthis seen as allies of Iran and the US siding with Saudi Arabia. Pentagon spokeswoman, Navy Commander Rebecca Rebarich said such attacks were “a significant cause for concern and [put] innocent lives at risk”. According to the Saudi Press Agency SPA, coalition officials said Saudi security forces were working to determine what type of projectile had been used. “We are closely monitoring the situation and continuing to consult with our partners and allies,” said Sarah Sanders, White House spokeswoman, amid mounting fears that a military confrontation could erupt between Tehran and Washington.

Rabat – Australian-based Instagram boutique Meshki has released its 2019 summer collection, called “Meet Us In Morocco.” Each year, the boutique that has taken Instagram by storm, picks a different location as the focus of its summer collection. California’s Venice Beach and the Italian Riveria have been in the spotlight, but this year is all about Morocco as a whole. “Our latest summer collection is inspired by the beautiful intricacies of Moroccan architecture and it’s iconic heat,” the brand said.

Rabat – The organizing committee of the 2019 African Cup of Nations has released the competition’s official music video. However, the video, released on Wednesday June 19, could be seen as a direct provocation to Morocco’s territorial integrity as it displays the flag of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) . The music video entitled “All Together,”  is performed by renowned Egyptian singer Hakim, along with Nigeria’s Femi Kuti, and Dobet Gnahore from the Ivory Coast. The song’s lyrics speak about unity and diversity in Africa. However, a  map of Africa appears at the end of the video, showing the flag of the self-proclaimed SADR.  The inclusion of the flag is a provocative move as any support for the Polisario front is an ultimate red line for Morocco’s foreign policy and national sovereignty.  The action is even more surprising as SADR is not among the squads who have qualified for the 2019 tournament, due to begin on June 21. The CAN committee and Egypt are both well aware Morocco’s position regarding such unfriendly actions towards its territorial integrity, casting doubt on the inclusion being a coincidence. In May, the committee listed Polisario in ticketing system for CAN 2019, a move which did not go unnoticed. To protest the inclusion, Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) submitted a letter to Egypt’s football federation, requesting clarification on the apparent provocation. FRMF also submitted a letter to the African Football Confederation (CAF) to protest the move. Morocco’s complaint was received with a nod as the organizing committee removed the flag of the separatist group from the competition’s ticketing system, claiming it was an administrative accident. It remains to be seen whether the FRMF will file a complaint against the most recent provocative move from the organizing committee.

Rabat – UK’s development finance institution CDC Group will acquire an equity stake of 5% in BMCE Bank of Africa through a primary capital injection of $200 million. The two groups announced the investment in a press release. According to the press release, CDC’s investment will help accelerate BMCE’s expansion across Africa while also allowing the Bank to leverage CDC’s wide in-country networks. The British institution has over 70 years of investment experience in Africa and in Asia, with more than 700 businesses in its African portfolio. CDC is strongly committed to the continent and plans to invest up to $4.5 billion in Africa across different sectors and through various investment solutions by 2022. CDC invests in financial institutions to advance financial inclusion and bring better access to affordable finance for individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to help them strengthen their communities. The strategic partnership between BMCE and CDC represents one of the largest single investments by a British institution in the Moroccan financial sector and is a testimony to their joint vision and commitment to strengthening Africa’s economy and improving people’s lives. Access to affordable and innovative finance, financial education, and business advice is essential to ensure economic development. This is particularly true for SMEs, which constitute the backbone of Africa’s economy and are a key driver of economic growth. As these businesses grow, they create jobs and wealth in their communities. The promotion of environmentally sustainable development is an important component of the partnership. BMCE and CDC recognize that sustainable development can serve as a driver to enhance economic growth in African economies and empower African societies.  As part of their work in this area, BMCE and CDC seek to ensure that environmental and social risks are taken into consideration at the transaction level and to work with companies to help them incorporate sustainable practices in their business operations. “The ultimate goal of our agreement goes beyond the US$ 200 million investment,” said Othman Benjelloun, Chairman and CEO of BMCE Bank of Africa. “Rather, it is an alliance aimed at developing Morocco and Africa and ensuring that Africa’s human capital achieves a sense of fulfillment”. “Investing in financial institutions is a powerful mechanism through which we can deliver impact at scale,” said Nick O’Donohoe, CEO of CDC Group. “The capital markets in countries such as Morocco are integrated across Africa and are critical to the success of more economically challenging environments in the region. We see these countries as regional hubs, strong platforms from which to provide affordable finance, goods, and services to millions of people,” added O’Donohoe. “Our support will allow the Bank to grow its offering, especially in the SME segment, deepen penetration of banking services and promote financial inclusion for all,” he pointed out. Present in 31 countries throughout Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America, BMCE Bank of Africa is today the most internationally oriented Moroccan banking group. The bank employs more than 15,200 people around the world, with more than 1,675 branches serving nearly 6.6 million customers. The BMCE bank is also a major environmental player, with a hand in 14 001 certified, and social responsibility projects.  The bank’s Medersat.com program promotes education and community development in rural areas in Morocco and Sub-Saharan Africa. Innovative sustainable financing programs and products in partnership with major international financial institutions add to its environmental portfolio.  Since its establishment in 1948, the UK owned CDC Group has been investing in Africa and South Asia with the aim of supporting economic development to create jobs. With net assets of $6.48 billion, CDC takes a flexible approach and provides capital in all its forms, including equity, debt, mezzanine, and guarantees, to meet businesses’ needs and achieve development impact.

Rabat –  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) reiterated its “constant” position in favor of Morocco’s territorial integrity during a meeting of the 24 Committee of the United Nations held in New York. The representative of the UAE said at the meeting that her country maintains its “constant” position and support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan submitted to the UN in 2007 as a pragmatic and realistic initiative  to definitively settle the Western Sahara conflict. During the meeting, Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale defended Morocco’s firm position, maintaining  that the North African country would not accept any political solution that would undermine its sovereignty over southern provinces in Western Sahara and national unity. The UAE acknowledged Morocco’s efforts to reach a definitive solution which  the UN Security Council described as “ serious and credible” in all its resolutions. The Gulf country also said that it supports the political process under the exclusive auspices of the UN Secretary General to achieve a consensual and mutually accepted political solution to the dispute. In recent months, reports of alleged friction between Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have emerged. The alleged tension came from a rumored shift of position by Morocco’s gulf allies regarding the conflict. Amid escalating rumors of the alleged tension between the two countries, Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum reported in April that the UAE ambassador to Morocco, Ali Salem Al Kaabi, had left the North African country at a “sovereign” Emirati request. Neither Morocco nor the UAE confirmed the news.  The rumors of the alleged rift between Morocco and UAE increased when Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita excluded the country from his tour to the Gulf in April. During the visit, Bourita focused on the historical roots of Morocco’s diplomatic ties with the Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia. Bourita emphasized Morocco’s wish to preserve and strengthen those relationships.  Morocco’s historically positive relationship with Saudi Arabia also faced scrutiny when pro-Saudi government television Al Arabiya aired a documentary which challenged Morocco’s Western Sahara position. Supposed tensions between Morocco and its Gulf allies may also have increased with Morocco’s unwillingness to side with them on certain regional issues. Recently, Morocco warned that military intervention in Yemen and  Libya is a recipe for humanitarian disaster. The Moroccan government then withdrew from the war in Yemen for citing humanitarian concerns. During Bourita’s visit to Saudi Arabia in April, however, Saudi Arabia reassured Morocco of its support for the territorial integrity of the North African country and of ongoing  historical diplomatic ties between the two countries.

By Morgan Hekking Rabat – An American military drone has been shot down by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), sparking concern that a major military confrontation may be on the horizon.  Tehran argues that the surveillance aircraft, a MQ-4C Triton, was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile after flying into Iranian airspace. Meanwhile, US officials maintain that the drone was shot down in international territory. The two alternate reports of the event have not been reconciled.  Iran’s Foreign Ministry has condemned the “violation of Iran’s borders” and warned “of the consequences of such illegal and provocative measures.” Conversely, US Navy Captain Bill Urban asserted that “no US aircraft were operating in Iranian airspace” on Thursday.  The US drone was shot down near the Strait of Hormuz, where two oil tankers were attacked on June 12, allegedly by Iran. Iran has denied responsibility for the attacks on the oil tankers, as well as similar attacks in the area that occurred on May 12. Although US President Donald Trump has recently deployed troops, aircraft carriers, and B-52 bombers to the Middle East, he insists that he does not seek war with Iran. The US State Department has sent Brain Hook, the US Special Representative for Iran, to discuss “Iran’s regional aggression” with members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The shootdown sent “a clear message” to the US. Iran does “not have any intention for war with any country, but we are ready for war,” said the commander of IRGC. “Borders are our red line. Any enemy that violates the borders will be annihilated.”

Tan-Tan – The Tan-Tan Moussem is an annual gathering of nomadic tribes from Morocco and from other parts of north-west Africa.  Originally a spontaneous meeting of peoples, the gathering first took the form of a “moussem,” a celebration of a pious person, in 1963. It celebrated the life of Mohamed Laghdaf, a resistant to French and Spanish colonialism in the region, who is buried in a mausoleum in Tan-Tan. The moussem was banned by authorities in 1979 due to political concerns in the region, but was revived in 2004 with the help of UNESCO and the Ministry for Tourism.  In 2008 it was listed on the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list, which recognizes practices worldwide that celebrate cultural identity and promote respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. This year once again, the festival organizers set up hundreds of nomad tents around a large arena just outside Tan-Tan, near the town’s camel racing track.  These powerful symbols of nomadic identity provided a place for different tribes and family groups to meet, and to shelter during the day from the sun and strong winds. People flocked to watch camel and horse parades, tbouridas (a traditional Moroccan horsemanship performance), camel races, and cultural performances.  The guest of honour this year was Mauritania, present alongside the United Arab Emirates who funded the construction of the camel racing track in 2016. In the center of town, festival participants sold crafts in an undercover market. Every evening, hundreds watched musical performances by Moroccan and regional artists at a stage on the main square.  The 2019 Tan-Tan Moussem was a vivid tribute to nomadic and saharan practices as well as a patriotic celebration of Moroccan cultural identity in the region.

By Kawtar Ennaji Rabat – French car manufacturer, PSA Group, is set to inaugurate its new Kentira plant on Thursday, June 20. The group’s industrial project in Morocco is based on the creation of a complete automotive ecosystem. Construction work on the plant, the first PSA Peugeot Citroën industrial complex in Morocco, began in the Kenitra region in 2016. The industrial agreement for this project was signed on June 19, 2015, in Rabat by Carlos Tavares, CEO of PSA Peugeot Citroën, and Moulay Hafid Elalamy. The plant reinforces the PSA ecosystem in Morocco and plans to produce 200,000 cars per year by 2020, exceeding the 100,000 expected in the original 2015 contract. The PSA group has mobilized an investment of €560 million to fund the development of its projects in Morocco. The plant in Kenitra will help to meet the growth of sales in the region and to make the Middle East &amp; Africa a major pillar of profitable growth for the group.  The PSA Group hopes to reach a local purchase volume exceeding €1 billion by 2020 and a local integration rate of 60% as a start and 80% by the end of the project. “We have exceeded €1 billion of local sourcing, which was planned for 2022 and we will reach €2 billion in 2023,” said the office of the Minister of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy, Moulay Hafid Elalamy. On the employment side, the PSA Group’s workforce in Morocco, which stood at 350 in 2017, is expected to reach 2,200 by the end of 2019 in addition to 20,000 indirect jobs. The group expects that 90 percent of production will be directed to export markets, especially to the rest of Africa and the Middle East. According to the Oxford Business Group’s overview of Morocco’s economy for 2019, the country’s economic development depends on “improving business environment and infrastructural base, the gradual liberalization of the local currency and increased investment into export-oriented industries.”  The Ministry of Industry’s plan to provide a solution to the wave of protests across Morocco in recent years included creating 500,000 new jobs in various industrial sectors including the automotive sector. Oxford also said that industry, including the automotive sector, contributed an average of about 25 percent to Morocco’s GDP in 2017. Similarly to PSA Group, the French group Renault had also signed six agreements with equipment manufacturers as part of a “Renault ecosystem” to be established in Morocco.  In the last 4 years, Morocco has become the largest car producer in the MENA region, and the automotive industry has become the largest exporting sector of the country, ahead of phosphates.

Rabat – Skytrax, a UK-based consultancy agency, has ranked the world’s 100 best airlines. The rankings were announced at the annual World Airline Awards, at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday, June 17. The top 10 was dominated by Asian and Middle Eastern airlines, who have maintained their spots in the ranking for the past few years. Last year’s winner, Singapore Airlines, dropped to second place, and Japan’s All Nippon Airways placed third for the second year in a row. Qatar Airways took the number 1 spot. It was a big night for Qatar Airways, as the company also clinched awards for World’s Best Business Class, Best Business Class Seat, and best Middle Eastern Airline. Morocco’s national carrier, Royal Air Maroc, placed 93rd on the list. Although the placement is low, it is an improvement from last year when the Moroccan airline was not included in the list. Skytrax ranked the airlines by compiling more than 20 million survey entries between September 2018 and May 2019 for this year’s awards, with voters coming from over 100 different countries. The CEO of Skytrax, Edward Plaisted, commented on the ranking. “All of today’s award-winning airlines are voted for by customers, and the focus of our annual survey is for travelers to make their own, personal choices as to which airlines they consider to be best,” he said. “We operate the survey and awards in a 100 percent independent and impartial format according to the commitment we gave back in 1999, and whilst every winner may not be the favorite of everyone, those that disagree should understand that these are the Passenger’s Choice Awards.”

Rabat – Mobile operator Inwi has announced that, in September 2019, the company will launch a Mobile Money service called Wana Money. The manager of Wana Money, Nicolas Levi, disclosed the launch during the MPay Forum held last week in Casablanca, Morocco. The Inwi representative said that the telecom company looks forward to providing a wide range of mobile financial services for its customers, but also all mobile phone users. He added that  the expansion of Inwi’s “network and brand strength” has made these new services possible. The telecom company will launch its Mobile Money service in a market where competitors Maroc Telecom and Orange are currently prominent. This means stronger competition in the sector which will contribute to increased financial inclusion in Morocco.  The Central Bank, Bank Al-Maghrib and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency, established a program called Mobile Money in November 2018. Bank Al-Maghrib has also granted eleven similar licenses to other companies. While this program is new to Inwi, it is not the first of its kind for Africa. Mobile company MTN launched its own personal finance service, positioning Ghana as the fastest growing mobile money market in Africa. The MTN service, called MoMo, is an artificial intelligence service bot allowing customers to manage payments on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and via SMS.

Rabat – In the absence of diplomatic relations between Israel and Morocco, a notable number of  Israeli tourists visit the North African country annually. Statistics shared by Sputnik News show  that over 50,000 Israelis visit Morocco every year. Once a year, Jewish Moroccans from Morocco and around the world flock to  Essaouira to celebrate the Hiloula of Saint abbi Nessim Ben Nessim. In addition to Hiloula, Morocco’s tourism assets have been attracting travelers from across the globe. Tourism is one of Morocco’s strongest industries and is a driving force for the country’s Gross Domestic Products (GDP). In 2018 Morocco welcomed 1 million tourists on average per month. Adil El Fakir, general director of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT), said in January 2019 that  Morocco received 12.3 million tourists last year. In 2018, tourism generated revenues totaling MAD 70 billion.   In addition to Israelis visiting Morocco, a notable number of Moroccans also visited Israel in 2018. In May 2019, the Population and Immigration Authority announced that 2,108 Moroccans visited Israel in 2018 The statistics revealed that nearly 55,000 tourists, from countries which share no diplomatic ties with Israel, visited the country in 2018.. The majority of Moroccans criticize any move towards normalizing diplomatic ties with Israel. In February, dozens of activists marched to Morocco’s parliament to protest against any normalization of Morocco’s relations with Israel in the wake of rumors of the possible visit of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Morocco Morocco’s government denied any plans for a diplomatic visit.

Rabat – Ajax sporting director Marc Overmars recently declared that Moroccan football player Hakim Ziyech is free to leave in the summer. However, Ziyech’s contract has a release clause of £25 million. Ziyech, who moved to the Johan Cruyff Arena three years ago from FC Twente, proved his worth in the Eredivisie and the Champions League last season. The 26-year-old scored 21 goals with 18 assists across all competitions.  The Moroccan player won the club’s Player of the Year award for the second season running after helping his side win the domestic double. Ziyech’s outstanding performances have attracted a number of Europe’s best clubs, including Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Arsenal, according to media reports. Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan has revealed that the Moroccan is ready to quit Holland and try his luck in the Premier League.  Van der Kraan told the Spy Sports Transfer Window Podcast: “I know that the player is keen on a club like Arsenal, who have always played good football.  Manchester City also under Pep Guardiola plays a kind of Ajax style of football, as do Barcelona. But not all of these clubs will line up for him.” Overmars said: “Many big clubs are buzzing around him. We promised Hakim [that we would] agree to a good transfer.” In 2016, Ziyech signed for Ajax on a five-year deal, with a reported transfer fee of €11m. Ziyech is now valued at £25 million, which is more than half of Arsenal’s £40 million summer transfer budget. Van der Kraan said, “I think that if Arsenal did not have Mesut Ozil, they would have been the perfect club for him. But now, he has to choose between clubs in the Bundesliga, two or three clubs.” “In Serie A, Roma has come back in for him after going for him last summer, while there are also one or two clubs in Spain who want him,” van der Kraan continued. “But he is not that keen and Ajax are now aware that the best bit of business they may do this summer is to give him a new contract, rather than sign a new big-name attacker or midfielder,” van der Kraan added. Sports journalists predict that Ajax will struggle to hold onto Ziyech for the long-term future. According to Jay Williams from The Boot Room, “he is worth a gamble for a top European club and Arsenal must make sure they win this race.”

By Kawtar Ennaji Rabat –  The first defendant, Felix Ramos, who works in television and showbiz in Marbella, is known to the Spanish and Moroccan courts for selling falsified titles, distinctions and diplomas on behalf of several institutions. He was arrested on Tuesday, June 18 in Tangier for “child abuse and human trafficking.” The second defendant, Rafael Ojeda, aka “Falete”, a friend of Ramos, is a 41-year-old flamenco transvestite singer from Seville. The two allegedly sexually abused the young man while he was still a minor. The young Moroccan appeared on June 18 in the second instance court of Tangier, accompanied by Mohamed Taib Bouchiba, regional coordinator of the association for the protection of children and the fight against pedophilia, “Do not touch my child”.  By coincidence, Felix Ramos was in the police station being sued for fraud at the time of filing the complaint, says Mr. Bouchiba. The public prosecutor immediately ordered the judicial police to open an investigation and question the suspect. The victim reportedly met Felix Ramos when he was 14 years old. Bouchiba added that Ramos approached the young man who lived in a homeless shelter run by a Spanish woman, and offered him work on television. Ramos also promised the boy documentation and accommodation in Spain and then invited him to a five-star hotel in Tangier. “That day, he raped me; I suffered so much that I will never forget it, “said the young man who dreamt of a ” future in Spain “, reports El Español who had access to the complaint. The alleged rapist abused the young man for several years for a small amount of money. The victim reportedly met the transvestite singer “Falete” in 2016 while he was in Tangier, invited by his friend Ramos, to record a television program. “He asked me to behave well with him, he told me he was a singer and he would also help me and give me money,” said the boy in his complaint.  “He also raped me, and he gave me MAD 2,000 after abusing me for several days,” he added. The artist living in Spain also asked the young Moroccan to send him nude photos via WhatsApp in exchange for money. According to Bouchiba, other homeless young people in Tangier could have been victims of similar abusers. “These children living on the street are the new victims of pedophiles who come here for what is called ‘sex tourism’,” he said, convinced that these two alleged rapists are part of a wider network. These young people seek for the most part to sell their bodies to survive. “It’s the easy solution when they need money. They do not always want to lodge a complaint because they live on it,” says Bouchiba. “It took several days for the young man to trust us and eventually file a complaint,” he added.

Rabat – Despite losing back-to-back friendly matches leading up to the start of the tournament, Dirar told ONsport “I predict the final to be between Egypt and Morocco.” The last time the Lions won the Cup of Nations title was 1976. Last week, Gambia bested the Moroccan squad when they scored the only goal of the match. On Sunday, the Lions suffered their second pre-cup loss in a friendly match with Zambia by a score of 3 to 2 in Marrakech.  Neither the Zambian nor Gambian teams qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) this year.  The losses did not dampen Dirar’s hopes. The Lion’s winger admitted the Egyptian team was a strong foe but he kept his eyes on the prize.  “Our target is to win the title,” Dirar said. Morocco last faced off against Egypt in the 2017 CAN when they lost to the Pharaohs one-nil. The cup kicks off this Friday in Cairo with a match between Egypt and Zimbabwe. The Moroccan national team’s first game will be played against Namibia on Sunday. The Lion’s assistant coach Patrice Beaumelle shared Dirar’s optimism. After last week’s loss to Gambia he said his squad can use the match as a learning experience as they head into the cup. Beaumelle said the game was “very beneficial to the group as the matches of the Afcon will be similar to today’s game.” Morocco will play in Group D alongside South Africa, Zimbabwe, and the Ivory Coast. The last time Morocco made it past the quarter finals was in 2004. The Lions made it all the way to the final match of the cup, where they lost 2 to 1 to host team Tunisia.

Rabat – Chariot Oil &amp; Gas has announced the findings of its recent study which identified Morocco as an attractive potential energy market. The key findings of the study shared by Proactive Investors showed positive aspects of the company’s project, emphasizing that development of the Anchois field is “feasible.” The Anchois project is part of Chariot Oil &amp; Gas’s Lixus license. The project’s viability, according to the industrial news outlet, would “attract potential strategic partners with a view to funding appraisal operations in 2020.” The company claimed that developments to the project could take place in a “single phase or a staged development” in order to “optimise access to different parts of the gas market.” The company  also conducted an assessment of the energy market described as “growing” and “attractive.” Proactive Investors said that the company’s research concluded that Morocco “has a growing energy market with ‘attractive gas prices.’” The company’s CEO, Larry Bottomley expressed satisfaction with the report’s findings saying that the “results of these studies demonstrate the technical feasibility and commercial attractiveness of developing the Anchois gas discovery with the potential to offer a strategically important indigenous source of gas into Morocco’s developing energy market.” In April 2019, the company announced that it secured a 75 percent interest and operatorship of the Lixus offshore licence in Morocco. In a statement, the company said that  the remaining 25 percent will go to Morocco’s National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM). Commenting on the license, Bottomley said that  “The award of the Lixus licence provides Chariot with a discovered resource base offering a low-cost development opportunity and significant upside. The commercial attractiveness of the Lixus licence is further enhanced by its position offshore Morocco, a fast-growing energy market with high gas prices and a need for increased supply.”

Rabat – In a move to secure greater international legitimacy, Palestine agreed to join the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an observer state on June 19, in exchange for full recognition of statehood from the organization. As part of the agreement, the IAEA will now have the right to monitor the Palestinian Authority’s nuclear-related activities, such as ensuring the safety of fissionable and radioactive materials. Although the Palestinian Autohrity does not have access to nuclear reactors or weapons, nuclear material is common in medical facilities and universities, which both utilize equipment constructed with nuclear and radioactive materials. However, Israel, which has been criticized in the past for its nuclear activities, has condemned the agreement. Emmanuel Nahshon from the Israeli Foreign Ministry called the accord a “violation of international conventions.” The spokesperson also accused the Palestinian authority of manipulating the international community to gain further recognition. “This is another attempt by the Palestinian Authority to join international organizations in order to exploit them for political purposes,” Nahshon said.  “Israel does not recognize the attempts of the PA to join such organizations and such institutions as a state, and Israel views this as a violation of international agreements.” Meanwhile, Israel has received its own host of criticism in the past due to its attitudes towards nuclear proliferation, specifically its refusal to comply with international regulations regarding nuclear energy and weapons. Previously, Israel had refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is designed to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons of mass destruction and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. At the same time, Israel has refused to acknowledge whether it currently possesses nuclear weapons or not. This has led many to believe that the country does possess such weapons yet refuses to disclose such information. Israel has also restricted IAEA inspectors to specific sites and only with supervision from Israeli authorities. One of the sites which IAEA inspectors are barred from entering is a nuclear facility outside of the city of Dimona, which has been suspected of harboring a nuclear weapons development program. Regardless, the IAEA has refused to take a particular side, and has instead assured Israel and the international community of its neutrality towards political issues and of its exclusive concern with the prevention of nuclear conflict. “The agreement does not in any way imply an expression of a position regarding the legal status of any state or territory or its powers or demarcation of its borders,” said one spokesperson from the IAEA. Meanwhile, Saleh Abdel-Shafi, the Palestinian Authority’s representative to Austria, touted the agreement as a step in proving Palestine’s dedication towards international cooperation. “Signing this agreement constitutes additional proof that the State of Palestine is a full and active partner in the international community,” Abdel-Shafi said. There has not yet been a response from the United States; however, the US passed legislation in the 1990s to prohibit Congress from funding any UN organization which recognizes non-recognized states.  As a result, the more than $200 million which the US currently contributes to the IAEA every year could be jeopardized, which puts the IAEA at risk of losing a large proportion of its funding.

Rabat – The Minister of Public Works, Transport, Logistics and Water, Abdelkader Amara, has launched a call to tenders for the acquisition, installation, and maintenance of 552 devices for the automatic control and detection of traffic violations. According to the statement released by the ministry yesterday, June 18, the tender includes 276 speed control devices outside urban areas, 204 monitoring devices for respecting signaling appliances in urban regions, and an average of 72 highway speed monitoring devices. The minister also noted that he has introduced a number of methods to enhance automatic speed control devices. These initiatives are intended to reduce the rate of accidents caused by speeding by implementing the objectives of the national road security policy.  The policy is aimed specifically at reducing by 50% the number of fatalities of road accidents by 2026. Moroccan Al Omra Group International (Group leader), German Vitronic, and Emirates-based Vitronic Middle East have all submitted bids for the national contract. Besides the detection of speed and traffic light breaches, these systems have various characteristics, including the ability to detect multiple vehicles at the same time. The devices can detect up to 24 cars, off-road and in-line traffic violations, as well as categorize types of vehicle.  The devices also have the capacity to function in both directions (far and close) and use laser scanning techniques. The statement adds that it will take 2 years to finish the project and that the average speed monitoring equipment will be positioned on the highway network roads, making possible to track the average speed of cars on the road areas over a number of kilometers. This is not the first time that the ministry has taken action to control speeding on the national roads. In 2018, the ministry purchased 280 movable radars to monitor the speed of Moroccan drivers.

Rabat – Earlier this year, the UN extrajudicial executions investigator, Agnes Callamard said that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was “the victim of a brutal and premeditated” murder by Saudi officials. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, who was an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia‘s ruling family, was allegedly strangled in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by operatives of the Saudi state, on October 2, 2018. Agnes Callamard is set to issue her report on the Khashoggi killing on Wednesday, June 19 2019 and present it on June 26 to the UN Human Rights Council. Khashoggi’s remains have not yet been traced, but Callamard and her team of forensic and legal experts have accessed “chilling and gruesome audio materials” of his death gathered by the Turkish intelligence agency. Her report is expected to hold individuals from both Turkey and Saudi Arabia accountable. Callamard cited “credible evidence” that high-level Saudi officials were implicated, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) should also be investigated over the alleged murder.  Saudi officials continue to deny the accusations. Turkey sought to have the trial of the Saudi suspects held in Istanbul, but Saudi Arabia repeatedly turned down the requests. Callamard has denounced the lack of transparency concerning the trials of 11 suspects being held in Saudi Arabia. The names of the suspects and the details of the charges against them have not been released.  Khashoggi’s killing has tainted the image of the crown prince, who was previously acclaimed for his advancing changes in the conservative kingdom. US President Donald Trump’s administration said it is expecting its close Middle East ally, Saudi Arabia, to make “tangible progress” towards holding accountable those truly responsible for the Khashoggi killing.

Rabat – Residents in Marguerites in southern France found the bodies of two men  on Sunday, June 16. French news outlet  Midi Libre reported  that both men have been identified as Moroccan nationals who were living  in Nimes in southern France. The victims, aged 33 and 40, were murdered in cold blood. Morocco World News has contacted the embassy of France in Morocco to confirm the news, but it was unreachable. An autopsy carried out by the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Nimes showed that the two victims were killed by bullet wounds to the neck and eye socket respectively. The injuries to the eye and neck sustained by the victims killed them instantly.  The French news outlet added that while one of the victims had been resident in France for a long time the other had only been in France for a few months and did not have a residency permit. The outlet speculated that the murders were connected to drug trafficking.

By Morgan Hekking Rabat – United Nations officials have accused Syria and Russia of deliberately targeting civilian areas and using tactics designed to terrorize civilians.  The latest attacks on civilians were in Idlib, the last-rebel held territory in northwestern Syria after eight years of civil war. Idlib is one of three cities included in a buffer zone deal signed by Russia and Turkey.  The buffer zone is intended to be protected from regime offenses, but the agreement was never fully implemented.  The planned demilitarized zone instead came under the administrative control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a designated Salafist jihadist militant group. HTS control over Idlib has put the territory’s population of three million people at the forefront of Syrian and Russian offenses.  UN chief Antonio Guterres has classed the northwestern province of Idlib as the site of a humanitarian disaster.  The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 26 incidents of attacks on healthcare facilities, which are obligated to share their exact coordinates with military officials as a part of the UN’s deconfliction system. Some civilian facilities are now refusing to do so, as sharing their locations with warring parties makes them an easy target.   On June 19, the White Helmets civil defense group reported the deaths of at least seven civilians in Idlib due to Syrian government air raids. This follows another attack on June 15 in which four were killed and 15 were wounded. Scores of rebel fighters have also been killed in recent attacks.  Mark Lowcock, humanitarian chief of the UN, urged Russia and Syria to stop their attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure at the UN Security Council session on June 19.  “A number of partners . . . have drawn the conclusion that hospital bombings are a deliberate tactic aimed at terrorizing people,” Lowcock said at the session.  Both Syria and Russia denied the UN’s allegations of terror at the Security Council session, questioning the sources of information. Russian UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia argued that all military activities were in response “to provocations from terrorists.” More than 230 civilians have been killed in Idlib over the last six weeks, and an estimated 330,000 have fled to Turkey.

Rabat – Egypt has criticized the United Nations for “politicizing” the death of the country’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi. Morsi was overthrown on July 3, 2013, after barely a year in power, through a military coup staged by current Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. He was placed under house arrest before being moved to prison. The former president had been in custody for six years, before suffering a fatal heart attack in a Cairo court earlier this week. “Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough, and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death,” said Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the UN high commissioner for human rights on Tuesday, June 18. “Concerns have been raised regarding the conditions of Mr. Morsi’s detention, including access to adequate medical care, as well as sufficient access to his lawyers and family,” Colville added.  Egyptian Foreign ministry spokesperson, Ahmed Hafez, said Colville’s call for an independent inquiry into Morsi’s death was a “deliberate attempt to politicize a case of natural death.” Hafez accused the UN of trying to “[obscure] the institutions of the Egyptian state and the integrity of the Egyptian judiciary.” Human rights groups, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have also called for a thorough investigation into Morsi’s death. “The Egyptian government has known very clearly about his declining medical state, ” Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of HRW’s Middle East and North Africa division, told Al Jazeera, decrying Morsi’s “terrible but entirely predictable” death. “He’s been in prison and treated worse than the already terrible conditions for Egypt’s prisoners,” Whitson added. “He had lost a great deal of weight, he had fainted in court a number of times and was being kept in almost around-the-clock solitary confinement.” His former party, the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – a close ally of Morsi – are among those who have also placed the responsibility for his death on the Egyptian leadership. Egypt’s government has so far denied all accusations concerning the mistreatment of the former president while in custody and negligence over Morsi’s declining health.

Rabat – Algeria’s military Chief of Staff has issued a veiled warning to the country’s protesters and political circles critical of the current regime, calling on them to respect the army and the “democratic institutions” it is supposed to embody. A statement from the defense ministry quoted General Ahmed Gaid Salah on Tuesday, June 18, as insinuating that protesters “hold grudges and animosity towards the army and its command” and are “undoubtedly enemies of Algeria.” General Salah’s warning comes as Algerians continue to ask for radical power shift months after former president Abdel Aziz Bouteflika resigned as he faced unprecedented popular anger after two decades in power. Protesters, unimpressed by the current interim government’s promises of upholding the constitution and organizing “free and fair” elections, have made it clear they will not stop protesting until the entire Bouteflika cohort relinquishes political power to a new generation of politicians. General Salah says that some protesters’ and political organizations’ perceived hostility towards the status quo is a frontal assault on the country’s constitution and a declaration of war against what he sees as the pillars of “the Algerian democracy.” “Those who are knowingly trying to circumvent… terms of the constitution, do they realize what it means to suppress all state institutions?” he asked. With protesters bent on driving interim president Abdelkader Bensalah out of Office, General Salah said such an occurrence would usurp the country’s constitution. This, he argued, would amount to the “the destruction of the foundations of the Algerian national state.” In the most recent developments, the interim government has initiated a witch hunt against a number of former Bouteflika political and business tycoons it accused of large scale corruption. The move is largely seen as a strategy for the interim regime to distance itself from the Bouteflika establishment which protesters say is the cause of the country’s dire economic situation. According to General Salah, some political circles are only challenging the country’s authorities to advance their own agenda. “When the National People’s Army was working with responsibility, self-denial and disinterestedness, some people cunningly planned to appropriate public funds.” But the ongoing witch hunt has not calmed protests, with many dissenters insisting on the departure of Abdelkader Bensalah. Most recently, the country’s constitutional court canceled the general elections that were scheduled for July 4 amid fears of escalating crisis. With demonstrator manifestly unwilling to give in to the government’s successive placatory moves, the Algerian crisis does not appear to show signs of ending anytime soon.

By El Baz Abdessamad Rabat – Ihssane Toujgani, a Moroccan researcher, has received UNESCO’s annual scholarship for up to $5,000 for her work on “Characterization and enhancement of local genetic resources of the common chestnut tree (Castanea sativa Mill.) in the Mediterranean Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve.”   An alumni of Agronomic and Veterinary Institute Hassan II (IAV), Toujgani, is one of the seven winners of UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Young Scientists Awards this year. The list also includes two winners from Africa. Isaac Yaw BARNES (Ghana) has received an award for “Using storytelling through a geo-story map to highlight Bia River Biosphere Reserve’s anthropogenic effect on community livelihood and adaptation”. While Kazeem JIMOH (Nigeria) has won the award for his research on the “Impact of green economy in biosphere reserve project (GEBR) as an alternative livelihood source on the poverty status of Omo Biosphere Reserve communities”, according to UNESCO.  A Biosphere reserve is conservation of plants and animals which exist in a specific place and are of interest to researchers and interests. Morocco is home to several Biosphere reserves including the ARGANERAIE Reserve, established in 1998, which covers more than 2 million hectares “bordered by the High Atlas and Anti-Atlas Mountains and open to the Atlantic in the west.”  Another Moroccan Biosphere reserve is the OASIS DU SUD MAROCAIN. Started in the year 2000 and situated in the east of Morocco, it covers 7 million hectares and is home to the Heritage Site of Ait-Ben-Haddou. Shared between Morocco and Spain, the Intercontinental Biosphere reserve of the Mediterranean, designated in 2006, is ”the first of its type to be designated by the Man and the Biosphere Programme. It combines the Tingitane Peninsula in Morocco and the southern Iberian Peninsula of Andalusia.” Finally, the Atlas Cedar (Cèdre de l’Atlas) (2016) “is characterized by a wealth of ecosystems and mountain peaks, which reach up to 3,700 m, providing the region with critically important water resources, fruit plantations, modern agriculture, and tourist activities”, according to UNESCO.  Scientist Ihssane Toujgani joins a list of Moroccans who have won international awards this year. Mostapha Tarfaoui won France’s National Energy Globe Award on June 6 for his work on deicing. While Said El Mejdani, a computer science teacher in Canada, won the Prime Minister’s Teaching Award for Teaching Excellence on May 2.

Rabat – In light of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring vaccine hesitancy one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019, Wellcome Global Monitor has revealed which countries have the highest rates of hesitancy. The survey was designed by Wellcome, a British medical charity, and conducted by Gallup World Poll between April and December 2018. The analysis includes responses from more than 140,000 people in 144 countries and found that while most people globally believe vaccines are safe to use, 79 percent, the level of vaccine hesitancy is still high enough to cause a risk to public health, especially in Europe. More than a fifth of people surveyed in Western Europe, 22 percent, disagreed that vaccines are safe. France had the highest level of vaccine hesitancy of all the Western European countries surveyed, with one-third of French people disagreeing that vaccines are safe. In an attempt to counter the possible effects of vaccine hesitancy, the French government has increased the number of vaccinations compulsory for children from 3 to 11.  Wellcome’s head of public engagement, Imran Khan, said the study showed that “people’s beliefs about science are deeply influenced by their culture, context, and background.” “We need to care more about these connections if we want everyone to benefit from the science,” he added. The study found that those living in high-income countries have the lowest levels of confidence in vaccines. Khan attributed this to the “complacency effect.” He added that in developed countries people are both less likely to catch certain infectious diseases, and more likely to be treated effectively by their healthcare systems if they do. “If you look at those countries in our survey which have very high rates of confidence in vaccines, places like Bangladesh and Egypt, these are areas where you do have more infectious diseases,” Khan told AFP. “Perhaps what you see is the people in those countries can see what happens if you don’t vaccinate.” The Middle East and North Africa had some of the highest rates of trust in vaccines, with a median of 85 percent for the region. In Morocco, vaccine trust was slightly lower than the regional average, but still the overwhelming majority at 80 percent. The study found that 99 percent of those surveyed in Morocco have ensured their child has received at least one vaccine. Fortunately, the anti-vaccine movement seems not to have taken off in Morocco. In 1987, the government implemented the national immunization program, which is to thank for huge progress in the health sector and led to the eradication of major communicable diseases, including polio, malaria, trachoma, and schistosomiasis in Morocco. Vaccine hesitancy, which WHO defines as “the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines,” has caused a resurgence in presentable diseases in recent years. Measles, for example, have seen a 30 percent increase in cases globally according to WHO. Some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence. The UN reported that measles cases worldwide had soared nearly 50 percent in 2018, killing around 136,000 people. Ukraine, where 70 percent of people do not trust vaccines, had one of the biggest measles outbreaks, with 85,000 cases recorded. The resurgence in Measles is due to the popular misconception that measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), causes autism, a claim that has long since been disproven. “We are really concerned at the moment because for measles, anything less than 95 percent coverage can lead to outbreaks and that is what we are seeing,” Khan said. Since the invention of vaccines, billions of people have been shielded from diseases that used to wreak havoc and destruction, such as smallpox and polio, both of which have been either eradicated completely or nearly so, thanks to vaccines. Vaccinations currently prevent 2-3 million deaths a year, making it of vital importance that the global vaccine hesistancy movement doesn’t take further hold. WHO estimates that a further 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improves. Dr. Ann Lindstrand, an expert in immunization at the WHO, told BBC that vaccine hesitancy is extremely serious. “One of the most important interventions to counteract doubts and worries about vaccines is to have health workers really well trained and able and ready to recommend vaccinations based on scientific truth and to be able to respond correctly to questions and concerns that parents have and communities have,” she said.

Rabat – The oppression of Sahrawi activists condemning human violations in the Tindouf camps continues.  Following the arrest of journalist Moulay Aba Buzid in a demonstration held on Monday, June 17, the Polisario Front kidnapped a second Sahrawi activist in Rabouni on June 18. Pro-polisario news outlets reported that the front arrested Fadel Brika, who was taken to an unknown location after his arrest. A statement from the Saharawi Initiative for Change, quoted by FuturoSahara, described arrests of both activists as “arbitrary detentions,” as there were no arrest orders from the so-called judiciary authority of the Polisario Front. The arrests were carried out in response to comments and posts the opposition activists were sharing on their social media accounts. The pro-Polisario news outlets reported that the front intends to carry out further arrest operations in the coming hours to “silence opposition voices.” The arrest of Brika was confirmed by former Polisario member Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, who has been following the violations in Tindouf camps, Algeria. Commenting on the arrest of Abu Buzid, Mustafa Salma said: “Every Moment Buzid spends in detention does not only condemn Polisario, but also the high commission for refugees as he was arrested  immediately after he left their office.” Despite the pressure that the front continue to face in the wake of the disappearances of Polisario members and activists, the Polisario has refused to reveal the fate of several arrested activists. .  “I challenge [Polisario] them to keep journalist Buzid hidden now,” concluded Mustafa Salma. The family of Ahmed El Khalil, a  Polisario member who went missing more than 10 years ago, has been calling on the United Nations to intervene as the front remains silent on his fate

Rabat – Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi released a statement on Tuesday, June 18, in response to the US deployment of 1,000 troops to the Middle East. The United States is “pumping up tensions” in the Middle East, said Wang. “We call on all parties to remain rational and restrained, not to take any actions to provoke the escalation of tension in the region, and not to open a Pandora’s box,” Wangtold reporters in Beijing. “In particular, the United States should change its practice of extreme pressure,” Wang added. Meanwhile, China and Iran have close energy ties, with Beijing opposing the US threats against countries importing Iranian oil. Fears of an upcoming confrontation between Iran and the US arose since last week after the alleged Iranian attacks on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz. Washington and Tehran traded accusations over the incident. In reality, Iran and the US are trapped in a turbulent standoff after US President Donald Trump withdrew from an international accord that constrained Tehran’s nuclear program last year. “Now what we see are unending and sustained US attempts to crank up political, psychological, economic and, yes, military pressure on Iran in quite a provocative way. They [the actions] cannot be assessed as anything but a conscious course to provoke war,” said Sergey Ryabkov, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister. In the meantime, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said: “Iran will not wage war against any nation,” while former director of NATO, David Desroches, called the deployment a “small measure” that is “designed to send a message,” not enough for an invasion or a war. China and Russia have both expressed serious concerns over the complex situation in the Middle East, stressing US administration’s reckless building up of tensions in an already explosive region.

Rabat – The Moroccan branch of Thyssenkrupp Aerospace has delivered its first major order for processed aluminum plates. The order signifies that the new site in Casablanca is now fully operational. Thyssenkrupp is a German producer of steel, machines, and industrial services, such as high-speed trains, elevators, and shipbuilding. From its bases in Duisburg and Essen, the company has spread to over 480 locations worldwide. The branch near Casablanca is Thyssenkrupp’s second in North Africa. Egypt was its first on the continent. The Moroccan branch is located on around 3,500 square meter in the Ouled Salah area, between the city center of Casablanca and the airport industrial area. In addition to producing and storing metals (such as aluminum, steel, and copper), the company also uses state-of-the-art machines to cut the material exactly to customer specifications. Even before the official opening of the Thyssenkrupp’s aerospace facility, two supply agreements were signed with aircraft parts Figeac Aero Maroc and ARM Group. The Casablanca location provides better proximity to local partners. Being closer to clients is particularly important for short-term delivery requests. In addition to this benefit, customers no longer have to operate their own warehouses. Instead, they can have the required materials delivered as needed. “Our new materials processing and logistics center in Casablanca serves precisely [the] needs and ensures just-in-time supply to our customers,” Eric Cornilleau, managing director at Thyssenkrupp Aerospace France said. Cornilleau elaborated on the company’s plan which highlights customer satisfaction, “we have shortened the distances to our local customers, which benefit our partners and allow developing our relationships with additional volumes to be supplied to the Moroccan companies.” Joachim Limberg, CEO of Thyssenkrupp Materials Services, stated that the new site underlines Thyssenkrupp’s ambition to be a reliable and strong partner alongside their customers, highlighting “With our broad and deep experience as a system partner, we ensure that our customers can focus even more on their core business by taking on the complete management of logistics, warehousing, and supply chains.” Cornilleau said, “The aerospace industry has been growing rapidly over the last years, which is why reliable, timely supply and sustainable quality via a local presence is very important to our customers.”

Rabat – Morocco will walk away from the 53rd edition of the Paris Air Show with yet more promises of investments and bilateral cooperation to foster its growing aviation sector. On Tuesday, the opening day of the five-day event, 18-23 June, Paris and Rabat signed two secured deals to boost cooperation on civil aviation-related technical assistance and quality management. The deals mainly entail aviation security, with the two countries agreeing to upgrade technical cooperation in air security, as well as air management, quality, and air safety-related services. Within the parameters of the agreement, the two countries are to reinforce cooperation in cases of plane crashes. Mohamed Sajid, Morocco’s Minister for Tourism and Air Transportation signed the conventions with the French transportation minister, Elisabeth Borne. Borne said the newly-signed agreements constitute a further proof of the two countries’ desire to cement their “already close collaboration.” She said the gesture comes to “once again hail the quality of our relations in terms of civil aviation.” Sajid, who echoed the same sentiment, said he hopes the deals will drive up Morocco’s performance in the sector. He said that his department expects to get inspiration from the French success for the “important reforms” Rabat envisages making in the aviation sector. Present at the Paris gathering, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Morocco’s Industry and Investment Minister, gave a resoundingly optimistic reading of the newly struck deals. Morocco’s presence at the event, and the ensuing deals with France, Elalamy said, are a testament to the sector’s growth and investment potential in the country. According to him, the notable diversification of Morocco’s economic ventures is among the many positive factors driving the rush of interest in the country among global households in the aviation and other industries. “Our approach centered on promoting investments seeks to attract them [investors] to invest in the kingdom and help us complete the ecosystem,” the minister offered in a statement. According to Elalamy, recent reforms in Morocco have made the country a “privileged destination” for companies looking for “best-cost” outsourcing opportunities. The upbeat assessments of the future of Morocco’s aviation sector come days after Bombardier reiterated commitment to its Moroccan plant. Amid fears of devastation when the Canadian giant announced that it was retreating from its Moroccan ventures, senior managers at the company have recently echoed Moroccan authorities’ reassuring stance. Bombardier now says it will only leave after it has secured a safe aftermath. Despite the robust consensus on the enormous opportunities of Morocco’s aviation sector, some critics are still questioning the plausibility of the rosy picture Moroccan authorities have been painting since Bombardier announced its departure from Morocco. Pointing out the gulf between successive government promises and “the reality on the ground,” critics say that talks of “Bombardier not leaving” or Morocco still being a regional leader despite noticeable setbacks to its initial plans are more of a feel-good tale designed to placate and preempt possible social movements.

Rabat – News about the death of a Moroccan man in Tunisia has gone viral on social media, with some football fans and friends of the deceased deeming his death suspicious. Samih Abghor, from Chefchaouen,  traveled to Tunisia to cheer on his football club. Wydad had also traveled to Tunisia to play the second leg of the African Champions League in Rades, Tunisia on May 31. The fan did not, however, return home after the game which raised concerns among his friends and family. Some of his relatives and friends claimed on social media that Tunisian authorities sent a notice to his family to announce his death a few days of his disappearance. On Samih’s Facebook friend list, a man called Fouad Ajaha shared a post to extend his condolences and to announce the death of his friend. “My warm condolences to Abghor’s family following the tragic death of my friend Samih in Tunisia in mysterious circumstances  while attending Wydad- Esperance Tunis match.” As family member , Rim Abghor, also shared a post to mourn Samih’s death.  Several people also took to Samih’s Facebook page to express their condolences on posts shared on his wall. Local news outlets quoted the deceased’s brother, who said that Samih was stabbed with a knife in the legs on the eve of the match. The sources believe that the Moroccan national did not receive the necessary care following the stabbing which led to a hemorrhage. Samih’s brother also claimed that Tunisian authorities attempted to hide the circumstances of his sibling’s death. Morocco World News contacted Samih’s relatives for a comment , but they were unreachable.  Samih was not the only Moroccan who experienced assault in Tunisia.  Fans of Tunisia’s Esperance Tunis assaulted and threw stones at a bus carrying Wydad fans upon their arrival in Tunisia to support their club. One of the Wydad fans was injured in the assault from EST supporters.. The attacks came amid controversy over refereeing mistakes during the first leg, which took place in Morocco on June 24. Similar refereeing mistakes were made against Wydad during the second leg of the final, which  urged the Wydadi players and the Moroccan football federation to intervene. Wydad Casablanca left the pitch to finish the match when a referee refused to use the assistant video referee in favor of the Moroccan football club. It was later found that the VAR was not operational. Following Morocco’s campaign, the African Football Confederation decided to strip Esperance Tunis of the trophy and medals and will replay the game on neutral ground after the African Cup of Nations (CAN).

Rabat – A Qatari technical commission held talks in Israel and the Gaza Strip on Tuesday June 18. The commission discussed the funding of a new power line between Qatar and Gaza, marking a potential expansion of Doha’s aid endeavors for Palestinians. In recent years, Qatar has funnelled millions of dollars into relief projects in Hamas-dominated Gaza, in an  effort to alleviate the deprivation caused by the ongoing conflict with Israel.  Spearheading the Qatari drive has been envoy Mohammed Al-Emadi, a Qatari economist and businessman. This time, Al-Emadi was accompanied by Qatari electricity and water experts. The Qatari experts met with the Israel Electric Corporation in Tel Aviv on Sunday, and in Gaza with energy officials, to discuss the Qatari offer to pay for the completion of a new Gaza electricity line. “It will make a difference,” said a Palestinian official. “Maybe we will not have electricity 24/7, but people may begin to feel there isn’t a power crisis anymore.” The new line, known as Line 161, would provide 100 megawatts to Gaza, which currently gets a total of 120 megawatts from Israel, short of the 500 megawatts to 600 megawatts that Palestinian authorities say the blockaded territory needs. Besides preventing some of Gaza’s chronic blackouts, an improved electricity supply would also benefit power sewage pumps and hinder water contamination afflicting two million Palestinians. So far, the intervention is approved by Israel but has gone largely unacknowledged by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who, alongside U.S.-allied Arab leaders, has criticized Doha for its close ties to Iran and Islamist groups like Hamas.   An Israeli official said that the power line’s construction would take three years to complete and that it remains unclear whether the Netanyahu government will approve it. The prime minister’s office had no immediate comment.

Rabat – Medical students continue to boycott final exams, despite threats from the government that they will have to repeat the year. threat. In a statement on Saturday, 15 June, the National Committee of Medical Students calls on the government, instead of undertaking a policy of threats and oppression, “to respect national and international treaties on the right of self-expression and to protest.” The medical students insist on the “autonomy” of their movement and urge the government to participate in a “constructive” discussion. “The National Commission is an autonomous institution whose decisions are made through democratic debate at the general assembly of students,” said the statement in reply to the government accusations. There are 18,000 students,from the 1st to the 7th years of study, involved in the strikes which have taken place across Morocco. The medical students are sticking to their position and are preparing to take to the streets again to claim their rights. “Immediately after the exams deadline on 25 June, we will organize a national march but we have not set the date yet” the coordinator said. The representative and member of National Commission of Medical Students of Morocco, Hamza Karmane, states that the “movement does not follow conflict’s logic and, in particular, a citizen’s movement aimed only to improve study conditions in the public faculties.” For Karmane, the origin of the strike was the student’s fear that the conditions of their schooling would “get worse” over the years. “In this situation, no one is a winner or loser. If students win their requests, the whole country wins. However, if they lose this boycott, Morocco loses as well”, he says.

Rabat – A deteriorating oil tanker, close to Yemen’s recently demilitarized Hodeidah port, adds stress to an already tense region threatening to spill more than one million barrels of oil into the Red Sea. “If the tanker ruptures or explodes, we could see the coastline polluted all along the Red Sea,” the Humanitarian Affairs Chief Mark Lowcock told the UN Security Council on Monday. Lowcock said he is working with Houthi rebel forces to have UN Officials access the tanker, named SAFER, check the situation and find a solution to avoid an environmental disaster. SAFER was built in 1976 and has been moored north of Hodeidah since 1988 as a Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) terminal and was used as a point to load exported oil onto vessels.  Following Houthi control of Hodeidah in 2015, SAFER has not been in use, but still holds approximately 1.1 million barrels of oil. SAFER’s structure has been exposed to humidity and corrosion and had little maintenance. It is particularly at risk because of its old age.   When crude oil sits without being tended to regularly, the oil exposed to air oxidizes – oil molecules break down and combine with air molecules – creating a hot and flammable compound. Hodeidah remains an area of conflict between Houthi rebel forces and Saudi Arabia-backed military coalition that supports the government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. The Hodeidah Agreement, part of the larger Stockholm Agreement, came out of peace negotiations in December 2018 and required both parties to remove military forces from the Hodeidah, Salid and Ras Isa ports to allow for greater access for humanitarian aid. An explosion threatens the longevity of these agreements and complicates the already dire humanitarian crisis; according to a previous reporting by the Atlantic Council. Lowcock reported that fighting in Yemen displaced more than 250,000 people this year and the conflict is getting worse not better. An oil spill would also endanger the surrounding marine environment – depending on currents damage could stretch from Bab el Mandeb to the Suez Canal, and potentially as far as the Strait of Hormuz, Lowcock explained.   The Regional Organisation for the Conservation of the Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA), an intergovernmental body dedicated to the conservation of the coastal and marine environments found in the Red Sea, has previously promoted improvements to Yemeni oil spill response systems and the creation of Marine Protected Areas off the Yemeni coast. Likewise, the Conflict and Environment Observatory has been reporting on and warning of SAFER’s posed threat for the past year.

Rabat – The perpetrator of the assault against a German tourist in Tangier appeared before the investigating judge for his first hearing on Tuesday at Tangier‘s Court of Appeal. The investigating judge decided to put the perpetrator in custody for several charges, including robbery and intentional homicide. The perpetrator was put in custody under a detention warrant, an official source told Morocco World news. The victim of the attack left the hospital after health condition improved. The German tourist was stabbed with a knife, and was taken to a hospital in Tangier where she underwent surgery.  Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced in a statement on June 15 the arrest of the suspect. The DGSN said that preliminary investigation showed that the perpetrator is a 29-year old man from Guelmim,  southern Morocco. He was residing temporarily in the city of Tangier at his brother’s house.”

Rabat – A senior Iranian security official announced on Monday, June 17, that Tehran recently unveiled and dismantled a large cyber espionage network run by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  According to the statement made by Iranian official Ali Shamkhani, the investigation led to the arrests of several US spies. “One of the most complicated CIA cyber espionage networks that had an important role in the CIA’s operations in different countries was exposed,” said Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. “We shared the information about the exposed network with our allies that led to the identification and arrest of CIA intelligence agents,” he added.  Shamkhani did not specify how many CIA agents were arrested or in which countries. Already high, US-Iranian tensions increased following US President Donald Trump’s accusations that Tehran was responsible for attacks on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz last week.  Iran vehemently denied any involvement in the reported attacks. Tehran also implied that Washington itself could have engineered the attacks to add pressure on the Islamic Republic on top of economic sanctions. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), called on the international community to take a “decisive stand” over the oil tanker attacks, while Iran has accused its main regional rival of adopting a “militaristic, crisis-based approach” to the incident. Amid the frosty relations between the US and Iran, Shamkhani said that Iran has chosen to publish information on the cyber network for the sake of public awareness. The US has previously implicated Iran in accusations over cyber espionage, claiming that Iran uses fake social media accounts to harm enemies through propaganda. Such claims have worsened the already turbulent US-Iranian relationship.  As of last year, Trump’s administration withdrew the United States from an international nuclear deal with Iran, seeking to end Iran’s international sales of crude oil and restrain its economic activity.  The United States yesterday; June 17, the deployment of an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East adding further pressure to the region’s already complicated dynamics.

Rabat – Mustapha Ramid, Moroccan Minister for Human Rights, posted a statement on Facebook page, Monday June 17, refuting reports that he had attended a nightclub in Rabat. The website Barlamane.com released an article stating that Ramid “who teaches others morality lessons went to a nightclub in Hay Ryad district at Rabat.”   In the article Barlamane.com remind readers that Ramid was one of the first to criticize Amina Maelainine, a member of the parliament, after pictures of her without a headscarf and in front of the famous “Moulin Rouge” in Paris were released. The article asks readers to question the moral credibility of the moralizing minister. The website added: “In order to prevent Ramid from accusing us of lying and slander, we did not see him drinking […] but he had excellent time with those he went with.” Ramid replied to the allegations by writing a post on his Facebook page stating that, “the website Barlamane.com once again fell into the sin of lying and slandering me, they have already done the same dirty thing more than once.” “But the owners of the website did not have the courage to appear in court nor the ability of proving their statement, thus, it is legally recorded that it is a slanderous website.” He pointed out that “Today, the website itself is practicing the sin of slandering me over and over, by claiming that I was seen one night last week in one of the nightclubs in Rabat where there is alcohol and women.” He added that “the article came with false statements, including my activities related to the government, and other activities related to my political party, which everyone knows is a lie.” “And thank God, because I never went to a nightclub during my entire life. I have never entered a restaurant by night.” The minister finished his statement by calling on members of his party to verify his moral character. “On the other hand, I ask for the Deputy Chairman of the Party’s Integrity and Transparency Committee to investigate on this subject and take the decision that is required.”

By Morgan Hekking Rabat – Sexual gender-based violence (SGBV) is a strong concern for displaced Syrians around the world, but this issue is especially heightened in host countries where economic opportunities are limited. SGBV includes psychological and emotional abuse, forced marriage, child marriage, sexual assault, and rape.  This type of violence occurs in both refugee camps and non-camp settings, and can be perpetrated by fellow refugees or natives of the host country.  According to the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), economic pressures and stressful living conditions can trigger what psychologists refer to as negative coping mechanisms.  Within families, examples of negative coping mechanisms include using child marriage, labor, and trafficking to ameliorate financial hardships. Psychological distress can also generate sexual assault and abuse within the home, often in the form of intimate-partner violence.  Although the primary targets of SGBV in refugee communities are women and girls, men and boys are also vulnerable to sexual violence, based on UNHCR regional studies. The perpetrators of this violence are typically male family members or older boys and men from local communities, both refugee and host.  Refugee girls’ mobility in Lebanon is restricted by looming threats organization’ threats of sexual assault and harassment outside the home. In a study conducted by the humanitarian organization Plan International, Syrian girls in Beirut reported being harassed and chased by men and boys, and expressed fears of being kidnapped or raped.   In Lebanon, Syrian refugee girls are getting married and having children at a young age, according to Plan International’s research. Colin Lee, the regional program director for the Middle East says, “child marriage is on the rise because parents are so fearful for their daughters’ safety.”  The Higher Population Council’s 2017 report on child marriage in Jordan offers similar reasoning: “for families, marriage seemed the only option for their daughters to be safe and provided for, even at 14 years old.”  Early marriages amongst Syrian refugees in Jordan has been on the rise for several years, with many Syrian refugee girls getting married to older Jordanian men.  Child marriage allows many refugee families to ease financial burdens and can offer peace of mind regarding the safety of their daughters. However, this survival strategy is ultimately damaging to young refugee girls, who are forced to make the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of their family’s livelihood.

Rabat – Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale denounced Algeria’s hostile moves against Morocco’s territorial integrity during a meeting of the UN Committee of 24 on Monday, June 17 in New York. The diplomat’s  statement in front of the committee comes in response to claims voiced by the ambassador, Chargé d’Affaires of Algeria, who condemned countries which name Algeria as a key actor in the Western Sahara conflict. The Algerian diplomat claimed that his country “is not a party but just an observer.” In response to Algeria’s claims, Hilale reiterated Morocco’s firm position regarding Algeria’s unquestionable  responsibility in the conflict. “If Algeria is only an observer, why does it arm, finance, shelter and diplomatically mobilize for the Polisario, an armed non-state separatist movement?” Hilale also deplored Algeria’s recent move against Morocco’s territorial integrity during a final exam at a school in Algeria. “If Algeria is not a main party, why does it foster the culture of hatred of Morocco and separatism among children in primary education by introducing into the school curriculum and end-of-year examinations.” Algerian students who took history-geography for the Certificate of Primary Studies (CEP) found a task which questioned Morocco’s territorial integrity. A question in the exam papers reads that “the independence of the Maghreb and its construction can only be achieved if the Sahrawi people are free.” Hilale said that  “the Sahara will never be independent and will always be an integral part of Morocco.” In response to Algeria’s claims, the ambassador added: “If Algeria is not a party, why has it continued to turn a deaf ear for 40 years to the incessant and urgent calls of the international community, including the Security Council in its resolutions since 2011 for the census and registration of the populations of the Tindouf camps in Algeria?” The Moroccan diplomat argued that census registration  is the only way to protect the rights of these populations who “are scorned every day, and are exposed to intimidation and violence.” Algeria also continues to turn a deaf ear to Morocco’s dialogue initiative, proposed by King Mohammed VI in November 2018, to break the stalemate between Rabat and Algiers and to increase cooperation.

By Kawtar Ennaji Rabat –  On Monday, June 17,  Nezha El Ouafi, Moroccan Secretary of State Responsible for sustainable development, stated that the number of air quality monitoring stations will reach 101 instead of 29 stations by 2030. This addition comes as a means of strengthening the network of air quality control. Speaking at a meeting held on World Environment Day, El Ouafi noted that this strengthening is part of the national air program (2018-2030) aimed at reducing pollution from stationary and mobile sources and strengthening the regulatory framework. She added that 17 priority actions have been developed and validated. The actions include the allocation of MAD 10 million for the extension of the air quality monitoring network in priority areas. El Ouafi also highlighted the participation in the development of an institutional framework for the future management of a national network for air quality monitoring in partnership with the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Protection of the Environment. The secretary added that “the dynamics of our country in recent years in the field of environment and sustainable development were translated into the enactment and entry into force of the framework law on the National Environment and Sustainable Development Charter and the adoption of the national strategy for sustainable development.” “Our country has put in place a number of regulatory, institutional, incentive and operational measures and initiatives to address the negative impacts of air pollution generated in particular by the industrial sector and the transport sector,” she concluded. The resident representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Morocco, Martine Therer, praised Morocco’s efforts to promote sustainable and inclusive development in accordance with international conventions and agreements and particularly the program of sustainable development by 2030. “The fight against air pollution is a plague that causes, on average, every year the premature death of 7 million people in the world,” she said, recalling that the SDGs tend to reduce the number of deaths and diseases caused by this issue. Similarly to other countries, Morocco celebrates, on June 5 of each year, the World Environment Day. This year’s theme is “Fighting air pollution”. The State Secretariat for Sustainable Development organizes, throughout the month of June, in coordination with its partners, several activities at the national and local levels, including seminars, meetings, cleaning operations and the broadcast of informative and sensitization programs on radio and television channels.

Rabat – Saddened by the news, Prince Moulay Hicham of Morocco emphasized that  Mohamed Morsi died due to the “systematic negligence” he suffered in prison. “He was accused of treason, but the traitors were the ones who usurped the will and sovereignty of the Egyptian people and killed hundreds [of them],” said the prince on his Facebook page. . Moulay Hicham said that Morsi made “political mistakes, but he still embodies democratic legitimacy.” “Sooner or later, the same legitimacy will be imposed again in Egypt. The case of Morsi the tragedy of all Egyptians demanding democracy and whose fate  is torture, disappearances, detention, and exile.” Several public figures mourned the death of Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president. The president was buried today, Tuesday June 18, in Cairo, a day after collapsing and dying in an Egyptian court in Cairo on Monday, June 17. Today in Istanbul, thousands joined funeral prayers in absentia for Morsi. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attended the prayers. After the prayer, Erdogan  commented on the death of his close ally, saying that he does not believe that Morsi died of natural causes. “Mohammed Morsi walked to join God during the trial. Whether this was a normal walk, or there were some other conditions involved, this is something to think about,” he said.  “I don’t believe that this was a normal death,” Erdogan added.

Rabat – Palestinian Minister of National Economy Khalid al-Assaily and Moroccan Ambassador to Ramallah Mohammad Hamazawi met in late May to discuss a deal between the two countries.  The pact focused on investment, trade, and development between the North African country and its ally to the East. Morocco has long recognized Palestine’s sovereignty and aims to further economic ties with the state through the new agreement. The officials discussed forming both a joint economic committee and a joint business council. These collectives will work to establish a framework increasing trade between the two counties. Current Palestinian and Moroccan exports include perishables such as fruits, dates, and seafood products, as well as non-perishables like cars, and mosaic tiles. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Morocco exported seven times the number of goods to Palestine than Palestine exported to Morocco.  Allowing Palestinian merchants to sell goods directly to Moroccan markets would offer relief to businesses that have suffered under the 12-year Israeli blockade. Two factors remain an obstacle to economic exchange between Morocco and Palestine: distance and similarity in exported goods. While direct trade between the countries may not be the solution, the agreement could facilitate Palestinian companies in exporting their products to Arab and international markets. However the agreement ultimately relies on government enforcement. “We need government follow-through so that this agreement doesn’t remain mere talk without action,” Palestine Trade Center chairman Arafat Asfour said to Al-Monitor. The promise of an agreement was timely for Palestine. Earlier this year Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh enacted internal austerity measures after the country suffered a series of financial setbacks.  In February the United States drastically cut its aid package for the West Bank infrastructure programs and the Israeli government began restricting the transfer of Palestinian money.
 Contrary to the US, historically Morocco has remained a supporter of Palestine and its people.  “Palestine is considered a national cause in Morocco.” Moroccan Prime Minister Saadeddine El Othmani said at a speech Arab Media Workshop on Palestine last year.  Currently Morocco does not recognize Israel as a state. The economic agreement is not the first time this year that leaders from the two countries came together for diplomatic reasons. In January officials met and discussed ways to “improve the ties of friendship, fraternity, and cooperation between Morocco and Palestine, particularly in the judicial field.”

By Kawtar Ennaji Rabat – Minister of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs,  Ahmed Toufiq, said the ministry plans to freeze its investments in mosques, new administrative institutions, and Quranic schools in order to address the problem of closed mosques. During a question session at the House of Representatives held Monday, June 17, Toufiq discussed the ministry’s efforts to recondition mosques closed since 2011. He went on to indicate that “the closure of mosques is implemented based on a review by a specialized committee after the confirmation of a real threat.” Toufiq revealed that, since 2011, experts conducted 4,661 technical expertise operations at a total cost of MAD 140 million, resulting in the closure of 3,007 mosques. He added that the ministry has supervised the renovation of 910 mosques at a cost of MAD 473 million, the reconditioned mosques have since been reopened to worshipers. There are currently 466 mosques in the renovation phase at a total cost of MAD 962 million, while 189 mosques are under licensing at a total cost of MAD 243 million. Toufiq mentioned that 1442 mosques are still closed and that their renovation over the next 3 years would require a total cost of MAD 2 billion. He added that the ministry will work on mobilizing MAD 1 billion from the investment budget allocated to it, and requested the allocation of an additional negotiable amount of MAD 1 billion. Toufiq pointed out that despite the Ministry’s efforts, the monitoring process carried out by Walis and governors resulted in the closure of an average of 157 mosques annually. “Most benefactors prefer to build new mosques instead of rebuilding collapsing ones,” Toufiq said. He also appealed to the benefactors to sensitize them to the need to renovate the collapsing mosques, saying that reconditioning is as rewarding as building.

Rabat – Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib is a central bank which hasn’t cut interest rates since 2016, diminishing this year’s economic projections for growth and inflation of the country’s  $115 billion economy.  North African Business journalist Suhail Karam reports from Bloomberg that Morocco’s central bank won’t budge on interest rates, even as the country’s economic prospects “took a turn for the worse.”  Karam sees Morocco’s economic stability, which was established in 2011, as threatened by protests over jobs, poverty, and human rights. The state’s reform efforts have recently pushed tens of thousands of teachers and medical school students to rally against what they call a push to privatize a costly public system.  Economic growth has remained too weak to generate enough jobs, while inflation is running below the central bank’s forecasts, having touched negative territory twice already this year, according to Karam. Lending also continues to be depressed as a result of a slowdown in the real estate industry, lower private investment, and tighter regulations.  The government has made economic stimulus which should raise VAT repayments for private firms 1.1 percent of gross domestic product this year from 0.7 percent in 2018. Karam predicts that Morocco will see a general increase of wages, Morocco’s “broadest wage hike,” since 2011 next month. Under an agreement reached in April, a 10 percent increase in the private-sector minimum wage will be delivered over two years starting in July. “That, alongside this year’s value-added tax reimbursements, means the key rate will likely stay at a record-low 2.25% when the central bank meets on Tuesday,” He writes. The hike is expected to boost “demand for domestic goods and social peace,” said Rachid Aourraz, an economist and founding member of the Moroccan Institute for Policy Analysis. “But it’s not the sort of wage hike that will see people put some money on the side or rush to a bank to buy a car or a home.” Abdelouahed El-Jai, a former central bank director and now an economist at Rabat-based think-tank Cerab said, “On paper, Bank Al-Maghrib should cut the rate. But it shouldn’t be done after the government took steps that will boost demand. The central bank will want to see the effects of these measures on inflation before considering a rate move, probably in six to 12 months.” “Financing conditions remain satisfactory overall,” Nasreddine Lazrak, chief economist at Banque Centrale Populaire said in an email to Karam. “The central bank covers the entire liquidity needs of Moroccan banks and interbank rates are close to the key rate.”

Rabat – AGCO, a worldwide manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment, has opened a new office in the north-east of Casablanca, Morocco.  According to the company’s website, AGCO’s innovative approaches are helping make more productive farms—and helping make the world a better, more sustainable place. AGCO’s philosophy says that professional farm machinery is key to boosting agricultural productivity and reducing post-harvest waste. “The opening of the Casablanca office demonstrates AGCO’s strong commitment to ‘Run Africa from Africa,’” The AGCO vice-president and general manager Africa, Nuradin Osman, said. “The Casablanca office will also serve as the headquarters for Agri-Parks, which represent a significantly fresh approach for agricultural production and rural transformation,” Osman said. “The innovation of Agri-Parks is in developing infrastructure and community through agricultural mechanization.” Agri-Parks takes a holistic approach to farm production, crop storage, and processing by grouping together key activities in one location. The company’s role is to provide the technology, equipment, and expertise for this networked approach. This highlights AGCO’s product and services, which include farm machinery, grain processing, and protein production systems. Agri-Park aims to secure reliable sources of food, help create high-value jobs, and encourage satellite industries through agricultural machinery workshops and farm supplies outlets. The objective is to focus on creating an integrated value chain “from farm to fork instead of selling low-value crops.” A further aim is to develop agricultural contracting businesses to assist small-scale farmers in gaining access to modern machinery and technologies. AGCO has received several awards this year alone, including awards for its precision planting, manufacturing excellence, manufacturing leadership, and being one of the best workplaces for women. This AGCO office comes after just recently opening in Johannesburg, South Africa.  “The continent is home to 60 percentof the world’s arable land and is thus expected to play a major role in future, global food security,” said Osman. “Opening the Casablanca office not only builds on our presence at a sub-regional level but also underlines AGCO’s vision and strategy for advancing African agricultural prosperity.”

Rabat – As hundreds of bodies still waited to be buried beneath the ground following the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, a glimmer of hope shone across the country with the election of Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected leader. Vowing to bring the country together after its bloody revolution, Morsi promised inclusiveness and cooperation between Egyptians of all political affiliations, and sought to oust the lingering oligarchic structures of his predecessor’s regime. However, Morsi’s appeals to liberal and progressive Egyptians quickly fell into conflict with his conservative ideologies and alignment with the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed Islamist group which has been designated as a terrorist organization in Egypt. This conflict broke out into violence within the year, as an attempt at expanding presidential power led to deadly street fighting between leftist Egyptians and Morsi’s supporters in the Muslim Brotherhood. Soon after taking office, Morsi moved to consolidate his hold on the country and prevent Mubarak-era judges from intervening in the new regime by issuing a constitutional declaration to essentially exclude the Egyptian Judiciary from practicing any form of oversight. After barely a year in office, Morsi was overthrown and imprisoned by the Egyptian military, which began to implement its own vision for the restoration of the country’s government. On June 17, 2019, after several years of being locked away in prison, Morsi passed away at the age of 67 following a court appearance in Cairo. Democracy and Morsi’s rise power In 2011, hundreds of Egyptians were killed in the violent struggle to oust Hosni Mubarak, who had been in power for three decades.  With the removal of Mubarak from power, Egypt was free to hold its first truly democratic elections, which were won by Mohamed Morsi, and the Muslim Brotherhood, with 51.7 percent of the vote. Promising inclusivity and cooperation across Egypt, Morsi won the initial support of both his ardent supporters and suspicious critics, with his popularity never dropping below 55 to 60 percent. “The counternarrative that Morsi wasn’t a popular person, that Egypt needed a more charismatic figure, was not true … For the first four months, Morsi’s popularity [ranking] was in the stratosphere,” said Wael Haddara, one of Morsi’s campaign advisers. “He presented to people an accessible figure. A vast majority of Egyptians eking out a living, struggling to make ends meet, looked at Morsi as one of their own,” he added. Taking his oath at Tahrir Square, the site of mass protests during the 2011 Revolution, Morsi attempted to connect with his people by opening his jacket to show that he wasn’t wearing a bulletproof vest. Morsi, who had himself been imprisoned during the 2011 protests before escaping in a mass prison break, also released 572 political prisoners detained during the revolution to further show his dedication towards the revolution and his acknowledgement of the hundreds who were killed to earn his position as a democratically elected leader. In the eyes of his people, Morsi was a welcome change from the elitist regime of Mubarak, and represented hope for a secure and democratic future for the state of Egypt. Meanwhile, in reality, Morsi’s grip on his country was challenged in every arena, with the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces giving itself legislative power and the Mubarak-era judges of the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolving the Brotherhood-majority lower house of Parliament. When the time came to draft a new constitution, Morsi stripped the military of its ability to participate in creating the constitution and issued a declaration to place himself beyond judicial review. The drafted constitution which promoted Islam and threatened practices such as free speech and womens’ rights was hastily written and approved by an Islamist-dominated assembly. To further consolidate his own power, Morsi moved to further entrench the Muslim Brotherhood within the government by appointing seven of the group’s members to regional governor positions. Among these appointments was the placement of a member of al-Jama’a al-Islamiyya, an extremist organization responsible for killing 62 tourists in Luxor in 1997, to the position of governor of Luxor. With Morsi’s power growing dangerously similar to the previous Mubarak regime, the military decided to intervene and issued the president an ultimatum to either fix the increasingly severe political crisis or step down from power. Coup and the fall of Egyptian democracy Two days after issuing the ultimatum, the forces from the Egyptian military marched into Morsi’s office to inform him that he was no longer the legitimate president of Egypt. Morsi was dragged out and brought to the headquarters of the Republican Guard to be imprisoned, where subsequent clashes between pro- and anti-Muslim Brotherhood forces would lead to the military gunning down 51 demonstrators. With democracy suspended and Morsi imprisoned, the military moved to crack down on the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, butchering at least 800 pro-Morsi protestors in the Rabaa Massacre one month after Morsi’s removal. Morsi had been charged with a myriad of crimes, ranging from espionage to murder for his role in the deaths of protestors in 2012.  At the time of Morsi’s death, Egypt had not yet resolved the ongoing crisis and the military remains in power, leaving the country without any hope for democratic leadership in the near future. Thus, with the death of Egypt’s first elected official, the hope for future elections deteriorates and the prospects for a free Egypt remain grim.

Rabat – Morocco’s Secretary of State for Sustainable Development Nezha El Ouafi said that the economic cost of air pollution in Morocco is estimated at 1.62 percent of the country’s GDP. The statement came during a press briefing at the National Laboratory for Studies and Pollution Monitoring. El Ouafi added that the cost of air pollution in Morocco adds up to nearly $1.2 billion per year due to its effects on public health and the environment. The worrying number means Morocco attaches special importance to air pollution because of its direct impact on people and the environment, El Ouafi said. Vehicle emissions are the most important sources of air pollution in Moroccan urban centers, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the pollution. Aside from causing economic problems, air pollution causes a great public health risk globally. According to a 2016 World Health Organization study, 3 million deaths a year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. The study also found that a shocking 92 percent of the world’s population lives in areas with unhealthy levels of pollution.

Rabat – The Rhineland Palatine’s top administrative court suspended a decree against full-body swimsuits issued by the local council in the western German city of Koblenz. The court has issued an injunction suspending the ban, pending further investigation into the case.  The ban was initiated at the beginning of this year after Koblenz local legal council narrowly approved the ban. The ban forbids garments in public pools in the western city of Koblenz. Authorities and officials argued that it was impossible to check whether wearers have open wounds or diseases since the burkini covers the whole body. The ruling from the local council was challenged by a Syrian asylum seeker who had been advised by her doctor to swim as part of treatment for a back problem. A pious muslim, the woman challenged the ban in court. The Rhineland Palatine  court ruled that the council’s ban goes against the German constitution’s call for equality and respect This is not the first time the Burkini has been banned in a European country. Bans on the burkini were imposed by French Riviera mayors in 2016, but were later lifted in seaside resorts after France’s top administrative court overruled the law. Bans on the women’s full-body swimsuits have also been lifted in France’s Villeneuve-Loubet, Cannes, Frejus and Roquebrune.

By Abdessamd El Baz Rabat –  Michel Platini, former President of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), was arrested on Tuesday, June 18 for alleged corruption in connection with the 2022 Qatar World Cup .  The ex-captain of the French football team had been serving a 4-year ban from all football-related activities after receiving a $2 million payment from International Federation of Association Football (FIFA). The investigation, which led to Platinis arrest, was opened in 2016. The former UEFA president was investigated on criminal charges relating to  “private corruption,” “criminal conspiracy,” “influence peddling and trading in influence” over 2022 Qatar World Cup, according to the French newspaper Le Monde.  Investigators are particularly interested “in the lunch organized on 23 November 2010 at the Elysee, in the presence of Nicolas Sarkozy, Michel Platini, the current Emir of Qatar, Tamim Ben Hamad Al Thani, Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem, then Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Emirate,” reported Le Monde.  Sepp Blatter, former FIFA president, said in an interview with TRT World, that Platini’s decision to grant Qatar the 2022 World Cup was influenced by French Politics.  Blatter claimed that Platini met with the then President Nicolas Sarkozy and several Qatari officials at a lunch prior to announcing the decision that Qatar would host the World Cup in 2020.  Michel Platini previously told Le Monde  “I knew I was going to vote for Qatar before lunch and I went to see Nicolas Sarkozy to tell him. I did not know that the Qataris would be there.” In 2015, Sepp Blatter announced his resignation as FIFA president amid bribery scandals.
In the same year, the US Justice Department issued several indictments against multiple individuals and organizations for corruption scandals.  The former head of the IRS criminal investigation division, Richard Weber, said: “This really is the World Cup of fraud, and today we are issuing FIFA a red card.”

By Morgan Hekking Rabat – Acting US Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan has authorized the deployment of 1,000 troops to the Middle East. The announcement came Monday, June 17, five days after two oil tankers were attacked near the Strait of Hormuz, a vital passageway for maritime oil trade. The incident has caused an increase in oil prices by more than three percent. The tankers, stationed in the Gulf of Oman, were Norwegian-owned Front Altair and Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous. Crew members from both ships were rescued by Iranian search and rescue teams, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). The US Navy also assisted the tankers. Washington, D.C. and Riyadh have accused Tehran of facilitating the attacks, which came amid increasing tensions between the US and Iran. The Pentagon released photos supposedly connecting Iran to the attacks on Monday. According to Shanahan, who released a statement on Monday, June 17, the attacks “validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and their interests across the region.” Shanahan framed the deployment of American troops to the Middle East as a preemptive measure, stating that the defensive move will “ensure the safety and welfare of our military personnel working throughout the region and . . . protect our national interests.” Troop levels will be adjusted accordingly as the US military continues to monitor the situation. Iran has denied its alleged involvement in the explosions aboard the oil tankers. The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, has urged US forces to leave the region, claiming that Tehran is responsible for security in the Gulf. Four other tankers were attacked in May, prompting the US to increase their troops in the region to 1,500. The latest developments in the Gulf of Oman will place approximately 2,500 US troops in the region.

Rabat – The head of the International  Union of Muslim scholars, Ahmed Al Raissouni has released a statement mourning the death of former former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, who died after collapsing in a Cairo court on Monday, June 17. The news ofMorsi’ sudden death shocked the Arab world, with several public figures and leaders mourning his death. Morocco’s Al Raissouni, who described Morsi as a “martyr,” was among the well-known figures who blame Egypt of  the ousted president’s death. In the statement issued on June 17. Al Raissouni accused the Egyptian regime of killing the ousted president, who was Egypt’s first democratically elected President. “Six years ago he was tortured in prison. Six years ago he was taken to the so-called trials. Six years ago they killed him part-by-part,” wrote Al Raissouni. Pointing fingers at the Egyptian regime, Al Raissouni said that the example of Morsi was a “stigma to all parts of Egypt, except for the treacherous ring governing” in the country. “These traitors and assassins have no brow and now place to put  a new stain. They are a disgrace to Arabs, Muslims, and humanity,” Al Raissouni said. In his statement, Al Raissouni accused Egyptian political elites of selling Morsi as well as“legitimacy, and democracy.” “The case of Mohamed Morsi is a disgrace and a condemnation to the silent and gloating Arab presidents. It is a disgrace and a condemnation to Al-Azhar, and all its scholars and to its so-called sheikh the ‘Grand Imam.’” In addition to Egypt, Al Raisouni also blamed Saudi Arabia and the UAE for the death of the imprisoned ex-president. “The case of Mohamed Morsi constitutes a disgrace and a treacherous plot for criminal conspirators of Al Saud and Al Nahyan families who are involved in the killing of the martyr Mohamed Morsi.” Al Raissouni also accused Saudi Arabia and the UAE of killing innocent people in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Sudan and other Muslims. Al Raissouni was not the only public figure to condemn the death of Morsi. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Egypt’s “tyrants” for the death of Morsi. “History will never forget those tyrants who led to his death by putting him in jail and threatening him with execution,” said Erdogan. A close ally to Morsi, Erdogan added. “May Allah rest our Morsi brother, our martyr’s soul in peace.”  The United Nations also expressed condolences to Morsi’s family through its spokesman Stephane Dujarric. Malaysia, Qatar, Palestine’s Hamas have also expressed condolences to the family of the deceased.

Rabat –  The Polisario Front arrested Sahrawi journalist and activist Moulay Aba Buzid during a solidarity demonstration on Monday, June 17. The demonstration took place  next to the high commission of refugees in Rabouni near Tindouf, Algeria. Pro-Polisario news outlet FuturoSahara reported that several activists have condemned the “kidnapping” of their colleague who  was “taken to an unknown destination by some members of the ‘national gendarmerie” without an arrest order from the ‘republic’s’ prosecutor.” Mustafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, a former Polisario member, confirmed the arrest on his Facebook page.  Mustafa Salma said “Keep the journalist hidden if you can. I learned of the arrest of the journalist in Sahrawi refugee camps today.I did not condemn this back then, and I don’t need to condemn it.  Every Moment Buzid spends in detention does not only condemn Polisario, but also the high commission for refugees as he was arrested  immediately after he left their office,” Mustafa Salma. The activist added that Buzid, along with other activists, “went to the commission to hand in a letter, calling for the protection of Sahrawis in Morocco. However, it would have been more appropriate for them to demand their own protection.”  Mustafa Salma, who was police officer in the Tindouf camps, said that the High Commission is “required to reveal the fate” of the journalist. “The Polisario Front is required to keep [the journalist) hidden, if it can. A week ago they were widely sharing a report from the  Reporters Without Borders on the arrest of Sahrawi journalists and the crackdown on their activities in Morocco’s southern regions. I challenge [Polisario] them to keep journalist Buzid hidden now,” concluded Mustafa Salma. This is not the first time that Polisario faces accusations of kidnapping and violent arrest of Sahrawi activists in the Tindouf camps. Throughout this year, Polisario has been facing pressure from Sahrawis who have repeatedly condemned the mysterious disappearance of Ahmed El Khalil, a  Polisario member who went missing more than 10 years ago under unknown circumstances. The front claimed that El Khalil is alive after  pressure from his family and activists who have continually protested his disappearance. In February, Sahrawis took to the desert in Rabouni, where the Secretariat of the Polisario Front is located, to condemn the disappearance.

Rabat – Rabat – After giving a much-needed morale boost to Morocco’s Western Sahara position, Brazil is poised to take the growing connection with Morocco to the next level.  In a series of tweets that followed Morocco’s Nasser Bourita’s recent trip to the country, the Latin American giant announced it has struck a historic defense deal with Rabat. The ministry tweeted on June 13 that Brazil has given a supportive nod to Morocco’s ambitions to develop its own defense industry. The agreement, which according to the Brazilian foreign ministry includes “investment cooperation and facilitation” in military industry, is the first of its kind between Brazil and a Maghreb country. The move, the statement added, “is an important investment destination, with the participation of companies such as Bunge Fertilizantes, Neobus, Randon, and Votorantim Group.” The deal is already being welcomed in Rabat as the ultimate proof of Brazil’s adherence to Morocco’s most vital interests. The underlying purpose of the agreement is to provide bilateral platform to facilitate Morocco’s desired shift towards relative self-sufficiency in the defense sector. Currently one of Africa’s heaviest importers of military equipments, Rabat is intent on developing its own industry to reduce, and potentially end, overreliance on foreign-made weaponry. Along with the investment and business components of the defense deal, the Brazilian ministry explained in a subsequent tweet, that the two countries signed a Framework Agreement on cooperation and defense. The framework entails promoting knowledge in military science and technology and providing a basis for Morocco to acquire defense products and services. This means in addition to helping Morocco’s defense ambitions, Brazil will avail its own resources for training Moroccan officers in an array of state-of-the-art military technologies. The announcement from Brazil is far from Rabat’s only move to foster its own defense industry, however. In late May, Liam Fox, the British Secretary of State for International Trade, visited Morocco to discuss and explore possibilities of advancing commercial and political connections with Rabat. During his visit, Fox said in a press conference that the defense sector was an important component of the increasingly “promising” connections between Rabat and London. The Brit’s enthusiasm was later confirmed by Moroccan sources, with a Moroccan diplomat indicating that part of what Fox meant by “promising” prospects for defense cooperation entailed investing in a joint venture with Britain’s Chemical Military Product (CMP), a leader in the conception of military explosives and related weaponry. There are also whispers of negotiations with Spain and France in the military aviation sector. Already a continental giant in terms of its air capabilities (the country is among the restricted circle of countries with the latest F16 fighters), Rabat is intent on upgrading its defense fleet. The country even nourishes ambitions of developing its own industries in the long term to supply its naval and air forces with made-in-Morocco equipment. Latin America offensive Brazil’s latest move comes after the country vowed to support Morocco’s Western Sahara stance, calling the territorial conflict an “important issue for Moroccan territorial integrity.” The Latin American country’s notable, unambiguous shift towards Morocco is part of a pattern that some are already dubbing a Moroccan “diplomatic remontada” in Latin America. The idea is that, after falling behind in convincing Latin American countries of the “historical legitimacy” of its Western Sahara claims, as well as the seriousness and reliability of its plan for a political settlement in the decades-long conflict, Rabat is ready engage the region on a whole new basis. The plan, according to observers, is to embark on a charm offensive to gain the support of a region whose deep-seated association with Marxism and “revolutionary movements” has meant that it has traditionally been more receptive of Polisario’s claims. With Brazil, Surinam, Chile, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic all recently breaking with that tradition, observers say the plan is so far working for Morocco.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled on Tuesday, June 18 a five-member terror cell operating in Tetouan, Northern Morocco. A statement from the BCIJ said that the five suspects, aged between 23 and 33,  are under investigation for links to ISIS. During the arrest, BCIJ seized several electronic devices, knives, and military uniforms. Preliminary  investigations show that the suspect pledged allegiance to the self-styled “emir” of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The suspects, according to BCIJ, are also accused of promoting terrorism and extremist propaganda.  The cell is suspected of having links with terrorists in conflict zones, such as Syria and Iraq. The group are suspected of plotting terror attacks across the country. The statement added that the five cell members will be brought to justice immediately after investigation. Today’s operation is part of Morocco’s national and international counter-terrorism initiatives. BCIJ has carried several similar operation throughout the year. The latest operation was on  June 3, when BCIJ dismantled a three-member terrorist cell operating in several cities in the region of Draa-Tafilalet. Following the 2003 terror attacks in Casablanca and the 2011 attack in Marrakech, the Moroccan security services announced several counter-terrorism initiatives. The programs were praised by several international allies, including the US. In March, Morocco’s Ministry of the Interior announced the repatriation of eight Moroccan terrorists who were operating in Syria. The move pleased the US, which said that Morocco “is a highly capable partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.”

By Kawtar Ennaji Rabat –  On June 14, the Higher Council for Audiovisual Communication, known as HACA, issued a warning to the National Broadcasting and Television Company (SNRT), the “SOREAD 2M” and Medi1 TV over the controversial running of an Orange Telecom commercial. The HACA noted, as part of the monitoring of audiovisual programs, that one of the  “Orange Morocco” commercials contains a scene including the quote: “Ndir Selfi mâa Omar ou nâayet lweld Aïcha wakha ikoun f’Kandahar“.  The sound sequence translates as: “I take a selfie with Omar and I call Ould Aisha even though he is in Kandahar” (Afghanistan). For the HACA, this is an “implicit reference to the phenomenon of recruiting young people to join illegal organizations.” Accompanied by the voice over; the commercial screened a scene which shows a group of young people dressed in short jellabas, including a bearded man. The scene depicts an innocuous communication from the Moroccan streets with a friend in Kandahar,  Afghanistan. The HACA considered that, given the symbolic significance of this geographical reference and even in the absence of direct incitement, “this passage is likely to constitute a normalization and banalization, by humor, of joining entities and regions known to be harboring organizations classified as terrorists. “ All of these elements “put the commercial’s content in non-compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions in force, particularly those relating to ethical commitments.” The “Orange Telecom” advert was broadcast from May 9 to 13 (the first week of Ramadan).  After having sent  a letter,dated May 20, to SNRT, “SOREAD 2M” and Médi 1 TV, concerning the recorded observations, the HACA finally sent an official warning to the three television companies. The warning will be published in the Official Bulletin, says a statement released by the Council on Sunday June 16.

Rabat – Well-known zionist Mike Evans shared his support for the improving relationships between Israel and some Gulf nations at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference Sunday. Evans said that after visiting multiple Gulf states, “the leaders are more pro-Israel than a lot of Jews,” specifically praising Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.  He later also recognized Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi as a supporter of his cause. Evans said he believes there will be peace between Israel and at least five or six Gulf nations before Trump leaves office.  An ally of the president, Evans gave Trump the “Friend of Zion” award in December 2017 after he moved the US Embassy from Tel Avivto Jerusalem. Ties between Israel and some Gulf nations have been warming over mutual dislike for Iran and positive relations with Trump.  The Trump administration – which also seeks to contain Iran – strongly supports closer ties between US allies in the Gulf and Israel. The new friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia remained strong in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, taking many by surprise. Evans founded the Friends of Zion (FOZ) Museum to recognize non-Jews who helped the Jewish people return to their historic homeland, specifically Christian Zionists, in 2015.  The FOZ also serves as a platform to denounce the policy of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) and antisemitism. With over 60 million members, FOZ is one of the largest pro-Israel sites in the world.

Rabat – Mostafa Terrab was elected president of the International Fertilizer Association (IFA), becoming the first African leader of the organization on June 13. The IFA is a global body which promotes the interests of the fertilizer industry Terrab is the CEO of the world’s largest fertilizer exporter, the Morocco-based OCP Group, which is committed to feeding the growing global population in a sustainable manner. Both OCP Group and the IFA were founded nearly a century ago and while OCP Group has always placed emphasis on improving agriculture within Africa, the IFA has shifted its focus to the region as well. The IFA aims to promote efficient production and distribution of fertilization around the world as well as serving as a space for collaboration among its 480 members. Members are spread across 68 countries and account for 80 percent of the world’s fertilizer production. Forty-five percent of members are based in developing countries. As the world’s population grows, there will be greater demand for food. Both OCP Group and the IFA are working to increase soil fertility and support sustainable agriculture in Africa to take advantage of the agricultural potential throughout the continent. Africa has the lowest fertilizer consumption in the world.  Low soil fertility contributes to low crop yields which makes it more difficult to produce enough food for the population. Throughout his two year term, Terrab said he hopes to increase the use of fertilizers in Africa and bring more young people and women into agriculture. Terrab received both his Master’s in Engineering and a PhD in Operational Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Before joining OCP Group in 2006, he served as an advisor in the Royal Cabinet and as a lead regulator specialist at the World Bank.

By Ghayt Bennis Rabat – Protesting medical students have launched the hashtag #DoctorsUnderOppression following an enormous boycott of final exams. One student told Huffpost Morocco: “The students willingly decided to launch this hashtag to make their voices heard worldwide.” Online protests, particularly supported by reported cases of “threats against striking students, including visiting their homes by the Moqadem .” “Students were asked to visit the Governorate (Wilaya) along with their relatives and their parents simply answered that their children are adults and that it is their right to sit or not to sit the exam.” While the hashtag fight is still rising, the struggle between the striking medical students and the government is far from over. On 13 June, in a press release, the state government announced that medical institutions would remain open until 25 June for students wishing to break the strike and take their final exams. The government also restated its “willingness to implement the legal and procedural actions in such situations, including failure of the academic year or expulsion of students who have already completed the authorized years of repetition “.  The government, which accuses the “Al Adl Wal Ihsane “ movement in particular of “taking advantage of this situation”, also threatens to “take the legal actions  against anyone who tries to disturb the normal conduct of these examinations”. The achievement of the newcommon hashtag seems to have inspired private medical students in the private sector too. The private medical students have started their own battle cry by putting #ResidencyForAll, which went viral on Saturday. “These students must protest to have favorable conditions but within their own hospitals to do their residency,” said the the striking student interviewed by Huffpost.

Rabat – New Zealand’s Sikh community has donated $39,000 (NZD $60,000) to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack. The two consecutive attacks on mosques during Friday prayers in Christchurch on March 15 left 51 people dead. Since then, over $650,000 has been raised for the surviving victims of the attack and the families left behind. The latest donation comes from New Zealand’s Sikh community, who rallied together during a 5-day Facebook appeal for donations. The $39,000 from the Sikh community came from 1600 total donations. The donation was presented with a cheque to Lianne Dalziel, the Mayor of Christchurch on Wednesday, 12 June at a function in Christchurch. The local Muslim and Sikh communities were present, including representatives of the two affected mosques, Linwood Islamic Center and the Al Noor Mosque. Auckland-based Jaspreet Singh Rajpura is to thank for initiating the fundraiser on March 16, with the support of Sikh Supreme Society. “No amount of money can change what has happened, or bring back the lives lost. But we can offer our support to victims and their families, so they don’t have to bear this burden alone,” he told Australian news outlet SBS Punjabi. “This couldn’t have been possible without community support. Thank you, everyone. Hope we will always stay strong and stand together again and again.” The generosity comes as a moment of brightness just 3 days after the perpetrator of the attack, a 28-year-old Australian man, pleaded not guilty to 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one terrorism offense in the Christchurch High Court on June 14. A trial has been scheduled to begin on May 4, 2020, and prosecutors estimate it may run for up to six weeks.

Rabat – Ahmad Ahmad, the president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), has just given a muscular rebuttal to critics of CAF’s stance on the controversial Champions League final between Esperance de Tunis (EST) and Wydad of Casablanca. In what France Football has described as a no-holds-barred interview, Ahmad doubled down on the decision to replay the second leg of the match between Wydad and EST. There has been a flurry of criticism since CAF ruled for a rematch, with EST’s board threatening to seize “international instances” like FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). EST has protested against what it says is a scandalous and biased decision. Ahmad has been unimpressed, however. Where EST saw a scandal, he saw the need to restore confidence in CAF’s ability to “rule responsibly” when faced with significant, hot button issues. While unprecedented in African football, Ahmad said, the rematch move was a clear and thunderous message that the body in charge of monitoring the game on the continent will no longer admit a certain way of behaving from African clubs and federations. “I tried to make everyone come to their senses,” Ahmad offered. He went to reveal that despite his efforts to maintain neutrality and fair-play in the course of the events that led to CAF’ final decision, he has received threats from Hamdi Meddeb, the EST president. Ahmad did not dwell on the type of threats he has been subjected to. He was insistent, however, that EST should take the decision as a testimony of the near consensus in CAF circles that they have not been doing some things right. He particularly hinted at the suspicion that ES Tunis deliberately neglected to attend to the functioning of the VAR system before the match against Wydad. For that, he argued, the rematch ruling comes as punishment and a message that teams which do not abide by CAF regulations should expect similar treatment in the future. “What else could I do?” Ahmad answered when asked about the implications of a rematch in a fragile atmosphere. What about the potentially violent backlash from circles that may feel prejudiced by the ruling? “Since last year, VAR has always been used in our tournaments [properly]. Only in Tunisia has the system been defective. I doubt that it was a coincidence. We can no longer accept that.” Because of the biased refereeing controversy that marked the first leg between the two teams, CAF needed to “take serious measures” to signal that “we can no longer afford confusions because of a defective VAR.” Ahmad’s statements, a damning thrashing of ES Tunis’ accusations of pro-Morocco bias, comes on the heels of surging tensions between Moroccan and Tunisian fans. After CAF opted for a rematch, the EST-Wydad confrontation took extra-sporting proportions, with politicians joining in to propel the enmity to new heights. The CAF chair’s interview also comes days ahead of the much-anticipated 2019 CAN. Tunisia and Morocco are among the tournament’s favorites, and the prospect of a knockout stage encounter between the two teams may yet morph into an extension of the ongoing hostility between the two nations’ most successful football clubs. Meanwhile, Ahmad has high expectations for this year’s CAN tournament.
With the quality and depth of squads, as well as the extension of participation from 16 to 24 teams, he argued, this year’s contest may be the most exciting ever organized. “With the likes of Salah, Mane, Ziyech, Pepe, and Mahrez who have all been brilliant,” fans can expect a first-rate display of footballing quality.

Rabat – In an interview published Sunday in Asharq Al-Awsat, bin Salman said Saudi Arabia was committed to achieving justice “without getting distracted by positions taken by some for their own domestic considerations.” Bin Salman’s comments were understood as a veilied reference to Turkey, where the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi took place last October. While countries such as the United States President Donald Trump has refused to hold the Crown Prince responsible, Turkey has openly accused Bin Salman of the murder. Bin Salman has denied any involvement in the killing. Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the Saudi regime, visited the Saudi Consulate on October 2 of 2018 to procure documents for his upcoming marriage. Inside the consulate the journalist was confronted by a team of Saudi operatives. He was then strangled, dismembered with a bone saw, and removed from the building. The location of Khashoggi’s body remains unknown. After weeks of shifting explanations, from denying Khashoggi’s death, to claiming it was an accident, then blaming it on a “rogue operation,” the Saudi government finally admitted in late October that the murder was premeditated. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the killing was “obviously a political crime.” In 2017, a year before the murder, Khashoggi began writing an op-ed column for the Washington Post. The column was critical of the Saudi regime’s foreign policy and the diminishing press freedom in the country. That same fall, MBS voiced concerns to his aides that Khashoggi was becoming too influential. According to an intelligence report, bin Salman said he would “use a bullet” on the dissident journalist if he refused to end his criticism and return to Saudi Arabia. In the Asharq al-Awsat interview, bin Salman called the killing a “very painful crime,” and said “any party exploiting the case politically should stop doing so, and present evidence to the [Saudi] court.” A month after the killing, audio tapes of the gruesome murder were leaked to the press by the Turkish government. Security footage also surfaced, showing Khashoggi entering the consolate. The tapes later show one of the operatives, dressed in Khashoggi’s clothing, leaving the building through the back entrance. US President Donald Trump has refused to place any blame on bin Salman for the murder. Instead, he has focused on strengthening diplomatic ties with his oil-rich ally. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor, is also unwilling to implicate Bin Salman in Khashoggi’s killing. In an interview with Axios on June 3, Kushner refused to divulge any information from conversations he has had with the Crown Prince. Instead he referred to an investigation by the State Department and said “when they have the facts from the investigation then it will be up to the President to make a determination on what he wants to do.” Last November, the Central Intelligence Agency released an assessment of the killing and found it had been ordered by the Crown Prince. In February, UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard discussed her ongoing investigation into the case. Callamard said her evidence showed “Khashoggi was the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the state of Saudi Arabia.” Callamard’s full report on Khashoggi’s killing is expected to be published this week.

Rabat – Egyptian former President Mohamed Morsi has died after a court session today, Monday June 17. The Islamist president was elected after the 2011 Arab Spring, which ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak.  Morsi served as the fifth president of Egyptfrom July 30, 2012 to July 3, 2013. 
 Serving only one year of his 4-year term, he was removed from power by a coup d’état in 2013.  The former president was a key figure in the society the Muslim Brotherhood,a transnational Sunni Islamist organization founded in Egypt by Islamic scholar and schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna in 1928. He was serving a 7-year-sentence for allegedly falsifying his candidacy application during the 2012 presidential campaign. The ex-president faced further accusations including inciting supporters to murder a “journalist and two opposition protesters.” The charges are linked to clashes that erupted between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and opposition protesters in December 2012 in Cairo. In November 2013, Morsi faced trial along with14 other brotherhood members. Morsi denied the accusations against him, emphasizing that he was a victim of a military coup. “I am the president of the republic, according to the constitution of the state,” he said from the dock during his first hearing. In April 2015, Morsi and the other Brotherhood defendants  were sentenced to 20 years in prison “inciting” murder in addition to fraud. He was also sentenced to a further 25 years in prison  in September 2016 for passing intelligence to Qatar. An Egyptian court sentenced the former president to another three years  in December 2017 on “charges of insulting the judiciary.” Born in 1951,  Morsi studied engineering at Cairo University and moved to the US in the 70s to finish his PhD. On his returnEgypt, the former president became head of the engineering department  at Zagazig University.  In April 2012,  Morsi entered the presidential campaign as the Muslim Brotherhood candidate. Standing on an  anti corruption platform, he opposed the elites from the Hosni Mubarak era and called for radical change. Opposition voices criticized Morsi for failing in his mission, accusing him of allowing “Islamists to monopolize” Egypt’s political scene, the BBC reported. In 2018,  a panel of British MPs and lawyers issued a report, suggesting that Morsi was  being held in standards lower than “those sanctioned by international law.” The situation, according to the report, could “lead to an early death.” According to the Retention Review Panel (DRP), Morsi was receiving “inadequate medical care, particularly inadequate management of his diabetes, and inadequate management of his liver disease.”

In Darija (Moroccan Arabic), Fajr wrote: “Hi my brother Abderrazak, I hope you are well. I am sorry if I upset you because of the penalty.

Rabat – Huawei’s founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has said that the telecommunication company forecast a $30 billion decrease in revenue over the next few years.  The prediction comes in the wake of President Trump’s executive order blacklisting Huawei in the US. The legislation prevents American mobile equipment makers from trading with the tech company. . “In the next two years, I think we will reduce our capacity, our revenue will be down by about $30 billion compared to the forecast, so our sales revenue this year and next year will be about $100 billion,” Ren Zhengfei said Monday during a panel discussion at Huawei’s headquarters in Shenzhen. In 2018, Huawei’s revenue grew by 19.5%, surpassing $100 billion for the first time. Earlier this year the United States government accused Huawei of using international networks for espionage purposes. So far the evidence behind the accusation has not been made public. On 15 May 2019, President Trump signed an executive order banning American companies from trading with any foreign telecommunication providers named on a blacklist of companies thought to pose a threat to the US national security. To comply with the ban, Google announced that they would no longer provide Huawei with pre-release access to Android software updates. Huawei users in China are already unable to use Google’s various services, such as Gmail, google maps, youtube, etc. Most recently Facebook group, which owns Instagram and Whatsapp, also announced that Huawei would no longer be authorized to pre-install the group’s applications on their devices. Despite the US blacklist, Russia’s MTS network operator, however, has announced the signing of a new contract with the Chinese telecommunication company to develop a 5G network over the coming year. Russia believe that Huawei pose no threat to national security and that the US allegations are false and unjust. The chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill Dmitriev, has criticized the US stance, saying that they have failed to provide evidence that Huawei is a security risk.

Rabat – After their honorable performance at the Russia World Cup, Morocco’s Atlas Lions won plaudits around the world and emerged as a footballing powerhouse in the African context.  This has meant that millions of Moroccans fell in love with Lions and raised their expectations of a squad that has often left them down, hoping that the current team could be the deal, the one to deliver the continental crown that has eluded the country since 1976.  Increasingly, Moroccan fans have grown into the belief the Moroccan national team will confirm its status as major African team and win the upcoming African Cup of Nations.  But the team’s less enthusiastic performances in most of its recent games, the defeat in a friendly game against Gambia on Wednesday and against Zambia on Sunday, have cast doubt about the Moroccan Lions’ capability to bring joy to the Moroccan people as early as this summer by winning the ultimate continental showpiece. .  Hamdallah brazen unprofessionalism  What is even more worrying is not the performance in the latest friendly matches, but the apparent lack of cohesiveness between some players and the alleged existence of clans within the national team.  That striker Abdellah Hamadallah decided to leave the national team’s training camp in an instant outburst of petulance and unprofessionalism all of a sudden and just 10 days ahead of the start of one of the most eventful continental contest, suggests that something is wrong with the way the team is being handled by head coach Hervé Renard. There is no doubt that Hamadallah’s decision to leave the national squad at such a critical juncture was wrong, and potentially damaging for the hopes and dreams of the millions of Moroccans he must have always nourished a desire to play for. He should have been more professional and overcome all the obstacles he might have faced since he joined the camp on June 1. A player of his drive and talent should have known better than slamming the door in the face of the national team less than a week before a career-defining contest. Moreover, for the sake of national pride and the pristine joy and smiles and passion of millions of ones’ compatriots, he should have sidelined some petty considerations. Perhaps the player might have felt a sense of lost cause for his national cap aspirations despite his performances and because of his status as a newcomer in a group where most of the players have regularly featured in Renard’s three-year tenure. There have been reports that neither the head coach nor the veteran players welcomed Hamadallah with the usual warmth for such occasions.  Hervé Renard’s favoritism  Since he was entrusted with the national team in March 2016, Renard has rarely relied on Moroccan players who play in the national league. The Frenchman  flaunts a preference for those who play outside of Morocco.  In some of the most disheartening instances of Renard’s coaching bias, he has often preferred players in second divisions of some European leagues at the expense of the comparably more skilled, in shape, and sometimes more experienced, players who happen to play in the national league.  Unless a player is a favorite of Renard’s, it appears, playing in a non-European league is a limiting factor, even if that means calling on out-of-shape and inexperienced European leagues players who, in normal circumstances, should not be playing for the national team at a highly competitive tournament. This was the case even in the CAN 2017. After the last-minute injuries of Soufian Boufal, Younes Belhanda and Noureddine Amrabat, Renard replaced them with out-of-shape players such as Mehdi Carcela, Omar Kaddouri, and Youssef Bouhaddouz, a newcomer who played in the German’s league second division when Renard’s call came.  Renard is apparently adopting the same approach for this year’s Africa Cup, which might explain Hamadallah’s decision to leave the national team’s camp. Despite his stellar performances in the Qatari league where he was a major goal scorer and most recently in the Saudi league where he finished the year as the top goal scorer, Hamadallah remained unqualified for a call up to feature in Renard’s squad.  According to reports from the inner circles of the FRMF, Renard called on Hamadallah only after the pressure he has been subjected from the President of Moroccan football federation, Fouzi Lekjaa.  Many argue that Hamadallah’s decision to leave the national squad was the consequence of Faiçal Fajr unfriendly behavior towards him during the friendly against Gambia. That incident brought into the spotlight some downsides of Renard’s management’s philosophy and the criteria he uses in selecting players who represent Morocco.  When manager Herve Renard’s criteria of selection becomes favoritism, player-pleasing and loyalty to those who have played with him for the longest time instead of reliance shape and skills at the moment of selection, the result is failure. No good is to be expected from this team. This coach, and players like Fayçal Fajr, Khalid Boutaib, and Mbark Boussoufa, Nabil Dirar, who have gained the coach’s trust and favor over other more qualified players for no reason other than their long-lasting collaboration are sure to disappoint fans at  this year’s CAN. 
All Moroccan fans watched how Fayçal Fajr, who had not played more than a few matches for the national team, started acting as if he owns the squad, and how he snatched the ball from the team’s main attacking player, Abderrazak Hamdallah, to recklessly take the penalty kick against Gambia.  Fajr failed to score that golden chance for an equalizer, adding insult to injury for a team hungry for a morale boost before taking on the upcoming CAN’s most lethal group stage.   Fans of the national team are wondering why coach Renard continues to rely on Khalid Boutaib despite his lack of competitiveness, his recent recovery from injury, and his loss of official status with his Egyptian club, Zamalek. After the three goals he scored against Gabon in October 2017, the Zamalek man become the undisputed owner of the Moroccan team’s attacking seat. It seems as though Renard has definitely and irreversibly handed Boutaib the keys of the Moroccan attack.  After taking the spotlight in that 2017 match, Boutaib’s spark faded in the rest of his matches with the national team, except for the one goal he scored against Spain at the latest World Cup. But the series of poor displays and laughable lack of clinical instincts in key, match-winning moments have not been enough to convince Renard that his loyal man may not be the right man. As for Boussoufa, despite his age and lack of competitive playing time (he has not played for over six months until last January), he seems to have officially and indefinitely leased his place in the team while other players, with more capability of enriching the Moroccan national team, are sidelined. Nobody can deny that Boussouffa has done a lot for the national team since he joined it for the first time in 2006. But at 34 of age and after over six months without playing a match, his fitness is highly questionable.  
Renard’s team management for more than three years clearly shows that he gives preference to Moroccan players coming from European leagues over players from the national championship or Moroccan professionals who have stood out in the Moroccan championship before signing for foreign clubs.   After the childish and unprofessional behavior of Fayçal Fajr in the friendly match against Gambia, the coach and the football federation had to punish him and exclude him from the team because such actions show a lack of cooperation, and mutual respect among the team members or at least some of them.  Many Moroccans deplore that there are still clueless players such as Khalid Boutaib, Mbarek  Boussoufa, Fayçal Fajr, and Marouane da Costa in a team boasting names such as Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi, Noussair Mazraoui, Sofiane Boufal, Yassine Bounou and Noureddine Amrabat. But an even more jarring realization has been that players of the national championship such as Walid El Karti, Ismail Haddad, and Mohcine Yajour, who have a lot African experience and have contributed to winning continental titles for their teams in the last two years, are overlooked.  After the poor performance of the national team in this week’s friendly matches, the childish behavior of Fayçal Fajr, and the withdrawal of Abderrazak Hamdallah from the team camp, Moroccans no longer nurture any hopes for the team to honor in the upcoming CAN 2019. Nor do they expect much of a coach who relies on favoring his friends and on players with no respect for teamwork to defend the national shirt.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has finally disclosed the much-awaited study on which the government decision to stick to Daylight Saving Time was allegedly based on. The 24-page study shows several sections, including the economic and social impacts. Social and health impacts The Ministry of Administration Reform published the study, claiming that it shows an “overall” positive impact. The study claims that the adoption of the DST year-round contributes to maintaining the stability of the population’s health as it stops the clock change several times. “The change of time has no impact on public security,” the study finds. The study also claimed that the decision provides an additional hour that citizens can utilize to accomplish their daily activities. However, the study acknowledges that citizens would face some difficulties during the first days of the change, especially for children and elderly people. “Some functions of the human body are negatively affected during the first few days of change of the hour.” According to the study, the change might cause increased levels of stress, sleep issues, and health disorders during the first few days. The study reported that the effects during the first days are not a source of concern. “The body of a human should not experience any issues and should not be affected” due to the change of hour as it can adapt to the change. “A human has a strong ability to adapt to a wide range of types of changes.” The study also emphasized that citizens don’t experience increased stress due to lack of public transportation as the companies concerned fixed their schedule to provide services throughout the day. However, the study emphasized that the government should reinforce public transportation in rural areas. Airlines are not affected unless an unexpected change in the schedule is not reported in a timely manner. Energy saving and  economy According to the document, the study examined several aspects, particularly the impact of adhering to GMT during winter. These findings were supported by consultations with more than 20 concerned parties and 40 officials. The study also stipulated that the DST will contribute to saving more energy. The study claims that Morocco would achieve additional energy savings during the winter period estimated at 37.6 GWh, in addition to saving hydrocarbons with a financial profit of MAD 33.9 million during the same period.  The study also claimed that Morocco managed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of 11,444 tonnes. The study compared two phases: the period of 2012- 2017 when the government applied the clock change four times and the period of 2018-2018, when the government decided to keep DST year round. The government also claimed that the decision has a positive impact on Morocco’s economy, emphasizing that the GMT+1 in winter time helped to reduce the time difference with its key economic partners. Impacts on students Despite the outrage among parents, who strongly condemned the change after decision, the study finds no negative impacts due to the implementation of DST year-round. The study finds that there is a weak link between school performance and change in the hour, emphasizing that there has been improvement in grades instead of weak education performance speculated by some news outlets after the adoption of the change. The comparison did not show any difference of absenteeism among students after the change, adding that absenteeism increased during the first weeks after the decision as some students accompanied their parents to protests against the change. Teachers and headmasters consulted, according to the study, said that absenteeism or delays are linked to the distance between the schools and students residence location and public transportation . Additionally, the study suggested the importance of transport services, lighting systems and the need to increase communication between citizens and public administration to avoid pressure and crisis in the education sector. On October 26, 2018 the government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in the country year round. The decision angered many Moroccan people who condemned the decision.  The government released the study after several months of promises to disclose the findings. Previously, Morocco switched the clock every summer to DST, GMT+1, and returned to the old standard time, GMT, for a period when Ramadan fell in the summer. After the adoption of Decree 2.18.855, Moroccans reset their clocks now only twice before and after Ramadan.

Rabat – El Salvador has decided to withdraw its recognition of the pseudo “SADR”, and support the territorial integrity of Morocco, announced Saturday the Salvadoran government. The announcement was made during the official of Morocco’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, to El Salvador. “The Government of El Salvador informs the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco of its decision to withdraw its recognition of” SADR “and to break all contact with this entity.” The Salvadoran Government made the announcement in a joint statement signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and international cooperation, Nasser Bourita and his Salvadoran counterpart Alexandra Hill Tinoco, in the presence of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. “This decision will be notified to the United Nations and the relevant regional organizations,” said the joint statement. Similarly, “the Government of El Salvador supports the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and its national sovereignty, as well as its initiative of autonomy as the only solution to this regional dispute”, concludes the joint communiqué. The decision comes less than two weeks after El Salvador President said he was country was in the process of reconsidering its ties to the Polisario and its recognition of the so-called Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic. El Salvador’s decision is a new setback for the Polisario whose leadership has long lobbied latin and central American countries to support its claims to establish an independent state in southern Morocco. El Salvador’s President, who is very active on social media, posted a Tweet about the decision, saying it’s the right decision for his country to stop recognizing a country that does exist. “From this day, El Salvador breaks diplomatic relations with the Polisario Front and no longer recognizes the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic,” he said. A partir de este día, El Salvador rompe relaciones diplomáticas con el Frente Polisario y ya no reconoce a la República Árabe Saharaui Democrática. — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) June 15, 2019  Es la decisión correcta para el Salvador. Dejamos de reconocer a un país que no existe, estrechamos nuestros lazos con el Reino de Marruecos y abrimos las puertas del mundo árabe. — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) June 15, 2019  “It is the right decision for el Salvador. We stop recognizing a country that does not exist, we strengthen our ties with the Kingdom of Morocco and we open the doors of the Arab world,” he added.

Rabat – The organizer of the Diamond League 800 m has now invited Caster Semenya, an intersex South African Olympic champion, to race on Sunday in Rabat. Before inviting her, Morocco previously banned Semenya from running.  Semenya said on Thursday that Morocco denied her request to run in Morocco. The Royal Moroccan Athletics Federation banned her, without providing a reason.  The sport’s governing body, The Swedish International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), restricts testosterone levels in female athletes like Semenya. However, The Swiss Federal Supreme Court lifted the IAAF’s regulations in order to allow Semenya to run until June 25.  Regardless, The Diamond League independently organized, meaning those in charge of the event are also in charge of the runners they invite. Friday, the organizer of the Diamond League race, Alain Blondel, posted a statement on the event’s site saying: “After checking the situation of Caster Semenya in the light of the decisions of the Swiss Federal Court, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the head of the international athletics meeting in Rabat, Alain Blondel, is happy to confirm the invitation.” “She received an invitation but is unable to organize her schedule to come to Rabat,” Blondel then said. Her agent Jukka Harkonen said that the lateness of the invitation made it impossible for Semenya to travel to Rabat in time for the race because it was a journey of more than 20 hours from her home country South Africa. “She’s not running,” he said. “She was invited today but that was too late.”

Rabat – News of Bombardier’s imminent withdrawal from Morocco’s aerospace sector sparked wild speculations about the devastating impacts of the move for Morocco’s aerospace industry. In recent comments to aviation website Ain Online, however, multiple sources indicated that the Canadian giant is committed to finding a safe replacement before it completely departs. “Although a sale to a third party appears inevitable, the intention seems to be that Morocco and Belfast will remain key link” in the company’s supply chain, the newspaper reported. A Casablanca-based bombardier spokesperson reaffirmed the continued relevance of the Casablanca plant to the company’s long-term plans. She said that the Morocco-based Bombardier site will remain an essential part of the aviation giant’s prospective ventures. “The Morocco site plays, and will continue to play, an important role in Bombardier’s supply chain. It is a world-class aero structures facility with an extremely competitive cost,” she said. “We will maintain and grow our strategic presence in Morocco to enhance our position and develop the Moroccan aerospace ecosystem.” Months after news emerge of the company’s expected departure, the Casablanca site is still open and functioning as before, according to the spokesperson. Ain Online noted that current operations include work on “wing components for Bombardier’s CRJ regional aircraft, such as flaps, slats, ailerons, and winglets, as well as the complete engine nacelle; fuselage sections for the Learjet 70/75, floors for CRJs and Globals, Challenger 650 emergency doors and some subassemblies for different programs, in addition to the MRO activities.” More still, the Bombardier spokesperson reiterated the multinational’s commitment to the Belfast and Casablanca sites because, she explained, they have been greatly beneficial for the company. She promised that even after it leaves the sites, Bombardier will put its large pool of third contacts to good use to secure a less devastating aftermath for employees and the Moroccan aerospace ecosystem as a whole. The plan is to avoid complete extinction after the company departs. “Following the announcement of Bombardier to divest its aerostructures activity in Belfast and Morocco, I continue to be confident in the future of the site in Casablanca,” said Stephen Orr, a senior manager on the company’s Moroccan site. The spokesperson agreed. She said, “With Bombardier and third-party customer’s contracts, we are sure that both sites have a long and bright future.” According to Orr, the upbeat comments have a lot to do with the impressive-looking prospects of the Moroccan aviation ecosystem. Ali Seddiki, the chief of the aerospace department at the Moroccan Ministry of Industry, Investment, Trade, and Digital Economy, echoed the same faith in the promising prospects of Morocco’s aerospatial ecosystem. “Morocco…is ranked number five among the most attractive countries for suppliers [worldwide] and number one in Africa,” he explained. Another factor of the sustained optimism for the immediate aftermath of Bombardier’s withdrawal from Morocco is the perceived profound coloration mechanism between Boeing, a well-established global aviation giant, and Morocco’s national carrier, Royal air Maroc (RAM). While it is still unclear whether Boeing is indeed one of the potential buyers of the concerned plant once Bombardier complete retreats, there appears to be a robust consensus in circles close to the sensitive dossier that Bombardier’s departure will not be as devastating as initially thought at the announcement of the news nearly two months ago. Caroline Tourrier, Boeing’s communications chief for France and North Africa, revealed the American giant has been engaged in talks with Morocco to deepen its presence in the country’s ecosystem. “We are also engaged in other activities to share information about Morocco’s aerospace industry and its talented workforce, as well as government investments and incentives for Boeing suppliers to consider operations in Morocco,” Tourrier said. These latest clarifications buttress the position of the Moroccan government, which, amid wild speculations of disastrous impacts after Bombardier announced its planned departure, steadily maintained that the news coverage of the dossier was disproportionally alarming. In a series of declarations after Bombardier’s initial announcement, the Moroccan government reassured the Canadian company’s Moroccan site’s employees, arguing that it is “not completely leaving.” Saad Eddine El Othmani, the Morocco’s Head of Government, later said that Bombardier agreed with Moroccan authorities that it would only depart after it has ensured a safe and much less devastating aftermath.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced that Minister Nasser Bourita’s visit to Latin America was part of a larger, intricate scheme to get more involved in the region and gather momentum for its Western Sahara position. Latest news suggests an overwhelming sense of mission accomplished for government department.  Brazil, a Latin American power-house and one of the four countries that Bourita visited in his recent tour in the region, has just given Rabat a much-needed morale boost by affirming its support for the North African country’s “territorial integrity” on the Western Sahara question. Speaking on Thursday during a joint press conference with his Moroccan counterpart, Brazil’s foreign affairs minister, Ernesto Araujo, said that his country is poised to throw its weight behind Morocco’s efforts towards a “realistic” settlement in the decades-long territorial dispute.  Avoiding the usual enthusiastic and overt proclamation of support in such instances, Araujo was diplomatic in his remarks—a reminder of the thorny issue that the Western Sahara question has become in diplomatic circles.  Even when you support one side, diplomatic decency seems to impose deference to the UN-led process which prides itself on its objective and neutral search for a common ground.  But standing out from Araujo’s diplomatic and measured declaration of support is the blunt reference to “Morocco’s efforts” towards lasting and politically negotiated solution. To Rabat’s ears, this was bound to sound like a thinly veiled recognition of the widely recognized “seriousness” and political feasibility of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan over the Polisario’s ideological and impractical rhetoric. At least that was the implied meaning here, and such an interpretation was correct in many regards. As a strong Moroccan partner, the Brazilian minister said, Brazil wants to contribute to the UN-led process to carve out spaces of understanding and genuine dialogue to reach a roundly agreed-upon solution that “goes beyond mere rhetoric.” In a singularly Morocco-friendly instance during his press conference, Araujo said, “On the issue of Western Sahara, a vital issue for Morocco, Brazil supports Morocco’s efforts to reach a realistic solution to this issue, which has lasted for decades.” But while in Brazil Morocco was served a music that was much to its liking—Rabat has been adamant that its approach is pragmatic and realistic while the Polisario’s is ideological and soaked in unnecessary hostility—much closer to home, in Abuja, an emerging Moroccan partner added a sour note to what could have been an immensely satisfying week for Bourita and the Moroccan diplomacy. The African front still needs engaging Also on Thursday, while speaking on the sidelines of an event Morocco had notably attended, Nigeria’s President Buhari, said to be on very friendly terms with Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, said his country was “historically committed to liberation movements” in Africa. Like Araujo, however, President Buhari saw no need to engage in profuse declamation of support for the “Sahrawi cause.”  The simple mention of “liberation movements” was enough for pro-Polisario outlets to put the Nigerian president’s remarks in much more strident and hostile terms. “Why Nigeria Is Committed to Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic’s Independence,” Sahara Reporters headlined a report on Buhari’s remarks.  The editorial-like headlined piece provided no answer to its originally intended question. Instead, the short report only limited itself to drawing attention to what seemed to matter more: Nigeria, an African giant thought to be indispensable  for Morocco’s continental ambitions, had just given the North African country the cold shoulder, even though rather mildly, on the Western Sahara question.  Undoubtedly, the charm and allure of Morocco’s “royal diplomacy,” has come from the remarkable visibility and influence Rabat has secured in African circles in a ridiculously short span. Since the African Union (AU) welcomed Morocco in January 2017, what has followed has been a cascade of Morocco-friendly moves making it sound—and rightly so—to Moroccan diplomats that the continental momentum is irretrievably shifting towards Rabat.  The AU, an organization which still recognizes SADR, and until recently seemed intent on pushing for a Western Sahara agenda other than the UN’s, has decided to retreat from the Western Sahara dossier and unconditionally support the UN process. In Rabat, the move was greeted with exuberance. It felt like the highest point, the most resounding affirmation of the bumper harvest of Morocco’s return to Africa’s most consequential organization. “It appears today that consensus is building up at the international level about the fact that ideological options of the past, things like referendum and independence, are totally unrealistic,” Brahim Fassi Firhi, the founder of Amadeus Institute, one of the leading Moroccan think tanks, told MWN in a recent interview on the continuously cloudy but largely encouraging horizons for Morocco’s Western Sahara claims.  When you look at what has been unfolding in African and global discussions around the Western Sahara question in the past months, Fihri elaborated, there is no mistaking that the momentum is Rabat’s. He singularly stressed the significance of Morocco’s presence in the AU, dismissing critics who continue to question Morocco’s “historical Africanness” to challenge the sincerity of its increasingly African gaze.  Fihri’s measured optimism, the belief that Morocco is so far winning the public relations battle on Western Sahara but there is still so much left on the plate, is perhaps the most determining signature of the Bourita-led diplomacy. When the Moroccan foreign affairs ministry announced Bourita’s Latin American tour earlier this week, it noted the country’s eagerness to convince reticent interlocutors while keeping momentum alive in places that have already signaled a shift towards Rabat.  Transplanted in the context of President Bouhari’s nod to SADR, the perceptible optimism of Moroccan diplomats invites the question: What now? More plainly, will such positions affect the improvement that the complicated Rabat-Abuja ties have registered in recent months? The question has already been answered at the various Africa-saturated symposiums and political fora Morocco has organized since it joined the AU: continue to preach the merits and “authenticity” of Morocco’s “African roots” and engage in a relentless diplomatic race to prove Rabat’s “historical legitimacy” over the disputed territory. This means that even as the momentum seems to favor its claims, Rabat plans to take nothing for granted. In March of last year, after an important Malian delegation visited Rabat to sign an array of bilateral agreements, I pointed out to a former Moroccan ambassador to Geneva that the Moroccan media was being misleadingly and—quite naively—celebratory about the possible political implications of the much-reported Morocco-Nigeria pipeline project.  As Nigeria has been a known Polisario supporter, even if less avowedly so than South Africa, I asked the ambassador, is it not wildly exaggerating to expect so much in so little time from Abuja, especially on a question as intricate as the Sahara conflict? The ambassador, who was talking at an event on the “Future of Morocco-Africa” at the Rabat School of Governance and Economy (EGE), agreed with my reservations. But, perhaps more crucially in the current context, he argued that Morocco knows how to be patient to get the results it hankers after. If it is going to take decades to convince Nigeria and other African partners, he said, Morocco will be glad to oblige.  At a November 2018 event his think tank organized in Tangiers, Firhi gave a strikingly similar answer when asked about what Rabat plans to do about Abuja’s reticence to Morocco’s ECOWAS bid. “We are not in a rush,” he remarked. Taking nothing for granted Back to the contradictory messages from two regional giants on which Rabat is visibly counting to give more weight to its now applauded South-South-driven foreign policy moves, what such convictions from front-bench Moroccan actors elicit is a certain belief in the virtue of diplomatic patience—and measured recklessness. An effective diplomacy, the suggestion seems to be, lies in yielding encouraging results in less encouraging, sometimes overtly hostile, environments.  In addition to taking nothing for granted, this requires adjusting until the other party is convinced. The point is that outcome-defining diplomatic victories only come with long-term-oriented acceptance that change takes time and energy. And also that some instances of reticence (like President Buhari’s principled—but gentle—commitment to Nigeria’s default Western Sahara stance) should invite more sustained engagement. Sometimes, Moroccan diplomats appear to argue, reticence complicates more than it reveals. President Buhari’s comments can be interpreted as an emphatic dismissal of hopes that his reputably strong ties with King Mohammed VI are could be reasons to renounce a position he himself engineered. (Nigeria first recognized SADR in 1984 with Buhari as the chief of the country’s then ruling military junta). But the statement can also be taken to be a far-from-muscular acknowledgement that changing a decades-long diplomatic identity will not happen in five years.  Whichever the correct interpretation, underpinning the current Moroccan diplomacy is the faith that effectiveness comes with a vigorous demand for looking at the larger picture, rather than focusing on the fever of the moment which leads to inescapable disagreements with partners on some principles.  By all accounts, versatility has emerged as the distinctive article of faith for Moroccan diplomats. So whatever happens next, expect Morocco to play hard when it can and softly when it should. For a country hungry for international support for its territorial integrity, all roads lead to Rome.

Rabat – French company Alstom announced, on June 13, the delivery of additional tram-trains to the Sale-Rabat stations. Alstom stated on its official website that 2 tram-trains out of the 22 have been delivered.  In May 2008, Alstom signed a €90 million contract with the Tramway Company of Rabat-Sale (STRS) to supply 22 tram trains. By May 2011 Alstom had delivered all the 44 Citadis trams which are now operating in Rabat-Sale stations. The additional trains will support the increased usage of the Tram-trains in Rabat and Sale.  “Citadis trams for the Rabat-Salé lines combine flexibility, reliability, comfort and respect for the environment. 32 meters long, they will be able to carry up to 606 passenger,” said Alstom, the creators of the Citadis tram. The 22 new trams will be stationed at Hay Karima maintenance centre in Sale. Earlier this year the CEO of STRS, Said Zarrou, told L’Economiste that a Tramway network extension at a cost of MAD 4.5 billion linking Rabat to Temara and Sale Al Jadida is on track. 
 STRS stated that “the extension of this line will extend over a linear 2.4 km including 4 stations and will provide service to the district of Yacoub El Mansour.  The extension will link the current station of Moulay Youssef Hospital (Akkari) and Alkifah Avenue, via Essalam Avenue.” According to STRS “this extension will allow the daily transport of 40,000 additional passengers, which will bring the number of passengers transported in the network to 150,000 per day.” The Rabat-Sale tramway began operating on May 23, 2011. The network covers 19.5 kilometers with 31 stops, and has a seating capacity of around 110,000 passengers daily.

Rabat – Moroccan club Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) announced on Thursday, June 13, that it will take the case of the arbitrary refereeing mistakes- which occurred during the second leg of the final of Africa’s Champions League, resulting in a win for Tunisian rival Esperance de Tunis (EST)- to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. WAC’s protest over the absence of a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) and the poor referee performances is supported by the Champions League regulations.  On Friday, May 31, Gambian referee, Gassama Bakary, refused a legitimate goal for Wydad Casablanca, angering Moroccan football fans and observers, who argued that the decision of the referee was unjust. When Wydad players put pressure on the refereeing staff to use the VAR, the referees said that the video footage was unavailable due to technical issues. The players subsequently refused to resume the game until the VAR issue has been fixed. WAC players were given no concrete reason why the VAR was not functional in such an important game. Paragraph 15 of Article 2 of the CAF regulations stipulates that “If it is established that the absence of the designated referees was the fault of the host association, the host team shall be declared the loser by 2 to zero and shall be eliminated from the competition, regardless of the result obtained on the field.” The Moroccan club, that was playing at the Tunisian team’s home ground at Rades, may be declared winner as stipulated by the CAF regulations. The regulations state that “if the referee is forced to stop the match before the end of the regular time because of pitch invasion or aggression against the visiting team, the host team shall be considered the loser and shall be eliminated from the competition.”  Despite CAF regulations being in favor of the Moroccan team, CAF decided instead to re-play the game causing backlash from both EST and WAC supporters.  CAF president, Ahmad Ahmad, has said that the president of EST threatened him during the game. Naciri went on to add that the CAF officials attempted to convince him to resume play in exchange for granting them next year’s title.    “All of them, without exception, were asking us to continue the game and next year’s title would be yours,” revealed Naciri in an interview with Medi1TV.  Naciri will now seek justice for his club by requesting to be declared winners without re-playing the 2nd leg of the African Champions League final in South Africa.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Athletics Federation (FRMA) has banned South African Olympic champion and intersex athlete, Caster Semenya from running the 800 meters in Morocco.  She was denied entry into the Diamond League competition, despite Switzerland’s highest court finding the athlete fit to run. The FRMA, giving no reasons, denied her request to race in Rabat this weekend. The Swedish International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) regulations state that XY chromosome athletes with differences in sexual development can only compete in women’s events at distances from 400m to 1500m if they take medication to reduce their natural testosterone levels. The IAAF argues that testosterone’s muscle-building capacity and ability to help athletes carry more oxygen in their blood gives Semenya, and others like her, an unfair athletic advantage over other women. The Swiss Supreme Court (SFT) temporarily lifted the regulations affecting Semenya until June 25. The SFT has the power to further extend the exemption. However, the IAAF said, “It should be noted that the Diamond League meetings are not organized by the IAAF. Entry for any athlete into a Diamond League meeting is by invitation only from the meeting organizer.” “The IAAF continues to comply with the Swiss Federal Tribunal’s order dated 31 May to suspend the [differences in sexual development] regulations in as far as they apply to the appellant,” according to the IAAF. After being blocked entry to run in Rabat, where the South African won at the meet in 2018, a statement from Semenya’s legal team read: “Caster expresses grave frustration that she has been prevented from competing in the 800m in Rabat, in an apparent violation of the Swiss Supreme Court’s order.” “She was notified on June 11 that the president of the Moroccan Athletics Federation has denied her participation. Caster is currently seeking clarity on the specific reasons for that decision, and she urges the IAAF to ensure its member federations comply with the law and the Supreme Court’s orders of May 31 and June 12,” the lawyers added. Semenya, twice Olympic 800 meters champion, considered boycotting the event in solidarity with other athletes who may be affected by the regulations but said she had decided that running was the best form of protest. Speaking with the BBC, Semenya said, “No woman should be subjected to these rules. I thought hard about not running the 800m in solidarity unless all women can run free. But I will run now to show the IAAF that they cannot drug us.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Independence Party (Al Istiqlal) has issued a statement to warn against “the serious” ramifications of the US Middle Peace Plan also known as the ‘Deal of the Century’. The ‘Deal of the Century’ is a proposal from the US administration to broker regional peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Party’s executive committee described the peace plan as another Sykes-Picot agreement, which will cause more division and strife across the Arab world. Also called Asia Minor, the Sykes-Picot Agreement was a secret convention made during World War I between France and the UK with agreement from the Russian Empire and Italy. The agreement sought to divide Arab lands under the Ottoman empire and allocate them as ‘spheres of influence’ to France and Great Britain. The Executive Committee reiterates its “absolute rejection of any attempt to impose a new reality on land that supports Israeli settlement expansion on the coast of Palestinian sovereignty over its territory.” The statement urged that the Palestinian people should enjoy their “full rights and the right to establish their own independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.” Al Istiqlal Party has for long showed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, in line with Morocco’s full solidarity with the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights to establish anindependent state. King Mohammed VI has long been vocal in his support for the Palestinian cause.  In December 2017, the King  addressed a letter to US President Donald Trump and the United Nations in the wake of President Trump’s removal of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.. In his message to Trump, the King wrote, ““The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all.” He added that “The city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism.” Morocco also emphasized its staunch support for the Palestinian cause during Pope Francis’ visit last March. During the visit, the Pope and King Mohammed VI signed the “Al-Quds call” to protest the multicultural character of Jerusalem, a move that received appreciation from several states, including Palestine. Following the US embassy move to Jerusalem, Palestine no longer accepts US as a mediator. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbass said  on December 30, 2017 that “Jerusalem is and will forever be the capital of the Palestinian state.” “We do not accept any role of the United States in the political process from now on, because it is completely biased towards Israel,” he said.

Rabat – June 14 – Brenton Tarrant, the Australian extremist charged with the murder of 51 Muslims in March in Christchurch, New Zealand, has pleaded “not guilty”. The trial will begin in May 2020, announced the judge. The defendant appeared in an audio-visual transmission from the Auckland High Security Prison aired in the court of Christchurch. Tarrant’s lawyer, Shane Tait, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. On screen, Tarrant showed little to no emotion except for a smirk when his lawyer entered the not guilty plea.  The decision to plead not guilty triggered a wave of anger among the victim’s families attending the hearing. Outside the court, Yama Nabi, whose father was killed in the shootings, expressed how the prospect of a trial was “hurtful for the families”. Janna Ezat, who lost her son at the Al Noor mosque, cried after learning that the trial would proceed, saying “I’m so frustrated”. Brenton Tarrant, who identifies as a white supremacist, is charged with 51 murders, 40 attempted murders and one act of terrorism. On March 15, the 28-year-old Australian opened fire  two mosques in Christchurch during Friday prayers. He live streamed the attack on Facebook. Judge Cameron Mander released a statement shortly after the hearing. The judge confirmed that psychiatric assessments conducted during Tarrant’s detention had established that he was mentally fit to stand trial. The judge set the opening of the trial to May 4, 2020. The defendant’s attorney Shane Tait said the trial should last about six weeks. A further hearing is scheduled for August 15th.

Rabat – Two Moroccan workers died in Seine-Saint-Denis, France, on Saturday, June 8 after falling from an unhooked construction scaffold, reported the French newspaper LeParisien. Despite efforts to revive them, the two men could not be resuscitated. A tenant told LeParisien ”There was a deafening noise around 9:30 am. I saw a cloud of smoke,… and when I went out, I saw a man on the ground, his eyes were open. The other gentleman was a little further.” The two Moroccan construction workers were undocumented according to an early investigation. Both men were identified and contact was established between the consulates of Morocco and France to reach the families of the two victims. The height of the fall has yet to be determined, but it is speculated that the victims could have fallen as far as 18 stories. The owner of the building decided to suspend the worksite until all the scaffolds were inspected, according to a report by France Bleu. In a Facebook post published by the French recruiting agency, Plaine Commune Habitat, the Mayor of Epinay-Sur-Seine, Herve Chevreau, and the president of the agency, Laurent Russier, expressed their condolences following the accident. “Our thoughts are with the families of the victims.”

Rabat – The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that the Mediterranean fruit fly, sometimes referred to as the “medfly,” is threatening Morocco’s economy. The Mediterranean fruit fly is a pest species that threatens the growth and success of the citrus fruit industry, which plays a significant role in Morocco’s economy. The production of citrus fruit employs over 13,000 farmers and produces exports of $300 million per year. Miklos Gaspar, writing the new report for the IAEA, elaborates on the harm that the animal has caused to Morocco’s economy: “As medflies have made their home in Morocco’s citrus orchards and farms, the volume of the country’s citrus exports has been reduced due to direct damage to fruit and to increased production costs associated with the use of insecticides and post-harvest treatments, necessary for fruit exports.” Gaspar writes that farmers have seen indirect losses because importing countries have imposed quarantine restrictions. Additionally, farmers have faced environmental costs from using traditional, broad-spectrum insecticides. However, the European Union, which has been the main traditional export market for Moroccan citrus fruits, has increasingly lowered the acceptable levels of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables, because of food safety concerns. The IAEA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have helped Morocco plan an eco-friendly strategy for combating the fruit fly. The IAEA, in cooperation with the FAO, has helped Morocco conduct a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach. Gaspar writes that this effort is a “first victory in the ongoing campaign to suppress medflies.” “Moroccan counterparts have, under an IAEA technical project, received the training and equipment necessary to detect and respond to any incursion by other pests, which is a prerequisite for the sustained suppression of the  using the sterile insect technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly nuclear technique that can lead to the suppression or elimination of insect pests,” he explained. The sterile insect technique means mass producing and sterilizing insects for continuous aerial release over infested areas. The government is building a facility for producing, sterilizing, and then releasing male medflies. The IAEA and the FAO are supporting the construction of the facility, which will be near Agadir, in the heart of Morocco’s citrus-producing region. The organizations will also assist through the training, expert visits, and providing equipment. “Some of these species are as hard to control as the Mediterranean Fruit Fly, so giving them a chance to establish themselves and then an advantage by suppressing the medfly would be counterproductive,” explained Walther Enkerlin, an expert at the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. Enkerlin said that in order for the SIT approach to be successful, the facility must meet a weekly production of 100 million sterile medflies per week, which will cover the 180 000 hectares in the Souss Valley where most commercial and wild citrus are found. According to Gaspar, an SIT intervention across such a broad area requires a sequential approach, so they have divided the total area into SIT blocks. “Sterile flies’ rearing and release are expected to start in early 2020 and pest suppression will be gradually implemented, advancing from one block to the next, until effective pest suppression is achieved,” He writes. However, without a system for repelling other pests, SIT usage would still leave room for another pest to replace the medfly and “devastate” Morocco’s citrus orchards. Controlling medflies alone is not enough to help save Morocco’s fruit industry from damage and insecticides. Gaspar points out that invasive fruit fly species from neighboring countries could still undermine whatever success that sterilizing the medfly may bring. Other species include both the peach fruit fly and the oriental fruit fly. To mitigate this risk, Morocco and the IAEA have made a national surveillance network for the early detection of new fruit fly species. The National Office for Food Safety has built an emergency response in the event of a new pest incursion. The surveillance network covers eight sites, classified as high-risk points-of-entry, along the country’s borders, with 94 traps. Traps are also in 19 other risk sites, including fruit markets, tourist sites and some orchards close to risky areas. Read also: Black Crickets Invade Mecca’s Grand Mosque

Rabat – The apartment, located on one of the most prestigious streets in the French capital, boasts elite residents including members of the Onassis and Rothschild families. Princess Hassa bint Salman had hired the victim to refurbish her apartment. While in the apartment, he took a photo of the room he was renovating. Bint Salman, said to be in her 40s, allegedly became irate and accused the worker of intending to sell the picture to the media.  According to Sky News, bint Salman ordered her bodyguard to attack the worker and shouted: “Kill him, the dog, he doesn’t deserve to live.” The victim was punched in the face, tied up by the bodyguard, and held in the apartment for hours. He also claimed the Princess forced him to kiss her feet. The pair eventually let the worker go but confiscated his tools. AFP reported that the beating was so severe that the victim was out of work for eight days. On October 1, 2016, French authorities charged bint Salman’s bodyguard with armed violence, theft, issuing death threats, and holding someone against their will. The powerful Salman royal family is no stranger to legal controversy. Bint Salman’s brother Mohammed bin Salman has faced ongoing controversy after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Once considered a symbol of modernization in Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince was accused of ordering Khashoggi’s killing in retaliation for his criticism of the Saudi Regime. While the court case will begin in a few weeks, bint Salman will likely be tried in absentia. An international warrant was issued for her arrest in 2017, but the Princess has not been apprehended.

Rabat – Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt joined the latest push for military de-escalation on Wednesday June 12, issuing a joint statement calling for an “unconditional ceasefire” for the neighboring country of Libya. After a meeting in Tunis, foreign affairs ministers of Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt expressed “deep concern” over the situation. The ministers issued a statement that denounced “the continuous flow of weapons” into Libya and rejected a military solution to the conflict. The three countries instead pushed for a political settlement to Libya’s continuing unrest. In 2011, Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed in the NATO-backed Libyan Civil War. The power vacuum left the country in a growing state of instability, with multiple militias fighting for control of the oil-rich country.  The ongoing conflict between factions turned Libya into a war-zone between rival forces. In 2015, the UN supported the establishment of the Government of National Accord (GNA). The internationally-recognized government is based in the Western half of the country and headquartered in Tripoli. The GNA’s primary opposition is the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by General Khalifa Haftar. The GNA established its own parallel government in the east, based in the city of Al Bayda.  The battle marks the third time Libya has gone to war since the fall of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The latest fighting began when General Haftar launched an attack on the GNA in Tripoli on April 4. Both the LNA and the defending GNA received weapons from their respective allies, which violated the UN’s arms embargo. This included neighboring Egypt, who supported the LNA. The battle for Tripoli devastated the capital, home to over a million residents. According to the World Health Organization, at least 653 people have been killed since the fighting escalated in April. Thousands have been injured, and over 50 thousand displaced from their homes.  Despite the loss, General Haftar and the LNA rejected plans for a ceasefire. He claimed militias have infiltrated the GNA and vowed to continue fighting until they are defeated. While the violence in Tripoli continues, Foreign Ministers Sameh Shoukry of Egypt, Khemaies Jhinaoui of Tunisia, and Ramtane Lamamra of Algeria pushed for a diplomatic solution.  At their meeting on Wednesday, the seventh in an ongoing tripartite initiative, the ministers renewed their “categorical rejection of any outside interference in Libya’s internal affairs” and called for continued cooperation between the three countries. The meeting was held a few days after United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for all countries to enforce a total arms embargo to Libya.  The UN first imposed a ban on arms sales to Libya after the fall of Gaddafi in 2011. Following Guterres’s call on Monday, the UN unanimously approved to extend the embargo through June of 2020.  The next gathering of the tripartite council will take place in Algeria, the date yet to be determined.

Rabat – The Mohammed VI Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, chaired by Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Hasna, has awarded the “Blue Flag” label to 21 beaches and marinas this summer. The Blue Flag seal of approval is given to beaches and marinas that meet and maintain the organization’s stringent criteria for bathing water quality, information, awareness and environmental education, health and safety, and finally planning and management. Created in 1985 by the International Foundation for Education at the Environment, the Blue Flag label has been given to 3,687 beaches in 49 countries in Europe, Africa, and America in collaboration with municipalities in charge of beach management. With 21 beaches on the list this year, Morocco ranks first among Arab countries and second among Africa countries. Out of the 40 Moroccan beaches and marinas that applied for the label this year, 21 received the prestigious certification after a selection process by the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, chaired by Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Hasna. In Morocco, the Blue Flag initiative was introduced in 2002 as part of the foundation’s Clean Beaches program. “Municipal officials are trained in beach management and environmental management and awareness tools are available to enable them to welcome summer visitors in the best conditions,” a statement from the Foundation said. “We evaluate candidates for the Blue Flag and organize unannounced inspections during the summer.” The municipalities are supported by economic partners mobilized by the Foundation as part of the Clean Beaches program, which provides them with managerial skills as well as financial support, the Foundation continued.

Rabat – Police in Marrakech arrested a 48-year old Dutch man for falsifying and selling foreign passports. The Police were working in collaboration with Morocco’s Directorate General of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The arrest took place on Wednesday June 12. Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) seized multiple digital and computer equipment belonging to the suspect, as well as printing and lamination machines used to falsify passports. The suspect is in custody awaiting further investigations led by the Public Prosecutor. Earlier this year, Morocco’s National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ) dismantled a network of 5 suspects accused of selling fake documents. The leaders of the network were Moroccan nationals. Two of the suspects are subjects of Interpol red notices and have been found to have similar networks in other countries, according to a statement by DGSN. Investigations have concluded that the network were active in selling false Moroccan IDs to non-Moroccan Jews.

Rabat – Women who have run away from their lives in Saudi Arabia anonymously shared that the government had attempted to use their cell phone’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) to track them down and bring them back to the Kingdom. Two women told Business Insider that Saudi government officials asked their families for their cell phone packaging, claiming they needed it to find them.   A third woman, who has since been brought back to Saudi Arabia, said her lawyer informed her that her IMEI code was used to track her down. An IMEI is a 15-digit ID number unique to each cellphone and is separate from a SIM number – changing one’s IMEI code means replacing the entire device, not just the SIM card. Every time a cell phone connects to a tower, it shares its identification information, including the IMEI code. With this information, it is possible to track an individual to within feet of their location. Using the code to track individual’s locations is neither new nor complex technology – the number is often printed on a phone’s SIM tray and the outside of the original packaging – but is usually reserved for use only by the police, military, or national intelligence bodies. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman initially drew positive international response when he included advancing women’s rights as part of his formal plan – known as Saudi Vision 2030 – to modernize the nation. Since then, Saudi women have gained the right to drive and men are no longer able to file for divorce without informing their wives. Women run away for different reasons, but the Saudi guardian law that requires women to have permission from a man to do things like marry, work, or travel has been cited as a common motive according to Human Rights Watch. Runaway Saudi women are typically trying to secure asylum in another country so they are protected from being forcibly brought back to the Kingdom.   The trend has recently drawn greater attention following high profile runaways like 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed, who live-streamed her escape on social media in January before being granted asylum in Canada. In response to public attention to the trend, the Saudi government created a video that compared runaway women to jihadist terrorist operatives.

Rabat – The criminal court in Sale near Rabat has once again adjourned the trial of the suspects of the Imlil terrorist incident. After a hearing today, the Sale criminal court ruled to adjourn the trial to June 20. The official statement did dwell on the reason for the ruling, but it is understood that the court decided it needed more time to evaluate the evidence it has so far received in the case. On the trial are 24 suspects whom the Moroccan police arrested in the aftermath of the tragic killing of two Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal in December 2018. The defendants, including notably a Swiss-Spanish binational, are facing charges of incitement of hatred, terrorism, and premeditated murder. The Imlil murders took Morocco by surprise in late December 2018. Police discovered the lifeless bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Uland on December 17, 2018 beheaded while camping near Imlil, one of Morocco’s most prized tourist destinations. The tragedy caused shock waves in Morocco, with many sympathizing with the pain of the two tourists’ loved ones while roundly condemning the horrific murders. Police arrested the suspects less than 48 hours after the murder.

Rabat – Habib El Malki, the speaker of the Moroccan House of Representatives, represented Morocco’s King Mohammed VI at the Democracy Day event in Nigeria on June 12. El Malki stressed the strong and brotherly ties between Nigeria and Morocco while speaking about Morocco’s improving standing on the democratic spectrum. During an official state dinner after the festivities, El Malki thanked his host, Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari, on behalf of King Mohammed VI. In his speech, the Moroccan house speaker hailed the recent rapprochement between the two African countries. He said that Morocco, which has shifted its focus to its home continent, is in a better position than ever to shoulder its “historic responsibility” in any collective continental endeavor in increasing Africa’s standing on the global stage. To an audience mainly comprised of other high-ranking dignitaries from across the continent, including presidents, heads of government, MPs, and representatives of civil society, El Malki reiterated Morocco’s commitment to the advancement of the pan-African ideals. He cited the ongoing gas pipeline project spearheaded by Nigeria and Morocco to supply much of West Africa with natural gas. On the democratic front, El Malki underscored the slew of economic and political reforms which Rabat has initiated in recent years. He pointed out that since adopting a more liberal constitution in 2011, Morocco has furthered its democratic consolidation by improving its good governance and human rights indicators. While recent studies have suggested that the project may be delayed due to the persistence of major political blockades, the prospect of a project of its standing has been largely interpreted as one of the strongest signals of Morocco’s full-throated return to its position as an important player in continental affairs. For his part, President Buhari expressed satisfaction with his country’s democratic trajectory. He acknowledged that the country’s democracy is not pristine, but remarked that considerable progress has been made in recent years. Nigeria’s Democracy Day, a national holiday held by the West African country since 2000 to mark its transition to democracy and civilian rule, was, until last year, celebrated on May 29, the day in 1999 when the country’s last military junta handed power to an elected civilian government. This year, President Buhari decided the holiday will henceforward be held on June 12 to commemorate the death of Moshood Abiola. Abiola ran for president in 1994 and won. However, the then ruling military junta barred him from taking office. He was later arrested and put in jail, where he died on June 12, 1998. He has since become an icon of Nigeria’ struggles for transitioning from military juntas to elected civilian governments. Outside of the event’s ostensibly democracy-focussed agenda, El Malki’s presence in Nigeria came as Morocco makes no secret of its newfound—and in many regards genuine—love for its home continent. In a conversation with an African Union diplomat in late April, El Malki said that commitment to Africa is part and parcel of Morocco’s identity in world affairs. He said Morocco takes pride in its African roots and is prepared to contribute to advancing pan-African interests and foster intra-African exchanges.

Rabat – The Higher Council for Education, Training and Scientific Research (CSEFRS) conducted a study showing that 19.8% of Moroccans aged between 6 and 22, nearly one in five, left school early. The ministry released the report which focussed on 3,000 Moroccan households in all regions of Morocco on June 12. The number of people who dropped out without obtaining a diploma or certification was 23.9% in rural areas compared to 13.1% in urban areas. In terms of gender, 20.2% of school-aged boys dropped out, compared to 19.3% of girls. The most-mentioned reason for school drop-out is exam failure and class repetition, at a rate of 33.8%, reports the CSEFRS. Low household income and poverty were second in the list (11.7%). Other reasons included remoteness of schools (10.2%), the child’s refusal to pursue their studies (9.8%), the lack of school transportation (7.9%), (8%), the futility of continuing education (4.3%), marriage (4%), the absence or lack of social support for schooling (3.1%) , the parent or guardian’s refusal to let the child pursue their studies (2,6%), the exclusion of the child from studies (2,6%) and other reasons (10,1%). The number of young people who have had no schooling is equally significant. It is, however, much higher among young people aged 18 to 22 (8.2%) compared to 12-14 year olds (0.8%) . The percentage among children aged 6 to 11, an age group where education is compulsory, is 4.5%.

Rabat – Morocco’s Royal Football Federation  (FRMF) has issued a statement  commenting on the decision of Abderrazak Hamdallah to leave the training camp where the Moroccan team was training in preparation for the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). The statement announced that the head coach of the Moroccan national football team, Herve Renard, has replaced Hamdallah with Abdelkarim Baadi. FRMF claimed that Renard made this decision as Hamdallah cannot participate in the CAN due to “back and hip injuries confirmed by medical tests.” The federation added that the player  will undergo a medical examination tomorrow, June 14. The statement comes as a surprise to Moroccan football fans and observers as the footballer appeared in good shape during the friendly game against Gambia yesterday, on June 12.   In the wake of the team’s loss to Gambia, speculation spread on social media suggesting that Hamdallah left the camp after issues he faced with some members of the  Moroccan squad. Several Moroccan football fans argue that the move was due to a friction between the footballer and his teammates. Facebook page Hassad Al Kora quoted close sources close to the Moroccan national team, saying that the footballer was not treated well  by the rest of the team. Several sports news outlets also said that the major cause of his exit was a rift with his teammate Faycal Fajr during Wednesday’s friendly match between Morocco and Gambia on Wednesday. During the game, Hamdallah was supposed to kick a penalty for the Atlas Lions in the second half. To the surprise of football fans, Fajr took the ball from Hamdallah’s hand and played the penalty instead. The Atlas Lions will take part in the 2019 CAN, which will kick off on June 21 in Egypt. Renard has already announced his lineup for the competition.

Rabat – The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has signed Tecnologias Plexus SL, a technology company, to design a new management system for visa appointments. Tecnologias Plexus SL will be responsible for managing online appointments in 129 offices located outside of Spain, as well as an office in Madrid. According to the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the contract is worth € 89,460. The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borell indicated in the contract, that “the [visa] services will be improved in order to preserve the image of Spain abroad.” According to Europa Press, Minister Borell has publicly acknowledged, during an appearance at the Senate, that “the Spanish consulates are saturated and they need more staff and resources.” During his last visit to Morocco, the focus was on the Casablanca consulate, where there are delays for visa appointments. Schengen visa applicants have been facing wait times of six months due to the Spanish computer systems being “overwhelmed.” Another goal for the ministry’s new system is to “eliminate any potential fraud, as well as uncontrolled access to consular services, avoiding any interference from third parties.” There is already an existing contract between the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and BLS for visa processing which covers 58 consular offices. However, the existing contract with BLS also includes appointment managing services for Schengen visa applications and will not be affected by the new contract signed with Tecnologias Plexus SL.

Rabat – Morocco’s revenues from the Algerian gas pipeline crossing the country’s soil to Spain dropped from MAD 790 million in May 2018 to MAD 532 million by the end of May 2019. The figures account for 35.3% of the total forecasted revenues from the pipeline, which is expected to reach MAD 1.5 billion, according to the Kingdom’s Treasury. Morocco’s total revenue from the pipeline was 1.53 billion dirhams in 2018, compared to MAD 1.01 billion in 2017, up by 52%. Last year’s revenues exceeded the government’s expectations, set by the financial law at MAD 1.21 billion. The Directorate of Customs and Indirect Taxes shows that the increase in last year’s revenue is due to an increase in both gas prices by 21.7% and the amount of natural gas transported through the pipeline by 19.5%. Morocco does not receive money for allowing the exportation of the Algerian gas pipeline to Spain, the figures are the conversion of Morocco’s share from the gas which is set at about 500 million cubic meters, while the national consumption is 1.1 billion cubic meters. Morocco’s share is directed to the Ain Beni Mathar and Tahaddart stations to produce electricity. The volume of natural gas delivered through the Maghreb-Europe pipeline reached 9.45 billion cubic meters last year, compared to 7.95 billion cubic meters in the previous year, an increase of 18.9%, according to the National Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Minerals. The delivery of the Morocco-Europe gas pipeline began in 1996, on a length of 1,300 kilometers coming from Hassi R’Mel, crossing 540 kilometers of Moroccan soil, before continuing its sea and land route to Cordoba, Spain. The pipeline ownership goes to Spain until the end of 2020, and will be transferred to Morocco in 2021, which is currently receiving transit fees from Spain. Algeria exports gas through three pipelines, the first linking it to Italy via Tunisia, the second to Spain via Morocco, and the third via the Mediterranean to Spain. In 2016, the revenue stood at MAD 1 billion, compared to MAD 1.8 billion a year before. In 2014, however, revenue reached an unprecedented MAD 2.4 billion compared to MAD 2.3 billion a year before.

Rabat – Representing Morocco, Achraf Hakimi is one of the athletes from Forbes 2019 list for the Middle East, which is a 30 under 30 ranking of Arabs who have “secured remarkable achievements on a global stage.” Hakimi is a 20-year-old footballer who plays for both the Moroccan National Team and Borussia Dortmund. Though he lives in Germany, he was born in Madrid to Moroccan parents. Hakimi joined Real Madrid’s youth setup in 2006, aged eight. In 2017, Hakimi was promoted to the main squad. A year later, German club Borussia Dortmund signed him on a two-year loan deal. Achraf made his full international debut for Morocco in 2016 and was selected CAF Youth Player of the Year in 2018. Forbes publishes the annual list to recognize the region’s youth, who “are advancing in fields as diverse as science, business, sports, arts, and culture—transforming the Middle East into a promising economic hub of the future. Forbes Middle East’s latest list has tried to capture the essence of this by ranking some of the young achievers.” The Middle East’s 30 under 30 were all under the age of 30 as of February 1, 2019, and are either in residence in an Arab country or have Arab heritage. So, for example, South Korean entrepreneur Shane (You Keun) Shin of Shorooq Investments made the list as he lives in the UAE, where he has helped to shape the venture capital landscape. Forbes elaborates, “We also have people of Arab origin who reside abroad like Lebanese national Marwan Aboudib, who is based in Massachusetts, US, but has whipped up a solid reputation in designing smart cities across the world.” The ranking this year includes individuals from 14 sectors, hailing from 15 countries: “From world champions to CEOs leading high-growth businesses, these 30-somethings have left an indelible mark in the economy. Their technological innovations have closed a market gap or have created a niche concept that has earned global acclaim.” “To formulate this list, we sent out questionnaires to a pool of achievers who nominated themselves,” Forbes details. After collecting the nominations, researchers calculated their impact on the world. The methodology behind the list factored in remarkable accomplishments: “Their level of achievement in their respective fields was measured through the number of accolades they have received for their achievements, their annual turnover and the investment they have received.” Factors include disruption, or “how they changed their traditional industry”, future prospects, and media coverage (traditional and social media). The Middle East is among the few regions in the world with a sizeable young population. “Governments are devising various strategies to utilize this youth bulge and transform them into a growth engine.” To realize that aim, nations are “investing heavily in upskilling the youth” while also encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. Forbes Africa’s 30 Under 30 for 2019 is now narrowing down nominations in order to compile its list. The publication is yet to produce its ranking of “resilient self-starters, innovators, entrepreneurs, and disruptors who have the acumen to stay the course in their chosen field.”

Rabat – Morocco will allegedly support Palestine’s  decision to boycott the US-sponsored economic conference, which will take place in Manama, Bahrain on June 25-26. Spokesperson of the Palestinian Government Ibrahim Melhem said that Morocco, Jordan and Egypt did not announce their intention toparticipate in the forum. Melhem’s remarks came after an anonymous senior US official announced that the three countries have confirmed their participation in the symposium. “In contrast to what was reported, the Palestinian government took note that the brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Kingdom of Morocco, and the Arab Republic of Egypt did not announce their acceptance to take part in the Bahrain conference.” He also highlightedPalestine’s friendly diplomatic relations with the three countries. Melhem then called on all “brotherly and friendly countries” to withdraw their participation in another statement on Facebook. He said that the participation “would carry wrong messages about the unity of the Arab position” to oppose Trump’s Middle East Plan. Both Morocco and Jordan have long held unwavering support for the Palestinian cause. Sponsored by the US, the conference will serve as an opportunity to encourage investment in Palestine.  “This workshop is a pivotal opportunity to convene government, civil society, and business leaders to share ideas, discuss strategies, and galvanize support for potential economic investments and initiatives that could be made possible by a peace agreement,” said the US and Bahrain in a joint statement on the conference. Rumors suggesting Morocco’s participation in the forum followed the visit of senior US  adviser Jared Kushner to Morocco on May 28, when he was received by King Mohammed VI. Kushner’s visit, according to the Moroccan government, sought to discuss the diplomatic relations between Rabat and Washington as well as recent developments in the Middle East.  Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, denied that Kushner unveiled the content of the US Middle East Plan also known as the Deal of the Century, which aims to broker  peace between Palestine and Israel. “Morocco does not know yet of the content of any peace plan and will express its position when it will be informed about the details of the initiative,” Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said last weekend. Several countries have already confirmed their participation in the conference, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar,  and the UAE.

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Abderrazak Hamdallah has allegedly left the training camp where Morocco’s Atlas Lions are currently preparing for the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). Moroccan journalist Ayoub El Basri from Radio Mars announced the news after talking to a source close to  the footballer, leaving doors open for rumors and speculation. Several local sports outlets suggested that the footballer left due to problems with the other players on the Atlas Lions team.  Al Mountakhab reported that the major reason is the behavior of  Moroccan footballer Faisal Fajr during the Morocco-Gambia friendly game. Hamdallah was supposed to kick the penalty for the Atlas Lions. In a surprising move, Fajr took the ball from Hamdallah’s hand and played the penalty instead. Fajr missed  the penalty which would have leveled the score. Hamdallah made the list of the 23 footballers selected to join Morocco’s CAN squad. Morocco’s Royal Football Federation and head coach of the national football team Herve Renard has not yet confirmed the news. The news comes after a friendly game played between Morocco and Gambia on Wednesday, June 12.  Gambia defeated the national team by 1-0. It remains to be seen whether the FRMF will deny or confirm the news. Hamdallah currently plays for the Saudi football club of Al Nassr. The club awarded him  the Golden Shoe Award and the title of the best scorer of the Saudi Football Championship during the 2018-2019 season for making history by topping the charts of Saudi Football as the top goal scorer ever recorded. In March, Renard and Hamdallah had a small rift after Hamdallah rejected Renard’s invitation to play with Morocco in March. The BBC reported that the footballer could not accept Renard’s invitation for personal reasons relating to his family. Renard has commented on Hamdallah’s decision, saying that he spoke to him on the phone. “He declined for reasons you know, I had 33 other players to manage, so I turned the page.” Hamdallah made his debut with the Atlas Lions in a friendly against Burkina Faso in February 2012.

Rabat – The Ministry of Education has announced the suspension of three professors for supporting medical students’ final exam boycott. The ministry has issued three statements to suspend professors in three different regions: Agadir, Casablanca, and Marrakech. The statement  of the suspension reads: “ due to your breach of professional commitment … you have been suspended from work with the suspension of your salaries.” The statement also announces that the ministry will send the suspended professors’ files to the disciplinary office to take the necessary measures against them. Ahmed Belhouss, one of the professors suspended, condemned the ministry’s decision.  Belhous says the decision violates his rights as a member of a labor union. The ministry’s decision comes after medical students boycotted the final exams earlier this week. The students also received support from  their parents, who encouraged their protests and condemned the ministry’s reluctance to meet the students’ demands. In a statement, the parents of the medical students in Casablanca said: “The government, and the ministries of health and education, bear  the responsibility for the lost year.” The statement also condemned the ministry’s approach to dealing with the protests. “We refuse the policy of imposing a fait accompli … and we condemn all pressures exerted on our children to take the June 10 exams,” added the statement. The National Commission for Medical Students  announced that the boycott of the exams was 100% successful. In response, Minister of Education Said Amzazi  said that his ministry had met the demands of the students. “The case file of medical students is composed of 16 points, we have responded favorably to 14 points through the draft agreement, and we are committed to executing them,” Amzazi said. He added:“The teachers came to monitor and the students did not come. They are under the influence of a group that threatens them, attacks them, harasses them! We believe that this is no longer a matter of pedagogy, but of politics.” The medical students have been protesting against the Ministries of Health and Education since March. The students are  demanding radical reforms to the medical industry and threatening to continue striking until their demands have been met.

Rabat – After years in a legal and financial quagmire and inability to find suitors, SAMIR, Morocco’s once-promising oil refinery and now bankrupt company, is reportedly attracting interest from buyers again. Exol Lubricants Morocco, a subsidiary of Britain’s Exol Lubricants Limited Holding, has put together a bid to acquire SAMIR, hoping to salvage the refinery from complete demise and make the promising gasoline source what it once was. The news, which was relayed earlier this week by Moroccan newspaper Medias 24, comes at a singularly heady time for the refinery. According to the newspaper, Exol’s offer, while a lifeline for the majority of Moroccans associated with the refinery—especially workers who have been protesting against the closure of the company—has not been well received by a number of front-bench shareholders. Exol, whose bid was assessed during a hearing at the Casablanca commercial court on June 11, Medias 24 reported, is offering $8.23 million to acquire the assets of the almost defunct SAMIR. Mohamed Saouabi, the British company’s Morocco representative, was present at the hearing to “confirm the company’s interest” in SAMIR, the newspaper noted. Prior to the court hearing, Saouabi had submitted its bidding to syndic Abdelkbir Safadi, who has been monitoring the bidding process for the liquidation of SAMIR’ assets. Exol presented its offer weeks after the syndic initiated a tender process. But the syndic’s decision to receive or reject any offer will only come after he has heard the opinions of all parties involved in the liquidation process, the newspaper recalled. It added, however, that of the parties with a say in the completion of the transaction, only the customs services have a favorable opinion of Exol’s bid. Other shareholders, including the Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP), are yet to assess the British offer. But it is understood that BCP does not view Exol’s bid favorably. Driss Laraqui, a BCP legal counselor, said the offer is “too low” and does not compare well with the usual international rate in such situations. The representative of SAMIR employees, who unlike BCP is in favor of a complete liquidation of assets, has however opposed Exol’s offer, arguing that the price the company is willing to pay is low and “below market standards” in the refinery industry. Also standing in Exol’s way is that some other contenders are believed to have offered a much higher price for the transaction.
That includes Glencore, a Swiss-British commodity and mining company, and Trafigura, a Geneva-based commodity trading giant. The two companies have offered 14.99 million and 11.70 million respectively. But is not certain whether the two are still in the race. Meanwhile, Exol justified its offer by pointing to the quality of SAMIR’s products. The refinery’s semi-finished gasoline means that the company could not bid any higher than its current offer, Saouabi pointed out. Since a Casablanca court declared it bankrupt in 216 and ruled that its assets be liquidated, SAMIR has been embroiled in a series of controversies. In addition to the dearth of interest the on-sale refinery has generated among potential buyers, there has been a tense arm twisting between Moroccan authorities and a Saudi investor over the origins of the refinery’s troubles.
Successive court rulings have established that SAMIR sank because of failed management. However, Saudi billionaire Sheikh Al Amoudi, one of the refinery’s principal shareholders, has been adamant that Moroccan authorities are at fault for the company’s failure. Most recently, the Saudi billionaire, who had filed a complaint against Morocco with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in early 2018, claimed that the North African country owed him $1.5 billion as compensation for precipitating SAMIR’s downfall. With the ongoing Morocco-Al Amoudi tussle and the perceived hesitation among investors to acquire SAMIR, the refinery may yet be at the center of further hot debates.

During the hearing, the 24 suspects involved in the murder will appear before the judge to give their testimonies on the murder. The four main suspects, who were directly involved in the beheading of the two tourists appeared before the court on May 30.  During the hearing, the defendants confessed to all charges. . In December 2018, Moroccan security services arrested 24 suspects on suspicion of involvement in the crime. The suspects include a Swiss-Spanish defendant, who pleaded innocent.

Rabat – Amid political uncertainty and turmoil in the country, Moldova’s interim president, Pavel Filip, has decided to join the US and Guatemala in moving his country’s Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Following the announcement of the decision, Filip referred to the move as “a long overdue commitment to support our allies.” By moving Moldova’s embassy, Filip has set his sights on positioning his country to become a stronger ally to the US and Israel. However, the decision has elicited backlash from both domestic and international sources, with the greatest criticism originating from officials within the Arab League and Palestinian Authority. The move represents a breakaway from the European consensus as a whole, which regards Tel Aviv as the legitimate capital of Israel, rather than Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israeli forces since 1967. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority has condemned the decision as “a flagrant violation of international law, international legitimacy and the UN resolutions” and accused Filip of “taking advantage of political uncertainty in his country to gain support from the US and Israel.” With the rest of the European community remaining relatively supportive of Palestinian liberation – most notably by condemning the expansion of Israeli settlements following the Six Day War in 1967 – the Palestinian Authority has appealed to the EU in the hopes that it will take action against Moldova for violating its international sovereignty. “The European Union should halt Moldova’s political and economic integration until the latter rescinds its illegal and provocative action and realigns its policy with international law and the collective EU position regarding the Palestinian question,” said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive Committee. Now that three countries have decided to move their embassies to Jerusalem, Palestinian sovereignty is further from reach, and it is uncertain as to whether other countries plan to follow suit and move their embassies as well.

Rabat  – This year, 441,065 Moroccans sat for the Baccalaureate exam nationwide. The age and background of those sitting for the test varied from 17-year-old school students up to this year’s oldest participant, 70-year-old Fettoum El Youssoufi. A picture of El Youssoufi taking the test is circulating on Facebook, with commenters congratulating the Sale-native en masse. “This respectable lady, Fettoum El Youssoufi, is the oldest baccalaureate candidate this year. At age 70, she participated in the city of Salé. Bravo dear madam and good luck,” the picture was captioned. “Better late than never. This woman has merit,” one user commented. Another user cheekily commented “this participant won’t cheat, at least,” in reference to the 3,000 cases of cheating on the exam recorded this year. Each year, the oldest participant of the baccalaureate exam is praised online for showing that it is never too late to accomplish your goals. Originally from Tangier, Fettoum said that her goal is to study Islamic law. She added that she was encouraged by many people to take the exam, including the headmaster of the school where she sat the exam. The ambitious woman said that she dreams of meeting King Mohammed VI if she gets her baccalaureate. She also wants to teach people in mosques. Last year’s oldest participant, 69-year-old Lahcen Chakiri, gained considerable attention on social media for his determined spirit. He stated that his move will help “to inspire young and rising generations to work and persevere to achieve their goals.” Read also: Marrakech-Safi Students Discover Error in Regional Baccalaureate French Test

Rabat – The investigating judge at the Supreme Court in Algeria summoned Algeria’s former prime minister Abdelmalek Sellal, who served from 2012 to 2017, on Thursday, June 13.  The former PM appeared before the Supreme Court to be heard in an investigation into corruption cases, Algerian media reported.  After listening to Sellal’s testimony, the Judge ordered his detention. On Wednesday, June 12, the same court ordered the provisional detention of another former prime minister, Ahmed Ouyahia, over allegations of corruption.  Authorities have also detained Algeria’s former minister of transportation, Abdelghani Zaalane after a hearing over alleged involvement in corruption.  Since former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s resignation, several wealthy businessmen have been held in custody for benefiting from government contracts through their links with senior Algerian officials.

Rabat – Morocco’s head of government Saad Eddine El Othmani has met with Tunisian prime minister Yousef Chahed at the UNheadquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. According to a press statement of the Tunisian government, El Othmani said after the meeting that “the relations between the two countries are distinctive and must be developed, especially that the region is facing difficult challenges in a complex regional and international situation and difficult to predict its developments.” The dynamism of bilateral relations, El Othmani said, “is mainly reflected in the work of the joint technical committees, which study the promotion of economic cooperation, cultural and student exchanges as well as certain commercial issues between the two countries.” El Othmani considered that these efforts are not enough and need to be further developed in a way to resolve the issues discussed.  He also called for reinforcing cooperation of the private sector in both countries and raising the level of scientific research between them. Both officials were attending the 108th Session of the International Labour Conference which coincided with the centenary celebrations of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The meeting comes after unfriendly statements from Chahed, who politicized a football issue between Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) and Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST).  Last week, the Tunisian minister posted a tweet on his official account disapproving the CAF executive body’s decision to replay the match between the two clubs in South Africa due to security measures. “After the CAF farce: salutation to our army and police, who have been a good example for all the world, and whoever is talking about this should take responsibility for it,” he wrote. “Salutation to ES Tunis fans, they were great at the last game. We will not give up on ES Tunis’ rights or any Tunisian association’s rights,” he added. The post did not go unnoticed in Morocco with many Moroccans criticizing the Tunisian official’s involvement in a sports matter that falls out of his remit. During the second leg of the African Champions League, WAC players experienced arbitrary refereeing mistakes in favor of the Tunisian team. The referee, Gassama Bakary, refused WAC’s legitimate goal at the 58th minute of play. WAC players then requested a review of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) to learn that it was not working due to a technical issue. Moroccan players subsequently refused to continue playing until the issue had been fixed.  After more than an hour of waiting, the referee surprised players by signaling the end of the game, thus, declaring EST winners of the CAF Champions League.  A decision has been reached by CAF to replay the match which has led to increased tension between Morocco and Tunisia’s media, provoking a journalistic war including numerous journalists and former players denouncing the decision.

Rabat – The investigation judge at the Supreme Court in Algeria ordered the provisional detention of Algeria’s former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia.  Ouyahia is suspected of involvement in many corruption cases.  Dozens of people were waiting for Ouyahia’s arrival at the Supreme Court, throwing yogurts on the van transporting him to the prison.  Algeria’s former minister of transportation, Abdelghani Zaalane, is also expected to appear before the court. On Sunday, June 9, Ouyahia, along with other senior officials, were summoned by an investigating judge of the Algiers court for ‘granting privileges’ to the owner of a car assembly plant. It is the second time in two months that the former prime minister has appeared in court in connection with corruption investigations.  Ouyahia was previously summoned on April 30 for ‘squandering public funds and undue advantages.”  Since the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, several wealthy businessmen have been held in custody for benefiting from government contracts through their links with senior Algerian officials.

Rabat – The Judiciary Police in Rabat have seized several vests connected to an electronic device, equipped with wireless earphones.  The vests have been used to cheat on the baccalaureate exams which started Tuesday and will continue till Friday, says the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). The police arrested a 20-year-old man for possessing and trafficking the vests.  Further investigations have led to the arrest of a female baccalaureate candidate who bought the vests to cheat. The main accused was placed in custody for further investigations into further suspects involved in the criminal act. The female candidate was summoned and was released after the completion of the preliminary investigation, while police are still looking for the main suspect who is suspected of trafficking the vests from abroad. Morocco’s Minister of Education and Vocational Training Said Amzazi has announced that the number of fraud cases during this year’s session notably decreased since 2016.  Amzazi, who spoke to the press on the sidelines of the launching of the Baccalaureate exams at the Abderrahmane Ennacer high school and Abdelmalek Essadi in Kenitra, said that the decrease is due to the various awareness campaigns held in many schools across the country throughout the month of May. It is also due to the entry into force of the law related to the repression of cheating during exams, he added. In the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region, a number of 45,784 candidates are taking baccalaureate exams this year. At the national level, a total of 440,000 candidates are taking exams, 48% of which are girls while candidates for the free Baccalaureate account for one-quarter of the total number. The baccalaureate results will be announced on June 26, while the students who failed in the normal session will re-take exams from July 4-6 and June 8.

Rabat – According to El Norte de Castilla, the province of Segovia, northwest of Madrid will offer 268 contract to Moroccan seasonal farmers, who have moved to Spainfor the harvest season. The news outlet reported that the number of Moroccan seasonal workers in Spain reached 20,000, representing an increase of 35 compared to last year. The news outlet added that the workers started arriving in Spain for the campaign in February. The recruitment of Moroccan seasonal workers comes amid sexual assault allegations filed by some farmers in Huelva.  The allegations date back to 2018, when a group of Moroccan female seasonal workers filed complaints against managers for allegedsexual abuse in Huelva, Spain. In May, the Provincial Court of Huelva ordered the reopening of the case after closing in it December 2018, without the judge hearing the testimonies of the complainants. In a new documentary aired on Salvados, Moroccan women who worked as seasonal migrants described the conditions they work in.  In the interviews, Moroccan women condemned overcrowded living conditions, sexual abuse, and long, irregular hours.  In response to the complaints, Morocco’s Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Moroccans Living Abroad and Immigration Affairs signed an agreement to monitor the situation of the Moroccan farmers in Spain. The agreement put in place a joint commission with Spanish authorities to organize visits to the Spanish farms to examine working conditions.

Rabat – After months of demonstrations and failed negotiations, medical students have achieved a major victory over the government with the success of a nationwide boycott against annual medical examinations, with the National Commission of Medical Students (CNEM) reporting that no student participated in the exams. Since March 25, medical students have been waging a campaign against the Ministries of Health and Education, demanding an array of reforms to the medical industry and threatening to continue striking until their demands have been met. Calling for an end to the privatization of the medical industry and condemning poor medical training conditions are among the 16 principal demands issued by the demonstrators. In response, the Minister of Education, Saaid Amzazi, has claimed that the majority of the student’s demands have already been met. “The case file of medical students is composed of 16 points, we have responded favorably to 14 points through the draft agreement, and we are committed to execute them,” Amzazi said. However, students still feel that their demands have not been fully met and have reiterated that the demands which have been met should have been fulfilled long before protests even began. “It should also be remembered that the majority of these points do not concern new achievements, but old unfulfilled promises dating back to 2015,” said Hamza Kermane, a member of CNEM-Rabat. Without a single student completing their exam, the question was raised as to whether every student due to graduate would have to retake their exam next year. The government has been firm in its stance that students who failed to take the exam would be forced to sit it the following year. “The exam will take place June 10, those who will not attend it will repeat,” Amzazi said. The minister also condemned the protest’s leadership, arguing that boycotting students were “threatened” by a minority of radical demonstrators. “The teachers came to monitor and the students did not come. They are under the influence of a group that threatens them, attacks them, harasses them! We believe that this is no longer a matter of pedagogy, but of politics,” Amzazi said. Though great progress has been made thus far with the protests, the two sides still remain uncompromising on several issues. Meanwhile, should a resolution not be reached soon, the medical industry could potentially face a year with no new graduates to replace the hundreds of doctors who have already resigned this year.

By Ghayt Bennis Rabat – Firdaous Bouzeryouh, a 9 year old  Moroccan girl, won the “ Arab reading Challenge” in Germany, in the category of Arabic readers living in non-Arabic communities. She will now go on to compete in a further round of competitions in Dubai.  Bouzeryouh competed against 23 participants from different nationalities, representing 70 Arabic language schools in Germany. Firdaous Bouzeryouh participated at the qualifying rounds in Berlin on Friday and Saturday, June 7 and 8. Bouzeryouh has read 25 books over the past 5 months and presenting resumes for the competition.“I was born in Germany, but I also visited Morocco by reading books about the Kingdom and the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battouta,” she said. “I have read many books in Arabic that have opened my mind and involved me in incredible worlds. Reading made me visit many places and helped me to beat stage fright and be more confident” she added. Firdaous Bouzeryouh is a very young reader who is enthusiastic about Arabic. Her family from Rif region who are now sitting in Rüsselsheim, Germany, introduced her to the values of Arabic and helped her to read widely. She has developed her talent at the school of l’Amitié, where she attends courses in Arabic. Her father, Ali Bouzeryouh, said that he is delighted with this accomplishment. According to her father, Firdaous has her mother to thank for the significant role she played in motivating and encouraging her child to learn  and read Arabic. Expats living in non-Arab countries have more limited access to Arabic reading materials. However, mosques play a major role in lArabic learning in Germany, which helps people understand Islam’s fundamental principles and to keep their Muslim identity. Mariam Aklekan, Bouzeryouh’s teacher, pointed out that this victory is not due to chance, but to  efforts and guidance of Firdaous’s family, who ensured that her daughter maintain a solid relationship with the Arabic language and reading.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has reiterated that that keeping the Daylight Saving Time (DST), also known as the GMT+1 all year around is not a source of concern. On Tuesday in Rabat, the minister delegate for Reform of Administration and Public Service, Mohamed BenAbdelkader, said that  GMT+1 year around has no impact on health. The statement is part of the first findings of a “scientific study” ordered on the adoption of DST throughout the year.  At the House of Councillors, Benabdelkader said that the adoption of  DST throughout the year has “no impact on health from a scientific point of view, according to a study adopted” by the ministry. He added that his ministry will release the findings of the study soon. However, the government previously promised to release the study findings when they initially adopted the GMT+1 policy. On October 26, 2018 the government council adopted Draft Decree 2.18.855, adding 60 minutes to the standard time in the country. The decision angered many Moroccan people who condemned the decision. The announcement of the change came only days before the country was set to turn back the clocks one hour with the end of DST on October 29, 2018. Defending its decision, the government claimed that it had prepared a study that shows  the decision to switch to GMT+1 year round was based on an evaluation study. On November 1, the spokesperson of the government, Mustapha El Khalfi, also promised that the government would issue the study used in the decision to stay on the DST “next week” in November 2018. To date, the government has not yet disclosed the findings of the study. In addition to El Khalfi, Benabdelkader also argued that the decision was based on a study that started in May 2018, and the government received the preliminary results of the study on October 9, 2018. The official also claimed that the study aimed to evaluate the reaction of Moroccan citizens to time changes. He also claimed that “we found that 68 percent of [Moroccans] prefer stability. The decision to maintain daylight saving time is a political decision.” He also argued that the study’s indicators included “health aspects related to time change, energy saving and Morocco’s commercial transactions.” Calls to release the study The decision generated anger not only from citizens but also from parliamentarians, who urged the government to release the study. MP Abdellatif Ouahbi called on the government to reveal the study that the government claimed to have conducted on time change. Ouahbi, a member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), told Morocco World News that  if the change is based on a study, “I want to see these reports.” Morocco now switches between GMT and DST only twice a year, rather than 4 times.   Previously, Morocco switched the clock every summer to Daylight Saving Time, GMT+1, and returned to the old standard time, GMT, for a period when Ramadan fell in the summer. After Ramadan, Morocco switched back to DST for the remainder of the summer, and then  returned again to the old standard time every winter on the last Sunday in October. After the adoption of Decree 2.18.855, Morocco now changes g the clocks only twice for Ramadan.

Rabat – Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, is off to Latin America for a four-day tour, between June 11 and 14. The Moroccan minister is reportedly placing his eventful trip to the region under the umbrella of an ongoing charm offensive to gather international support for Morocco’s Western Sahara position. During the tour, Bourita will visit Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Surinam, announced yesterday a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. While the ministry’s statement did not provide details about Bourita’s schedule in the four Latin American countries, it hinted at Morocco’s earnest desire to capitalize on the current Morocco-friendly momentum in a region that has until recently been an undisputed stronghold of the Polisario Front’s Western Sahara separatist project. In addition to drawing his different hosts’ attention to Morocco’s south-south agenda on various global issues, ranging from security, trade, and cultural exchanges, Bourita’s visit to the four countries is part of a broader scheme to breathe new life into the region’s perceived shift towards more Morocco-friendly positions on the longstanding Western Sahara dispute. Having made its marks on its home continent, where the momentum on Western Sahara is increasingly moving towards Morocco, despite abiding hostilities from some known pro-Polisario outposts, Rabat now seeks to establish more diplomatic linkages with Latin America. Bourita’s visit comes after some recent developments have shown the considerable gains that Morocco’s Latin American diplomacy has made under his ministerial tenure. In the most recent instance, El Salvador, whose government eagerly sided with Polisario’s “Sahrawi cause” from the outset of the group’s separatist agenda and until recently remained an outspoken pro-Polisario voice, has just said that it is poised to reconsider its stance on the decades-long dispute in Western Sahara.

Rabat – While talking with scientist Rachid Yazami, a Fez native and world-renowned battery researcher, one does not feel overpowered by the aura of a man whose inventions are used by billions of people each day. Instead, Yazami is warm and easy to talk to, repeatedly expressing gratitude for the opportunities he’s had and the people who’ve helped him along the way. Yazami is best known for inventing the graphite anode, which, after more than 30 years since it was first patented, is still the number one electrode used in rechargeable lithium batteries. Lithium batteries are used in cell phones, laptops, cameras, and other technology that much of society uses every day. A curious child, Yazami shared that he had his own home-lab by the age of 10. He remembers going for walks in the countryside, collecting rocks, and bringing them home to analyze their compositions. His initial interest in geology waned as he entered his teenage years and he was instead drawn towards chemistry – creating hydrogen out of metal powders and acids, filling balloons to watch them fly. Around the same time, a chemistry and physics professor noticed the scientist’s passion for science and motivation to discover, which he described as a turning point in his life. “One day he pointed his finger [at] me and said, ‘Rachid you will be a chemist,’” Yazami said, and laughed. Yazami recalled this memory more than 10 years later while choosing his degree major at France’s Grenoble National Institute of Technology. “I had this picture of this professor pointing his finger to me telling me I would be a chemist so I said, ‘I would like to go into chemistry.’” Yazami, who had high academic rankings, surprised advisors when he chose this over a more prestigious route, like computer science – a decision he never regretted since it led him to invent the lithium-ion batteries society relies on today. Yazami said he was grateful for the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people throughout his career – whether in Morocco, France, Japan, the US, or Singapore. “You have to trust yourself, that’s very important, and also recognize the people who play a role in your life and never forget them,” he said. While Yazami said he was lucky to meet the right people at the right time, not everyone was supportive. Throughout his career he faced multiple barriers, though one instance early on stood out in particular. Yazami first discovered the graphite anode just one year into his PhD program, but, after presenting his idea at an international meeting in France, the head of a major company told him there was no commercial potential. “He looked at my poster, he looked at me, and he said, ‘you are wasting your time.’ That was a very discouraging comment – I could be depressed after this,” Yazami said, adding that the man was well known internationally and had written the first book on lithium batteries. “‘But still I said, ‘well, okay, I respect his opinion, but I will be happy to show him that he is wrong – not me. And in the end, he was wrong,” he added. Yazami’s patent for the graphite anode is now worth $15 billion annually. Despite difficulties along the way he always managed to achieve what he wanted – a testament to Yazami’s character, who was happy to say he has never been very discouraged. The scientist is rightfully proud of his achievements and their ongoing role in society, but also light-hearted, and laughs as he shares that everyone using a cell phone owes him something. “They are all using my invention. If everyone gave me one cent I would be a multi-billionaire,” he said jokingly. As Yazami summarized the path he took to get where he is today – describing his masters, his PhD, entering the workforce, and expanding his career experience from researcher to professor to entrepreneur – he mixed invaluable lessons he’s learned along the way. While he says he is “blessed” to have had a chance to work with prestigious institutions, daring to try new things in and out of work characterized his career and allowed him to capitalize on opportunities that ultimately granted him both success in work and a chance to learn about new people and cultures. After receiving his PhD, the  scientist was admitted to the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), ultimately moving up the ranks to become the CNRS Director of Research in 1998, a position he has held for the last 40 years. Throughout his time at CNRS, he took advantage of opportunities to travel and research in new places – a year in Japan, ten years in the US working with CalTech and NASA, and now in Singapore, where he has resided since 2010. “I was always open to new adventures,” he said. “This is all about being curious and also having the will to do something different.” Colleagues had been pushing Yazami to try his hand in the business world, and while he was initially resistant to the idea, in 2006 he took on this adventure, too, co-founding CFX Battery Inc., decided he’s a fan of entrepreneurship, and now advises multiple other corporations in addition to his own ongoing research with CNRS. After approximately 150 patents and co-authoring 230 peer-reviewed scientific papers, Yazami is retiring from his current position at CNRS next week. For most people, retirement means more free time to spend doing activities one didn’t always have time for while working. For Yazami this might mean traveling, enjoying a particularly good meal out with friends, or joining in a game of football – which he’s played for 61 years since he was 5. But the scientist emphasizes that his life probably won’t change – much of his other work will continue and his determination to contribute to society and make batteries even more friendly to us is as strong as ever. “Retirement is the last page of one book, but it’s not the end of the series,” he said. Improving battery safety is his top priority nowadays, but finding ways to better existing batteries so they charge faster and last longer, with hopes of reducing pollution is also important to Yazami. As he enters retirement, he is still searching for ways to help more people and specifically hopes to improve lives within Morocco, especially in his home village North of Fez, where he’s started programs that promote women’s education. Although he has only been back to Morocco for visits since leaving to study in France, after receiving the Draper Prize, equivalent to a Nobel Prize of engineering, and a Royal Medal from Morocco’s King Mohammed VI in 2014, Yazami said he’s “suddenly become more popular” in his home country and has been visiting more frequently. Yazami emphasized that family has always been most important to him and described his parents’ pride following these awards. “They said, ‘Okay, you spent most of your life outside of Morocco but at least you bring something to honor the family,’” he shared. Even after years of success, Yazami remains driven by the chance of new discoveries and tells others to not shy away from unexpected solutions. “I would advise people to dare to do things that maybe other people will tell you, ‘oh that is very crazy, it’s impossible,’” he said. “Everything is possible.”

By Abdessamad El Baz Rabat – In Parliamentary questioning held on Monday, June 10, Anas Doukkali, Morocco’s Minister of Health, said that smoking is a major threat to national health and the number one cause of death around the world. Anas Dokali added that 23.4% of men and 2% of women consume tobacco, according to the National Survey On Non-Communicable Diseases 2017- 2018. Statistics also show that 6 to 7 % of minors aged 13-15 consume tobacco, 4.4% of these are girls. In order to reduce the rate of smokers, the Ministry of Health has developed the National Program for Prevention and Combating Smoking, which was introduced in 2010 within the national plan to prevent and control cancer. The Ministry, in partnership with Lalla Salma Foundation for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer, designed a plan that consists of 78 measures, 8 of which are specifically dedicated to combat smoking. The national program has four main aims: the organization of epidemiological studies to monitor the spread of this epidemic, raising awareness of the dangers of smoking, assisting smokers who wish to quit smoking, and strengthening the legal framework against smoking. Houcine El Ouardi, the former health minister, said that 75 % of smoking-related deaths are due to lung cancer, while 10 % are caused by respiratory diseases. A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that the number of Moroccan smokers is expected to reach over 7 million by 2025. According to the Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII), Moroccans consumed 13.8 billion cigarettes in 2016, 1.2 billion more cigarettes compared to 2015. Tobacco kills more than eight million people every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 7 million of those deaths are a direct result of smoking while “around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to secondhand smoke”. Non-smokers who are exposed to tobacco also suffer serious health risks, including major cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. “In pregnant women, it causes pregnancy complications and low birth weight,” stated WHO. WHO also added that 65 000 children die each year from diseases related to secondhand smoke.

Rabat – A video circulating on social media shows Moroccan and Algerian migrants being attacked with poles by Pakistani migrants during Eid al-Fitr. The North African migrants reportedly decided to celebrate the end of Ramadan in what some would consider unconventional way; by drinking in a park. After the Eid al-Fitr prayer on Wednesday, June 5, at the Velika Kladusa mosque in Una-Sana Canton, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the group of Maghrebi migrants continued the festivities at a nearby park, thinking they would be away from prying eyes. The Pakistanis, who prayed at the same mosque, took objection to this, yelling that the drinkers are “bad Muslims.” A huge brawl ensued, spilling out from the park into the parking lot. The video shows some of the men were armed with metal bars and glass being thrown before police intervened. Around 20 people have been arrested by Bosnian authorities and an investigation is underway. Read also: Violence and Vandalism Erupts During FAR-Raja Football Game in Rabat

Rabat – Moroccan-born Aziz Zaghanane and his Mexican wife Ana Marilu Reyna were first on trial last year accused of recruiting for Islamic State (IS). Zaghanane was sentenced to six years in prison and Reyna, one. The verdict for their retrial is set to be announced this week. The Spanish National Court ruled that a retrial was necessary. Their reasoning was that the evidence in the first trial was incomplete, as it did not include statements from three others involved in the case. The three other suspects had also been accused of recruiting for the IS but had confessed to the crimes, unlike Reyna and Zaghanane. The couple argues that their social media, which was used as evidence against them, discusses world events related to the IS, but does not condone violence. When the couple was first arrested, it was for distributing propaganda with the intention to persuade individuals to join the IS movement. Reyna gives a detailed account of the arrests in an interview with NPR, which was released in a 2-part series. For the interview, the reporter went to Pinto, her small village south of Madrid. Reyna told the story of how she converted to Islam, which happened as learned more about the religion through teaching the Abrahamic faiths in a Catholic school. Reyna met with Muslims and read materials which explained their beliefs. She quickly accepted the idea that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, against her previous misconceptions. Reyna said: “So I start reading it, and I say: ‘Oh!’ I mean, everything I had believed started to vanish. I couldn’t believe it.” Reyna said that she dispelled the prejudices she’d previously held about Muslims and became increasingly impressed with the way Muslims worship, she was soon conflicted about teaching in a Catholic school. She quit her job and officially converted to Islam. Today she is not without a sense of humor about her identity: “I’m a Muslim, a woman, Mexican, and a Muslim woman. Don’t let Trump see me (laughs).” Reyna later felt it was time for her to get married. She said, “Well, I knew, in Islam, you complete your… the religion when you get married. So, in Islam… well, it’s that. You have to… celibacy isn’t conceived of.” She signed up for online dating and met Aziz, a divorced Moroccan man working in Spain. In Reyna’s words, she describes him by saying, “Aziz was… very direct. He said: ‘OK, I’m a person… a very serious person. I’m very responsible,’…‘I’m looking for someone to marry.’ And I said: ‘And who is this guy?’” After a long-distance relationship, Reyna came to Aziz and they got married. She again tells is with humor: “Afterward, on December 28th —Día de los Inocentes, like April Fool’s Day (laughs). And, well, it was an event for 60 people more or less, and half of them went. The other half thought it was a joke. (Laughs)” She moved to Pinto, where there is a prominent Muslim community, which made her feel welcome. However, people there spoke Arabic, which Reyna didn’t speak, so she was somewhat of an outsider. The Spanish people would assume she was from an Islamic country and make comments on the streets. After some years with Aziz, they had two children. When the police came to their door to arrest Aziz, Reyna’s initial thought was that they were being robbed. Aziz was later accused of leading a group that handed out IS propaganda. The police had been investigating him since 2014. Reyna was shocked, saying, “If I had seen something strange in him, however small it may be, I would grab my kids right away and go. But if I never saw anything strange in him, well no. I’m not going to turn my back on him.” When, a year later, Reyna was arrested in front of other moms from her children’s school, she thought, “Maybe they’re confused. Maybe they want to give a statement maybe and they’re saying I’ve been arrested just to say it.” According to the interview, it wasn’t until she was finally before a judge that she learned she was being accused of “recruitment, promotion, and indoctrination.” Her arrest warrant explains that she quickly changed her appearance to a “rigorous esthetic, with the most radical precepts of Islam” and it said she had no female friends, which was also suspicious. The warrant also accuses Reyna of using social media and emails to recruit extremists. She was said to be “performing the functions of a sheik [religious leader] over the others.” Reyna had regularly posted advice on how to worship in Islam on her Facebook page. From the moment she discovered that she was a suspect, she felt certain that “things will be cleared up.” Her sentence was eventually cleared in June 2018. The Supreme Court ordered a retrial in November 2018, though Aziz remained in jail until February 2019, when he was released on parole. The verdict for the couple will be released this week.

Rabat – In another unfriendly move, the Algerian government  mobilized its Education system to stand against Morocco’s sovereignty over its southern provinces. Algerian students who sat for the history-geography for the Certificate of Primary Studies (CEP) discovered a question which questioned Morocco’s territorial integrity. In the exam paper, the question reads: “the independence of the Maghreb and its construction can only be achieved if the Sahrawi people are free.” The students are asked to  argue and explain why Algeria supports the “cause.” While this move comes as no surprise since Algeria expresses unwavering support for the Polisario Front, the new hostile move explains how Morocco’s eastern neighbour are determined to continue to oppose Morocco’s territorial integrity.  The Algerian government has long supported the “independence” claims of the Polisario Front. The country also provides diplomatic support for the separatist group at an international level. Despite the support, Algeria has been denying its role as a main party to the Western Sahara conflict, defining itself as an observer and a neighboring party instead. However, Morocco is determined that Algeria bear full responsibility in the conflict. In May, Moroccan Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations Omar Hilale  accused Algeria of creating Polisario, and giving it “practically an extra sovereign territory in the Tindouf camps.” Hilale also said that Algeria provides arms to the separatist front and carries “diplomatic campaigns” against Morocco’s territorial integrity. In addition to Morocco, the UN also defined the role of Algeria in the UN-led political process over the conflict in the recent resolutions, including the new Resolution 2468. The resolution mentioned Algeria as a key party to the conflict.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Health Security Office of Food (ONSSA) warns of a bacteria called “Xylella fastidiosa” which affects more than 350 plant species.   “Raising awareness among all the stakeholders concerned, as well as strengthening national technical capacities in the diagnosis and control of this plant disease.”, said the office in a statement.  The office also warns against the introduction of any plants to Morocco without the necessary phytosanitary documents. ONSSA has set specific conditions and guidelines for importing plants susceptible to the bacteria to the country: plants likely to harbor the bacteria are not allowed for import from the countries in which the”Xylella fastidiosa” disease has been reported. 

“Xylella fastidiosa” mainly affect olive trees, however, the bacteria can include a variety of other host plants. According to the according to the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization EPPO: “Globally, the main economic hosts are grapevine (Vitis vinifera, V. labrusca, V. riparia), citrus (Citrus spp., Fortunella), almond (Prunus dulcis), olive (Olea europaea), peach (P. persica), coffee (Coffea spp.)” Plants susceptible to ‘Xylella fastidiosa’ “may be authorized for importation from countries where the disease of this bacterium has been declared, but only from the uninfected regions”, according to ONSSA official website.  A few days ago ONSSA ordered the destruction of dozens of mint fields for the use of “unlicensed” pesticides and high levels of unapproved chemicals following a national study.

Rabat –  President of the Dominican Republic Danilo Medina has reiterated his country’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. The president reaffirmed his country’s position when he received Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on Tuesday, June 11, at the Presidential  Palace in Santo Domingo. The meeting is part of Bourita’s official tour of four Latin American countries from June  11 to 14. On his tour, the minister is expected to discuss Western Sahara with the Latin American leaders. During the meeting, Bourita conveyed a verbal message from King Mohammed VI to the president. In the message, the Moroccan monarch reaffirmed Morocco’s determination to foster its bilateral relations with the Dominican Republic and to encourage a partnership between the two countries. Bourita also spoke about the “sustained and constructive” action of the Dominican Republic in the United Nations as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in support of Morocco’s territorial integrity. Following the meeting, the Dominican Republic issued a statement to express its satisfaction with the bilateral relations between the countries.  In the same statement, the country also expressed its “respect for the territorial integrity and national sovereignty” of Morocco. The Dominican Republic  also expressed full support for Morocco’s efforts to reach a mutually acceptable solution for the Western Sahara conflict. The Dominican Republic is on the list of the countries which deem the autonomy initiativea realistic and credible political solution for the Western Sahara conflict. The territorial dispute pits Morocco against the Polisario front, a breakaway movement that claims to be the sole representative of the Saharawis and seeks to establish an independent state in southern Morocco.

Rabat –  A recent report shows that in 2018, Moroccans spent more in Spain than Spaniards spent in Morocco. This is partly due to more Moroccans visiting Spain than Spanish tourists in Morocco.  Morocco is the second most popular tourist destination for Spanish tourists, after France. The geographical proximity of the two countries, which are only separated by 13 kilometers, makes it accessible. However, because of this same proximity, more Moroccans travel to their Iberian neighbor, especially in summer. The balance of travel between the two countries, which had been favorable to Morocco, has now reversed. Uneven number of travelers EFE news agency announced that in 2018, the number of Moroccan tourists who visited Spain was 900,000. Meanwhile, only 814,069 Spaniards came to Morocco. That is a difference of 10%. According to Medias 24, the Spanish tourist office confirmed that the number of Moroccan tourists has increased since 2016 (when it was at 630,000), growing 13% in 2017 (711,000) and then 26% in 2018 (900,000). The growth rate of Moroccan arrivals now far exceeds that of Iberian arrivals in Morocco, which grew by only 14.5% between 2017 and 2018. This vacation pattern has caused a negative difference between the two countries in travel revenue, estimated at more than one billion dirhams.  Moroccans spending on vacation The greater number of Moroccan tourists (a reminder of the 10% difference) explains the difference of 1.1 billion dirhams, but also the average Moroccan budget is greater than that of Spaniards who spend on average 115 euros per day for a stay of four nights including about 45 euros for their hotel per night. The total Moroccan tourist expenditure in Spain in 2018 is therefore estimated at 5.2 billion dirhams, more than the MAD 4.1 billion spent by the 814,069 Spanish tourists during their stay in Morocco in 2018. The average length of stay of a Moroccan household in Spain is 6 nights and that their daily budget is 150 euros (approximately MAD 1,600).  About 60% of the 900,000 visitors from Morocco (totaling 540,000 people) spent money during the holidays in 2018, the rest most likely being children or dependents. Instead of flying, most Moroccans tend to take the ferry to Algeciras and Tarifa before visiting popular areas like the Costa Del Sol (which includes Malaga, Fuengirola, Benalmadena, Torremolinos, etc.) or the Costa Brava in winter. Consequences With the significant increase in Moroccan tourist visits to Spain, and especially their significant expenses, there are plans that Spain will open a national tourist office in Morocco to boost “a market emerging still underused.” The Spanish tourist office targets 1 million Moroccan tourists in 2020. Due to this new travel trend, Spain, which already has profitable trade with Morocco (as its 1st supplier), also has very profitable revenue from tourism.  The situation may motivate the Spanish government to improve the procedures of granting travel visas to Moroccan tourists as the numbers for Moroccans vacationing in Spain are high, despite an increase in obstacles for getting there. Moroccans applying for a visa have been facing up to six months of wait times for their visa appointments at Spanish consular services. Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell said that Spain has been “overwhelmed” due to the high number of visa applications. Additionally, the EU announced that the Schengen visa fees would increase from €60 to €80 (33.3%). The EU justified the decision, saying that the visa fee will be increased to “ensure member state can better cover the costs of visa processing without constituting a deterrent for visa applicants.” Spain is now asking for visa appointment fees in advance as an effort to control the number of visas it issues since it is a border country for the EU, where irregular immigration has long been a problem. The Spanish Foreign Minister recently apologized for the slow pace of the proceedings and promised improvements. But if these are followed up with more visas awarded, there is no doubt that the rush of Moroccan tourists in Spain will continue, which could further aggravate the deficit of the Morocco-Spain travel revenue balance. Other tourism to Morocco The Moroccan Tourism Observatory stated that more than 3.6 million tourists visited Morocco in the first four months of 2019, which indicates an increase in comparison to 2018. The 2019 increase was mostly tourists from the traditional European markets, as statistics showed an increase of 13% in Italian tourist visits, 9% in French and Spanish tourists, 8% in German tourists as well as 14 %t in U.S. tourist arrivals. In 2018, the number of tourists visited Morocco saw an increase by 8.3 % in comparison to 2017. Morocco attracted 200,000 Chinese tourists that year.

Rabat – Morocco’s Mostapha Tarfaoui won France’s “National Energy Globe Award”, one of the most prestigious energy and environmental awards in the world, on June 6. The national prize, which was created in 1999 by Austrian scientific pioneer Wolfgang Neumann, aims to give exposure to projects that provide effective and feasible solutions to protect and save resources. Approximately 2,000 energy projects from 182 countries apply to win the prize every year. Tarfaoui clinched the prize this year for his work on the development of an innovative deicing system for composite structures based on carbon nanotubes for aerospace and renewable energy applications. The use of salt is the most commonly used deicing technique. However, most deicing salts contain chloride and have a strong tendency to cause corrosion and pollute groundwater. Tarfaoui’s new technique will provide solutions to save energy and solve environmental problems related to the use of standard techniques. The Moroccan scientist completed his primary and secondary studies in Morocco, before moving to France for graduate studies. He is currently a professor at the National School of Advanced Techniques in Brittany. Tarfaoui isn’t the only Moroccan scientist to be recognized for his innovation in the energy sector recently. Just this month, on June 3, Moroccan-American scientist Khalil Amine was awarded the Global Energy Prize for his outstanding contribution to the development of efficient electrical energy storage technology. Managed by the Moscow-based Global Energy Association, the Global Energy Prize is presented each year by the President of the Russian Federation.

Rabat – Following the U.S. government’s decision a month ago to blacklist Chinese tech company, Huawei, Reuters reports that Facebook is suspending its major applications from being pre-installed on future models of Huawei phones. The apps that will be suspended are Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This is an attempt to make Huawei devices less appealing to the public. Despite everything, you will still have the option to utilize Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp on a new Huawei device. You will just have to download all the applications from the Google Play Store, where they will still be available. The Trump administration’s sanctions against Huawei have started. The U.S has initiated this backlash because Huawei has won contracts to develop 5G. In order to hinder them before they can fully develop the 5G software, the U.S. has initiated those sanctions. U.S. and European governments cite cyber security concerns as part of their reasoning. U.S. companies that supply the Chinese tech powerhouse with PC chips saw their stock costs drop Monday, and Huawei faces decimated smartphone sales with the anticipated loss of Google’s popular software and services. On May 15th, the U.S. Commerce Department placed Huawei on its Entity List, adequately restricting U.S. firms from offering Huawei technology without government approval. The article “Huawei sanctions: Who gets hurt in dispute?” Quoted Google saying it would keep on supporting existing Huawei cell phones; however, future devices won’t have its lead applications and tools, including maps, Gmail and Google search. Just fundamental tools will be accessible, making Huawei telephones less alluring. Independently, Huawei is the world’s driving supplier of systems administration gear; however the technology is heavily dependent on U.S. parts, including PC chips. About 33% of Huawei’s providers are American.

Rabat – The Moroccan government has further clarified its plans to sell eight percent of its shares in Maroc Telecom, announcing that up to six percent of the shares will be sold exclusively to local institutional investors, such as banks and insurance companies. With the Moroccan government’s ownership of the company expected to drop to 22 percent following the sale, the company’s principal stockholder will remain the Emirati company Etisalat, which currently owns 53 percent of Maroc Telecom. By reserving a majority of its sales for local investors, the Moroccan government’s move has been interpreted as an attempt to prevent an even greater percentage of Maroc Telecom’s ownership being exported to the UAE. Maroc Telecom remains, by a wide margin, the most widely used phone and internet provider in Morocco, with over 43 percent of the market share. This has led to concern from the government and Moroccan public over the large number of shares owned by the foreign-based company Etisalat. Furthermore, Maroc Telecom remains influential throughout Africa, with the company owning subsidiaries in a number of countries ranging from Mali and Mauritania to Niger and the Central African Republic. The remaining 2 percent of stakes to be sold by the government, approximated at over 17 million shares, are planned to be listed on the Casablanca stock exchange as a public offering. The sale is part of a government privatization plan designed to slash the 2019 budget deficit by 0.6 percent, lowering it to 3.3 percent from 3.8 percent by flooding the federal budget with $633 million. The government also plans to bring several hundred million more into the budget by selling La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech and the Tahaddart power plant in northern Morocco.

Rabat – For all its associations with beauty, positive energy, and humane moments that bring together different people and help transcend traditional divides, football can be brutally cruel. In case you had forgotten that downside part of football, the controversy-soaked match between Morocco’s Wydad of Casablanca and Tunisia’s Esperance de Tunis (EST) should be enough to hammer the point home. A simple footballing rivalry is enough to, even if occasionally, open our eyes to the inescapable hideousness lurking beneath the universally acclaimed virtues of what has come to be known by fans and commentators as “the beautiful game.” But when politics enters the game, when grievances and perceived attacks on strongly felt notions of identity and pride enter the equation, the confrontation instantly reaches heights that can even baffle some of the fiercest fanatics. “Is this all really about a football game?” the bafflement seems to suggest, as what looked like a flippant, ephemeral expression of rage from fans of both teams invites even more acrimony from political leaders. This is what has been happening in the Wydad vs. EST fiasco, with politicians and ordinary citizens (not necessarily fans of EST or Wydad) joining in a discussion increasingly framed as a matter of national pride. Underpinning the rage-filled conversation is each side’s unbending faith that it is right. During the first leg in Rabat, Wydad felt robbed of a deserved victory. The Moroccan team complained about a valid goal and penalty being ruled out by the referee, as well as several refereeing mistakes which seemed to be favoring EST. At the African Confederation of Football (CAF), the reaction was to punish the referee of that first leg. Furthermore, as is the norm in such circumstances, unarticulated promises were made that the second leg would not witnesses the same fiasco as the first. But scandals often revel in defying expectations, taking everyone off guard, raising tensions, and sparking a scheduled march towards a precipice, any precipice. After a second leg equally marked by irregularities and a fatal refereeing mishap, CAF first proclaimed EST champions, downright dismissing Wydad’s repeated appeals that the newly introduced video refereeing system, commonly known as VAR, be used to clear out the fog. EST players and fans were exuberant, with a raucous Rades Stadium celebrating another continental crown for the Tunisian side. But the celebration turned into a festival of resentment and Morocco-trolling three days later, when, after an “urgent” board meeting in Paris, CAF decided that EST were no longer Champions, announcing a rematch to be had on “neutral ground after the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.” CAF said its decision came after painstakingly considering many factors, ranging from “technical mishaps” (a reference to a defective VAR) to the low security standards at the stadium on match day. But at this point, CAF had officially come out of sync with the Tunisian public. If Tunisian media outlets had thunderously lambasted CAF’s prior decision to inexplicably abandon the match and grant EST the trophy, they were now unanimously slandering the rematch decision as even more outrageous than the ostensibly scandalous decision it had ruled against. The idea of a rematch, en masse headlines suggested, bore out the now famous notion that “out of Africa [comes] always something new.” CAF’s president, the Malagasy Ahmad Ahmad, said in an interview after the Paris meeting that at the heart of CAF’s decision was the belated realization that, even by African football’s own standards of not-so-bright refereeing record, the now dismissed second leg was unforgivably outrageous. “You simply could not rule out that goal. It was valid from whichever direction you looked at it,” Ahmad said, referring to Wydad’s 59th minute equalizer which the referee had wrongly ruled out for supposed offside. Ahmad’s point, something he has been repeating to whoever would listen since the unprecedented rematch move, is that the Wydad vs. EST match was mired in scandal and irregularities. CAF, understandably, had it reasons for ruling as it did. But whatever those reasons are, Tunisian officials—and not sporting authorities—have declared them unconvincing. In a particularly vitriolic rebuttal, Tunisia’s Prime Minister shrugged off CAF’s justifications, calling the body’s decision a “farce.” In PM Youssef Chahed’s eyes, CAF justifying its “farce” by invoking technical mishaps and insufficient security was only meant to be an attack on Tunisia’s pride as a proven organizer of events bigger than a CAF Champions League game. “After the CAF farce: salutation to our army and police, who have been a good example for the whole world, and whoever is talking about this should take responsibility for it,” the Tunisian PM wrote. Hichem El Fourati, the North African country’s Minister of the Interior, echoed his prime minister’s sentiment. El Fourati said that security is at the forefront of Tunisia’s political culture and that the country has “successfully organized” a number of global events with far higher stakes than a CAF Champions League. Besides, a statement from the interior ministry settled, “Why did the referee start the game in the first place” if, as CAF has said, security and logistics requirements were not met? But that is only the tip of the iceberg of the Tunisian rage. Reading social media reactions, there have been statements questioning Morocco’s claims on Western Sahara, the usual middle finger move that Morocco critics—mostly pro-Polisario circles—quickly call upon when confronting Moroccan interests. There have even been some untraditional slurs, from Moroccan girls being “easy girls,” to Morocco itself being a country that thrives on “sexual tourism.” Such slanders often come from places thought to be at loggerheads with Morocco on a wide range of issues, mainly geopolitical. But Tunisia does not qualify as a Moroccan “enemy” or adversary. If anything, Tunisia and Morocco see eye to eye on a number of regional issues, with many observers labeling the two countries the exceptions in an otherwise undemocratic and crisis-prone neighborhood. In a recent column, Moroccan journalist Karim Boukahri eloquently drove the point home when he said that many citizens in both countries are puzzled by the growing hostility between two traditionally friendly nations. Beyond the unfortunate politicization of “a simple football match,” Boukhari contends, is the reality of the other side of football, the confrontational and divisive side which sports pundits and fans seldom consider. As much as it galvanizes and brings about beautiful moments of collective joy and elation, the “beautiful game” is as inherently divisive and toxic as any other human activity that thrives on emotional attachment and elicits group belonging and identity. “All this suggests that the worst is yet to come,” Boukhari regretfully remarked, tapping into the inescapable excesses and toxicity of football. He went on to add that given all the voracious reactions surrounding the rematch, it is sure that the next confrontation will not be approached as a football game. “The match will no longer oppose two clubs, but two nations, two cultures…. Defeat will feel like losing one’s honor, betraying one’s people, or selling one’s soul to the devil.” This is hideously true—and alarming enough. Just imagine what degree the hostility would take if Tunisia and Morocco were to play at some stage (at the semi-finals or final) of the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations. The stakes of the confrontation would be raised far higher for national honor and cultural pride-clocked hostility between two countries. Whatever happens at this year’s CAN, the EST vs. Wydad rematch is bound to be more than a football game. With politics taking center stage, there may follow a degree of zeal bound to border on reckless disregard for the boundaries of the usual football rivalry.

Rabat – Casablanca’s renowned Jazzablanca festival is returning for the 14th year in a row from July 2-9. This year, the festival will feature 58 concerts across four stages and two venues. Thousands of visitors will flock to Casablanca, Morocco’s “white city,” for the iconic event. The 14th edition of the festival has 6 big headliners this year – including iconic Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who became stars with their 2004 hit “Take Me Out” on July 2. The band released their 5th album, “Always Ascending” in 2014. Next on the list of headliners is Tobagonian singer Calypso Rose on July 3. Since the 79-year-old singer started writing songs over 6 decades ago at age 15, she has released more than 800 songs and recorded more than 20 albums. Rose has earned herself the name “Queen of Calypso,” a rhythmic style of Afro-Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago. Next up is British soul singer Michael Kiwanuka on July 4. Kiwanuka earned fame after supporting Adele on her world tour in 2011, as well as releasing his own number one single and a certified gold album. Kiwanuka was born in London in 1987, to Ugandan parents who fled Idi Amin’s regime in the ’70s. He developed a love of rock music at a young age and cites musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Bill Withers as his influences. In a change of pace on July 5, English electronic group Metronomy is the 4th headliner on the list. The 5-person group is known for its new wave remixes of popular songs, in addition to their 5 original albums. Metronomy is known for their eclectic live performances, featuring dance routines and light shows. Next up, on July 6, is the Al McKay Allstars with their show the “Earth, Wind, and Fire Experience.” The 13-piece ensemble, headed by 71-year-old American funk star Al McKay, has performed their show at some of the biggest jazz festivals in the world since the 1960s. Continuing the theme of funk superstars on July 7, Maceo Parker will be the 6th headliner. Parker began his illustrious musical career in the 1960s when he started working alongside one of the pillars of funk music, James Brown, as a key part of his band. Since going solo in the 1990s, Parker has established himself as a funk icon in his own right. The annual Jazzablanca festival showcases jazz and jazz fusion, attracting musicians from around the globe to Morocco. Last year, crowds totaling 75,000 gathered for a week of festivities in Casablanca, attending concerts in the city’s streets, theaters, and at more intimate venues.

Rabat – One such figure is Fatima bint Muhammad Al-Fihriya (also known as Fatima al-Fihri) who was born from humble beginnings in A.D. 800 in modern-day Tunisia. Al-Fihri is credited with founding Al Quaraouiyine mosque, library, and university in Fez with her own money in A.D. 859, naming the ground-breaking educational institution after her hometown of Qayrawan.  The world’s first university and the first educational institution to award degrees, Al Quaraouiyine is one of the most influential and impressive in history, particularly given the state of societies in the 9th century, as well as the place of women in those societies.  For a North African Muslim woman to establish such an institution, which she opened to people of all ages, social classes, and faiths, is testament to her exceptional vision for her society and her innovative mindset for the ways in which education could be transformed.  The oldest existing and continually operating university, the University of Al Quaraouiyine predates the foundation of all of the world’s most established and impressive educational institutions, including the University of Bologna (1088), the University of Oxford (1096), the University of Salamanca (1243), and Harvard University (1636).  Moreover, terms and concepts associated with higher education are all traceable back to the practices found in Al Quaraouiyine, from obtaining degrees, to wearing tassels and academic robes, to presenting an oral defense, to fellows “reading” subjects.  Al Quaraouiyine’s library is also the oldest in the world, containing a copy of the Qur’an dating back to the 9th century A.D., written in Kufic script on the skin of a camel, as well as thousands of manuscripts from a wide range of fields. It also contains an Arabic version of the Gospel that dates back to the 12th century A.D. As well as having a profound impact on education in the centuries following its foundation, the University of Al Quaraouiyine has drawn countless famous figures throughout history.  In addition to a number of prominent Muslim scholars, the university also attracted prominent Jewish and Christian figures. Andalusi diplomat and geographer Hassan al Wazzan (Leo Africanus), Jewish philosopher Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides), Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes), historiographer and thinker Ibn Khaldun, and Sufi poet and philosopher Ibn Hazm all studied at the university. Medical scholar Ibn Beja, grammarian Ben Ajrum, Dutch Orientalist and mathemetician Jacob van Gool, and Sufi leader Muhammad al-Jazuli, as well as Gerbert of Aurillac (who was Pope from A.D. 999 to 1003 and is credited for introducing the Arabic numerals we use to this day to Europe) were also believed to have studied at Al Quaraouiyine. Free education, training courses, and the quality of the curriculum are some of the aspects of al-Fihri’s legacy that continue to make the University of Al Quaraouiyine a destination for philosophers, scholars, and intellectuals to this day.  The University of Al Quaraouiyine continues to contribute to and enrich scientific and intellectual debates in the fields of language and literature, philosophy, astronomy, and medicine, as well as Islamic law and jurisprudence. The university has particularly contributed to the Maliki school of thought within Islamic jurisprudence. Moreover, in more than one landmark debate, the scholars of the University of Al Quaraouiyine have found themselves on the frontline of political debates. During a time in which medieval European societies were still in darkness, one 9th century Muslim woman had the commitment and the foresight to build a unique place of learning and intellectual advancement that has stood the test of time. The rest of the world has Fatima al-Fihri, the mother of intellectuals, to thank for the immense and far-reaching impact her university had on history.

Rabat – Morocco along with Egypt and Jordan have allegedly confirmed their participation in the US-sponsored economic forum, which will take place in Bahrain on June 25-26. International news outlets, including Saudi news channel Al Arabiya quoted an official from the Trump administration, who confirmed Morocco’s participation. Morocco has not officially confirmed its participation in the forum. The news comes a few weeks after the visit of senior US adviser Jared Kushner to Morocco. Kushner  arrived in Morocco for an official visit, in which he  was received by King Mohammed VI on May 28. The visit was part of Kushner’s tour ahead of Washington’s economic conference, which seeks to encourage investment in Palestinian economy. The conference will not address the political component of the so-called Deal of the Century, which the Trump administration seeks to impose as the only way to end the decades long conflict between Palestine and Israel. Speculations over Morocco’s participation also comes after Morocco denied that it had been informed of the content of Washington’s peace plan to end the Palestine-Israeli conflict.  On June 8, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita said that the Moroccan government does not know yet of “any peace plan for the resolution of the conflict.” “Morocco does not know yet of the content of any peace plan and will express its position when it will be informed about the details of the initiative,” he said. The Moroccan official said that Kushner’s visit aimed to discuss the diplomatic relations between Rabat and Washington and recent developments in the Middle East. Bourita reiterated Morocco’s full support for the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.  The Palestinian Authority has vowed last month that it would  boycott the conference, calling on Arab states to abstain from taking part in the conference. So far, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have confirmed their participation in the Bahrain conference.

Rabat – The city of Alexandria, Virginia, held its official “Morocco Day” at the Market Square on Saturday, June 9. “This is monumental because Alexandria, one of America’s oldest cities, is home to 10,000 Moroccans; it is a great place for entrepreneurship and tourism,” said Justin Wilson, Mayor of Alexandria, Virginia.  Several delegations from the Moroccan embassy and consulate in Washington attended the event.  “Morocco Day” was sponsored by the Moroccan American Network in partnership with Zagora Regional Council. The event featured various entertainments including live music, fashion shows, and handicrafts.  The event highlighted Zagora, a city located in southeastern Morocco’s Draa-Tafilalet region, as a cultural, environmental, and tourist destination for American visitors. “This event organized primarily to encourage small and medium-sized Moroccan businesses that work in the field of Tourism to connect with their American counterparts….”, Mohammed Hajjam, CEO of AVA Actions, a partner of the Moroccan American Network, said. The event paid tribute to Moroccan renowned singer Nouaman Lahlou whose famous song “Zagora El Ghazala” fits the theme of the day.  The Moroccan American Network plans to celebrate twelve other regions of Morocco in the upcoming years.  “We have a road map for twelve regions and we have a great team to do this in the next few years”, Mohammed Hajjam told Morocco World News earlier this year.  The very first official “Morocco Day” was organized on March 29, 2019, at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, D.C.

Rabat – A new agreement between Sweden and Morocco, which enables Swedish border police to match the fingerprints of unaccompanied minors to Morocco’s databases, has revealed that 90% of Moroccan immigrant minors are actually adults.  “When we find their identity, they leave the country and move on to other cities in Europe such as Barcelona or Paris. They do not want the police to know who they are because then they can be punished and be expelled to Morocco,” says Christian Froden, group manager at the border police in Stockholm. The adults who pose as children do so primarily to gain accommodation and care upon their arrival. However, these migrants all have unique stories. One such story is Ali’s, who left Morocco hoping for a better life abroad. Ali arrived in Sweden over a year ago, at age 22. He lied to authorities, saying that he was 16, as he had heard from friends that this was the easiest way to get help from the Swedish authorities.  When he first came to Sweden he was given accommodation and he went to school. He also did an internship at a car repair shop. However, his real age was subsequently revealed using fingerprints identified by Moroccan databases. Now, Ali lives on the street and makes a living with petty crime. Ali told Swedish news outlet SVT Nyheter that life in Sweden was not what Ali had hoped for. He said that he fears being caught and at night he sleeps in the metro or anywhere he can find that is warm and reasonably safe.  By his own admission, he sees “no future” in Sweden and would like to move to Belgium instead, where he has contacts and plans to start a drug-peddling scheme. The fingerprint tests have shown that only ten percent of immigrants claiming to be minors are younger than 18 years of age. Many of the children who previously lived on the streets, whose fingerprints show them to be minors, 8 have been placed in family homes or in other shelters. “Sometimes we have to use forced care to slow down a destructive lifestyle,” says Christian Froden. The number of young people from Morocco seeking asylum in Sweden is decreasing, according to the Swedish Migration Board’s statistics. For the past seven years, a total of 1800 single men from Morocco have applied for asylum in Sweden. But this year, so far only 55 people have applied for asylum, which is 20 percent fewer than during the same period last year.

Rabat – A 37-year-old Moroccan man stabbed a 44-year-old homeless Georgian national in the throat on Saturday, June 8, at Rome’s central Termini station. The victim was wearing a crucifix around his neck. The suspect shouted insults at the Georgian before stabbing him and attempting to slit his throat, Il Giornale reports. The suspect then attempted to flee the scene but only managed to make it a few steps before being detained and arrested. “Everything took place in a few moments,” one witness explained. “The Georgian got off the bus and was heading towards the metro station in Piazza dei Cinquecento on the Via Giolitti side when the Moroccan joined him and attacked him,” he added. The Moroccan man is being accused of attempted homicide with “religious hate” being an “aggravating factor.” The incident caused Italy’s far-right Interior Minister and Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini to increase security measures. In a letter, Salvini called for an “increase [of] checks and attention in places of aggregation of Islamic citizens in order to prevent any type of violence against innocent citizens.” The approach Salvini has taken to increase security measures to counter radical Islam is a controversial topic, with many people arguing that it is discriminatory to single out Muslims for security checks. News of the incident is circulating on anti-terrorism sites alongside a direct quote from the Qu’ran taken out of its context, “When you meet the unbelievers, strike the necks…” (Qur’an 47:4). Giorgia Meloni, leader of the conservative-populist Brothers of Italy made a vitriolic comment against Muslims on social media. In her remark, she said, “If Muslims think of bringing the holy war into our house, it is time to take drastic measures: it remains only to block any kind of Islamic immigration until these ideas are clarified,” she said. Muslims represent the second largest religious community in Italy, with approximately 1.4 million practicing Muslims in 2017 (3,1 percent of the whole Italian population).

Rabat – French authorities have dismantled a neo-Nazi cell allegedly plotting attacks on Muslim and Jewish worship sites in France. The Neo-nazism movement emerged in the post-World War II era, and seeks to revive the far-right ideology of Nazism. French news outlet, France 24, quoted a source close to the investigation, who confirmed the dismantling of the cell. The source said that five members of the cell were “close in ideology to the neo-Nazi movement.”   The source added that the five members were “charged between September and May” in connection with plans for islamophobic and anti-semitic attacks. The investigation found that the cell was “developing an ill-defined plot to carry out an attack, likely to target a place of worship.”  The news outlet said that police first arrested a suspect in the southeastern city of Grenoble on weapons charges in September 2018. The investigation led to four more arrests, including two minors. Counterterrorism agents were tasked with finishing the investigation in January, charging the suspects with terror offences, France 24 said. A report on Islamophobia in France, National  Report 2017, shows that the issue is on the rise. The report showed  that 121 Islamophobic incidents were reported in France in 2017, while 19 Muslim meeting places were shut down by the government.   France has also seen an increased number of cases of anti-Semitic violence. The Time reported that “ nine out of 10 Jewish students said they experienced anti-Semitism at least once during their studies” in France.

Rabat – The panel of speakers included Her Royal Highness Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan, Dr Shible Sahbani (regional adviser on reproductive health, United Nations Population Fund), Dr Daniela Ligiero, executive director and CEO of Together for Girls, Ms Berangere Boell-Yousfi, representative UNFPA, Libya, Ms Fadoua Bakhadda, executive director, Moroccan Family Planning Association, and Ms Ayah Al-Oballi, senior officer at Mercy Corps’ Regional Centre for the Advancement of Adolescent Girls, Jordan. Each of the speakers delved into the double discrimination that Arab women face in the region on account of both conflict and social conservatism. In fact, such is the plight of many Arab women that things like sexual and reproductive health and rights are well beyond their reach. And the reality of conflict-ridden and conflict-affected states means that many Arab women are constantly living in insecurity and being pushed into power-asymmetry situations. Thus the incidents of child marriage and survival sex being reported from places like Syria and refugee camps in Lebanon and Turkey. In this regard, I spoke with one of the panel speakers, Ms Fadoua Bakhadda of the Moroccan Family Planning Association, on women’s issues in Morocco, including those of migrants to the country. Here are the excerpts: What has been the process since Marrakech hosted the Global Forum on Migration and Development last year? Since the migration forum, Morocco has been hosting more and more migrants. It is welcome that the ministry of migration developed PPP (public-private partnerships) actions to respond to this situation. Investing more on migrants’ inclusion and supporting healthcare system for migrants and refugees are the needs of the hour. What is the overall status of Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) in Morocco? Concerning SRHR in Morocco, we do have many challenges. The abortion law is not updated, even if the government launched a reform of it in 2015. The new Gender Based Violence law that just came in at the end of 2018 is not as effective as it should be. Child marriage is still a big challenge. The poor services for women and statistics are alarming. We have a lot of work that remains to be done. The Moudawana was enacted in 2004, what has been the progress and what more needs to be done? Concerning the Moudawana, some good advancements have been made. Now Morocco recognizes the infant of a Moroccan woman as Moroccan, and we are doing fine concerning child rights in the family. However, divorce is still high and many people haven’t understood the Moudawana well, and women are rebelling against everything sometimes. Has the training of female preachers or morchidates contributed to women’s empowerment in Morocco and can they be agents of change for women, especially in rural Morocco? For morchidates, look we do have some ones that are really conservative, but most of them are doing their best to change women’s minds. We still have a lot to do because the education system of those religious leaders is mainly based on religion and some soft skills. They are not well knowledgeable about women’s needs and human rights What are your organization’s future plans? My organization’s future plan is to sustain existing feminist movements in the MENA region to empower women through education, access to SRHR and humanitarian aid.

Rabat – German  industrial machine developer Vitronic, a subsidiary of MENA,  has won a bid to supply Morocco with systems for speed and red light enforcement. The German company announced that it has secured a “notable contract” with Morocco to supply it with 500 traffic control systems. “This is part of the national strategy for traffic safety in the region. Vitronic as a group will implement the project with its local partner, Alomra Group International,” said the press release. The  company will spread the new technology across the twelve regions of the country, as well as its main cities, “such as Casablanca, Rabat, and Marrakech.” The statement added that the company will deploy its laser system technology in the twelve regions for fixed speed enforcement, “average speed enforcement and the monitoring of traffic light intersections.” Commenting on the signed partnership, CEO of MENA,Youssef El Hansali said: “We are very pleased that our systems will contribute significantly to the country’s national traffic safety strategy.”  He added that the project “plays an important role in our company’s strategic focus on the North African market. With the local team at our subsidiary, VITRONIC LLC, and our partner, Alomra, we are ideally positioned in Morocco to support our customers.”  The company will also implement the “superior housing platform, Company City Housing, throughout the country on a  large scale.” Vitronic said that the aim of the technology is to enforce traffic regulations “from an elevated position up to three meters in height.” As part of the agreement, the company will also “equip and staff four service locations in the country to cover the demand for onsite services. An initial three-year maintenance agreement is also an integral part of the contract.” Vitronic recalled that Morocco aims to curb traffic accidents by 50 % by 2026. “Traffic monitoring is a key component for this strategy and both the government and the citizens have been eagerly awaiting improvements to the current traffic system,” added the press release.  In 2018, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced the country’s determination to reduce the number of traffic fatalities as part of the 2017-2026 national road safety strategy. El Othmani said that the strategy seeks to reduce the number of road fatalities by 25% by 2021 and by another 20% by 2026. In 2017, 89,998 total traffic accidents were reported, representing a 10% increase compared to 2016. However, the number of road accidents with fatalities last year was 3,085, which shows a 2.4% decrease from 2016.

Rabat – British actor Orlando Bloom has his dog’s skeleton mounted on a display in his home, as he “can’t let go” of the pooch he adopted while in Morocco. Bloom found the dog, who he named “Sidi,” living on the street while on the set of his 2005 movie “Kingdom of Heaven,” and decided he had to take him home. Sidi passed away 11 years later in September of 2016 from liver cancer. Bloom posted a photo of the mounted display to Instagram with the caption “Man’s best friend…when you can’t let go.” The actor, known for his role in Pirates of the Carribean among other blockbusters, further explained the odd choice to magazine Dog’s Monthly. “He was a great companion and I was very upset when he died. I had his skeleton mounted so that he stays with me,” the 42-year-old actor confided. “I know that sounds a little odd to some people, but it is quite tastefully done and I still get to say goodnight to him,” Bloom added. ‘I’m British and we are a nation of dog lovers,’ Bloom said. ‘But even if I wasn’t British, I would still be an animal lover and especially a dog lover.

Rabat – The House of Representatives unanimously adopted draft law 26.16, which defines the process of adopting Tamazight (Berber) as an official language, its integration into the education system and into Moroccan public life. The draft law, adopted on Monday, was also approved by  the Committee on Education, Culture and Communication at the House of Representatives last Monday, June 3, after several years of consultations and debate. The new draft law confirms that the Tamazight language is to be written in the Tifinagh alphabet, characters specific to written Tamazight. It also stipulates the importance of the integration of Tamazight into the education system and public life. Article 1 of the draft law describes the Tamazight language as the dialects spoken across the country, as well as linguistic and lexical works created by institutions. It also confirms that Tamazight should be  written and read in “Tifinagh.” The second article of the draft law mandates that Tamazight be taught throughout Morocco and across all levels of education. Tamazight was integrated in public primary schools in the July 2011 Constitution and must be considered as an official language along with Arabic. In November 2018, the Ministry of Education reported that  nearly 600,000 primary students had studied Tamazight in the 2018-2019 academic year.  In June of last year, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced the government’s determination to preserve the use of Tamazight in Moroccan schools, emphasizing that teaching Tamazight in primary schools is mandatory.  He added that 4,200 primary schools in Morocco teach Tamazight, while more than 500,000 students study the language. The decision to adopt the draft law comes amid a tense debate between the Moroccan government and Amazigh activists, who condemned Morocco’s decision to cancel an amendment seeking to allow the Bank Al Maghrib to issue Amazigh banknotes and coins. It remains to be seen whether activists will re-open the campaign for Amazigh banknotes now that Tifinagh has become official.  Some Amazigh activists claimed that the decision is a violation of the 2011 constitution. The activists have also expressed concerns regarding a lack of justice with regard to their language and culture.

Rabat – Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) leader Geert Wilders called for a parliamentary inquiry into possible political interference in his trial. The politician is facing an investigation into discrimination and inciting hatred towards people of Moroccan descent. The appeal hearing began last May, but Wilders’ defense had succeeded in getting the judges removed after allegations of bias.  The appeal will resume later this month.  “Opstelten and the former head of the public prosecutor’s office, Herman Bolhaar, could be on the witness list,” Dutch News concludes. Dutch News, RTL television Nieuws and the Telegraaf newspaper both reported that there was contact between the minister of justice, Ivo Opstelten, and the head of the public prosecutor’s office in 2014. “Opstelten wanted to see Wilders prosecuted for leading the anti-Moroccan chants at a pre-election meeting.” RTL television Nieuws and Telegraaf newspaper reported. The current Minister of Justice, Ferd Grapperhaus, refuses to send documents to Parliament detailing the meetings between the two Dutch officials, claiming that there is “no (formal) indication of interference” from his predecessor. “These documents, prepared as briefings for the minister, will remain secret because of the confidential information they contain,” the Minister of Justice told the deputies. The case of “Fewer Moroccans” dates back to 2014, when Wilders asked a room full of supporters of his political party if they wanted to see “more or less” Moroccans in the country. When the crowd shouted “Less!”, Wilders replied, “We’re taking care of it.” In December 2016, Wilders was found guilty of inciting discrimination and the panel of three judges said Wilders’ comments were “humiliating and insulting to the Moroccan population.”  However, the court decided not to impose a fine or to sentence Wilders on the grounds that a criminal conviction was in itself a sufficient punishment.

Rabat –  Moroccan police in Tangier have arrested  an Indian national suspected of mediating irregular migration and human trafficking operations in Morocco. The suspect, who was arrested on Saturday, has been residing in Morocco illegally, according to a statement from the General Directorate of National Security  (DGSN) released yesterday, June 10. The statement added that the police arrested the suspect in a flat which he rented and used to house 10 irregular migrants from Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan. Preliminary investigations show that the suspect has received a cash amounts ranging from $1,000 and $7,000 dollars from the migrants in exchange for help reaching Europe. Police placed the suspect in custody for further investigation into links to a criminal network. The arrest is in line with Morocco’s strategy to crackdown on irregular migration attempts.  Moroccan law enforcement has carried out several similar operations throughout the year. One of the latest operations was conducted in May, when police in Rabat arrested  a sub-Saharan woman for her alleged links with an irregular migration network. Police in Asilah, northern Morocco also arrested a Malian national suspected of facilitating irregular migration and human trafficking operations in May. According to the Moroccan government, security services have thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, compared to 88,761 of foiled attempts in 2018. The European Union have granted Morocco €140 million to support the country’s efforts in reducing undocumented migration into Europe.

Rabat – Morocco’s Minister of Interior Abdelouafi Laftit announced on Monday that the number of people who filled in the census forms to perform the military service has reached 133,820. The Ministry of Interior announced the launch of a period of military conscriptions in April, with registrations ending on June 7.  During this period, according to Laftit, 133,80 people have filled in the census forms, including 13,614 female volunteers. The minister said that regional committees across Morocco will hold meetings starting June 17 to consolidate the lists of citizens who have chosen to register. Before the end of June, the central committee will also hold a meeting to set specific criteria for the selection of conscripts chosen to perform the military service for the year 2019, added the ministry. The number of people who filled the census forms exceed the number required by the ministry. The department currently aim to recruit a total of 10,000 Moroccans into the service and will select recruits from the 133,820 who registered. In response to the call to military service, young people aged 19 to 25 were invited to fill the census form on the website tajnid.ma upon receipt of a notice from local administrative authorities. The statistics shared by the Ministry of Interior starkly contrast with the heavy criticism that the government received when it announced the return of obligatory military service.  Some Moroccans expressed concerns that = military service would single out people from the lower and middle classes.  In 2018, however, the government rejected the claims,  assuring the public that the law will apply to citizens from all social classes. In August 2018, the Royal Cabinet said that the compulsory “military service aims to promote patriotism among the young, within the framework of the correlation between the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.” With this aim, the law is seen as a way to encourage loyalty to the state among young people. The reintroduction of obligatory military service in Morocco, which came under King Mohammed VI’s instructions, is in line with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution. The article  emphasizes that all citizens should contribute to the defense of the homeland and its territorial integrity. Before the reintroduction of the program, Moroccans were subject to 18-month military service in accordance with Royal Decree 137-66 in 1966.  In 1999, however, Morocco reduced the length of service to 12 months and abolished mandatory service completely in 2006. People with financial dependents or disabilities will be exempted from the military service. However, people over the age of 25 who were previously exempted can still be called up until the age of 40 if the reason for their exemption is no longer relevant.

Rabat – The autonomous city of Ceuta has been upgrading its security system at the border with Morocco, as planned by the Spanish ministry of interior. According to El Confidencial, a Spanish news outlet, the ministry replaced 41 DOMOS cameras and 11 fixed cameras and installed 14 new technical cameras as well as a more modern CCTV control platform. The facial recognition system, whose launch date has not yet been announced, will be installed in both Ceuta and Melilla as a way to fast-track border control and increase security. The interesting change is Ceuta’s plan to remove concertina wires while Morocco is building its new wire fences. Morocco’s new fence is a result of the agreements reached with the European Union that included a €140 million investment to control migration. However, according to El Confidential, Morocco began building concertina wires before receiving the EU funding. Khalid Zerouali, director of Immigration and Border Surveillance of the Moroccan Interior Ministry, said: “it is part of a project to reinforce Moroccan security measures in the Mediterranean over 1,000 kilometers.” The Immigration director described the project as “the outcome of an analysis that began in 2016 when we had identified some improvements which we are now incorporating.”

Rabat – Billionaire Zara founder Amancio Ortega has been accused of exploiting workers in Morocco. In 2017, Zara workers in Istanbul entered a store to attach notes to the clothes, saying, “I made this item you are going to buy, but I didn’t get paid for it.” This year, an NGO discovered that the Spanish business owner reportedly pays the seamstresses who make the garments as little as €178 a month for up to 65 hours a week. A Spanish NGO called Clean Clothes Campaign investigated the living conditions and wages that Ortega’s textile workers endure.  His company, Inditex, covers many popular brand names including Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, Pull &amp; Bear, and Zara. Spain has been a solid partner for Moroccan clothing exports since 2006 and 10% of all Inditex clothes are made in Morocco. Once a shop hand for a local shirtmaker himself, Amancio Ortega now has a net worth of approximately 60.3 billion dollars. The NGO author Albert Sale said the retailer “operates in the Moroccan market taking advantage of production costs clearly lower than those of the European Union and geographical proximity.” Younger workers work without contracts and receive 0.36 cents per hour. The report revealed that the harsh conditions Moroccan garment workers face include excessive hours of work with low wages and physical abuse. The report said: “These companies have in their hands the ability, both to generate situations of labor exploitation, and to avoid them.” A  worker gave his testimony for the study: “When auditors appear by surprise, supervisors hide minor workers on the roof or in empty clothing boxes.” In light of the abuse that has been recently reported, it seems to be contradictory that Ortega once uttered the esteemed quote:  “The successful combination of intense expansion and renewed business efficiency has only been possible through the immense effort of our team at all levels of the organization.” El Corte Ingles and Mango were also called out for using exploitative Moroccan based suppliers.

Rabat – In the Marrakech-Safi region, students taking their regional Baccalaureate exam were surprised to find an error in the French test. The test, which was supposed to be an extract from Victor Hugo’s “The Last Day of a Condemned Man,” included in its last paragraph 3 lines from another novel, “The Box of Wonders” by Ahmed Sefrioui. The discovery soon raised a wave of confusion and protest amongst students and administrative officials. As a response, the Regional Academy of Education and Training issued a statement confirming that “the French exam took place in good circumstances.”  However, the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) in Nador requested the opening of an investigation into this “serious pedagogical error” which “indicates the lack of attentiveness in the making and revision of Baccalaureate exams.”

Rabat – After Sudanese military forces shot demonstrators on Monday, June 3, in an attempt to break up a longstanding sit-in outside the military headquarters in the capital, opposition groups have urged supporters to take part in a civil disobedience campaign. These attacks marked a turning point in the standoff between protesters and the military which had previously been tense but remained peaceful. Starting yesterday, June 9, opposition groups told supporters to stay home, changing their tactics to civil disobedience while continuing to pressure the transitional military council (TMC) to step aside for a civilian-led government. “The civil disobedience movement will begin on Sunday and end only when a civilian government announces itself in power on state television,” said the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), responsible for organizing many of the recent demonstrations. A change in the Capital’s environment followed the change in opposition tactics. For weeks, protesters have filled the streets of Khartoum – now much of public transportation is not operating and most commercial banks, private companies, and markets are closed, though some state banks and public utility offices remain open. Since the civil disobedience campaign began yesterday, paramilitary groups have killed at least four people in efforts to suppress it, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors (CCSD). After last Monday’s crackdown, talks between the TMC and the opposition fell apart. Opposition leaders’ calls for civil disobedience came after Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was accepted as a mediator, met with representatives from both sides on Friday, June 7.
In accepting Ahmed’s mediation, the protesters demanded the TMC take responsibility for Monday’s attack and begin an internal investigation into the violence. The TMC said the actions of military and Rapid Support Forces, blamed for the attack, were “restoring life back to normal,” and that protesters broke the law by creating barricades in roads. After meeting with Ahmed, three leading members of the opposition were arrested, complicating the possibility of negotiating a solution. Ethiopia is in a unique position to mediate conflict because of its previous neutrality in the issue and significant political influence in the AU, which has suspended Sudan’s membership until a civilian government is in place. Sudanese civilians first took to the streets to protest rising costs of bread and fuel last December. They later called for the end of Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year rule, al-Bashir was then replaced by the TMC April 11.

Rabat – El Baraka Angels, an NGO dedicated to helping the most disadvantaged members of Moroccan society, distributed iftar meals to the needy of Rabat this Ramadan for the 4th consecutive year in a row. This month, the NGO handed out 3600 iftar (first meal after sundown) meal packs, with each pack containing all the essentials for a filling Ramadan meal – Moroccan bread and cheese, m’semen (Moroccan pancakes), orange juice and water, dates and chebakia (Moroccan pastries), and boiled eggs. While the NGO would usually launch fundraisers to fund the initiative, this year there was no need as they were instead approached by generous companies willing to help out. Centrale Laitiere, Sidi Ali, and Credit du Maroc were among the companies to donate goods. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the team of El Baraka Angels took to the streets of Rabat to distribute 300 packs. Selwa Zine, the founder of the NGO, is always hands-on in helping out the groups many volunteers. The Ramadan food drive in Rabat is but one of many of the El Baraka Angels’ initiatives to combat poverty in Morocco. On top of the sponsors, the NGO receives help from a rotating cast of volunteers touched by the cause. Last Wednesday, the staff of the Australian Embassy and its ambassador, HE Berenice Owen-Jones, visited the center to pack the 300 iftar meals before taking to the streets of Rabat to hand them out. Speaking to Morocco World News, Owen-Jones spoke of the experience. “It is so easy to live in a bubble, and not realize that there are people in your own city that are struggling. Working with El Baraka Angels in Rabat was a real eye opener for me. Coming face to face with those in need in my own city as I handed out the packs, made me realize I can no longer be indifferent,” the ambassador said. Zine founded the NGO in 2013 after she was deeply touched by the death of an infant in the village of Anfgou, a remote village in the Middle Atlas where temperatures drop as low as -16 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit). With such temperatures, the locals are often unequipped to cope. The remote mountainous region around Anfgou suffers from a crippling lack of infrastructure, with many roads impassable in the winter months. Residents often complain of having to transport basic supplies by mule for long distances along icy roads. Since then, El Baraka Angels has been delivering aid packages to the most economically disadvantaged parts of Morocco during the coldest times of the year – not an easy feat. The packages include 42 kg (93 lbs) of basic food and non-perishables, blankets and warm clothing for adults and children. This year, El Baraka Angels turned its attention to the abandoned and handicapped children of Taza, a small city in eastern Morocco. The NGO donates warm clothes, toys, milk, as well as other food items. Volunteers also took the time to interact with the children, playing with them and feeding them. Thanks to extremely generous donations through Facebook, El Baraka Angels was also able to donate essential equipment and resources to schools, to a retirement home, and to a homeless shelter within the region. El Baraka Angels’ hard work is carried out by 26 dedicated members, who vary in age and background but have one common goal: to fight for those who need the most support. The members of El Baraka Angels, in return, get to be part of something incredibly rewarding. One El Baraka’s 26 members, Ahmed Nejjar, spoke to Morocco World News about his 4 years of experience volunteering with the NGO. “Having already volunteered with many caritative associations in the past, I was surprised by the professionalism at El Baraka Angels, and the desire in each member’s eyes driven by the leadership and hard work of our president Mrs Selwa Zine,” Nejjar said of the association. “I derive great satisfaction and happiness when I participate in caravans and social aid. When you volunteer at El Baraka Angels, you are not there to put on airs. You feel like a superhero, and most importantly you learn that we can not be indifferent,” Nejjar continued. “We cannot be indifferent” is the motto of the NGO, and speaks volumes to their determination not to turn a blind eye to the most disadvantaged members of Moroccan society.

The  coordination of the medical students  announced that the strike and boycott were 100 % successful.

Rabat – Moroccan police arrested a gang of three suspects accused of armed robbery against sub-Saharan migrants. Migrants planning undocumented journeys to Europe often use the Rahrah forest and Boukhalef in Tangier as a place to rest before continuing to Europe. The migrants involved in the attack were waiting in the Rahrah forest when he three knife-wielding suspects, aged 19, 25, and 34, assaulted and robbed them of their personal possessions. Morocco is under pressure to curb irregular migrants entering Europe through Spain. According to migration and border control chief, Khalid Zerouali, more than 7,000 people have managed to reach Spain from Morocco in 2019 so far, compared to around 2,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Morocco and Spain are collaborating to stop the flow of irregular migrants into Europe. Elena Garzón, the General Director of International Relations and Immigration of the Ministry of the Interior, and the head of the General Commissariat of Foreigners and Borders, Juan Enrique Taborda, have demanded that Brussels fund Morocco with “Promised” 140 million “as soon as possible”, according to Spain’s newspaper El Pais.  In 2019 Morocco has already prevented more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts and dismantled 50 trafficking networks.

Rabat – As Muslims woke up to the news of Israeli forces breaking into the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, two mosques in the German cities of Kassel and Bremen witnessed acts of wanton vandalism on Saturday and Sunday, June 8-9.  The perpetrators broke into the Bremen mosque and ripped up 50 copies of the Qur’an. According to the Dutch news agency DutchTurks, the first witness on the scene following the incident found dozens of copies of the Qur’an thrown into the Bremen mosque’s toilets. Another mosque in the city of Kassel also witnessed an attack, where the perpetrators broke windows, leaving the place in ruins. It remains unclear how many vandals were involved as the suspects have not yet been identified. Seyfettin Eryörük, chairman of Kassel Central Mosque Foundation, said that the suspects had thrown rocks at the mosque, shattering two windows. As investigations into the incident by the Kassel Prosecutor’s Office are underway, local authorities stated that the unidentified perpetrator stormed the mosque on Saturday at around 2 p.m-4 p.m. when the mosque is usually open to the public. Likely driven by religious or political hatred, the attack speaks to the recent rise of Islamophobia in Germany, where dozens of mosques faced similar attacks every year. Islam IQ, a German-speaking news outlet on issues pertaining to Islam, has reported an alarming number of mosques being vandalized in recent years.  It reported that between 2015 and 2019, there have been 139 cases of attacks on Islamic places of worship, which included vandalism, acts of defacing, graffiti, fire, and pig heads. To document the incidents, Islam IQ marked every mosque attacked on a map, with descriptions of the individual incidents. Muslims living in the cities have expressed indignation at the incidents, calling on authorities to take immediate action against anti-Islam rhetoric.  The attacks follow an incident that took place less than two weeks ago when a man stabbed a 16-year-old in Bremen city. The attack was religiously motivated as the perpetrator launched into anti-Islam slur before carrying out the stabbing.

Rabat – Algeria’s former prime minister, Ahmed Ouyahia, along with other senior officials, was summoned on Sunday, June 9, by an investigating judge of the Algiers court for ‘granting privileges’ to the owner of a car assembly plant. The courthouse has not disclosed whether the former prime minister is implicated in the affair or was called up as a witness, according to Maghreb Arab Press Agency (MAP). Ouyahia was previously summoned on April 30 for ‘squandering public funds and undue advantages.” Since the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, several wealthy businessmen have been held in custody for benefiting from government contracts through their links with senior Algerian officials. Despite Bouteflika’s resignation and a wave of corruption eradication, the peaceful protests of the past 16 weeks continue.  Algerian protesters demand a radical change of the whole “corrupt system,” which would include the dismissal of every official from the Bouteflika’s era.

Rabat – Hundreds of Israeli settlers, escorted by Israeli forces, again broke into the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on Sunday, resulting in a backlash and frustration among Palestinians. Palestinian news agency WAFA  reported that 3300 Israeli settlers entered the compound through the “Moroccan Gate, which leads to the Al Aqsa Buraq Wall plaza inside the Old City of Jerusalem.” The news agency added that the settlers regularly  access the area and often perform Jewish prayers on the site, which is where they believe the Second Temple once stood. “Some right-wing Israeli activists have advocated for the destruction of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound to make way for a Third Temple,” added WAFA. Palestinian authorities strongly condemned the Israeli move against the sacred site.  Undersecretary of Palestinian Religious Affairs Ministry, Husam Abu Al-ob, addressed the international community, asking for the end of the “incursions” by the Israeli settlers. “He said in a statement that “Jerusalem will remain Islamic and the occupation will not deprive it of its identity no matter what it does.” This is not the first time that Israeli forces and settlers have accessed the third holiest site in Islam. On June 2, Israeli security forces assaulted Palestinian worshipers at the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound when they accessed the site with hundreds of Jewish settlers to mark what they call the “reunification of Jerusalem” . Spokesman of the Palestinian President Nabil Abu Rudeineh scondemned the attack, accusing Israel of escalation in the region. “We hold the Israeli occupation government fully responsible for the serious of escalations in Al-Aqsa Mosque as a result of continuing incursions and attacks on worshippers by extremist settlers under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces,”  he said. The official also called on the international community to “shoulder its responsibilities in this regard and pressure Israel to stop this policy.

Rabat – The World Wide Fund for Nature  (WWF) released its latest report on Friday, June 7, giving notice of the dangers facing the Mediterranean Sea on the occasion of the World Ocean Day, celebrated on June 8. In a 46-page report, the WWF has sounded the alarm of the ecological degeneration awaiting marine life over the next three decades as plastic waste is on the rise due to the failure of waste management policies.  The report shows that 0.57 million tonnes of plastic (33.800 bottles per minute) enter Mediterranean waters every year. According to WWF, the Mediterranean region ranks fourth largest in terms of plastic production, with plastic waste standing at 24 million tons each year. The high level of plastic production is driven mainly by tourism. Studying 22 Mediterranean countries, the report claims that the alarming rate at which pollution grows is due to mismanagement of waste by Mediterranean countries, which ends up either illegally dumped in open areas or buried in landfills. Morocco’s Waste Management In 2016, the report indicates, Morocco’s mismanaged waste stood at 0.43 million tons, representing 1.2 % of the overall 17.5 million tons the region produces. Another issue faced by Morocco lies in the volumes of imported waste it receives. However, Morocco remains relatively low compared to countries like Egypt, which appears first on the list of countries with a high rate of waste mismanagement and accounts for 43.1% of waste.  Italy, which tops the list for plastic production, generates 21% of the overall 37.81 million tons of waste produced. The WWF notes that Morocco, along with France, Croatia, Italy, Tunisia, Greece, and Turkey, has taken a positive step by banning the production, sale, and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags in 2015. With more than 40% of its waste production dumped, Morocco, unlike France, Italy and Greece, imposes no landfill and waste dumping taxes. WWF recommends waste dumping taxes, saying it is an “effective method to financially disincentivize landfills as waste management option.” The future of the Mediterranean marine life The organization notes that the bulk of the plastic waste, which is estimated at 247 billion pieces littered at sea, is expected to quadruple by 2050, taking its toll on aquatic wildlife, natural systems, and marine food chains.  Furthermore, the report also shows that 80% of the marine plastic in the Mediterranean will find its way back to land within a decade. This will contaminate the coastlines and have a more damaging effect on the so-called Blue Economy (tourism, maritime trade, and fisheries), which represents 6% of the region’s GDP. Tourism, which makes up three-quarters of the current Mediterranean Sea economy, maritime trade, and fisheries currently lose an estimated $641 million each year. Addressing the root causes of growing plastic pollution, the organization asserts that the plastic life-cycle results from failure to hold accountable parties responsible.  This failure can be attributed to a combination of plastic production companies, citizens’ neglectful use of plastic, waste collection services, and waste treatment companies; all of which, account for the growing threat to marine life. To tackle plastic pollution causes, the WWF suggests that governments push ahead for new strategies to create systematic solutions through imposing strict laws, such as Extended Plastic Responsibility (EPR), impose bans on plastic use, waste collection, impose taxes on landfilling and on open dumping.

Rabat – According to Spanish Federation of Associations of Fruit, Vegetable, Flower, and Live Plant Producers-Exporters (FEPEX), Morocco is taking the lead as Spain’s main non-European supplier of fruit and vegetables.  FEPEX data shows that the overall cost of vegetables and fruits exported to Spain accounts for $299 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2019. Based on estimates from the Spanish Directorate of Customs, imports have increased significantly over the previous years, with this year’s overall imports rising by 4 percent compared to last year’s first quarter. Morocco’s exports in the first quarter of 2019 represent 33 percent of Spain’s total vegetable and fruit imports, the same source notes. Spain is experiencing an upward trend in terms of overall imports from Morocco, which rose by 11 percent between January and March 2019, with an estimated 137,760 tons. The Federation highlighted that Morocco has registered a marked growth over the last five years, from 70,420 tons in 2015 to 137,670 tons in 2019, representing a 95.5 percent growth. In terms of revenue, imports rose from $141 million to $299 million between the first quarter of 2015 and 2019, representing a 110 percent increase. The report shows, however, France as the leading European supplier to Spain in terms of vegetables and fruits in the first quarter of 2019, with a total of 295,565 tons estimated at $131 million, compared to, 128.7 million euros in 2012. In 2016, the figure increased to 413.3 million euros spent on Moroccan produce.  Morocco also stands out as the fourth largest tomato exporter worldwide, according to the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), representing 7% of the world’s total.

Rabat – In a standoff deemed a “tech Cold War,” Huawei secured a contract with Russia‘s MTS network operator this week in order to develop a 5G network over the coming year. Russian sovereign wealth fund says US allegations that Huawei poses a national security threat are unproven and unfair. The head of Russia ’s sovereign investment fund has now urged the US to back-up those claims. Speaking to CNBC’s Geoff Cutmore at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said the US had failed to provide evidence that Huawei actually brings a security risk.  Dmitriev was asked if he had concerns about Chinese surveillance. “First of all, it has not been proven. We need to have some really clear evidence and I’m sure our people will look into this and, if it happens, it will not be the case,” Dmitriev said.  “But, what we are concerned about is allegations like this are thrown in without any proof and used for unfair practices,” he added. The new agreement between Russia and Huawei could improve predictions saying that the Chinese company won’t do well on the market this year, as a result of missed business opportunities with the US. Huawei has already “downgraded its forecast for total smartphone shipments in the second half of 2019 by about 20% to 30% from the previous estimate,” according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review that cited “a source familiar with Huawei smartphone orders.”  The company has also “reduced or canceled orders to major suppliers for components that go into its smartphones and telecom equipment,” according to the report. Some of the supply chain reductions “included cuts to orders of as much as 30%.” This is one of the consequences from the U.S. blacklist on Huawei’s supply chain, which as Forbe’s Zak Doffman, who’s been closely following the issue says, “is hitting much harder and faster than anyone expected.” Despite Huawei maintaining its number two spot for global smartphone sales in the first quarter of 2019, it was expected to struggle for the remainder of the year before Russia signed. Google and Huawei Google is reportedly urging the Trump administration to lift the ban that would prevent them from doing business with Huawei, also citing security concerns. Google has warned Washington of potential risks to U.S. national security should Huawei Androids not have Google apps installed on them. After the US government placed Huawei on the blacklist that restricted it from trading with US companies, Google accordingly restricted Huawei’s access to its Android operating system. Huawei would then be allowed to use an open-source version of Android, but that means its phones will not come pre-loaded with Google apps like Google Play Protect, which is a security feature. Google Play and other Google apps would also be missing from the Huawei devices. According to Google, allowing Huawei to run its own version of Android is a security issue, The Verge reports, citing Financial Times. Google Play Protect runs safety checks on apps, checks for malware-laden apps, removes harmful apps, and warns about high-risk apps. Without it, Google says, Huawei phones will be “more at risk of being hacked, not least by China.” However, to resolve this issue, Huawei might create its own operating system (OS). Last month, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s business consumer group, said a Huawei-made OS could be produced by spring 2020 at the latest. The OS would be compatible with smartphones, PCs, tablets, TVs, cars, and wearables, and also be compatible with Android apps. Huawei allegedly still prefers to use Android or Windows, though. Trump responded to Google’s concerns. “We are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else,” Trump said during a joint press conference in London on June 4. “We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. This is a truly great ally and partner and we will have no problem with that.” “There are genuine national security risks at play in Huawei’s battle with Washington. But there is also the backdrop of a world that is dividing technologically.” Doffman from Forbes.  “The real issue, though, is that a Chinese alternative to the world’s most popular smartphone OS risks disrupting the global smartphone ecosystem.” “Huawei is too important to China for China to let it fail,” Doffman says. The US’s accusations are contagious Though Russia has called out the US for circulating unchecked allegations that Huawei jeopardizes national security, the UK’s Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) Oversight Board differs. The HCSEC issued a report which said that it “continued to identify concerning issues in Huawei’s approach to software development bringing significantly increased risk to U.K. operators.” However, Huawei seems to be negotiating negative remarks. “We are willing to sign no-spy agreements with countries,” Huawei Chairman Liang Hua told reporters in Shenzhen when asked if the company is open to having an agreement about surveillance with the U.S. The same agreement had been offered to both the UK and Germany. “Since the U.S. has not bought from us,” Huawei’s Chairman Liang told reporters, “is not buying from us, and might not buy from us in the future, I don’t know if there is such an opportunity to sign such an agreement.” Regardless, the Technical Director of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre criticized Huawei technology as “shoddy.” In the 2019 report, the U.K.’s Huawei evaluation center also claimed the company failed to make improvements since the time of last year’s report. Despite the US’s many allegations about Huawei, outgoing Prime Minister May eventually allowed Huawei into parts of its 5G network. The decision sparked backlash from the US. Teresa May is due to soon step down as PM, and it is possible that her replacement will overturn the Huawei decision.  The European Union, on the other hand, advised member countries to “proceed with caution,” meaning countries should conduct their own risk assessments of the 5G equipment and then to decide what’s best.

Rabat – A video has been going viral on social media showing a confrontation between an Algerian man and the former Algerian Minister of Defense Khaled Nezzar. The confrontation started when an Algerian man at the Paris Orly Airport started insulting the former defense minister, accusing him of “killing people.”  In the video, the Algerian man says, “ you have slaughtered people, what are you doing in France.” The former minister attempted to ignore the man. However, after he continued persisting and following him, the former minister attacked him with his crutch. The date when the video was filmed is not determined, but the video has been going viral since Friday. On May 2019,Anadolu Agency cited on a book written by professor Philip Naylor, in which Ali Hussein Kafi, an “Algerian politician who became chairman of the High Council of the State and acting president from 1992 to 1994,”  heavily criticized Nezzar’s former service when he was a defense minister. “He even accused Nezzar of infiltrating the ruling National Liberation Front on behalf of France. The Nezzar-appointed junta reimposed martial law and tortured, murdered, and killed thousands extra-judicially,” said the Turkish news outlet.

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied being informed of the content of the US Peace Plan for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, known as the Deal of the Century. The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, said that the government does not know yet of “any peace plan for the resolution of the conflict.” Bourita made his statement during a joint press conference with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian, who has been on an official visit to Morocco since June 7. “Morocco does not know yet of the content of any peace plan and will express its position when it will be informed about the details of the initiative,” Bourita said.  The statement comes after the visit of US senior adviser Jared Kushner on May 28. During the visit, news reports suggested that the visit aimed to seek support for the US-led Middle East Peace Plan. Bourita, however, said that the recent visit of Kushner touched on “bilateral relations and developments in the Middle East.” He also added that the visit served as an opportunity for Morocco and King Mohammed VI to emphasize the country’s “well-known’ positions on the issue, referring to Morocco’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause. Le Drian also joined Bourita to say that his country has not been informed yet of the content of the Deal of the Century. He added that Rabat and Paris have “identical” stances on the situation in the Middle East.

Rabat – French Foreign Affairs Minister  Jean-Yves Le Drian has said that Morocco most visas from France after China. Le Drian made the statement during his visit to Rabat on Saturday to meet with his counterpart Nasser Bourita to discuss bilateral relations between Morocco and France. The minister said that France has never issued as many visas to Moroccan citizens as it did last year. Le Drian said that “more than 400,000 Moroccans received visas to France from French consulates across Morocco in 2018.” The number makes Morocco the second  country that receives “most visas from France, after China.” Le Drian said that the increase is “very significant” as it shows the “attractiveness” of diplomatic ties between Paris and Rabat. “It is rather good news for our relationship, but it must be managed as best as possible,” he said. The number shared by Le Drian, however, contradicts figures from the French Ministry of Interior. The ministry states that Moroccans only received 334,016 visas in 2018, making the North African country the third country to receive most visas from France after China and Russia. The French official reassured Moroccan citizens  that the visa fee for France has not increased, adding that his country is subject to “European regulations.” In addition to the visa discussion, Le Drian also praised the business relations between Morocco and France. He recalled that more than 900 French companies are directly or indirectly operating in Morocco, creating “thousands of job opportunities.” “We have a will to continue together in a real partnership, which was singularly illustrated at the inauguration of the LGV [high-speed train],” Le Drian said. He referred to the visit of President Emmanuel Macron, who inaugurated Africa’s first LGV with King Mohammed VI in November 2019. Le Drian also announced that both countries will convene a high-level meeting, which is expected to take place in the upcoming fall of 2019. French institutions ready to help youth In addition to business and visa discussions, Le Drian also pledged his country’s interest in helping Morocco to curb unemployment among youth. Le Drian said that French higher education institutions in Morocco are ready to “engage in joint work with Moroccan authorities to provide young Moroccans with education and job opportunities.” The minister added that this partnership would further contribute to strengthening of the Franco-Moroccan relations. In the press conference with Le Drian, Bourita said that the official visit is part of the “ongoing dialogue” between the two countries.  Bourita said that the Rabat-Paris partnership is based on a determination at the highest level between King Mohammed VI and President Emmanuel Macron, who “always stressed the importance of consolidating the achievements of this partnership.”

Rabat – Serious vandalism and acts of violence erupted before the final game of the Algerian Football Cup between CR Belouizdad and JSM Bejaia at the Mustapha-Tchaker stadium in Blida, Algeria on Saturday. Football fans, according to Algerian news outlet TSA, threw projectiles at the official stand, where officials from the government were sitting to attend the final game. However,  acts of vandalism forced the officials to leave before the start of the final. Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui were among the officials forced to leave the stadium. The football fans were chanting anti-government slogans, including “assassin power.” Algeria has been facing a wave of protests against the former and current government. The protests erupted before the resignation of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika condemning his decision to bid for a fifth term. Despite his resignation, protesters continued their demonstrations against the interim government, calling on all the Bouteflika- government elites to leave. Protesters are also condemning the military interference in political affairs, demanding the resignation of army chief Gaid Salah. Friday, June 7, marked the 16 weeks of continuous protests, with the interim president deploying security troops into the peaceful demonstrations. Many arrests were made throughout the weeks of protests.  Despite crackdowns on peaceful protests, protesters have been going to boycott the July 4 election, which was later canceled by the Algerian Constitutional Council due to the absence of “valid candidates.” Following the council’s decision,  Bensalah urged civil society and political parties to engage in an “inclusive dialogue” to overcome the crisis that the country has been facing. Bensalah said that dialogue would help fix a new date for elections as soon as possible” after the cancelation of the planned election on July 4.

Rabat – The conference is convened by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) as a “bold” measures are “urgently” needed to address the fisheries issues, a press release from the GFCM announced. The statement shared with Morocco World News said that the conference in Marrakechseeks to renew “commitments made under the MedFish4Ever declaration.” Sixteen Mediterranean riparian countries signed the declaration in 2017, including Morocco. As a key fisheries exporter, Morocco was among the signatories of the declaration, which aims to save the Mediterranean fish stocks and to “protect the region’s ecological and economic wealth.” The declaration acknowledged that despite common efforts, the future of fisheries in the region is “at stake.” The issue, according to the declaration, is “putting pressure on our fishermen as sub-optimal yields become an increasing threat to employment, further jeopardizthe ing stability of food supply and regional security.” The Marrakech event aims to serve as a platform, where the signatures can renew their commitments made in the declaration. “Despite the progress made so far, there’s still a lot more work needed to secure long-term sustainability for Mediterranean fisheries,” said the GFCM statement. The press release added that the symposium will discuss measures on how to improve working conditions in the industry, as well as  on “fighting illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing”  “MedFish4Ever recognizes that coastal communities need to be protected against the risks and uncertainties that come from being reliant on fishing, and the conference will seek to identify ways of combating poverty, reducing marginalization and promoting resilient livelihoods. The role of women in the industry is currently under particular scrutiny. They need recognition and support.” The statement acknowledged that the industry has been playing a crucial role in serving as a lever for employment as well as a key food source, providing food and jobs across the region and strengthening the social fabric of countless communities.” The statement added that some 250, 000 people are “directly employed on fishing boats, along with many hundreds of thousands who work in the industry and its supply chains on shore.” Dozens of delegations and representatives from the countries, which signed the declaration are expected to convene in Marrakech to attend the symposium.

Rabat – Saudi Arabia intends to execute the boy, who just turned 18, for having taken part in a protest as documented in video footage acquired by CNN. At the age of 10, the young boy, Murtaja Qureiris, staged a protest demanding human rights along with 30 other children. Qureiris, who was the leader of the group of children, lifted a megaphone and shouted, “the people demand human rights!” At the age of 13, the boy was arrested by Saudi border authorities on the King Fahd Causeway, as he was traveling with his family. At that age, lawyers and activists considered him as the youngest known political detainee in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia detained Qureiris for almost four years in pre-trial detention and is now intending to execute him, reported CNN.  Saudi authorities charged him and his brother, Ali Qureiris, with allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at a police station in the eastern Saudi city of Awamiya He was prosecuted by a terrorism court which accused him of belonging to an extremist terror group, committing acts of violence during protests, shooting at security forces, according to CNN. Qureiris denied the accusations and said that Saudi authorities obtained his confessions under duress. At 11 years old, Qureiris witnessed his brother’s death during a protest. In a  video footage obtained by CNN, mourners during Ali’s funeral chanted anti-government slogans. Saudi authorities also jailed his father last year. One of his brothers has also been jailed. CNN has learned that Saudi Authorities are seeking to crucify or dismember Qureiris after execution as part of applying the severest form of the death penalty. Previously, Saudi Arabia has told the United Nations that it does not impose the death penalty on people who committed crimes before the age of criminal responsibility, which is 18-years-old. This may explain why Saudi authorities have kept the young boy in pre-trial detention for almost four years. Obtaining confessions under duress  In 2016, the UN Working Group for Arbitrary Detention brought up the case of a detained Saudi minor. The group did not disclose the boy’s name but his information matched the details CNN collected about Qureiris. On November of the same year, the group said during its 77th session, that the minor’s confessions were obtained via torture and that his arrest was arbitrary. The group finds the boy’s detention violated international norms. It said that the boy was arrested for participating in peaceful demonstrations calling for justice for protestors who were killed.  UK-based Saudi activist, Mohammad Daman, echoed the group’s statement, adding that Saudi Arabia has not presented a video or photographic evidence of the violence committed during the protest. Daman told CNN that Saudi authorities consider anti-government protests in the Saudi Eastern Province as violent, claiming that protestors attack both security and civilians.

Rabat –  On Saturday, teachers supervising the regional baccalaureate exam found three phones in the possession of Moroccan parliamentarian Noureddine Kchibel.  Phones are banned in exams rooms as they could be used for cheating. Kchibl, who is a member of the Development and Justice Party (PJD), denied that he was carrying the phones to cheat. In a statement, the parliamentarian said: “I headed this morning to Al Irfan secondary school in Rabat, and I entered the institution like the rest of the students. I joined room 2 to take the French exam. After 20 minutes, I was surprised that the headmaster of the school who was accompanied by other people came to me directly and started searching for me.” He added that the headmaster of the school asked him for his phones. “I gave them to him, and he asked me to go with him to his office, where he asked me about my identity.” The parliamentarian said that the director of the school told him that he has summoned the head of the education academy of the region. “After 3 hours of waiting, a deputy came and apologized. He told me to go and wait for their call.” He added that the deputy refused to hand him the phones back. Denying that he was intending to cheat, the MP claimed that he forgot them as he always carries them with him due to his commitments. Kchibel apologized for the “inconvenience.”   PJD also issued a statement in response to the reports against the parliamentarian. In the statement, the party said that it has opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of the issue.  The party vowed to hand disciplinary punishment against the MP if found guilty. As part of a campaign against cheating, Morocco’s security services arrested earlier this week six suspects for alleged exam fraud in Casablanca, Agadir, and Marrakech. The suspects were arrested in possession of devices used to facilitate cheating during exams a few days before the Baccalaureate exam.

Rabat – Spain and Portugal have announced their bid to host the 2030 International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) World Cup, leaving Morocco out of the equation for now. “After holding several meetings, the football federations of Spain and Portugal can confirm that they are set to begin an in-depth analysis of the possibility of presenting a joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup,” the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said in a statement. RFEF tweeted this morning that both the Spanish and the Portuguese government will play a role in the bid for the World Cup. Morocco has long been included in the talks of a possible bid alongside Spain and Portugal. The Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, in his visit to Morocco in November 2018, proposed a trio-bid between Morocco, Spain, and Portugal for the 2030 World Cup bid. However, the idea was not welcomed by the president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), Aleksander Ceferin, who said that he will not support an inter-continent bid to host the World Cup. Great Britain and a coalition of South American countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile) are also in the race to win the bid to host the tournament in 2030. The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) will announce the host of the 2030 World Cup in 2022. After losing to the North American World Cup bid for 2026 following a fierce campaign, Morocco announced its decision to bid again for the 2030 World Cup. It remains to be seen whether the African country will bid alone or join the Portuguese-Spanish bid.

Rabat – Moroccan singer Saad Lamjarred has announced he will release a new album on June 16, amid a slew of legal troubles and sexual assault allegations. Although his new album will soon be released, the singer announced on his Instagram account that his collaboration with Egyptian singer Mohamed Ramadan will be postponed. Lamjarred announced the delay but did not explain the reasons why. “It was decided to postpone the duet with my brother, the beloved Arab actor Mohamed Ramadan and me. And we will announce the date of its release as soon as we have finished the recording. I took this opportunity to announce the date of the broadcast of my new song “Njibek”. I hope with all my heart that you will like it,” he wrote on his Instagram account. The duet was announced just two weeks ago and received a great amount of fanfare, making the postponement even more mysterious. The singer is currently in Paris, living freely but unable to leave France due to his legal issues. Young French seasonal worker Laura Prioul filed a rape complaint against Moroccan pop star Saad Lamjarred in October 2017, saying Lamjarred “ruined her life by forcing himself upon her after he had rejected her.” Police arrested Lamjarred, who then spent six months at the Marriott Champs Elysees in Paris before he was released in April 2018 on bail under electronic surveillance. Police arrested the singer once again in August 2018 in Saint-Tropez in southeastern France, after another young woman came forward and filed a rape complaint against him. On September 18, the singer went back to jail after a prosecutor appealed the release and the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeals’ ruled he should return to jail. The court then released Lamjarred in December. The rape complaints come as part of a long history of allegations. Lamjarred was first accused back in 2010 in New York, but US prosecutors later dropped the case when the plaintiff withdrew. The singer has left the Moroccan public divided, with many calling for a boycott of his music on the Moroccan radio. The hashtag #Masaktach (I will not be hushed) went viral on social media, as part of the call on Moroccan radio stations to join the boycott initiative. However, Lamjarred still has a loyal fanbase. In September 2018, fans launched a petition calling on his former lawyer, Eric Dupond Moretti, to come back and “save Saad’s future.” “Saad Lamjarred, the Moroccan pop star, needs the help of Maitre Dupond Moretti, to get out of the claws of the trap in which he fell, on behalf of all the fans, we ask you to sign this petition which will be addressed to this illustrious lawyer. Our heartfelt thanks,” wrote the initiator of the petition. The petition was signed by more than a thousand of Lamjarred’s fans.

Rabat – The Skhirat agreement, to ensure a peaceful transition in Libya to more legitimate institutions, is worthwhile only with the will and commitment by the different Libyan stakeholders to implement it, said, on Saturday in Rabat, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita. Important provisions of this roadmap have not been implemented and the situation has deteriorated because the main actors have not put enough will, said Bourita during a joint press briefing with French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian. As a Maghreb country, Morocco considers as “a priority” the stability of Libya, which cannot be a field where different agendas that are external to the interests of the Libyan people are at play. The Libyan issue is now at a crucial time and the Libyans as well as the countries directly involved in the crisis have the responsibility to rise to the challenge, Bourita said. Morocco and France have shared their views on this topic since a long time, he noted, adding that the two countries are moving in the same direction and that their positions converge in relation to the objective. The Skhirat agreement should not be an alibi for those wanting to maintain the status quo or the others who would like to move toward total destabilization, Bourita said. For his part, the French diplomat said that his country is equally concerned over Libya’s stability and security. Stability and security not only for the Libyans but for the whole region, which wants to avoid the return to confrontation in which terrorist groups and actors are interfering, and also for the Europeans, said Le Drian. The French minister put emphasis on the need to move forward in resolving this conflict and in controlling drug, arm and human trafficking. France is in favor of an immediate ceasefire that would allow the implementation of a process and a roadmap leading to elections, said the French minister, who recalled the meetings of President Macron with Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj and Marshal Khalifa Haftar.

Rabat – Local authorities in Marrakech have banned a belly dance festival initiated by Israeli dancer Simona Guzman. The organizer, whose family has roots in both Turkey and Morocco, declared that the Moroccan authorities gave in to the pressure of “Islamists.” The belly dance festival was to take place between June 3 and 10 but was canceled following the protests of people who oppose Israel along with anything remotely related to the nation. A senior official of the region justified the ban by saying it conflicted with the last days of Ramadan and Eid El Fitr. The official said that this combination of circumstances could undermine the public order and religious sentiments of Moroccans. The official added that otherwise the festival would have been possible if it had not been scheduled during this exact period. Guzman had reserved a large room where she planned to organize belly dance workshops and 50 more rooms for the 50 dancers who were to participate in this festival. The dancer even paid an advance of 70,000 dirhams on a sum of 250,000 dirhams billed by the management of the hotel. The hotel was later contacted by the local authorities who asked the hotel not to host this festival. Simona Guzman tried to circumvent this ban by booking another hotel but was again hindered by authorities. She announced that this event would not take place, saying, “I became persona non grata [or someone unwelcome] in Morocco.” On May 14, the dancer posted  a message on her Facebook page saying that the Moroccan authorities have yielded to the pressures of what she calls “Islamists.” Guzman affirms that she will privately organize another festival in a small room at a hotel in Marrakech. This festival would feature the dancers who were due to arrive in Marrakech last Monday. The festival, she adds, is only a small event in comparison to the first.  Guzman attempted to organize a festival in a hotel in Marrakech with the participation of 17 Israeli dancers in 2011, but her attempts failed.  “This is an international festival and it is about promoting art, it is not political,” Guzman said at the time.  “In all places, there are extremist people but they do not represent all the people because the festival has received a lot of local support,” she said in a statement.

Rabat – Countless Westerners are moving to Morocco to start and maintain businesses. With this developmental jumpstart in the nation, Morocco is encouraging investment in new opportunities.  A 2017 exhibition that took place in Casablanca shed light on various young entrepreneurs in the nation. Some of their presentations included an instructive Lego center for children and delivery service of healthy on-demand uncooked dinners. No matter how different each presentation and business proposal was, these promising CEO’s shared one dream: Having a burning desire to be financially independent and create value in their societies.   Turning these dreams into reality and being able to sustain them is very difficult, and often against the will of their parents.  Nonetheless, parents sometimes decide to help them financially for the first few years. “My parents were in shock when I told them I wanted to start a business,” says Ahlam Lamrani, one of these youthful entrepreneurs. “They wanted me to get a degree and work in a big corporation… Two years on, they still ask me to get a ‘real’ job!” Given the absence of a completely steady framework, one marvels at what drives these visionaries to begin their businesses, and sustain them given the odds and uncertainty that they face.  “The global economy pushed Moroccans to reconsider their lifestyle and life goals, and find new ways of taking control of their lives, especially that the bureaucratic mindset of most Moroccan companies is off-putting,” says Kenza Bennis, a 30-year-old entrepreneur who launched an Argan-based makeup line in 2012.  In the 2015 Africa Competitiveness Report, Morocco was put on the 72nd position in the World Economic Forum’s 2014-2015 Global Competitiveness Report, making it the fourth most competitive nation in Africa. As indicated by a similar report, farming and manufacturing play a significant role in adding value to the continent. Yet, their decline and stagnation over the course of four decades have been counterbalanced by the increasing importance of the service sector. In an effort to re-energize Morocco’s dynamic populous, the government has set a goal to guaranteeing work opportunities for 67.2% of the populace by attempting numerous projects to support enterprise among the nation’s youth.  Furthermore, this will loosen up the authoritative strategies in hiring, taxes, and social charges amid the new companies’ initial operation. Sadly, these endeavors are regularly met with skepticism and stigma before they even get off the ground, due to the numerous unsuccessful trials. Financing is one of the top issues of young entrepreneurs, who, regardless of their appealing business ideas, can’t dive into the market because of the lack of resources.  “The entrepreneurial ecosystem is still young,” says Otmane El Hassani, Entrepreneurship Network Director, a program of the Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP), the biggest worldwide maker of phosphate and constrained by the Moroccan state. “Lack of support, experts and mentors that could support entrepreneurs, differentiated geographical coverage in terms of resources and the availability of capital but only beyond the seed stage, are all barriers to the creation and sustainability of a company at the national level.”  In any case, numerous associations exist to help young professionals build their businesses. They think of it as a lifelong decision to keep them motivated in what can be a forlorn path.  “I recently attended an event organized by StartUp Maroc,” says Said Bourhim, a 39-year-old business entrepreneur. “Spending the whole day at the conference taught me a lot of things.  Many serial entrepreneurs were present and have shared their experiences. I also often attend CEED labs. They help entrepreneurs get to know each other and potentially work together.”  INJAZ Al Maghreb, ENACTUS, Start Up Your Life and MCISE are different associations that positively impact individuals’ lives by helping them begin a business and by providing long term support. However, these associations, unfortunately, are not available in rural areas in Morocco.  El Hassani notes that OCP Network reaches out in such manner, saying that it “aims at partnering with all types of local, national and international actors in order to boost these ecosystems through the promotion of accompanying programs dedicated to entrepreneurs regardless of the stage of development of their project.” Much of the support is focused on the promotion of entrepreneurship and the foundations of starting a business. Global associations are likewise making their essence felt in the Moroccan scene, helping foster the entrepreneurial spirit by setting up competitions and awarding the winners. The British Council, the World Bank, the U.S Embassy, and so forth give regularly train and prepare new business visionaries and bolster their endeavors to improve their conditions.  These competitions, which are typically centered around subjects, such as social enterprise, innovation, education, and environmental entrepreneurship, tend to have a tremendous impact on society. However, these programs are not usually widely promoted, and Moroccan entrepreneurs may not be aware of their existence. Most innovative enterprises are replicating effective business models demonstrated abroad, particularly those from France.  Our next steps into realizing this would be to locate organizations to offer mentorships, training, and above all fund our projects.  Be that as it may, despite the complexity of the markets and the scarcity of the resources available, young Moroccan entrepreneurs hustle to create their own jobs, remain in the market, bring esteem, and take an interest in the advancement of their nation’s economy.

Rabat – World Ocean Day will take place on June 8 and, in observance of the occasion, the embassies of Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark have been organizing a special beach clean-up. This event will happen with the theme of “Ocean and Gender.” Specifically, the objective is to use the event as a platform to sensitize the population about waste management and to educate about the role both genders must equally play in keeping the coastline and the oceans clean. The clean-up is set to start in the morning of June 8, 2019, at the shoreline of Oudayas, Rabat, from 9:00 to 11:00. Through this activity, individuals from the Nordic government offices and civil society associations, including The Green Challenge, intend to urge local commitment to discover solutions for the ecological difficulties confronting Morocco.  Once the clean-up has concluded, the event coordinators will gather the waste before sorting it  according to the standards of Tadweir company. Tadweir will, at that point, sort the waste in their containment facility and recycle it into new products; cloth will be used to create new fabrics and plastic waste will be turned into containers. This year, the World Ocean Day clean-up will team-up with the Chourouk Center and other NGOs to focus on the importance of gender equality and empowerment. The aim is to include women and girls in the conversation on sustainability in order to find holistic solutions to modern environmental challenges. Fortifying the sustainable management of plastic waste is essential, particularly in vulnerable coastal areas. World Ocean Day is a chance to emphasize protecting marine life by battling against plastic pollution in our seas and oceans.  This will be done on a local scale, but with a global perspective in mind. l Today, we produce around 300 million tons of plastic waste every year, of which 13 million tons are released into the seas, presenting environmental, economic, health and aesthetic problems.  Somewhere in the range of 80% and 90% of marine litter originates from land-based sources, which is a clear sign of the priorities in which we should center our endeavors. The other 10-20 % is from miscellaneous sources. The Nordic nations have, for many years, shared a solid commitment to the protection of nature and regard for the earth is profoundly established in Nordic values.  It translates concretely into ambitious public policies; the adoption of good practices at the individual level; innovation of the clean technology industry.  The Nordic nations have aspiring ideas for sustainable power sources, vitality, productivity, and the circular economy – an economic approach of reutilizing resources.

Rabat – Don’t Forget Me, a documentary featuring Moroccan families caring for children with autism, is now screening in Chicago on June 19.  The documentary, which premiered on November 17, 2018, at Rabat’s 23rd film festival at Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, is now traveling to the US for an adults-only screening of the documentary. The event will be held 7-8:30 p.m., June 19, at Kibbitznest Books, Brews &amp; Blarney, 2212 N. Clybourn Ave., Chicago. Tickets are free, but RSVP required.  Moroccan filmmaker Rajae Bouardi is co-directing it with Jackie Spinner, an associate professor at Columbia College Chicago and former bureau chief at the Washington Post.  Spiner’s own two adopted Moroccan sons have autism. “It’s sad to see how hard the parents of the Moroccan boys in the film work to find opportunities that I take for granted, including the right my sons have in America to go to school,” Spinner said.  “Like the boys in the film, my children want to go to school and they need to be there if they are going to have a chance to be productive adults” Houda Zakri, who advises families who have children with special needs, said that Morocco does not have the institutional, economic, or governmental support needed to help children with autism.  “Families are left alone to struggle to help their children integrate a careless society and to live with fear from the future,” she concluded. The struggles that Zakri is referring to include expensive medical bills, which can exceed MAD 5000 monthly. The average income in Morocco is MAD 2,400 per month. Even though Morocco has inaugurated a special degree for individuals with autism, integrating autistic youth into the educational system has its challenges as there is a shortage of qualified professionals to care for special needs students. There is also a lack of awareness around autism, which leads to misinformation and further problems.

Rabat – Halima Aden is the first Muslim model to wear a hijab and burkini on the cover  of Sports Illustrated magazine’s swimsuit edition. For the 2019 issue, which was released this month, Aden modeled a number of burkinis, including a custom-designed, color-blocked burkini by American designer Cynthia Rowley. The shoot took place in Kenya, which holds significance to Aden’s story. The Somali-American model was born in Kenya at the Kakuma Refugee Camp. At the time her family was living in a tent as they were fleeing the horrors of the Somali civil war.  In each camp her family was transported to, hunger and malaria were common. During this period, her family made the best of life, making furniture from mud. It wasn’t until she was 7 that her family finally moved to the US. “I keep thinking [back] to six-year-old me who, in this same country, was in a refugee camp,” Halima said during her photoshoot. “So to grow up to live the American dream [and] to come back to Kenya and shoot for SI in the most beautiful parts of Kenya–I don’t think that’s a story that anybody could make up.” At the age of 19, Halima became the first woman to wear a hijab in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant, where she was a semi-finalist. She later became the first hijabi model signed with IMG models, which manages Gigi and Bella Hadid. Aden gained international success, landing on the cover of British Vogue, appearing in Carine Roitfeld’s CR Fashion Book, and walking on New York Fashion Week runways. “It’s so overwhelming, but in the most beautiful way,” Aden said. “Just three years ago, there was not a single [signed] hijab-wearing model.” According to Sports Illustrated editor MJ Day, there was a message behind having Aden in the shoot: “We bonded immediately over the idea of her participating in this year’s issue. We both believe the ideal of beauty is so vast and subjective. We both know that women are so often perceived to be one way or one thing based on how they look or what they wear. Whether you feel you’re most beautiful and confident in a burkini or a bikini, YOU ARE WORTHY.” Backlash Despite the positive motives that made the ground-breaking fashion statement a reality, many people are put off by the new issue, including women from the Muslim community. “While all representation is (generally speaking) good, not all representation is equal,” writes Sarah Shaffi for London’s Stylist magazine. “A quick glance through the brand’s Twitter feed shows image after image of women with perfect bodies in small swimsuits. Where is this purported ‘vast’ ideal of beauty?” Shaffi congratulated Aden but also recalled the controversy around the burkini, “The burkini has, unfortunately, gone from a personal sartorial choice to a politicized item of clothing in recent years.”  In response to MJ’s exclamation that women who choose to wear the burkini are “worthy,” Shaffi said, “The sentiment is nice, but underlying it is the idea that Muslim women need to be told they’re worthy by non-Muslims. Why are people not willing to accept the word of the Muslim women who choose to wear the burkini instead?” Shaffi writes that the “congratulatory tone over [Aden’s] Sports Illustrated cover makes me uncomfortable…It’s annoying, to put it simply, that it’s taken a magazine that largely caters to Western, white audiences to show the world that the burkini is acceptable.” Muslim reformer Shireen Qudosi tweeted a reply to Sports Illustrated: “Good for Halima. More nonsense for the larger debate. If you’re going to wear the hijab and cover your skin —whether you think our religion calls for it or you want modesty — it is completely counterintuitive to strike a sexy pose in a magazine known for objectifying women.” While neither Qudosi or Shaffi targeted Aden in their remarks, some are indeed attacking the model for her cutting-edge spread. Regarding those individuals, “There are people that think I shouldn’t be [in the magazine] and there are people that think I’m not representing [Islam] in the right way,” Aden said. “So I’m getting it from both sides.” Western men have also had plenty to say about the issue. One man tweeted, “Those garments are not trendy fashion statements. They are actual tools of patriarchal oppression and in many countries women can be stoned to death for refusing to wear them. But yeah that Sports Illustrated burkini is so wonderful and fun!” Aaron David Lewis, a comics scholar focusing on literary theory and religious studies, said, “…the awful mag Sports Illustrated is trying to up its feminist/cultural cred by featuring a model in a burkini and hijab for the first time. Does this call for a #NancyPelosi style clapback?” The writer David Hansard tweeted, “Women, celebrate your oppression.” Aden appears unbothered by the backlash from men. “My choice, my decision to do the things that I’ve done has nothing to do with you boys and everything to do with us,” Aden said.  “You don’t know what it’s like to experience being kicked out of a pool or banned from a beach for wearing a burkini. I want girls to see, no matter what sometimes you are going to get backlash from your own community. But you shouldn’t let that bother you. And really, the fact that in 2019 a swimsuit creates this much attention…I mean, why are women still being judged for what they wear?” Aden mentioned that, due to the controversy surrounding the burkini, many Muslim women often struggle with maintaining their virtue of modesty at the beach and therefore choose not to swim at all. She had a more personal message for these women: “Girls—join swimming!” Aden said.  “You don’t have to wear a bikini if you don’t want to wear a bikini. Wear a burkini if you want to be a part of it. I wanted to show girls that they had an option. A lot of girls opt out of swimming because they don’t think they have one.”

Rabat – France’s ambassador to Tunisia, Olivier Poivre d’Arvor, also put himself in the same basket as Tunisia’s prime minister, Tarek Chahed, by joining him in denouncing the CAF’s executive committee decision to penalize the Tunisian team, Esperance de Tunis (EST) for a number of violations.  In a Facebook post, Poivre d’Arvor has published his version of facts on the security measures Tunisia put during the African Champions League Final in Rades, Tunisia. “I fully associate myself with his protest, for having been present with him that night, to have noticed inside the stadium and outside, the quality of maintaining order, the exemplary work of the security forces as well as the benevolent conduct of the public,” wrote the ambassador in his Facebook account. “Say that Tunisian is not safe, it is bad and unfair trial. Oblige the blood and Gold to replay a final won at home ‘on neutral ground’ as if Tunisia is not worthy, it is an offense against the territorial sovereignty of a great football club,” he added. The French politician did not stop at only sharing the same point of view as Chahed, he went on to bear his full support to the Tunisian club and Tunisia as a whole. “Long Live L’Esperance. Long Live Tunisia!” he concluded. The ambassador has, however, deleted the post from his Facebook account.  CAF’s decision has fallen too heavy on Tunisian journalists, former footballers, and prime minister who went hysterical. Upon learning on the CAF’s decision on Wednesday, Tunisia’s TV Channel, Nessma TV, has used Morocco’s first national cause, the Western Sahara issue, to publish a provocative news story. The news story, titled “Polisario calls for more pressure on Morocco,” reports on a letter that Polisario’s representative sent to the head of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, Colin Stewart. In this call to action, the representative asks the UN to pressure Rabat to remove the alleged 7 million mines it planted across Morocco’s defense wall. Nessma TV has, however, removed the story from its website.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Health Security Office of Food (ONSSA) has destroyed contaminated mint plantations in the Souss-Massa region in southern Morocco, and in the Tanger-Tetouan region in northern Morocco. In a press release today, ONSSA explains the mint fields were destroyed after testing showed traces of unauthorized pesticides on the mint leaves, or unauthorized levels of pesticide usage. Mint is heavily consumed by many households across Morocco, as it is an essential ingredient in the iconic Moroccan mint tea. The fields were destroyed to prevent the commercialization of contaminated products on the national market, ONSSA adds. ONSSA also issued fines and a number of people are facing charges for unauthorized farming practices. ONSSA will continue to control the quality of the mint to ensure the product conforms with food security requirements, it states. It has also asked wholesale, large and medium-size supermarket to request scientific testing results, as proof that the mint meets health standards. ONSSA has also tested mint in the regions of  Rabat-Kenitra, Casa-Settat, Marrakech-Safi, and Fez-Meknes. Recognizing that the reasonable use of pesticides helps fight against insects and weeds, ONSSA has however called on farmers to only use authorized products, and to strictly respect chemical dosage. Last week, ONSSA issued a warning to the province leaders of Souss-Massa and Tanger-Tetouan, after finding that pesticide usage on the mint leaves from the areas did not meet food safety standards. ONSSA described its finding as an “alarming situation, constituting an imminent risk to the health of consumers.”

Rabat – Protests in Algeria have entered their 16 week as Algerian demonstrators are refusing any solutions except radical change after the resignation of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. On Thursday, Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah urged civil society and political parties to engage in an “inclusive dialogue” to overcome the crisis that the country has been facing since February 22. In a televised statement, Bensalah said that dialogue would help fix a new date for elections as soon as possible” after the cancelation of the planned election on July 4. On Sunday, June 2, the Algerian Constitutional Council announced that a presidential election would not be able to take place on July 4 due to a lack of valid candidates. Protesters have been rallying against the interim president since February 22, calling for a radical change, such as aa boycott of the election, as well as calling on all elites from the Bouteflika era to leave. Today marks the 16 weeks of continuous protests, with the interim president deploying security troops into the peaceful demonstrations. The police have been using tear gas and water cannons to disperse protests. Last Friday, May 3, police also arrested several protesters.

Rabat – In the last two weeks of June, 86,017 people in the Souss-Massa region of Morocco will sit exams as part of an anti-illiteracy program run by the National Agency Against Illiteracy (ANLCA). Most of the candidates are enrolled to sit exams in the Taroudant province (40,717), and the others will sit exams across the prefectures of Chtouka Ait Baha, Agadir Idda Outanane, Inezgane Ait Melloul and the provinces of Tata and Tiznit, all located in the southern region of Morocco. The exams are part of an anti-illiteracy program for children and adults run by ANLCA, the national body set up in 2013 to address Morocco’s literacy challenges. In 2014 (the date of the latest figures on the issue) 32.2% of Morocco’s population older than 10 years of age was illiterate. Illiteracy affects women more than men, with 42.1% of Moroccan women and 22.1% of men found to be illiterate in 2014. Rural populations are also more affected, with 57% of illiterate people coming from rural areas as opposed to 43% from urban areas. In the Souss-Massa region, where the exams will take place at the end of this month, 33.1% of people were illiterate in 2014. Since 2013, ANLCA has put in place a national strategy against illiteracy, aiming to reduce illiteracy rates to 10% by 2026. It supports organizations across Morocco that work towards ensuring access to education. ANLCA runs workshops for teachers and provides training modules to support children and adults in achieving literacy, prioritizing actions for women, children and people in rural areas.  It has also created an app, “Alpha Nour,” to teach basic literacy, and in May, it launched the Center for Literacy Resources and Expertise (CREA), a virtual platform on which to share training modules. ANLCA’s goal is for 1,050,000 people to achieve literacy every year.  The right to education is a fundamental human right, recognized by international statutes and enshrined in Articles 31 and 32 of Morocco’s constitution.

FIFA also asked the French authorities for “any information that might be relevant to investigations taking place within its ethics committee.” The governing body added that while everyone has the right to plead innocent,  “anyone found to have committed illicit or illegal acts has no place in football.” Update on #Ahmad: He has been released without any charge.

Rabat – Tunisians are unhappy with the decision of the Confederation of African Football to replay the second leg of the Champions League’s final between Wydad of Casablanca and Esperance of Tunis. The decision was made during an extraordinary meeting of the CAF executive committee in Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday. After more than nine hours of deliberations, CAF executive committee decided to stripe Esperance of Tunis of the Champions League title and to replay the second leg of the final in a neutral field outside of Tunisia. In addition to the decision to replay the second leg outside of Tunisia, the committee ordered EST to return their medals and their trophy. The rematch is expected to be played after the African Cup of Nations, scheduled to take place between June 21 and July 19 in Egypt. CAF decision has caused a hysterical reaction in Tunisia with politicians, former players, and journalists denouncing what they believe is “injustice” against their country. Tunisian Prime Minister, Youssef Chahed, politicized the event with a Tweet he posted on his Twitter account. “After the Caf farce: salutation to our army and police, who have been a good example for all the world, and whoever is talking about this should take responsibility for it,” he wrote. “Salutation to ES Tunis fans, they were great at the last game. We will not give up on ES Tunis’ rights or any Tunisian association’s rights,” he added. The post did not go unnoticed in Morocco with many Moroccans criticizing the Tunisian official’s involvement in a sports matter that falls out of his purview. Tunisians’ reaction did not, however, stop at lashing out at CAF President Ahmad Ahmad. A TV channel published a news report supportive of the Polisario Front, a breakaway movement that claims to be the sole representative of the Sahrawis and seeks to establish a state in Western Sahara, in southern Morocco. In what marks a departure from the TV channel’s editorial line, it published a news story titled “Polisario calls for more pressure on Morocco.” The news story reports on a letter that Polisario’s representative sent to the head of United Nations peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, Colin Stewart, calling on the UN to pressure Rabat to remove the alleged 7 million mines it planted across Morocco’s defense wall. “The representative of the Polisario to the United Nations, Mohamed Omar, called on the international community to put the necessary pressure on Morocco to force it to abide by the principles of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the use of mines and related weapons.” Nessma TV has, however, removed the story from its website following the uproar it caused in Morocco. The story remained on Nessma TV’s website until Thursday 8 pm time of Morocco.  CAF’s decision comes on the heels of Wydad of Casablanca’s complaints following the surreal incidents that happened during the second leg of the Champions League’s final last Friday in Tunis. The controversy was triggered when Moroccan player Walid El Karti leveled the score of the match at the 58th minute. To the surprise of football fans around the world, Gambian referee Bakary Gassama disallowed the goal for an alleged offside. Angered by the decision, WAC players pressured the referee to review the goal through the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), but Gassama dismissed their request. WAC players refused to resume the match until the referee has reviewed the validity of the goal through the VAR. After more than 20 minutes of interruption, they were told that VAR had not been functioning since the beginning of the match. Amid embarrassing scenes in Rhades stadium in Tunis and after 90 total chaos on the pitch, Gassama ended the game, thus awarding the African Champions League trophy to Esperance of Tunis.

Rabat – SudaneseSudanese military forces shot demonstrators Monday in an attempt to break up a weeks-long sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, the country’s capital. Monday’s attacks mark a turning point in the standoff between protesters and the military. Until this week’s crackdown, the situation had been tense but remained peaceful. The surge in violence escalates tensions between the two sides. There have been conflicting reports on the number of casualties- the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) said there have been over 100 killed while a health ministry official said the toll is only 61. While China and Russia blocked a joint statement from the UN Security Council condemning the violence, individual states – including the US and a group of eight European states – have spoken out against Monday’s attack, as have human rights watchdogs like Amnesty InternationalAmnesty International. Protesters, who insist they will continue their resistance until a civilian government is in place,  labeled the attack “a massacre.” After Monday’s crackdown, talks between the military council (TMC) and the opposition fell apart.  Protest leaders suspended negotiations and the military council responded in kind by canceling any agreements that had come out of previous talks, adding that the military would form a government and hold elections in upcoming months. Following international criticism of recent violence, the TMC back-peddled and said they were willing to resume talks, but the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) was quick to reject this offer. “This call is not serious,” SPA spokesman Mohammed Yousef al-Mustafa told the Associated Press. “Burhan and those under him have killed the Sudanese and are still doing it. Their vehicles patrol the streets, firing at people.  We will continue in our protests, resistance, strike, and total civil disobedience,” he said. As the SPA pulls away from negotiations, Sadeq al-Mahdi, the head of Sudan’s leading opposition party, urged all factions in the protest movement to come together and set a plan to bring about the transfer of power to civilians. While protesters and the transitional military council had been negotiating a shift from military to civilian power, the debate over who would head this transitional body – civilian or military – had been a sticking point. Al-Mahdi told the Associated Press that the military council played a “critical role in the revolution” in overthrowing al-Bashir, but need to take responsibility for recent violence. The military council’s deputy head, Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – who also leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that protesters claim led the recent attacks – said that the TMC is conducting an “urgent and fair” independent investigation into the attacks. Since gaining independence in 1956 Sudan has faced consistent conflict and coups. Recently ousted Omar al-Bashir originally took power in one such coup in 1989. The nation has had long-standing tension over economic hardship, especially following South Sudan’s 2011 secession, taking with it most of the oil fields that were key to Sudan’s economy. Even after the US lifted its sanctions on Sudan in 2017, the country has struggled to recover. Last December, Sudanese civilians took to the streets to protest rising costs of bread and fuel, and called for the end of Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year rule.  These economic-turned-political protests spread across the country, manifesting in the country’s capital Khartoum. The SPA, an umbrella coalition for professional unions, took charge in demonstrations calling for Bashir’s ousting, but were supported by other local organizations and political parties. Key sections of the military refused to repress protests, eventually forcing al-Bashir to give up power.  Al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and war crimes relating to the conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region, was replaced by a military council led by Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. In response to Monday’s attack, the UN is removing its “non-critical” personnel amid the surge in violence and the African Union has revoked Sudan’s membership until a civilian-led transitional authority is in place.

Rabat – Baggage handlers at Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport went on strike last weekend, causing flight and baggage delivery delays for the national airline company Royal Air Maroc (RAM). Some customers who flew to the US and lost their baggage on Sunday still don’t have their bags today. Angry at how RAM has handled the lost baggage claims, they have turned to Twitter to express their frustration.  The main anger is around RAM’s lack of communication and “radio silence” on the whereabouts of people’s luggage. “We just spent 30 minutes on the phone and were basically yelled at for asking for information. They couldn’t even tell us if some bags have left Morocco, let alone where ours were,” tweeted one user. The bags on flights to New York and Miami were left on the tarmac at departure. “Zero communication regarding the bags that flight AT0200 left at Casablanca and departed for JFK. Waited on the Tarmac for an hour before departure to be told that we were leaving 60% of the baggage at Casablanca. How do I get my bags that were left?” said another user. “There is nothing more heartbreaking than calling an airline and them telling you they have no clue where your luggage is – meanwhile we saw a pile of bags sitting on the tarmac as we flew away. @RAM_Maroc can you provide us with any information?!” When contacted by Morocco World News, RAM’s Customer Service line was not available. In a press release on Monday, RAM denied responsibility for the baggage delays, shifting the blame on its subcontractor General Private Interim (GPI), the company responsible for RAM’s baggage handling services at Casablanca airport. RAM’s website, however, states that the aircraft takes responsibility for finding lost baggage, and will do “all it can to return it as quickly as possible.” For some passengers, RAM is clearly responsible. “By buying a ticket on RAM, we are in an agreement for you to take us and our bags safely to our destination,” tweeted one user. Passengers want to know where their bags are, and they want compensation from RAM. RAM and its baggage handling subcontractor GPI have been butting heads since mid-April over contract terms, each accusing the other of not respecting its obligations.   GPI accuses the airline of imposing additional work on baggage handlers without fair remuneration and baggage handlers want a pay rise to reflect what they feel is an increased workload.  RAM accuses GPI of breaching the contract by intentionally slowing down its baggage handling services and causing flight delays. The delays this week are another blow to RAM’s reputation.

Rabat – The European Union Council announced on Thursday the adoption of a new regulation regarding Schengen visas will “improve the conditions for travelers” and fight against irregular migration. In a statement, the EU announced that the Schengen visa fees would increase from €60 to €80 (33.3%) when the approved regulation comes into force. The EU justified its decision, saying that the visa fee will be increased to “ensure member states can better cover the costs of visa processing without constituting a deterrent for visa applicants.” The EU added that the visa regulation also introduces a mechanism for reviewing every three years whether the visa fee should change.” The EU is expected to publish the new regulation in the Official Journal of the EU. The regulation will come into force six months after its publication (January 2020). With the change, third country travelers will need to pay €80 to get the visa. Schengen Visa Info said that the EU Commission had proposed the amendments in 2018 to ‘make traveling easier for frequent travelers to the Schengen countries.” The info website added that “another important part of the new code is that it also intends to contribute to the cooperation of third countries on readmission through the introduction of a new mechanism for using visa processing as leverage.” The Schengen Visa Info website added that the third countries will be “assessed continuously regarding cooperation on readmission,” through the new mechanism. Moroccan received high number of Schengen visas in 2018.  Data published in April 2019 showed that Moroccans received 530,000 Schengen visas last year. In May, Spain issued a new procedure, asking Moroccans to pay the service charge  in advance to get the visas. Commenting on the new procedure, Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell, who was on a visit to Morocco last week, said that his country was “overwhelmed” due to the high number of visa applications. “This year we will receive 250,000 visa applications, which is an annual increase of 10% in recent years,” Borell said in a press release following a meeting with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita. Borell also apologized for the delay in visa issuance. In mid-May of this year, Moroccans applying for a Schengen visa were facing up to six months of wait times for their visa appointments at Spanish consular services.

Rabat – On June 5, Spanish authorities arrested 4 Moroccans for allegedly stealing television and camera equipment from the Sky News crew. “The arrest of the four suspects took place in the morning … when the agents stopped them and checked the passengers’ luggage.” According to the Spanish newspaper, El Pais.  The four defendants allegedly stole television and camera equipment while the Sky News crew were covering the final of the Champions League between Liverpool and Tottenham last Saturday at the Wanda Metropolitan Stadium in Madrid.  “Sometimes they [suspects] even pose as journalists to go unnoticed.” Reported the newspaper.  The four Moroccans were arrested in Tarifa, a small town in the province of Cadiz. They are believed to be part of a gang that specializes in stealing expensive television equipment. The detainees are waiting to appear before the court. “Many of this equipment cost €30,000 and 40,000”.  According to Spain’s national police, over the course of three months, two gangs mostly from Latin America were responsible for 47 cases of this type of crimes in various cities in Spain.

Rabat – Three Moroccan immigrants on board a Kayak attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe on Tuesday, June 3. According to the press agency El Faro de Ceuta, the maritime rescue unit, the “Salvamar Atria” arrested the three Moroccans following a tip-off. The rescue unit then handed them over to the Red Cross and the three are now awaiting their deportation back to Morocco through the border crossing point, Tarajal.  Despite the drop in the number of immigrants coming by sea, the Spanish enclaves on the northern tip of Morocco still face huge land crossings.  Most immigrants crossing by land run the risk of death from suffocation as they are most often stowed away in cars, the El Faro added. Morocco, which is considered the stepping-stone for immigrants crossing to Europe, has stepped up efforts in recent years to boost its’ border and maritime security. It has successfully scaled down the rate of immigrants crossing to Europe. According to the Moroccan border security chief, Khali Zerouali, the number of immigrants, most of whom hail from sub-Saharan countries, dropped by 30 percent between 2018 and 2019. Spain, however, has invested a $36,8 million budget into a project it called “smart borders” and has deployed a number of high-tech security equipment to help monitor the influx of migrants coming to Spain.

Choosing the region of Draa-Tafilalet for its richness in Barite, the event will hold a separate two-day conference, free-to-attend exhibitions, and post-conference site-tours connecting worldwide companies and investors to explore an untapped market. The mining industry accounts for 10 percent of Morocco’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Besides cobalt, copper, silver, and gold, the country’s phosphates production makes up 90 percent, making Morocco the leader in the extraction and processing worldwide, accounting for 73.5 percent of the world’s 68 billion tons of total phosphate reserves. Latest figures released in September 2018 show that in 2017 the industry earned Morocco 56.5 billion in revenue, and created 41,000 direct job positions. The findings show that Morocco ranks the second most attractive market in the MENA region after Saudi Arabia.

Rabat – Morocco ranked 88 out of 129 countries in the 2019 SDG Gender Index, a new report on the global progress of gender equality. Carried out by the Equal Measures 2030, a partnership led by global civil society and the private sector, the report paints a dismal picture of how world governments are addressing the future of gender equality as agreed upon by UN member states in 2015.  With the average score being 65 percent, Morocco received a score of 59.3, which is defined as a “very poor” score. Morocco came behind Egypt (87th), Lebanon (86th), and Jordan (85th).  According to the report, Israel topped the list of Middle Eastern countries (31st worldwide) with a score of 76.7, followed by Algeria in the second place, with a global rank of 65, and then Tunisia (66th), scoring 66. The MENA ranked as the second lowest region, falling behind on a wide range of indicators like women’s legal rights, land ownership, workplace equality, and the extent to which there are legal grounds for abortion. However, the region scored well on measures of access to basic services, energy, infrastructure.  The report shows that not a single country has fully lived up to the promises laid down in the UN’s 2030 Agenda of sustainable development. “No one country is the world’s best performer – or even among the world’s top ten performers – across all goals or all indicators,” the report shows, but countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands are the highest ranking countries.  Alison Holder, the director of Equal Measures 2030, noted, “With just 11 years to go, our index finds that not a single one of the 129 countries is fully transforming their laws, policies or public budget decisions on the scale needed to reach gender equality by 2030.” She added that the countries are “failing to deliver on the promises of gender equality for literally billions of girls and women.” The global average score on gender equality stands at 65.7 out of 100, signifying a “poor” and “barely passing grade.” Nearly 40 percent of women and girls around the world, live in countries that fail to meet the average gender equality expectations, accounting for 2.8 billion of the world’s population. The report takes into account 14 of the 17 UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as health, gender-based violence, and climate change.

Rabat – A French parliamentary report on released on June 5 stated that undocumented Moroccans immigrants rank 4th of all forcefully deported nationalities in France. The same report stated that the cost of forced deportation cost France €500 Million ($564 million), while the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) costs six times less. AVRR is a program aiming at controlling migrants in a humane and orderly manner. 
 “The number of forced deportation has never been higher in ten years. And their cost to public finances represented half a billion euros last year,” said one government official.  The average cost of forced deportation costs €13,800 ($15,540) per person. Conversely, AVRR costs €2,509 ($2830). Immigrants who agree to the AVRR program receive €300 to €650  ($336 – $729) per person. A quarter of them will be the beneficiaries of €2,000 to €7,500 ($2245- $8420), to go towards “reintegration assistance” according to the report.  Albania topped the list with more than 2,112 deported immigrants, followed by Romania – a member of the European Union (EU) – with 1909 deported Romanian immigrants.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football’s (CAF) president, Ahmad Ahmad, was arrested this morning in Paris on corruption charges. Ahmad was arrested by the Central Office for the Fight Against Corruption (OCLIF) at 8:30 am at the Berri Hotel in Paris, according to Jeune Afrique. The arrest most likely stems from Ahmad’s alleged misappropriation of funds and corruption involving his dealings with French company, Tactical Steel, which some speculate Ahmad has personal ties to. Ahmad reportedly signed off on a deal favoring Tactical Steel, and one of the company’s executives is said to have paid a total of €739,000 ($833,000) to the CAF president in order to get the deal sanctioned. The alleged corruption first came to light after former secretary-general of the confederation, Amr Fahmy, sent a document to the FIFA investigations committee in April accusing Ahmad of costing CAF $830,000 by ordering equipment through Tactical Steel. The president of Tactical Steel, Sabine Seillier, denied the allegations, insisting that her company won the contract on a transparent basis. She claimed that her company was the only one that could guarantee delivery of the equipment sought in a tight timeframe of three weeks. Moroccan outlet Hesport reported that Ahmad Ahmad has now been released after further investigation. Ahmad was in Paris to attend a FIFA congress addressing arbitrary refereeing mistakes that occurred during the African Champions League’s 2nd leg final between Tunisian club Esperance de Tunis (ES Tunis) and Wydad Athletic Club of Casablanca (WAC). The emergency congress met in Paris yesterday to discuss the refereeing mistakes, mainly the malfunction of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), after that WAC players requested the referee to consult it after refusing their valid goal. The CAF executive committee, subsequently, decided that a rematch with functioning VAR will be played in South Africa during the African Cup of Nations, which is scheduled to start on June 21 in Egypt.

The National Agency for Telecommunications Regulations (ANRT) has released figures on mobile phone and internet usage in Morocco during the first three months of 2019. The report shows Maroc Telecom remains the leading phone and internet connection provider in Morocco, with a 43.08% market share. Orange comes next with a 34.78% market share, then Inwi with 22.14%. According to ANRT, the total number of mobile connections across all three service providers at the end of March 2019 was 44.73 million. This figure takes into account all mobile phone clients (prepaid and postpaid) who were “active” during the three month period. The number is greater than Morocco’s total population of approximately 36 million as some people and companies will have multiple mobile connection contracts. Prepaid mobile connections remain by far the most popular amongst Moroccan clients. Approximately 40.6 million clients were prepaid, whereas only 4.13 million were postpaid. Postpaid connections increased, however, by 20% since last year, indicating a shift in Morocco’s preferences since last year towards postpaid contracts. Clients across the three mobile providers consumed, on average, 103 minutes per client of call data during March. SMS usage is falling. Over the first three months of 2019, just over 1 billion SMSs were sent, a 20% decrease since last year. Internet connection According to ANRT, 23.1 million clients had an internet connection, a 9.3% increase from last year.  The report shows a sharp increase in 4G and broadband connections since last year. Of these 23.1 million internet clients, 11 million had 4G, up 56% since last year. Connection to broadband or fiber optical internet, though still low at 82,693, increased by 88%. These figures do not paint a picture of how many Moroccan individuals actually have access to the internet, noting a “client” may have multiple internet connections. ANRT publishes a separate annual report on this. Its 2018 report showed that 62% of the Moroccan population had access to the internet, and 86% had smartphones, from which they were regularly using social media and other mobile apps. ANRT’s 2019 figures are not yet out.

Rabat – Commander of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, otherwise known as MONUSCO has honored Moroccan peacekeepers deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in a ceremony held on Tuesday in Kananga. The Moroccan Embassy in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, said in a statement that the “battalion forming the Moroccan contingent deployed in DRC, under the command of Colonel Zakaria Sahili, was decorated by Lieutenant General Elias Rodriguez Martins Filho, Commander of the Monursco Forces.” The statement added that the Moroccan peacekeepers received the medals of merit in recognition of their “commendable services” in the UN mission. Moroccan ambassador to Kinshasa Rachid Agassim attended the ceremony along with the Naval Attache Zine Hrizou.  Representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCR) as well as several officers representing other countries also took part in the ceremony. Morocco is an active contributor to MONUSCO, with a contingent of more than 1,300 troops deployed in the DRC, particularly in Kasaï (the center of the country) and Bunia in North Kivu.  The Moroccan forces are strengthened by a number of female peacekeepers. There are 25 female members in Kananga, including five officers. The Moroccan military enjoys a very good reputation, both in the regions of their deployment and the Congolese authorities. In addition to the medals of merit attributed to Moroccans on Tuesday, UN also honored the sacrifices of Moroccan volunteers in UN Peacekeeping Operations on May 29. Morocco contributes more than 2,100 uniformed peacekeeping volunteers. It also ranks 13th in the world for peacekeeper contribution, and has been “an essential partner of United Nations peacekeeping operations for many years,” said UN peacekeeping spokesman Nick Birnback. “We thank them for their commitment to preserving international peace and security, especially in Africa,” Birnback said.

Rabat – Police at the Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca have arrested arrested a 51-year-old Chinese woman, who was under an international arrest warrant filed by the French judicial police for kidnapping. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), said that the police arrested the suspect on Monday. The Moroccan police arrested the suspect upon her arrival from Abu Dhabi. She was the subject of an Interpol red notice after being convicted in absentia by the French court for kidnapping her minor son, who she took out of France without the  permission of her ex-husband. Police put the suspect in custody for further investigation, pending the extradition procedure. The arrest is part of the DGSN services to reinforce international cooperation mechanism in security. Throughout the year, Moroccan police arrested a number of suspects under international arrest warrants. The latest operation took place in Marrakech on May 11, when DGSN members arrested a Danish national. The 30-year old suspect was arrested for his involvement in a fraud. In addition to its action against international wanted suspects, Morocco is also involved in several counter-terrorism projects in collaboration with the international community. Moroccan law enforcement is also working with international bodies on operations including tracking suspects involved in undocumented migration networks, and the fight against illegal psychotropic drug traffickers.

Rabat –  The regional health division of Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra, in southern Morocco, has  denied allegations from pro-Polisario news outlet FuturoSahara, claiming nine newborns died in the Moulay El Hassan Ben El Mehdi regional hospital center. The health division said in a statement that “this false and baseless information seeking to undermine the reputation of the health sector and its employees in the Laayoune province.” The department added that “no case of death was reported” and threatened to “sue people involved in spreading this erroneous information to stop such shameful actions.” The pro-Polisario news outlet claimed that when “Moroccan doctors announced their death, the professionals explained that all the nine babies consumed amniotic fluid,” which is rare but does harm infants, often leading to choking. It also claimed that Sahrawi families, or families from the region, condemned the death of their babies, accusing the health division of “intentionally killing” people, saying  that “it’s not the first time.” The department emphasized that the number of births in the delivery ward exceeds 18 babies per day, including 8 to 10 babies born via c-section.

Rabat – Amir Siman-Tov, a 41-year-old Jewish immigrant from Morocco died in 2016 by taking an overdose of painkillers while awaiting deportation just as he repeatedly threatened to do so. A recent inquest reveals that the staff of Colnbrook Immigration Removal Center contributed to his death by failing to properly communicate his symptoms. A jury at West London Coroner’s Court has determined that “inadequate information sharing” led to missed opportunities which would have prevented him taking an overdose “despite Mr. Siman-Tov repeatedly stating his intention to do so.” The Court heard how Siman-Tov, who lived with his family in North East London and had a history of mental health problems, was afraid of being in detention and terrified at the prospect of being deported to Morocco. A statement from the staff said: “Although Siman-Tov spoke of his intention to self-harm and expressed suicidal ideation this is judged to be a cry for help rather than a desire to deliberately end his life.” Human rights activist Mia Hasenson-Gross says this kind of neglect is normalized in centers which conduct indefinite detention for immigrants. As the information was released, Hasenson-Gross, who is also the executive director of Jewish human rights group René Cassin said, “This tragic incident once again highlights the lethal policy of indefinite detention. The evidence that detention is harmful is indisputable.” Hasenson-Gross added, “It robs people of their dignity, their spirit, and, in Amir’s case, their lives. Four years ago, a cross-party group of MPs condemned it as ‘expensive, ineffective, and unjust’. Four years later, it is still happening.” Siman-Tov was being held at the detention center when he died on the morning of February 17, 2016, surrounded by professionals who could have prevented his death. On the morning before his passing, a detention officer witnessed Mr. Siman-Tov take a handful of his prescribed painkillers, the court heard. A doctor from Hillingdon Hospital, where Mr. Siman-Tov was taken, told the inquest a psychiatrist at Colnbrook called him, doubting that Mr. Siman-Tov had taken an overdose. The psychiatrist suggested he may have only taken “tic tacs.” Mr. Siman-Tov was dismissed after a doctor and consultant decided that he was not showing signs of opiate toxicity. The nurse finished his shift at around 7 pm and gave a verbal handover to only one of the two night nurses. He said that he expected the night nurses to carry out medical observations every one to two hours. The court heard that the night nurses carried out no observations. One of the nurses attended to Siman-Tov at approximately 9.10 pm to give him medication, which included the painkillers had already overdosed on, but when he found Siman-Tov “asleep” he did not disturb him. It was not until 3.15 am that Siman-Tov was found to be unresponsive by custody officers who were supervising him. Paramedics rushed to the scene and pronounced him dead at 4.10 am. The inquest jury concluded that the “failure to provide a discharge summary, inadequate communication at handover and failure to establish an adequate care plan on return” contributed to his death. In a statement, Siman-Tov’s family said: “Amir was loved by his family and his death has been devastating for us. The jury’s conclusions show that he did not wish to die and that if those with responsibility for his care had not failed him, he would be alive today.” The statement also said, “We were shocked to learn that more than three years on, lessons said to have been learned have still not been implemented, and we now call on those involved – the NHS trusts and Mitie – to do so without further delay. The family added, “We also call on the Home Office to end its inhumane policy of indefinite immigration detention which, as Amir’s case shows, ruins lives and has no place in a civilized society.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Ministry of Administration and Public Service Reform has announced that the nation will return to using the GMT +1 timezone as of Sunday at 2 a.m. Two days before the holy month of Ramadan, Morocco switched back to the Standard time. This time change is a result of the government’s decision to switch to GMT only during Ramadan, announced Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani, in October 2018. The decision came after the Moroccan government adopted Decree 2.18.855 last October, adding 60 minutes to the standard time, moving the country to GMT+1 year-round. The decree moved standard time one hour forward permanently “to avoid many changes that occur many times during the year and repercussions at many levels,”  the government explained in response to the backlash from citizens. Before the adoption of the decree, Morocco switched the clock every summer to Daylight Saving Time, GMT+1, and returned to the old standard time, GMT wheneveras Ramadan fell in the summer.  The decision to keep the GMT+1 year around stirred confusion and generated backlash among Moroccan citizens, who called for the government to abolish the new standard time. The government, however, defended its decision, emphasizing that the time change was based on a study. The study found that the “adoption of ‘doubling timing’ has created a kind of confusion,” according to the government.

Rabat – In the last four and a half years, more than 1,600 children seeking asylum in the Netherlands have gone missing from their accommodation and the majority of them are Moroccan.  According to data from the Dutch news outlet NRC Handelsblad, Moroccan children make up the largest demographic that have been disappearing. Data reports that 325 of the asylum seekers that went missing are Moroccan. Children from Algeria made up the second largest group at 190, while asylum seekers from Afghanistan (167), Syria and Eritrea (114 each) also accounted for the large losses. Morocco and Algeria are both considered “safe” countries, meaning these citizens have little chance of being granted asylum in the Netherlands, and likely face being sent back to their country of origin. Moroccan children who made the journey to the Netherlands from Africa might be struggling with the reality that they are unwelcome to stay. The Dutch policy for individuals who do not receive asylum establishes that “foreign nationals who have no right of residence in the Netherlands must leave the country.” The government can offer financial assistance for their return, but “anyone who does not leave voluntarily can be expelled.”  While some children leave their housing to live with family members in the nearby countries of Germany, Belgium, or France, information from the detention centers says other children are exploited by criminal networks. Social workers with Nidos, an organization which regulates guardianship for asylum seekers under 18, said they had encountered Moroccan children with shopping lists of perfume, clothes, and other items they had been ordered to steal on commission. Many of the children battle addictions to Clonazepam, a drug used to treat seizures and panic attacks. Police in Rotterdam said they have frequently picked up minors in the city and took them to the central housing center in Ter Apel, but the children either refused to go into the shelter or left again during the night. Police have been called to deal with incidents involving asylum seekers 4,600 times in 2018, according to the annual justice ministry report on asylum seekers in the Netherlands. Though there were nearly 600 asylum seekers of Moroccan nationality in the Netherlands, asylum seekers who come from Morocco and Algeria accounted for almost half the incidents involving shoplifting or pickpocketing. Police also registered cases of physical abuse, threatening behavior, and damage to property. In addition, the figures include suicides, suicide threats, and violation of house rules in asylum seekers’ centers. In 2013, the police, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Nidos, and COA noted problems with Moroccan children hopping from day to day care through Europe. The Netherlands comes 7th in the list of European countries with 21,945 asylum requests. Germany tops the list with 173,640.

Rabat – Tuesday evening, Kourtney Kardashian invited the Moroccan-American rapper French Montana, to a dinner celebrating the end of Ramadan. The theme of this Eid was “Moroccan Vibes.” Kourtney Kardashian posted snapshots and videos on her Instagram story of the evening she organized for French Montana, her long-time friend, who is also her sister Khloe’s ex boyfriend.  Kourtney made Moroccan chicken and Middle Eastern spicy lamb with rice, mint tea, and pancake pastilla while Andalusian and Moroccan music set the atmosphere.     EID MUBARAK WITH MY RATATAA TWIN @kourtneykardash 🤟🏼 Une publication partagée par  French Montana (@frenchmontana) le 4 Juin 2019 à 11 :43 PDT  On Instagram, the rapper warmly thanked Kourtney, whom he considers a sister of his own. Very close to the family, French Montana is often a guest for events organized by the Kardashians. Though he has recently gained American citizenship, Montana rarely misses an opportunity to acknowledge his Moroccan origins. The rapper played the Ramadan card recently at the annual and very select Met Gala. As the first night of Ramadan in the United States coincided with the prestigious fashion rendezvous, the artist born in Casablanca in 1984 had displayed a qamis, which is a traditional outfit, with an agal or rope circle, as well as a tunic from the Dapper Dan collection by Gucci.

Rabat – Spanish police announced the arrest of a 30-year old Moroccan national in Coloma de Gramenet, near Barcelona. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the suspect was under an international arrest warrant issued by Moroccan authorities.  The  man is suspected of being involved in a “terrorist organization” and “drug trafficking.” Spanish police said that they arrested the suspect on Tuesday. Quoted by MAP, a statement from the Spanish police said that the arrest “reflects the process of dealing and addressing a global phenomenon that requires an effort that goes beyond borders and strong, intensive international security cooperation such as that between Spain and Morocco. The suspect fled Morocco in September 2018 following the dismantling of a terror cell. The suspect is allegedly a member of that dismantled terror group. “Data obtained by the Spanish investigation police revealed that the suspect illegally entered Spanish territory,” the statement said. Morocco and Spain share strong diplomatic ties and cooperation in several areas, including in the fight against drug trafficking, irregular migration networks, and counterterrorism. In 2018, Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell described Rabat-Madrid counterterrorism cooperation as  an example for other countries to follow. He added that their cooperation is “a model of inter-regional cooperation.” In April, Moroccan security services, in cooperation with Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services, have arrested a Moroccan terror suspect, who was allegedly planning a terror attack in Seville, southern Spain. The Spanish and Moroccan intelligence services “carried out an anti-terrorist operation, which resulted in the arrest in Morocco of an alleged jihadist who planned to carry out an attack in Seville,” the Spanish Ministry of Interior announced.

Rabat – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) officially decided Wednesday that Morocco’s Wydad Athletic Club  (WAC) and Tunisia’s Esperance Tunis (EST) will play a rematch for the controversial Friday (May 31) night game. The match will be replayed after the African Cup of Nations (CAN) on a field outside Tunisia, said adviser to CAF president, Hédi Hamel, adding that the EST should return the Trophy and the medals awarded to them. During last Friday’s match in Tunis, Wydad of Casablanca, were 2-1 behind on aggregate when they leveled the score just before the hour mark. But Gambian referee Bakary Gassama disallowed Walid Karti’s header for an alleged infringement. WAC players protested to the Gambian referee, demanding VAR be used. To their utter dismay, the referee kept refusing to check the video technology only to be told more than 20 minutes later that the VAR was not functioning. CAF president Ahmad Ahmad spent almost 30 minutes in discussions with officials in a bid to get the game restarted. Amid embarrassing scenes in Tunis and after 90 minutes of interruption and total chaos on the pitch, the referee declared home side Esperance winners of the African Champions League. After a football scandal that Wydad of Casablanca chairman, Said Naciri deemed a “total shame for African football,” CAF convened an emergency meeting in Paris to examine the unprecedented controversies that surrounded the second leg of the Champions’ League final. Less than 24 hours after last Friday’s controversial match, CAF President said that Wydad of Casablanca’s goal was legitimate. “If somebody did not see WAC’s goal as legitimate, he then should change his hobby and to stop watching football,” Ahmad Ahmad said in a statement to Moroccan sports news outlet Almountakhab. The emergency meeting of the CAF Executive Committee, which took place with the participation of a Moroccan delegation made up of officials of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and Wydad of Casablanca, opened on Tuesday morning before being postponed for the first time for the evening and then for Wednesday afternoon.

Rabat – Two teachers and the director of a school in Al Hoceima will appear before the public prosecutor after several students replaced the Moroccan flag with a white flag.  The Spanish news agency, EFE reports that the incident occurred on May 17, at the Arianen school in Issaguen, a rural town in Al Hoceima. According to the authorities, six students aged between 8-11 picked up the Moroccan flag and replaced it with a white flag. “The white flag remained for four days until the Royal Gendarmerie of the region was informed of what happened,” said EFE. The two teachers and the director of the school were interrogated and will appear before the prosecutor after Ramadan.  Sources close to the school told EFE that the two teachers and the school director were not aware that the country’s flag had been replaced because the incident coincided with the weekend and only found out days later. Moroccan law sentences anyone who insults the flag with six months to three years in prison and a fine of up to MAD 100,000 (€9,200 / $103,460). Al Hoceima region witnessed  waves of demonstrations in 2016 and 2017 to condemn lack of development and social disparities in the region. The protests broke out after the death of local fishmonger Mohcine Fikri, who was crashed in a garbage truck after he jumped in it to save his goods confiscated by authorities.

Casablanca – Last month, Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP) released the unemployment figures for the first quarter of 2019. They told a familiar story: Continued stagnation. Morocco’s overall unemployment rate rose from 9.8% in the last quarter of 2019 to 10% in the first fiscal quarter, where it has hovered for the past few years. This is despite the fact that  Morocco has received millions in loans to address the problem. Since 2014, the rate has hardly changed, averaging a little under 10% for the five-year period and only once dipping under 9%, in the second quarter of 2015. Yet over the past decade, Morocco has seen some of the strongest economic growth in the MENA region. In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that Morocco’s growth rate would reach 4.5% by 2020—the only country in the region expected to see constantly accelerating growth for that period. The kingdom surpassed South Africa last year to become Africa’s leading automotive producer.  That makes Morocco’s unemployment problem peculiar. Despite a growing economy, unemployment rates are unchanged. How is that possible? Dissecting this paradox reveals the complexities and uncertainties of Morocco’s job market, says economists. Gradual improvements
source: tradingeconomics.com Morocco’s unemployment rate since 2014. Data visualization source: TradingEconomics.com. Data matches HCP official records since 2014. Certainly, Morocco boasts some of the lowest unemployment rates among Maghreb – North Africa – region. Unemployment in Tunisia stood at 15.3% in the first quarter of 2019, according to its statistics agency, while Algeria’s most recent figures reported 11.7% unemployment in mid-2018. And the HCP’s first-quarter figures didn’t only bear bad news, Youth unemployment in Morocco reached its lowest level in two years, down to 24.1% from 26% at the end of last year. Unemployment among urban youth also fell this year for the first time since 2016, reaching 40.3%.  These decreases are welcome news for Morocco. Reducing youth unemployment has been a particular economic priority for the government. King Mohammed VI ordered the creation of a government committee to address the issue last year.  But Morocco’s youth unemployment rate is still high, particularly among young people with degrees. Many educated young people leave Morocco in search of work, including more than 600 engineers annually, Minister of Education Said Amzazi said in 2018.  So despite the slight reductions in youth unemployment, it’s clear that Morocco’s unemployment tells a more complicated story. Automation instead of jobs At a Citibank media roundtable in April, Citibank’s senior economist for Africa, David Cowan, told that story. Automation, he said, explains how Morocco’s growth is accelerating with little impact on the job market. This is particularly evident in Morocco’s flourishing automotive and aerospace industries. “You have a car industry that imports its components. Then robots put it together, spray the cars with paint, and you export it. It adds value, but it doesn’t fundamentally change the unemployment rates,” he told Morocco World News (MWN). Though things might be changing, Cowan noted. “That is why the new investment in the automotive components sector that is happening now is so important,” he added. “This has the potential to create more jobs going forward.”  Indeed, Morocco’s automotive sector has lately recorded strong job creation, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, part of the government’s plan to fight unemployment.  “The strong positioning of the industrial sector as a lever for job creation and the professional integration of young people is now strongly supported by the deployment of vocational training, driven by King Mohammed VI,” the ministry said in April. Dependence on agriculture Morocco will need more jobs from industry in order to see net job creation. According to the HCP figures, only 4,000 jobs were created by the industry sector in 2019’s first quarter, compared to the 114,000 jobs in the service sector. Meanwhile, 152,000 people lost their jobs in agriculture and fisheries. That’s Morocco’s other major problem, Cowan said. Morocco’s economy depends on its agricultural sector, which employs over 40% of the workforce. When rainfall is low, job losses spike—leading to decreases like those seen last quarter.  A restrictive bureaucracy also poses challenges for job creation in the kingdom.  “If you talk to any employer in Morocco they’ll tell you that employing additional staff involves meeting a lot of additional requirements, or there are a lot of rules and regulations around it,” he said.  “In that environment, it is often easier not to employ a new worker but to get existing workers to work overtime.” A path forward Easing regulation could be an important solution to job growth going forward, he said, as Morocco looks away from agriculture and towards industry for jobs.  But radical change might be unlikely. Cowan said Morocco often tends towards risk-averse fiscal policy—unsurprising, given the history of political turmoil in the region. “Even though the Arab Spring was nine years ago now, it’s still washing up on our doorstep. The political reverberations of it have not gone away,” he said. “And so it’s going to be a very interesting few years in Morocco on the economic policy front as the government seeks to maintain fiscal discipline, but wants to see growth pick up and unemployment fall.” Whether or not Morocco will achieve this remains to be seen. For now, its unemployment numbers remain a glaring point of focus—for both the government and its citizens.

Rabat – The end of Ramadan is a special event  for the Muslim world, and to properly cap off such a wonderful holiday the start of a new celebration begins. Eid Al-Fitr is a celebrations that gives Muslims everywhere a chance to come together with their families and display acts of kindness and compassion to display their gratitude.   How Moroccans Celebrate Eid Al-Fitr Honey drenched pastries aside, Eid Al-Fitr is most importantly a religious occasion.Some Moroccans wake early and head out to their neighborhood mosque for a morning Eid  sermon and congregational prayers. Following the prayer,Eid Al-Fitr festivities are generally relaxed. Extended family may assemble for happy dinners, beginning with elaborate breakfasts and then later indulging in the main meal of the day; or immediate family may eat at home and afterwards and spend the evening visiting relatives. While gift giving and decorating of homes and open spaces might be normal in the West or different places in the Muslim world, Moroccan holiday observance is not commercialized.It is not common to exchange gifts, especially amongst adults, however many families give gifts to children, for example clothes,or less often, small toys… It is more common for parents and grandparents to celebrate with blessings on children in the form of pocket money.  Zakat Al-Fitr  To guarantee that even the less fortunate have the chance to celebrate the occasion, heads of the household donate food to those who need it. The food usually takes the form of necessities and staples such as wheat or flour.  This act is called Zakat Al-Fitr or Sadaqa Al-Fitr and happenson the day of Eid Al-Fitr. Many families make their donations in the days preceding the Eid. This Zakat serves to cleanse Muslims of any slip-ups during Ramadan. Additionally, Zakat Al-Fitr is given to the poor and needy at the end of the fasting month, Ramadan,so they can celebrate Eid without financial worry. You can start giving Zakat Al-Fitr in the last few days of Ramadan and it must be completed before the Eid Ul-Fitr prayers are conducted; failing to do so invalidates your Zakat. The value of Zakat in Morocco this year is estimated at MAD 13  and usually it is the family breadwinner who makes the donations.  Mohammed the prophet emphasized the importance of delivering zakat, which is obligatory,  before the eid prayer. If the act is performed after the prayers it becomes a kind of charity or “sadaqa”rather than zakat.  Traditional Meals at Eid Al-Fitr  Food is very important to Moroccan culture and family life and preparations for the end of Ramadan see Moroccan women occupied in the kitchen preparing traditional Moroccan pastries, as well as possibly enjoying mint tea in the morning after weeks of caffeine free days.  Others buy treats or desserts from nearby bakeries and arrange the newly bought pastries in tempting spreads.  Although an  Eid supper could consist of a variety of dishes, common choices are couscous, lamb or beef with prunes, chicken with preserved lemons and olives, chicken Bastilla, or lamb or beef brochettes. Eid Al-Fitr makes its way to the White House Another fun fact about Eid Al-Fitr is that its celebrated across the globe.Hillary Clinton facilitated the first Eid al-Fitr at White House in 1996. Afterward, the Clintons proceeded with the tradition each year.  The dinner was attended by the prominent members of the Muslim American community, including politicians , leaders and students. With the progression of time, the Eid al-Fitr supper tradition has proceeded with each president. Geroge W Bush and Barack Obama facilitated the Ramadan supper each time of his administration. No matter, what are the alternative names of this festival, the emotion of every Muslim individual will always remain the same. But still, if you want to cognize what people of other countries say while conveying the best wishes of this occasion, then keep reading. Eid al-Fitr also is known as “Ramazan Bairami” in Azerbaijan, “Lebaran” in Indonesia, “Korite” in Senegal, “Hari Raya Puasa” in Malaysia.

Rabat – On June 4, on the eve of Eid Al Fitr, King Mohammed VI pardoned 755 people, sentenced by courts of law across Morocco, and either currently incarcerated or serving their sentences outside prison. Of those pardoned, 60 are Rif Hirak activists who were sentenced following mass protests in 2016 and 2017 in the northern Rif province. Forty-seven are Jerada Hirak activists, who were sentenced following protests in Jerada in western Morocco in 2017. “In consideration of the family and human circumstances of the people condemned following the events in Al Hoceima and Jerada […], the King has pardoned a number of people who were sentences but did not commit crimes or grave acts during these events,” states an press release from the Ministry of Justice. The Hirak protests started in 2016, when a fishmonger from Al Hoceima was crushed to death by a rubbish lorry as he tried to protect his fish, which had been confiscated by police.  His death led to a wave of anger, with thousands protesting and accusing authorities of “abuse of power and corruption.” Similarly in Jerada, two deaths in a mining accident catalyzed protests against the government, amidst accusations of neglecting the area. During the Hirak protests, hundreds were arrested, and many were sentenced to prison time for “conspiracy aiming to undermine state security,” and “participating in unauthorized protests.”  In August 2018, for Eid Al Adha, the King pardoned 188 Rif Hirak activists. However he did not pardon the leaders of the protest, including Nasser Zafzafi, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Zefzafi appealed the sentence but his appeal was rejected in April this year, sparking protests across Morocco and overseas. It is unclear whether Zafzafi is among the Hirak activists pardoned by the King this year. For Eid Al Fitr, the King has also pardoned people convicted for terrorism and extremism, but who have since participated in a “Moussalaha (reconciliation) program”, and “officially announced their rejection of all forms of extremism and terrorism, as well as their attachment to the Nation and national institutions,” adds the press release.

Rabat – The Moroccan Commission of Education, Culture and Communication adopted a law yesterday confirming that the Tamazight language (also called Berber) is to be written in the “Tifinagh” alphabet. The new law number 26.16 also confirms the integration of Tamazight into the education system and public life more broadly. It was approved by 19 votes. Six voters opted to abstain and no one opposed the introduction of the law. Article-1 defines the Tamazight language as the dialects spoken across the country, as well as linguistic and lexical works created by institutions. Importantly, it confirms that Tamazight is written and read in “Tifinagh.” Tifinagh, or Lybic script was used in the North Africa region from 2000 BC to the 3rd century AD. A modern derivative of the script known as Neo-Tifinagh was re-introduced in North Africa during the 20th century to write Tamazight, which until then was purely an oral language. The use of the Tifinagh alphabet to transcribe Tamazight has been a matter of contention in Moroccan politics.  The conflict came to a head last month when the Party for Authenticity and Modernity (PAM) proposed an amendment to existing law to introduce Tamazight script on Moroccan banknotes and coins. The nationalist Istiqlal Party and the Islamist Party for Justice and Development (PJD) blocked the proposal, as did a number of other parties. According to Abdellah Bouanou, the President of the Commission for Finance and Development in the House of Representatives, the law was blocked because rather than amending existing law to introduce Tamazight script on banknotes, it was more appropriate to wait for the freestanding law n26.16 (which would resolve the matter) to be introduced. “Why rush into introducing an amendment into an ordinary law, which has less legal weight than a freestanding law [law n.26.16]? […] We should just wait for the freestanding law on Tamazight to be introduced,” Bouanou told Moroccan newspaper Media24. Attack on Arab identity Some see the use of the Tifinagh alphabet on banknotes, and more broadly, as an attack on Arab identity, and want the Tamazight language to be written in Arabic script. In response to the proposal to printing banknotes with the addition of the Tamazight language, the famous Moroccan Salafist preacher Hassan El Kattani posted on social media: “ Suddenly, we will find Tifinagh letters printed at our banknotes… a further marginalization and restriction of the language of Islam and Muslims [the Arabic language].” The introduction of law n26.16 yesterday confirms that Tamazight will not be written in Arabic script, but will be written in Tifinagh, ending the debate on the matter. Article-4 of the new law also mandates Tamazight be taught throughout Morocco and across all levels of education. Amazigh has been taught in some schools and universities for a number of years. The new law however officially standardizes its teaching. Tamazight is a key element of the Amazigh peoples’ cultural identity. In 2011, the Moroccan Constitution recognized Tamazight as the country’s official language alongside Arabic. Yesterday’s new law, eight years later, finally provides concrete avenues for the integration of the Tamazight language into Moroccan public life. It is an important step forward for the Amazigh rights movement.

Rabat – Eid al Fitr, a fast-breaking feast marking the end of Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic Calendar, will be celebrated Wednesday, June 05 in Morocco, the ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs announced on Tuesday evening. A statement by the ministry said that the moon-sighting committee confirmed, on Tuesday, Ramadan 29, 1440 hegira, corresponding to June 04, 2018, after the prayer of Al Maghrib, the sighting of the crescent announcing the beginning of the month of Shawoual, 1440 hegira. Sightings of the crescent moon took place on June 4, confirming previous astronomical calculations made by the Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani. Al Ifrani told Morocco World News that Moroccans will celebrate Eid Al Fitr on Tuesday June 4 based on astronomical calculations.  Moroccans will have observed Ramadan for 29 days, abstaining from food and water from sunset to sunrise. Ramadan in Morocco started on May 6, a day later than in most Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Egypt.  When determining the dates of religious celebrations, Morocco relies on a number of observatories besides naked-eye sightings, unlike other Arab countries such as  Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities have allegedly misjudged the correct time for almost 29 years between 1961 and 2004 according to experts.  Morocco, however, made zero error in announcing the official dates for Ramadan and Shawal, according to the Emirati astronomer Mohammed Shawkat. The possibility of crescent moon sighting on June 4 is possible for all Muslim-majority countries, according to the Moonsighting.com.  According to experts from 12 Arab countries, moon sighting was impossible in Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe on Monday, June 3.  In Morocco, Oman, Iran, Bangladesh, Brunei, and Pakistan, the moon was possible to observe on Monday. Therefore, Eid Al Fitr will take place Wednesday June 5.

Rabat – Mohamed Salah rises above past the field of play. The Egyptian, who opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the Champions League final for Liverpool, has been an Anfield symbol since not long after his debut in Liverpool. The effects are even greater for the city all in all, with a fall found in Islamophobia and hate crime. The study by the Immigration Policy Lab of Stanford University, found an 18.9% fall in hate crimes across Merseyside – the English region where Liverpool is set- since the Salah signed with the club. The drop is based on the average rate of violations. The authors of the report, Ala ‘Alrababa’h, William Marble, Salma Mousa, and Alexandra Siegel, clarified their findings.  “Taken together, the evidence points to Salah’s rise in prominence causing a decrease in hate crimes in Liverpool FC’s home county.”  “These findings suggest that positive exposure to outgroup celebrities can reveal new and humanizing information about the group at large, reducing prejudiced attitudes and behaviors.” The study suggests that Salah becoming an idol to many helped fans acquaint themselves with the Islamic people, therefore reducing certain biases.  The investigation looked at 936 reports on detest violations and 15 million tweets from fans over the UK, with another emphasis on 8,000 Liverpool supporters.  All in all, the examination found that Islamophobic tweets from Liverpool fans dropped from 7.2% to 3.4% contrasted with those of other huge English clubs over a similar period, and hate crimes against the Muslim people group dropped by 18.9%.  “Salah is often seen joking with his teammates with a signature grin, entertaining his young daughter on the sidelines, and respecting his opponents almost to a fault, for instance, by refusing to celebrate goals against his former clubs,” read the report, concentrating on the player’s character, as well footballing ability, as a reason that he has been taken to the hearts of Reds’ fans and others.  Salah serenades unite networks  “By watching games, post-game interviews, promotional videos released by the club, and content on Salah’s social media pages, fans are exposed to rich information about Salah’s life on and off the field. Viewers see what a Muslim prayer looks like, perhaps for the first time, when Salah scores,” the study proceeded.  The positive response to Salah from Liverpool fans stems from some ongoing examples in football of racist conduct including insults towards Man City’s Raheem Sterling at Stamford Bridge from Tottenham’s Danny Rose, who said he was looking forward to ending his professional career because of it. Salah scored the third quickest objective of Champions League finals as he set up Jürgen Klopp’s side for their 6th European Cup trophy.

Rabat –  A new documentary, The Trial 2.0, focuses on the impact of the 2013 Charter of Values law created by the Parti Québécois. If passed, public employees would have been banned from wearing symbols of their faith, including the Islamic veil, the Sikh turban, the Jewish Kippah, and large Christian crosses. Ultimately, The Charter of Values did not pass into law.   The Trial 2.0 touches on the role of Internet harassment in relation to a public debate that aired in 2013. The events surrounding the charter highlighted, as Zouaoui puts it, are the “modern challenges of living together.” In an interview, Zouaoui said, “All these people are allowed to speak and their view is valid. But at the same time, what the film says is that you cannot slander or become violent because somebody else doesn’t like you [or your opinion].” Context: The backstory between Quebec’s secularism and the hijab Even though the Charter of Values did not pass, The Trial 2.0 is still relevant. The current Coalition government, Avenir Québec, has recently proposed a similar law under the intention to “separate religion and state,” called  Bill 21. The new law would ban newly hired public employees from wearing religious symbols while holding specific positions of authority. Additionally, in order for citizens to receive public services, they must remove head coverings which hide their face, so that they may be properly identified. The bill has been described as an “ethnic cleansing” for its inherent minimization of diversity. The debate over Quebec’s secularism has been going on for over a decade. Considering that Quebec is indeed a secular state which aims to “attach importance to the equality of women and men.” From this perspective, the veils that Muslim women wear can be seen as a visible denial of this philosophy. The laws, though not an explicit hijab ban, sparked another, more explosive universal debate around disposing of the hijab entirely. The hijab, traditionally a symbol of faith, is already a controversial garment because many against its use view it as something which polices a woman’s natural body for the sake of promoting sexual purity culture. The idea that sexuality should be heavily guarded and therefore women should resist displaying body parts which have the power to charm a man into deviant sexual behavior. Many Muslim women commit to wearing the veil not from being forced, but by their own free will. In the perspective of these women, the hijab liberates women to coexist with men, without inspiring sinful sentiments and gives them a sense of spiritual inspiration. On the other hand, there is some truth in viewing the hijab’s uses as problematic. Quite often, women are being forced to wear the veil, whether by law or family members. Typically, these women are not permitted to publicly express that they are being forced to wear the veil. However, what must be distinguished is that the veil is only an Islamic custom and therefore criticizing it is not necessarily a critique on Islam itself.   As a result, more hijabis, able Muslim women who wear their hijab with a sense of purpose, are becoming vocal and are speaking in favor of their a woman’s choice to wear the veil. All the while, many women do suffer in silence. The debate over the hijab questions whether or not it is overall harmful and oppressive or helpful and liberating for women.  In her documentary, Filmmaker Nadia Zouaoui chronicles the social division around the hijab that the law highlights, especially in the Quebec feminist movements within Islam. Plotline: Internet harassment and Dalila Awada The main subject of the documentary is Dalila Awada, a Quebec Muslim feminist who wears a hijab. Appearing on the popular Radio-Canada TV program Tout le monde en parle, Sept. 29, 2013, Awada debated that women should maintain the right to choose whether they want to wear a hijab. Her opponent was the author and pundit Djemila Benhabib, who argued that the veil is a garment that casts women as temptresses and men as predators. Benhabib argues that the hijab is a symbol “stained with the blood of thousands of women forced to wear it.” After the program aired, Awada faced more intense backlash. Among the backlash were death threats, and insults. Some of the virtual harassment has lead Awada to file $120,000 in lawsuits, for what she alleged were defamatory things that were expressed after she spoke out against the consequences of the charter on the Quebec talk show. In one of her lawsuits, Awada claimed that French actor, Phillipe Magnan, made a video, accusing her of infiltrating the Quebec Federation of Women to advocate in favor of the niqab (a veil covering the face but leaving the eyes visible). Awada also said the video falsely claimed that she associates with the World Islamic League, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Canadian Islamic Congress.  Other lawsuits include one for Louise Mailloux, a Canadian secularist and feminist, who allegedly circulated emails containing erroneous information about Awada. As well, the website Vigile.net, which allegedly published several articles about Awada, portraying her as a manipulator, working for Muslim fundamentalists. Awada said she will donate any money she receives from the cases to the Fondation Paroles de Femmes.  This is a non-profit organization that promotes and defends Quebec women who speak out publicly in support of interfaith and cross-cultural dialogue and against intimidation and harassment. Regardless, Zouaoui said that the film’s debate over the hijab is still yet to be resolved. When asked about her position on the veil and the law, Zouaoui said, “When I go back to my country [of Algeria], or Morocco, I’d say 80 percent of women wear a hijab. Even very young and modern women[…]Philosophically, you could understand that, yes, it could be a sign of oppression, but in a country, in a democracy where people have the right to be and the right to practice their religion, it’s very hard to chase women who wear a headscarf.” Morocco is one of the countries which have banned the sale and production of the full-face veil called a burqa. The ban was designed to fight against religious extremism. The film, The Trial 2.0. is available for paid streaming through Vimeo.

Rabat –  The Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell has reiterated his country’s decision to reinforce the bilateral ties with Morocco at every event possible. At a press conference held in Rabat, Borrell spoke about the “exemplary” Moroccan-Spanish diplomatic ties in “very sensitive” areas. Borell, who met with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita on Monday in Rabat, said that the exemplary relations between Madrid and Rabat include very sensitive areas, especially the management of the migratory inflow. Morocco and Spain have both faced pressure due to the flow of undocumented migrants between their borders. Spain has been also a pro-active voice for Morocco at the European Union (EU). “For Madrid, relations between Spain and Morocco are not only bilateral but rather a matter of state policy and a truly strategic and global partnership,” the Spanish official said. He also expressed his satisfaction with being in Rabat to think about the “future of relations between Morocco and the European Union,” emphasizing that Rabat turned its relations with the EU into a “structuring element” in its foreign policy and a “factor for economic and social development.” Speaking about Spain’s support for Morocco at the EU, Borell emphasized that Madrid has always “stressed the strategic importance of Morocco for Europe.” “Spain supports, with the authorities of the EU, the Moroccan ambitions to intensify the Moroccan-European relations in all areas.” Echoing statements from his Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez,  Borrell considers the EU’s financial contribution to Rabat to be insufficient. “Spain urged the EU to support Morocco in facing the increased inflow of migrants, especially after the migration pressure shifted from the east to the west of the Mediterranean,”  he said. In addition to  Borell, three Spanish officials urged the European Union to provide Morocco with multi-year financial aid to enable Rabat to deal with the pressure of undocumented migration. In May, Spanish news outlet El Pais said that the officials include General Director of International Relations and Immigration of the Ministry of the Interior, Elena Garzón and Head of the General Commissariat of Foreigners and Borders, Juan Enrique Taborda. In a press conference held in May, the spokesperson of the Moroccan government, Mustapha El Khalfi, announced that security services have thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, compared to 88,761 of prevented attempts in 2018. He also emphasized the importance of Morocco and Spain’s efforts to curb the issue, stating that the in the number of irregular migration attempts reflects the “great” effort of Morocco’s law enforcement forces against the issue of undocumented migration and the trafficking networks active in this area. Morocco and Spain maintain good and strong diplomatic ties, which have been further improved after the Spanish royal visit to Morocco in mid-February, when King Felipe VI and his wife, Queen Letizia visited Morocco.

By El Baz Abdessamad Rabat – Bouchamaoui is one of the most important businessmen in Tunisia, whose intervention in the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League between El Ahly and Esperance Tunis has sparked praise from Tunisians. Tarek Bouchamaoui was instrumental in the sanctions against El Ahly, who paid $20,000 in fines, and the suspension of the Moroccan striker Walid Azaro for two games.

The game also resulted in the suspension of the Algerian referee Mehdi Abid Charef by the CAF. 

The match ended with a 3-1 victory at the Borg el Arab stadium for the “Red” team. 

Referee scandals seem to plague the African League. Following the first leg between Wydad Athletic Club and Esperance de Tunis on May 24, the CAF referee committee decided to suspend the game’s referee, Gehad Grisha, for 6 months due to his poor refereeing performance. Tensions rose between the two teams, especially after the events in Rades, Tunisia on May 31, which saw the Tunisian team proclaimed the winner of the African League due to supposed technical problems with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system. After Walid El Katri scored for the Casablanca team in the 59th minute, the referee wrongfully ruled the goal out for outside. The players then demanded the referee consult the VAR system, however, due to technical issues, the system was not working, which complicated the game even further. 

The game was suspended for an hour before the referee, Bakary Gassama, blew the whistle handing the victory to the Tunisian team.

Days after the controversial match, CAF President Ahmad Ahmad, has come out and said: “If somebody did not see WAC’s goal as legitimate, he then should change his hobby and to stop watching football.”  He also added that “the goal was legitimate and the Video Assistant Referee is not necessary to prove that.”

For Moroccan teams and fans alike, this is a case of deja-vu. Tunisian members of the CAF committee have long been known to influence football games in favor of their national teams. 

The former president of the Esperance, Slim Chiboub, admitted that they “ do influence” CAF decisions, and “have always” done so.   Who is Bouchamaoui? Bouchamaoui was born in Buscema, Tunisia in 1966. He received his Ph.D. in the Faculty of Engineering and studied Business Administration. He is also proficient in three languages: English, French, and German. His grandfather, Ahmad Bouchamaoui, founded an engineering company called the Hedi Bouchamaoui Group (HBG). Since then, the family company has been making significant investments in a variety of sectors and “has turned the Group into a portfolio company operating in Automotive Distribution, Agriculture, Real Estate Development, Specialized Distribution, Financial Services, and other participation,” according to the company’s website. Tarek Bouchamaoui, an engineer by trade, is also a member of CAF’s Executive Committee and a member of the International Federation of Football Association (FIFA). Bouchamaoui also chaired the Committee of referees in the Confederation of African Football from 2011 to 2013. In 2017, Bouchamaoui became a member of the FIFA board of the Arabic, Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries. He was also involved in CAF’s Marketing &amp; TV Committee and the Organising Committees for Management of the CAF Club Licensing System and the Interclub Competitions.

Rabat – The President of the Confederation of the African Football (CAF) Ahmad Ahmad said that the president of Esperance Tunis threatened him “in front of witnesses.” Ahmad Ahmad’s statement comes after a backlash against poor referee performance during the Wydad Casablanca-Esperance Tunis second leg final of the African Champions League on Friday, May 31. In a statement to sports news outlet Stad’Afric, Ahmad condemned the absence of the video assistant referee (VAR) in the game. “VAR works everywhere but not in Tunis?” he said. He added that “major presidents of [football] clubs accuse the practices of this club, but we have no evidence.” During the game a referee rejected an equalizer for Wydad Casablanca, suggesting that it was offside. When Wydad Casablanca put pressure on the referees, asking them to check the legitimacy of the goal through VAR, the referees claimed that the technology was unavailable due to technical issues. Ahmed’s remarks followed several other statements, where the CAF president backed Wydad Casablanca. In previous statements, CAF has acknowledged that Wydad Casablanca’s goal during the second leg of the African Champions League final against Esperance Tunis was legitimate. “If somebody did not see WAC’s goal as legitimate, he then should change his hobby and to stop watching football,” he added. The scandal and criticism over the VAR and referees lead CAF to hold an emergency executive committee meeting on June 4 convened by Ahmed  to “discuss regulatory issues” following the EST-WAC game. The president of Wydad Casablanca, Said Naciri, and the president of the Royal Football Federation (FRMF), Fouzi Lekjaa will attend the meeting.

Rabat –  Morocco’s National Zoo in Rabat has announced the birth of a Barbary Macaque on May 28. The zoo shared its exciting news on Twitter yesterday. The Barbary Macaque, or Macaca Sylvanus, is endemic to Morocco, Algeria, and Gibraltar, and is the only species of macaque outside Asia.  In Morocco, it inhabits the cedar forests of the Middle Atlas mountains near Ifrane and west of Marrakech, as well as the Rif Mountains and near Tangier. It is one of the many tourist attractions in the country. According to the High Commission for Water and Forestry, Morocco has lost 65% of its macaque population in the last 30 years, mainly due to deforestation and consequential loss of habitat, but also due to hunting, and illegal traffic. They can sometimes be seen at the Jemaa El Fna plaza in Marrakech, where they are kept on chains, performing tricks or posing for photos with tourists to make money for their handlers. They are also sold illegally in Europe as pets. The species was listed in 2008 as “endangered” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. In 2016 it was also listed as a protected species under the Convention on the International Trade of Species Threatened with Extinction. Despite the listings, numbers have still continued to decrease. Morocco does not have a national strategy in place to protect the species, but NGOs like the Barbary Macaque Awareness &amp; Conservation (BMAC) run education and research programs to help preserve the species.

Rabat – Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has once again recorded a video message addressing all Muslims in Canada and across the globe in the event of Eid Al Fitr. Muslims in Canada are celebrating Eid Al Fitr on Tuesday along with another of other countries. On Monday, Trudeau shared a video message expressing best wishes to all Muslims on Eid AL Fitr. “Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. After a month of fasting and spiritual reflection. Eid is a time for community and celebration,” he said. The Canadian official also said that that the feast is a chance to “honor the values at the heart of Islam- from service and generosity to peace and compassion.” Trudeau repeated a similar sentiment to that in his message expressing best wishes to the Muslim community when Ramadan began, acknowledging that Islamophobia still persists in his country. “Our government will always stand with Canada’s Muslim communities,” he said, adding that  his country will “continue to fight against Islamophobia and hatred in all its forms.” “…And together, we’ll keep building a better Canada.”  Before concluding his message, Trudeau conveyed his family’s wishes to all Muslims, wishing them a “joyful Eid.” At the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan, Trudeau delivered a warm message, and acknowledged the increase of Islamophobia in the country. “For many Muslims, these last few months have been difficult ones.” He said, “communities have suffered hateful, Islamophobic acts of violence-acts that have no place anywhere in our world.”

Rabat –  Qatar will host the next two club world cups this December and December 2020, which will serve as test events for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. These tournaments will consist of only seven competing teams compared to the 32 teams attending in 2022. Despite its smaller size, the competition provides a chance for Qatar to test its facilities. Qatar’s 2022 preparations are taking place amid the Gulf crisis in which four of the nation’s neighbors – the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia – have imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott since June 2017 due to Qatar’s alleged support of terrorist organizations. The nation has assured the public that the land, air, and sea blockade has not hindered its tournament preparations – Qatar has already completed the construction of two of the eight planned stadiums for the World Cup, which is now only 3-and-a-half years away. Another is scheduled to be finished later this year. Qatar won the bid in 2010, becoming the first country in the Middle East to host the tournament and has since been working to make adequate accommodations for the anticipated crowds while improving working conditions for those building the new infrastructure. Qatar introduced a new bill in 2017 that granted minimum wage and legal protection for migrant workers who bear much of this work. The UN International Labor Organization has since dropped complaints against the nation. Preparations include creating stadiums and catering to the needs of visitors, including designating spaces to buy and consume alcohol, which is traditionally not consumed in the country, and developing ways to keep players and fans cool in the desert heat. Tournaments usually take place in June-July, but have been rescheduled for November-December due to the intense summer heat. FIFA had considered expanding the 2022 tournament from 32 to 48 teams, which would require one of Qatar’s neighbors to co-host, but this was met with a variety of complications. The organization ultimately decided to postpone the expansion until 2026. Human rights watchdogs urged FIFA not to grant neighboring countries with worse human rights abuses the privilege of hosting. This, combined with the current tense climate from the Gulf crisis and the general difficulty of neutral neighbors making sufficient accommodations so close to the event made increasing the tournament size unrealistic for 2022.

Rabat – Spain’s Guardia Civil busted four rings composed of 16 members of Moroccan origins on charges of trafficking minors. According to the Spanish news agency Eldiario, the ring, which operated in the Spanish cities of Cadiz, Seville, Morocco, and Gibraltar, smuggled Moroccan minors seeking to reach Europe. The suspects used boats to take kids from the Gibraltar peninsula to cities such as Barcelona, Bilbao or Valencia. According to a statement from Civil Guardia, upon landing in Gibraltar, where the children were kept in houses run by the organization, the ring contacted the families of the children to settle on a price of $600 to $800, before transferring the children to other cities. The ring smuggled the children onboard chartered petras and inflatable boats which were unfit for open water, and at times snuck them in trucks and buses, to transport the minor migrants across the Mediterranean Sea. According to the Civil Guardia, starting at the end of last year, security forces executed a raid on a camp in Seville, where they found that 253 minors had escaped from the reception facilities in Seville. The authorities also nabbed a second organization operating in Algeciras and San Pablo de Buceite village in the province of Cadiz. The ring had branches in Morocco.  Authorities also seized computer equipment and marijuana.  The ring members are being charged with crimes against the rights of foreign citizens, illegal immigration, illegal detention and for belonging to a criminal organization.

Rabat – The Minister for the Reform of Administration and Public Service announced yesterday that Friday June 7 will be a public holiday in Morocco this year. This public holiday will only apply to public service and local body employees. Moroccan public servants may, therefore, have up to three days off this week, because of the public holidays of Eid Al Fitr, which celebrates the end of the holy month of Ramadan.  The exact date of Eid Al Fitr in Morocco is not yet confirmed. Much like the beginning of Ramadan, the end of Ramadan also depends on the sighting of the moon.   If Eid Al Fitr falls on Wednesday, then Wednesday, Thursday and Friday will be public holidays, noting that in Morocco, people get two days off for religious celebrations, as opposed to one day off for national holidays like Independence Day. If Eid Al Fitr falls on Thursday, only Thursday and Friday will be holidays. It is likely Eid Al Fitr will be celebrated on Wednesday June 5, as Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani told Morocco World News this late last month.  Muslims worldwide begin the celebration with Eid prayers at dawn in mosques across the globe. After the Eid prayer, families will come together to share food and celebrate the end of Ramadan. The public holiday on Friday will allow Moroccans to travel across the country if they need to in order to share this moment with their close ones.

Rabat –  The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said in a press conference in Rabat yesterday that Spain is committed to strengthening its consular services in Morocco to face the growing demand for Schengen visas at Spanish consulates throughout the country. Borrell met with Moroccan Minister for Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita in Rabat yesterday, as part of an international forum on strengthening Morocco’s ties with the European Union. Borrell recognized that the Spanish consular services were under pressure from the number of visa applications it received per year.  “We are overwhelmed […]. This year we will receive 250,000 visa applications, which is an annual increase of 10% in recent years,” Borell said in a press release following the meeting. “We apologize to the Moroccan citizens for the delays,” he added, reported Moroccan newspaper Maghreb Associated Press. He assured that the Spanish consular services would do their best to overcome the delays in processing visa applications, adding that a new appointment request system would be set up to shorten delays. In mid-May of this year, Moroccans applying for a Schengen visa were facing up to six months of wait times for their visa appointments at Spanish consular services. At the meeting with the Moroccan Foreign Minister today, Borrell also emphasized the importance of Spain’s broader commercial relationship with Morocco. “For Spain, the relationship with Morocco is a State policy and is based on the commitment to build a global strategic partnership,” he said.

Rabat – The US State Department will now require applicants for US visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses, and phone numbers. Previously, the US State Department only requested social media, email and phone number histories from applicants who were flagged as needing extra scrutiny, such as people who’d traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations.  An estimated 65,000 applicants per year fell into that category, compared to the estimated 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the US each year who will now have to provide the extra information. “National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications, and every prospective traveler and immigrant to the United States undergoes extensive security screening,” the US State Department told the Associated Press.  “We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes to protect U.S. citizens while supporting legitimate travel to the United States.” The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms and require the applicant to provide any account names, as well as their previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, they may have had over the previous five years.  Visa applicants will now also have to provide their international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Rabat – Following the end of Ramadan, Muslims around the world celebrate Eid al Fitr with festivities lasting three or four days. The holiday typically consists of prayer, shared meals, and time with family, though specific traditions vary by country.   In Muslim-majority countries businesses will close. However, as Eid al Fitr is not a public holiday in Western countries most businesses hold normal hours, though some Muslim-owned establishments choose to close in honor of the religious holiday. “A majority of Americans don’t even know eid is so to come into Morocco where it is a Muslim country and, of course it would be, but eid is so highly celebrated, it’s definitely different,” Frannetia Beliard, a student at Florida State University who converted to Islam a few years ago and is working in Morocco for the summer told Morocco World News.  The majority of American Muslims celebrate Ramadan, with 80 percent of adults saying they fast for the month, according to a 2017 study by Pew Research Center.   “That’s not how it should be – that people only celebrate eid and don’t really do the essence of Ramadan,” Belliard said.  “If you’re going to follow the faith follow it one hundred percent – be a Muslim other parts of the year.” The meaning, essence, and fasting are the most important parts of Ramadan for her in America where she said she typically wouldn’t celebrate eid because she is not part of a Muslim community, but is looking forward to the eid celebrations in Morocco. Muslims believe the month of Ramadan is when God first revealed verses of the Quran to the Prophet Mohammed. Believers fast from sunrise until sunset throughout this month as a way to draw closer to God and increase compassion for those in need. In response to recent targeted attacks against Muslims, many mosques in both the US and the UK have heightened security for the month of Ramadan in anticipation of increased attendance at prayer. In the US, Muslims gather at and outside mosques, in parks, and sports stadiums to honor Eid el Fitr. Eid celebrations occur across parks in Europe too – the largest takes place in Birmingham, England where hundreds of thousands of attendees have celebrated together in past years.    The Islamic calendar is determined by the moon, compared to the West’s Gregorian calendar which is set by the sun – the first visible crescent moon marks the start of a new Islamic month.    Eid al Fitr will begin June 4 in the US, and several other countries, including Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Qatar,  and UAE. Other countries like Tunisia, Indonesia, and Australia will celebrate Eid Al Fitr on Wednesday instead. Morocco is expected to announce Wednesday as the first day of Eid Al Fitr, marking the end of the holy month of Ramada.

Rabat –  With the first step of the US Middle East Peace Plan less than a month away, the visit of the plan’s architect, Jared Kushner, to the Middle East has stirred up conflict and protest in both Morocco and the rest of the MENA region. In late June, the US will be co-hosting an economic conference in Bahrain focused on promoting investment into the Palestinian territories as a means of promoting peace in the region and an end to the ongoing conflict. Despite “good” intentions, the plan has been met with much criticism from across the Arab world, with many in Palestine seeing the plan as an attempt to pressure Palestine into conceding to Israel. “This is not a peace plan but rather conditions for surrender,” Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki  said. “And there is no amount of money that can make it acceptable,” he said. Last Friday, on May 31, hundreds of Moroccans gathered in front of parliament to protest the so-called “Deal of the Century” and voice solidarity with Palestinian cause against American meddling in the conflict. However, Kushner’s latest comments have sparked even greater controversy, with the White House Senior Advisor claiming that Palestine would be incapable of self-governance at this point in time. When asked about Palestine’s capacity for self-governance, Kushner responded with: “That’s one that we’ll have to see. The hope is that they, over time, will become capable of governing”. Kushner did comment that he was in favor of Palestinian “self-determination;” however, last month he had indicated that the US would no longer be supporting the long sought after two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority has already promised to boycott the upcoming economic conference in Bahrain and has encouraged other countries in the Islamic world to do the same.

Rabat – Said Naciri, the president of Wydad Atheltic Club (WAC) has commented again on the injustice that his football team experienced last Friday, May 31 in Tunisia against Esperance Tunis. The chairman of the club condemned the absence of video assistant referee technology (VAR) in the second leg final of the CAF-sponsored Champions League, knowing that it is a key element in the competition. On Friday, a referee refused a legitimate goal for Wydad, angering Moroccan football fans and observers, who strongly argued that the decision of the referee was unjust. When Wydad players put pressure on the referee staff to use the VAR, the referees said that the technology was unavailable due to technical issues. The statement over VAR received a backlash, with sports commentators arguing that such issue should have been solved before the game as VAR is necessary for the competition. As a result, Wydadi players refused to finish the game due to the lack of “professionalism” and no concrete reason why the VAR was not functional in an important game. The head of WAC, Naciri, condemned the poor refereeing in the game on Moroccan television channel Medi1 TV. The president said, “all we asked for is the application of the principle of equal opportunities and fair competition.” He added that CAF senior members attempted to convince him and his players to finish the game, promising that WAC would be granted the African Champions League title next year, instead. “All of them, without exception, were asking us to continue the game and next year’s title would be yours,” revealed Naciri. Naciri and his footballers turned down the offer. Afterward, Naciri decided to take the case to high sports authorities to condemn corruption inside CAF. “This is unfair and we will take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and FIFA,” he said.  He also called the outrageous scandal a disgrace for CAF. “It is not allowed to start a match when VAR football system is not working,” said Naciri who was quoted by state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press. Naciri’s statement over the absence of VAR is supported by the Champions League regulations.  Paragraph 15 of Article 2 in the regulations stipulates that “If it is established that the absence of the designated referees was the fault of the host association, the host team shall be declared loser by 2 to zero and shall be eliminated from the competition, regardless of the result obtained on the field.” This provision of the regulations suggests that Esperance Tunis’ win is illegitimate in the absence of VAR, one of the most important elements in the competition. Wydad has not only been deprived of its goal. The club’s fans were also attacked and assaulted when they arrived in Tunisia to cheer-on their team. Angry over the poor refereeing and the CAF offer, Naciri argued that Wydad did not negotiate with CAF members. “We have asked for the application of the principle of equal opportunities and fair competition, and since the first leg was played with the VAR, then the 2nd leg must also be with the VAR, and if there was an issue, we must be informed before the game,” said Naciri on the TV show. Naciri reiterated that the WAC players did not retreat from the game, which is the motive for CAF declaring Esperance Sportive de Tunis (ES Tunis) as the 2019 African Champions League winner. The WAC president has stated that he will explore all options in bringing justice to his team.  Overwhelmed by what happened on Friday’s game, CAF president Ahmad Ahmad sided with Wydad, emphasizing that their goal was legitimate without VAR. Ahmad Ahmad also speculated that what has been happening might be a “conspiracy” against him. He told Morocco’s Al Mountakhab newspaper that he was personally “surprised and angry against all the issues that happened so fast. It appears that there has been something going down against me.” Ahmad also called for an emergency meeting of the CAF Executive Committee, which he will chair on Tuesday in Paris to discuss the EST-WAC issues. The emergency meeting will take place on the sidelines of the 69th FIFA Congress in Paris with the attendance of FIFA President Gianni Infantino. It is expected that the FRMF President; Fouzi Lekjaa, and WAC president, Said Naciri, will take part in the reunion. Also among the delegation is FRMF vice president, Hamza Hajoui, the advisor of Fouzi Lekjaa and director of communication within FRMF, Mohamed Makrouf, and FRMF’s secretary general.   Morocco World News contacted FIFA to inquire whether they received a complaint from Morocco’s Royal Football Federation. FIFA, however, has yet to respond.

Rabat – Thanks to its popularity for walks and picnics, Jnan Sbil in Fez’s medina is always teeming with life. Fez’s wali, Said Zniber, clearly sees even further potential for the park. Last Thursday, Zniber called a meeting with the presidents of the Spirit of Fez Foundation, the Fez-Saïss Association, the Regional Tourist Board of Fes Boulemane (CRT), for a meeting to discuss future animation projects and other ways to improve the park. Presidents of the Agency for the Dedensification and Rehabilitation of the Medina of Fez (ADER), the Euromed University of Fez (UEMF), and the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University (USMBA) were also in attendance. Aziz Lebbar, president of CRT, told the meeting of Fez’s tourism and academic experts “that Jnan Sbil should welcome at least as many tourists as the Majorelle Garden in Marrakech.” “The Jnan Sbil garden could become a hotbed of cultural, musical, and cinematographic animation,” he added. The other officials agreed that “the city of Fez has great tourism potential thanks to its renewed medina and unique sites.” Jnan Sbil is one of the oldest gardens in Fez, having opened to the public in by Moulay Hassan in the 19th century. The garden encompasses 7.5 hectares and is located in the heart of the city, and offer a quiet area filled with plants, fountains, walkways, and orchards in the middle of the bustling city. Thursday’s meeting of tourism officials is part of a larger plan to drive up tourism in Fez, one of the oldest cities in the Muslim world known to as the cultural and spiritual capital of Morocco. In March, Morocco’s Tourism Minister Mohamed Sajid has announced plans to rebuild Fez’s image to increase tourism this year. Sajid’s plan is to “give back to the city its old attractiveness,” according to an official statement on March 3. The city has seen a resurgence of government-funded reconstruction projects. Under King Mohammed VI, an initial MAD 583 million urbanization project was launched in 2018 to give the city a new and attractive look. The project included the renovation of dozens of historical monuments, street maintenance, improved or modernized urban planning, the construction of new parking spots with extended capacity, and reconstruction work in and around the medina.

Rabat – With 30 percent of Maroc Telecom’s ownership belonging to the Moroccan government, the company has long been heavily influenced by the state. This is despite the fact that 53 percent of the company is owned by Etisalat, a company based in the United Arab Emirates. However, Maroc Telecom has recently announced that the Moroccan government would be selling up to eight percent of its stake in the telecom operator, thus reducing the Moroccan government’s ownership to 22 percent. The company has also announced that within the next few weeks, a public offering for the stakes will be put up on the Casablanca Stock Exchange. In 2018, the Moroccan government suffered from a significant budget deficit of 3.8 percent of the country’s GDP, with this number expected to hit 3.7 percent of GDP for 2019.  As a result, the government has planned to pursue a government privatization initiative to increase the state budget by up to $633 million by 2019, in an attempt to lower the deficit to 3.3 percent. The sale of Maroc Telecom shares is only the first part of this initiative, with the government also planning to sell the La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech and the Tahaddart power plant in northern Morocco.

Rabat – Qatar has criticized the outcomes of the emergency summits convened by Saudi Arabia to discuss “aggression” in the region over the weekend. On May 18, King Salman of Saudi Arabia invited leaders of Arab countries and Gulf states for two urgent summits to discuss “aggressions and their consequences” across the region. The meetings’ initiative comes after Saudi Arabia accused Iran of ordering the attacks against the two Saudi oil pumping stations at Yanbu, on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. Qatari Foreign Affairs Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani heavily criticized  Saudi Arabia due to the continuation of Saudi-led blockade against his country since 2017. He said: “The Gulf statement talked about a unified Gulf, but where is it amid the continuation of Qatar’s blockade?” Saudi Arabia along with Egypt, UAE and its other allies imposed a major blockade against Qatar, accusing it of supporting “terrorism.” Qatar also expressed “reservations” about the final statement of the emergency summits over Iran. Qatar’s foreign minister said: “the statements condemned Iran but did not refer to a moderate policy to speak with Tehran.” He added that the summits supports Washington’s policy toward Tehran “and not one that takes the neighborhood into consideration.” Saudi Arabia and UAE argued that the Qatari comment came out of pressure from Iran. UAE foreign affairs minister said in a tweet: “Seems to me that attendance and agreement in meetings and then backtracking on what was decided on is (a result of) pressure on the weak that lack sovereignty or have ill intentions or lack credibility, and it might be all these factors.” Saudi Arabia’s Minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir also criticized Qatar, saying that “countries … during summits announce their positions and reservations in the meetings according to customs and not after the meetings.”

Rabat – Australia’s National Imams Council announced that the country will celebrate Eid al Fitr will on Wednesday, June 5. The National Imams Council took to Facebook to make the announcement, writing: “Tuesday the 4th of June, 2019 will be the 30th and the last day of the Month of Ramadan for the year 1440AH and the day of Eid ul Fitr and 1st of Shawwal 1440 AH will be Wednesday, the 5th of June 2019.” The statement acknowledged the “different opinions amongst scholars” on when Eid at Fitr should start, and that not all imans agree on the “criteria and methodology” the council used to determine the date of Eid. However, the council called for all Australian Muslims to respect different opinions by “avoiding debates that lead to disagreements and misunderstandings” amongst the Muslim community, instead calling for unity among the community in order to be closer to Allah. The Grand Mufti of Australia, Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, wished the Muslim community a joyful and blessed Eid al Fitr and encouraged the community to “engage with their neighbors and friends in displaying the ‘true and peaceful image of Islam, and the true spirit of being an Australian Muslim.” Eid al-Fitr celebrations start at the beginning of the month of Shawwal on the Islamic Calendar, which is based on the moon and lunar cycles. As a result, the date of Eid al-Fitr and the start of Shawwal changes every year. According to the Islamic calendar, the start of the month is marked by the sighting of the first crescent of the full moon. Since the start of the month is marked by the moon, a new month begins in the evening. Astronomical charts and calendars are often used to determine the date in advance.  Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani announced that the crescent moon would be spotted in all Arab and most Muslim countries on Ramadan 29, 1440, which falls on June 4 on the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the first day of Shawwal will fall on June 5 in most Muslim countries as well. Muslims worldwide begin the  Eid celebrations with prayers at dawn in mosques worldwide. Eid is usually a three-day holiday in Morocco, and most Moroccans spend the time being close with their families. After the Eid prayer, families gather around a table full of various Moroccan pastries, cakes, and bread, accompanied by mint tea, milk, and coffee.

On June 14 every year, countries around the world celebrate World Blood Donor Day, thanking donors around the world and raising awareness of the global need for regular blood donations. While blood transfusions save millions of lives every day, hospitals still face shortages of blood and many patients suffer and die because timely blood is not available. Blood shortages are especially worse around the world over the festive periods of the year, where holiday schedules keep people busy with family and friends and away from blood donation centers.  Christmas and New Years are critical blood shortage periods in Western countries. For Muslim countries, the Eid celebrations, and the month-long celebration of Ramadan put significant pressure on blood supplies. Morocco has found a solution. Since 2013 the country has met all of its blood needs during the month of Ramadan, thanks to a national scale blood donation program in mosques. Blood donations in mosques is not a new concept, and many mosques in Morocco and overseas set up ad-hoc blood collection days. However, the national-scale Ramadan blood collection program, developed by the Moroccan National Blood Transfusion and Hematology Center (CNTSH), is a world first and its success is inspiring other countries to set up similar initiatives. Dr Najia El Amraoui, the Head of Communications at the CNTSH, the national body that coordinates all transfusions across Morocco, is behind the project and she has been following its progress since 2013. Blood shortages during Ramadan “Before 2013, Morocco was experiencing severe blood shortages during the month of Ramadan because we couldn’t find enough donors,” El Amraoui told Morocco World News. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise until sunset, when they break their fast with the “iftar” meal. In the evenings, many go to the mosque for the usual ‘Icha evening prayer, and the special Ramadan Taraweeh prayer, which can last well into the night. “We couldn’t collect in the day because people were fasting, so instead we would try collect after iftar,” El Amraoui explained. It is important for the donors to have eaten before they donate so that they can maintain their blood sugar levels throughout the process. “But in the evenings [after the iftar meal] it’s hard for people to come into the blood center. After iftar, people prefer to go to the mosques to pray. So this when we decided that we would go to them.” In 2013, CNTSH set up the first national scale Ramadan blood donation program, sending medical teams to mosques across the country every night to collect blood from people attending the evening prayer. The program is in addition to the blood donations that CNTSH coordinates all year around at donation centers across the country, and on an ad-hoc basis in mosques, for instance after the Friday prayer. Bigger mosques, more donors The program was launched in collaboration with the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Promotion of Social Work by Religious Officials. The Foundation, which works under the Ministry for Islamic Affairs, identifies mosques that are suitable for the program. “We choose the bigger mosques, the ones that receive many people. The Foundation has lists showing where people go to pray,” El Amraoui explained. The Foundation also works with the mosques’ religious leaders, Imams, on how to raise awareness about the program. Imams read out special requests during prayer time, explaining the need for blood and asking people to make a donation. After praying, people can then approach the CNTSH team and sign up to make a donation. Every night, CNTSH sends out two medical teams to each chosen mosque, one to work with the women, and one to work with the men, who each pray in different parts of the mosque. The program is so successful that CNTSH often has more donors than the teams can manage. “Our team can’t take blood from all the donors. The time period between when we start and suhoor [the sunrise prayer] is limited. We start the collection around 9.30pm and our team stays until 4.00am or 5.00am. Sometimes there are too many donors.” The goal is for each team to get 120 donations per mosque, per night, noting the total objective for Ramadan is to get 13 000 donations from the mosques, and 10 000 donations from our other units, El Amraoui explains. This amount covers all blood needs during Ramadan. “Our biggest donation drive ever was 347 donations from the one mosque over the duration of 4 or 5 hours,” she proudly adds.  The teams are committed to the project, and work long hours overnight throughout the month to reach the donation goals.  The team members, who usually work during the day for the center, do get advantages like bonuses and one-day-on one-day-off rosters. However, El Amraoui recognizes that they are still working at times where they could otherwise be celebrating Ramadan with their families and friends. “The work the team does is exceptional. We are very grateful to the staff because they are making a big effort,” El Amraoui says. The CNTSH makes sure to thank all those involved. At ceremonies after Ramadan, they award trophies and certificates to all the participating mosques, to foster a sense of group achievement and encourage participation in the program. “Every mosque gets a personal thank-you letter from the center, and we also thank the  Foundation and the Ministry of Islamic Affairs for their help.” A world first El Amraoui is proud of the mosque donation program. “We are the first country to have launched a national scale program like this,” she notes. Recognizing its success, France and Belgium have set up similar initiatives. El Amraoui is preparing for an upcoming conference at the French Blood Foundation, where she will present the project and share insights into its operations. “It is a very successful project, and the figures are excellent” she says, smiling. And it’s not just about the figures. The program also promotes ethical and safe blood donation as 100% of the donations made in the mosques are voluntary. While illegal in Morocco, in many countries across the world including the United States, people can sell their blood and plasma. Remuneration for blood donation raises serious ethical and health issues. Studies have also shown that paid donors are more likely to lead lifestyles that expose them to the risk of HIV and other infections that could be transmitted through their blood, notes the World Health Organization (WHO). The issue is, a paid donor is less likely to reveal reasons for which they might not be suitable to donate blood, as they are motivated to protect their income stream. This is why global organizations like the WHO strongly advocate for global blood donation to be on a 100% voluntary basis. Morocco’s mosque donation program fits in perfectly with this goal. What’s next? El Amraoui hopes that in future the program will grow. Simply put, more donations, more blood, more lives saved. “We want to increase the size of the teams and the number of mobile units that we can set up near mosques,” she says. CNTSH has the expertise, but funding is the issue. The center runs on state funding throughout the year, but does not get any extra money for the Ramadan project, so it does all the work during the month within its existing means. Right now though, El Amraoui just wants to share the idea of the project with the rest of the world, and she hopes to see other countries set up similar initiatives. It’s about the patients really, she says. “We just want to share our experience. It’s our legacy.”

Rabat – Murad Rais was a pirate born in the Netherlands in 1575. He fought the Spanish Empire alongside his Dutch troops and, after his arrest in 1681 near the Canary Islands, joined the Ottoman pirate ships. He was transferred to prison in Algiers, the capital of the regional Ottoman Eyalet, or state, at the time. There he declared his conversion to Islam, thus becoming Murad Rais and joining another Dutch pirate, Suleiman Rais, who took him under his wing. The two worked together until the death of the latter in a battle in 1619.  Afterward, the city of Algiers signed peace agreements with several countries, declaring the end of piracy and all interception of civil and commercial European ships. So far, the biography of Murad Rais is as ordinary as one of hundreds of European pirates who had willingly, or under duress, renounced Christianity. Thus, his biography does not include any distinction or major achievement that would change his life or the lives of those around him. However, his arrival in the Moroccan city of Sale would be a turning point in his life. There, he would become the President of the Republic of Bouregreg, also known as the Republic of Pirates of Bouregreg between 1624 and 1627. This event honored him and inscribed his name in the history books as a non-Moroccan embraced by Morocco and given significant diplomatic status.   To understand the life of Murad Rais, it is necessary to tackle the historical features of his era, which contributed to the prominence of his leadership and negotiation qualities, his mastery of several languages, as well as the geography of many countries, whether in the Mediterranean or the Atlantic.  On the other hand, to the creation of a collective ruling system on the banks of the River of Bouregreg, in the so-called Republic of Bouregreg. In other words, there are many important factors relating to Murad Rais’ life, and to its political context.  On the personal level, it appears that Murad Rais converted to Islam by conviction, and contributed to the conversion of many of his fellow inmates during his imprisonment. We can see from several instances in his life that Rais was a sharp person, a quality that enabled him to develop a significant network of friends, especially in piracy, and negotiation for the release of captives. As a result, a form of deployment was established throughout the Mediterranean, especially in Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, the Balkans, Cyprus, Tunisia, and of course Algeria, in addition to the Netherlands and the eastern Iberian Peninsula, especially the Cartage region (Murcia region), home of his second wife who was a Morisco. Concentrating on historical context, the era witnessed the mass exodus and mass migration of Andalusian Muslims in phases from the reign of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel in 1492 to 1609, the year when King Philip III issued a royal decree whereby the final expulsion of Muslims from Andalusia was implemented.  This expulsion was an example of mass migration which was embraced by the Maghreb throughout its different regions and across its countries. This period also witnessed major historical events, such as the conflict between The Muluk Al Tawaif, The Fitna of al-Andalus, minor wars and major wars such as the Battle of Zallaqa / Sagrajas during the days of Yusuf bin Tashfin Almoravid. The location of the city of Sale on the Atlantic Ocean and its difficult strait piqued the interest of the Hornachos, the Muslims of the Extremadura region, who were powerful in war and considerably wealthy. They brought their wealth with them to Morocco, preceding the Moriscos (inhabitants of Granada) who left all their money and belongings in Andalusia, hoping to return someday. Upon the arrival of the Hornachos and the Moriscos to Sale, the face of the city, its architecture and residential neighborhoods changed, and new professions related to the maritime field such as shipbuilding, maintenance, furnaces, and baths were introduced. This made Salé a piece of Andalusia, both in terms of architecture and daily life as they established a collective ruling system composed of 14 Navy commanders who would elect an Admiral to become President of the Republic of Bouregreg. Ibrahim Vargas, a Hornachi Andalusian, was the first leader of this political entity until 1624. The Hornachos had practiced piracy, especially against Spanish ships, as a form of revenge against those who had expelled them from their homes in Andalusia. They were joined by many European pirates, particularly the Dutch. All these practices were with the blessing of the Saadi Sultan bin Zaidan, who was in conflict with his brother Sheikh Al-Ma’mun who, in turn, was involved with the Spanish in the so-called “Larache issue” and the resulting tension and insecurity. This dragged the country into a state of political, economic, and military weakness which was less extreme than the aftermath of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur al-Sa’adi winner of the Battle of Oued al-Makhazin. So, the dispute of Ahmad al-Mansur’s sons over the throne and their conflict put the Saadi state on its deathbed paving the way for the birth of the Alaouite Sherifian State. Sultan bin Zaidan al-Nasser used the Hornachos in his war against his brother, Sheikh Al-Ma’moun, allied with the Spanish, which contributed to the consolidation of the former’s power in the city and their independence from the central authority. Here, the name of Murad Rais, the experienced pirate, smart negotiator and figure of a great history of naval jihad against the Spaniards and Portuguese, will arise. Murad would, thus, become a significant figure in an important historical period and an important political dynamo and diplomat, especially if the theory of his marriage to the daughter of Sultan Zaidan in 1642 is valid.  The validity of this marriage is strengthened by the fact that it coincided with his presidency of the Republic of Bouregreg 1624/1627, making Murad Rais a military ally, a deputy and a commander to the Sultan in the Republic of Salé, and the custodian of the collection of the tenth of the spoils of war for the treasury of the Saadi State. Moreover, all of Murad Rais’ qualifications, including multilingualism, good conduct, and negotiation experience would qualify him for diplomatic missions and enable to bring about the Moroccan / French agreement of 1631 between Louis XIII and Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik II Saadi. Murad Rais returned to piracy or naval jihad at the head of 18 small ships and reached Iceland, British Baltimore, Sardinia, and Corsica between 1631 and 1635, where he was arrested by the Knights of Malta and imprisoned for five years. After that, Murad Rais returned to Morocco in 1640, a 70-year-old burdened by the experiences of many years, and was appointed by the Moroccan Sultan as governor of Al-walidia region and inhabited its castle. In October of the same year, the new consul of the Netherlands visited the Republic of Bouregreg, asking for Murad Rais bringing Jan Janis / Murad Rais a dear guest, his daughter Lisbeth born in 1596 of his Dutch first wife. When Lisbeth entered, she found her father Murad Rais sitting on sofas and pillows of silk and surrounded by servants and all manifestations of wealth. She left the castle of Al-walidia in August 1641 after her father chose to stay in Morocco, a country which embraced him, raised him to the highest ranks of the state, respected him in his later years and bestowed upon him all aspects of respect and loyalty. He simply chose to be Moroccan because the Moroccan culture is capable of assimilation due to its diversity and flexibility, which has made Morocco a home for international figures who have enriched the intellectual, political and artistic fields. There are also great international politicians and Western intellectuals who preferred to be buried in Morocco or to spend their last days there. As an example, we recall the French Marshal Lyautey and the first resident-general in Morocco who requested to be buried in the country. His wish was respected until the year 1961 when his remains were transferred to France at the request of General De Gaulle. Murad Rais is a striking example of how Morocco is a warm environment for those who resort to it or choose to be Moroccan, how it assimilates all those who wish to contribute to a decent living and social peace, and how the country not only exports Moroccan figures, such as Hassan al-Wazzan, Al Idrissi, Ibn Battuta, and others, to the world to influence it positively; but is also a great place made of hopes and dreams, and Murad Rais is not the first, and will not be the last traveler;  to pass by or to settle in this welcoming place.

The Superior Council for Audiovisual Communications (CSCA) has suspended the Moroccan radio program “Bismilah Ouraqik,” broadcast by Moroccan radio channel MFM, after complaints of “charlatanism.” The Moroccan Federation for Consumer Rights made a complaint to CSCA about the  program for promoting charlatanism and exploiting listeners in a way that could put their health in jeopardy. During May, the radio program gave listeners “cures” to a number of health ailments including “sterility,” “mental health problems,” “food poisoning,” “hemorrhages,” and “colon problems.” As an example, on March 12, the program told listeners that “for women who have problems with bleeding or lethargy […] drink a mixture of orange blossom water and home-made vinegar, as well as Roqya (blessed water).” The program also gave “cures” to some listeners who shared their health issues with the radio station by SMS and telephone. To get rid of djinns (evil spirits), the program suggested drinking rose water and olive oil and eating nigella seeds, either before breakfast or after dinner. In its decision published on May 23, the regulator CSCA found that the radio program’s content was inciting listeners to adopt health practices that could be dangerous to their health. As a result, the CSCA suspended the program for one week. The regulator expressed concern that the radio program was “normalizing” non-medical treatment in a way that could lead listeners to neglect professional medical advice. CSCA had issued a warning to MFM radio channel on January 9, about previous episodes on similar topics.

By Najoua Bijjir Ericeira – After a career in the Netherlands as a model, an anchor, a TV reporter, and an actress, Sanae Orchi (29) radically changed course. Trading off her glamorous career in order to dedicate her life to … yoga!  “I believe that every time you express your gratitude and act upon it, that gratitude will return to you in various ways.”  What caused you to dramatically change your life? I grew up in a poor but very supportive family. As a young girl, I was driven to work hard and make the best of my life. I studied hard, went to university and obtained my degree in economics.  At the age of 25, I was modeling and I was also able to pursue a career in television. At the time I had it all: travel all over the world, nice clothes, and a fiancée. Everything I had fit in this perfect picture, and I was living a successful life. Yet somehow it all seemed wrong because I felt very imbalanced, empty and unsatisfied. I was unhappy and I determined that my career and my lifestyle were not working for me. One day I was enjoying the company of my mother, who suddenly expressed her worries about society as if it was doomed. I literally heard my mother repeating the defeatist news she heard on TV. I realized that I was the anchor and reporter that was partly responsible for reproducing all those headlines, all those frightening stories that weren’t necessarily true.  You see, news is based on a very small percentage of what happens in the world and that does not reflect every-day life. From that point on I decided I didn’t want to be responsible anymore for influencing people’s reality. I changed my job and my circle of influence and changed my life completely. I changed myself.   What was the big change?   I felt like there was more to life than 9/5 jobs, media, and business. I wanted to understand the world better. I wanted to understand why I had these empty feelings, while others thought I had it going on. I used to be a rebel and I was focused on making statements to try to change things. But I learned that if you desire a better world, you shouldn’t talk about war nor protest against it. You should put your effort into making peace.  I started reading a lot of books. All sorts of books! I studied my religion, Islam, but also about other cultures and religions. Understanding others made me better understand myself. Everybody struggles with their own inner battles at some point in their lives. I believe that personal crisis is a crisis of consciousness and inability to directly experience our true nature. Yoga really helped me to discover and unlock my potential. I tried different styles of yoga to explore my body.  I wanted to learn about the power of the mind so I tried very old meditation techniques as well as modern methods. I started to see things differently, do things differently. It opened my mind to change and allow myself to grow. Now I’m sharing my experiences and knowledge with others to support them in their growth and their journey.  What does yoga represent to you? To me, yoga isn’t just a physical &amp; mental workout. It’s a spiritual practice that helps you understand yourself on a deeper level. It’s also a way to detox your body by removing negativity. In this time of smartphones and screen-time, I see a lot of people unable to find balance between reality and virtual reality. Staring at a screen for hours a day, losing complete contact with your own body and the actual world that surrounds you leaves you lost and alone. It’s not surprising that the number of psychological disorders is increasing, and more and more often young people suffer from them; You became an African Yoga instructor. What is African Yoga? The African yoga I teach is actually called Smai-Tawi. During the time I was reading a lot, I also read about African history. There I discovered that yoga originated in ancient Egypt, a country that covered large regions of Africa. The geometric positions and postures that are found in the hieroglyphs and temple walls of Ancient Egypt are some of the earliest manifestations of yoga before it’s migration to India.   I was curious about Smai Tawi, so I decided to study it. I traveled all the way to Jamaica, where I followed an intensive course on the philosophy and practices of African yoga.  There are a number of differences in the positions, things you normally do not see in regular yoga. We also use controlled breathing techniques while doing physical exercises. You travel around the world giving yoga-classes. How do you manage all that? I teach yoga and give lectures on personal development. This week I’m teaching in Portugal, and I just came back from Ibiza and Edinburgh. In the upcoming weeks, I’ll be delivering a boot camp in England surrounded by nature. I’ve also been invited to speak about Smai Tawi at Breaking Convention and Noisily Festival. If you’re doing what you like it’s not hard to manage. I love practicing and teaching yoga. Sharing this with other people helps me to continue my own development. Celebrities approach you often in order to coach them. Who are these celebrities? I can’t mention their names but mostly artists, athletes, and entrepreneurs hire me to help them with their personal challenges. We use yoga and meditation to identify and alleviate their blockages. So far it has been proven to be very effective. The body movements and controlled breathing can bring one into an altered state of consciousness, helping us to connect with our true essence— who we are behind all the titles, roles and responsibilities. How do you combine teaching yoga, traveling and fasting for Ramadan?  It’s actually the perfect combination. But it’s not easy, and I’ve had my challenges.  I love traveling to sunny places, but right now I’m on a mountain hiding in the shade. Ramadan, in essence, is a very spiritual month. It’s more than just fasting to me. It is a month where you detox both body and mind. It’s easy to stop eating and drinking between sunrise and sunset. It’s more challenging to control your own feelings, such as mood swings, aggression and sexual temptations throughout the day. During Ramadan people are challenged to deal with these emotions, instead of eating and drinking them away. This makes you spirituality stronger. Yoga gives me energy, mental clarity, and discipline needed to direct my actions towards the goals I set for myself.  My biggest goal during Ramadan is to express my gratitude. For example, I’m grateful for being granted food, so I don’t want to waste it. I appreciate the company of family, so I put extra effort in getting together with them. I’m grateful for my health, so I fuel my body with healthy foods and exercise.  I believe that every time you express your gratitude and act upon it, that gratitude will return to you in various ways.

Rabat – Israeli security forces assaulted Palestinian worshipers in the Aqsa mosque compound on Sunday.  Israeli troops accessed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound with hundreds of Jewish settlers to mark what they call the “reunification of Jerusalem.” Omar Kiswani, head of Al Aqsa Mosque told Anadolu Agency that nearly 1,179 Jewish extremists stormed the compound since [Sunday] morning.” He added that the settlers, who were protected by Israeli police, broke into the compound in a “massive violation of the holy month of Ramadan.” Israeli forces also “assaulted” worshipers, and had reportedly fired “teargas.” Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Palestinian Authorities condemned the Israeli attack on al Aqsa mosque. “We hold the Israeli occupation government fully responsible for the serious of escalations in Al-Aqsa Mosque as a result of continuing incursions and attacks on worshippers by extremist settlers under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces,” spokesman of the Palestinian President Nabil Abu Rudeineh said on the attacks. He also warned of the “ dangerous consequences of Israeli practices that could drag the region into a new cycle of violence.” The spokesman of the presidency  also called on the international community to “shoulder its  responsibilities in this regard and pressure Israel to stop this policy.” The attack comes amid promises to improve the situation for Palestinians, especially from the US. Later this month, the US will organize an economic forum in Bahrain to unveil its peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Bahrain economic conference seeks to serve as a platform where the US will feature the advantages of the’ Deal of the Century’. The symposium will hold workshops to convene finance ministers and regional business leaders to  discuss the economic future of the region. Palestinian authorities, however, condemn that the US organized the forum without including them in it. The authorities also urged Arab states to boycott the forum, emphasizing that the US could not be successful as a mediator in the conflict.This is especially after the Trump administration’s decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and the proclamation that recognizing Israel’s control over the occupied Golan Heights.

Baggage handlers at Casablanca’s Mohammed V International Airport went on strike this weekend. This caused flight and baggage delivery delays for the national airline company Royal Air Maroc (RAM), angering passengers at Morocco’s largest airport. RAM denies responsibility for the delays, shifting blame on its subcontractor General Private Interim (GPI), the company responsible for RAM’s baggage handling services at Casablanca airport. “A number of flights have been delayed and baggage delivery has also been delayed due to these untimely strikes that have continued through to Sunday,” RAM said in a press release. Flights were delayed “despite the intervention of airport authorities,” it added. RAM’s reputation is however bearing the brunt of the strikes. Angry passengers expressed their frustration on Twitter. “[…] Get your services on the ground perfected, it has been 3 hrs waiting for the luggage on AT728 after waiting 1 hr to get off the plane #getyouracttogether #royalairmaroc look at your dissatisfied #passengers #visitmorocco,” tweeted one user. RAM and its baggage handling subcontractor GPI have been butting heads since mid April over contract terms, each accusing the other of not respecting its obligations.   GPI accuses the airline of imposing additional work on baggage handlers without fair remuneration and baggage handlers want a pay rise to reflect what they feel is an increased workload.  RAM accuses GPI of breaching the contract by intentionally slowing down its baggage handling services and causing flight delays. The strike this weekend shows the companies have not resolved their disagreements since the two strikes by GPI in April. Any more strikes will put pressure on RAM, especially as peak summer travel season approaches.

Rabat – Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) dismantled on Monday, June 3, a three-member terrorist cell in Morocco operating in Moroccan cities of Errachidia and Tinghir, in the region of Drâa-Tafilalet.   According to the  BCIJ statement, the three members had links to the terrorist organization of the Islamic State (ISIS).  The “extremists,” according to the statement are aged between 26 and 28. They were planning to carry out terrorist attacks across the country, said the statement. Preliminary investigations show that the cell was propagating extremist rhetoric. The BCIJ added that they were involved in preaching activities, seeking to recruit new members, and mobilize them for potential future attacks. The suspects were placed in custody for further investigation.  The latest raid was in last April, when Moroccan authorities arrested a suspect in the city of Dakhla for his connection to a six-member terrorist cell that operated in Salé, Rabat’s twin city, which police dismantled the same day.

Rabat – President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Ahmad Ahmad has acknowledged that Wydad Casablanca’s goal during the second leg of the African Champions League final against Esperance Tunis was legitimate. In a statement to Moroccan sports news outlet Almountakhab, the CAF president said: “If somebody did not see WAC’s goal as legitimate, he then should change his hobby and to stop watching football.” “The goal was legitimate and the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) is not necessary to prove that,” he added. Ahmad also hinted that issues like what happened during the game have opened room for doubt. “I no longer know what has been happening.” “Personally, I am surprised and angry against all the issues that happened so fast. It appears that there has been something going on against me.” Friday marked a scandal after notable refereeing mistakes during the EST-WAC match, which stirred controversy. During the game EST took the lead during the 41st minute of the game to score a goal. In the second half, Morocco’s WAC was able to score an equalizer, which was rejected by Gambian referee Bakary Gassama, who refused to review Walid El Karti’s header through VAR, a necessary element during the competition. The decision upset WAC players who refused to refuse to resume playing until the referee has reviewed the goal.  The scandal and criticism urged CAF to announce its decision to hold an emergency executive committee meeting on June 4 convened by CAF President to “discuss regulatory issues” following the EST-WAC game.

Rabat – The men who filmed themselves “bathing” on a bus linking Agadir to Inezgane, which went viral on social media, will face legal repercussions. On Friday, police arrested the two men in the video, aged 21 and 22, for causing public outrage to modesty and morals. According to a statement from the Director General of the National Security (DGSN), Inezgane authorities acted swiftly in investigating the video, gathering statements from the bus driver and a legal representative of the transport company. The defendants were placed in custody following the investigation under the supervision of the competent public prosecutor, while the details of the case are determined. The two young men explained their actions to Cap24TV. “We were working on a short film. We filmed several scenes in different places. The actions that took place in the bus was part of these scenes. We warned the passengers and the driver that it was a movie,” one of the men said.  “By the way, the passengers didn’t mind at the end and took selfies. But a malicious person filmed on the bus and swayed everything on social networks,” he added. “We were insulted by everyone, they even insulted our parents … we did not think at all that would happen there. We apologize to the people who saw the video without understanding the context.” “We had no intention of giving a bad image of Moroccan youth. Our parents did not tell us anything, but they were sad to see the situation.”

Rabat – Moroccan leading state-owned television channel 2M received a warning from the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication’s (HACA) Higher Council (CSCA) over what it called a “clandestine advertisement” during the cooking game show “MasterChef Maroc.” HACA issues in a statement that the segment of MasterChef Maroc broadcast on 2M on March 19 has “violated the legal provisions and regulations” relating to the sponsorship and television advertising. The statement reads that a member of the jury and one of the competitors of the cooking game show made hidden references promoting a residential complex in which the show was recorded.  The show, HACA warned, contained “promotional” language, presenting the resort’s credentials as “exceptional” containing a “football and gold pitch,” “overlooking the beach,” and boasting “lots of activities.” Some of the competitors launched into effusive descriptions of the commercial entity as “beautiful” and “pleasant.” HACA noted that the show also made heavy use of “sonorous” phrases which inspire a “direct” promotional intent to the products the segment contains.

Rabat – The Algerian Constitutional Council stated that a presidential election would not be able to take place on July 4 due to a lack of valid candidates. The council announced the decision on Sunday amid continuous protest against the interim government. The decision might result in an extension of the rule of Abdelkader Bensalah, who was appointed interim president upon the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Protests have been sweeping across Algeria since February 22 as demonstrators call for radical change from Bouteflika’s government and its elites. Protesters have called for a boycott of the election. The Algerian Constitutional Council shared in a televised statement that the election was “impossible” on the previous announced date as the two candidates were deemed “invalid.” Friday, May 31 marked 15 weeks of protests in Algeria. The interim government deployed dozens of police troops to crack down on the peaceful protests. Police have also arrested many demonstrators during the protests.

Rabat – French authorities have stripped a defendant of Moroccan origin convicted for conspiring to join terrorists in Afghanistan, of his French nationality. AFP reported that the dual national was sentenced in 2014 to five years in prison for planning to join jihadists in Afghanistan. The defendant was arrested in Pakistan in 2012 along with two other French nationals. It is possible for French authorities to deprive people of citizenship if the individuals have acquired French citizenship for specific reasons including treason and terrorism. AFP said that deprivation of French citizenship could occur if the alleged acts occurred “within 15 years after the acquisition of the citizenship.” Quoted by the news outlet, French Ministry of the Interior said that there have only been 13 cases of citizenship deprivation between 1996 and 2016. The individuals who were deprived from French citizenship were convicted of terrorism, including five sentenced in 2015. Authorities, however, would be helpless to deprive individuals individuals born in France. The Economist reported in February 2016 that the French government has “undertaken a raft of counter terrorism measures” after November 2017 attacks in Paris. The proposal to strip French-born dual citizens of French nationality in the case of terror crimes, according to the news outlet, “divided French political parties.” Some French citizens condemned that the proposal targeted French citizens from North African countries. “Many French citizens with dual citizenship from North African countries sense that they—not Franco-Germans or Franco-Americans, say—are the only dual citizens that lawmakers really have in mind,” said the Economist.

Rabat – The latest issue of the weekly magazine Jeune Afrique devoted its cover to the Director of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) and the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST), Abdellatif Hammouchi. The feature story describes a day in the life of “King Mohammed VI’s supercop.” Hammouchi reportedly starts his day at headquarters of the DGSN, in downtown Rabat. He spends half his day there, before heading to his second responsibility at the DGST headquarters in Temara. “The most senior police officer of the kingdom is also the most senior intelligence agent. An unprecedented number of positions entrusted to one person that speaks volumes about the trust placed in him by King Mohammed VI,” Abdelhak El Khiame, the Head of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ), told Jeune Afrique. “This is a model that has undeniably proved its worth and is envied by other countries,” he added. “Having a single decision-maker at the head of these two strategic branches opens the bridges of collaboration.” Jeune Afrique’s feature is a rare insight into the life of a man who is usually very private. Hammouchi has never given an interview and rarely receives journalists. In contrast, Jeune Afrique’s feature points out, the Director tries to ensure the DGSN is more transparent than ever. “With Hammouchi, our motto is to hide nothing from public opinion except what is prohibited by law, whereas before we only communicated the strict minimum of what the law provides,” explained Boubker Sabik. Hammouchi’s career with the DGST began almost three decades ago in 1991. Those who have worked with him describe him as “gifted” with incredible analytical skills, with a particular focus on Morocco’s jihadist groups, that propelled his rise through Morocco’s security ranks according to Jeune Afrique. “He is unbeatable on terrorist networks. He is always able to quote you, from memory, the names of the members of a cell, to trace their course and their relations with other groups fighters,” a former employee of the Interior Ministry told the weekly publication. His skills are so impressive, that America’s CIA reportedly tried to poach the gifted “supercop.” George Tenet, the director of the US’s renowned intelligence agency from 1997-2004, allegedly offered Hammouchi US citizenship and a high position in Washington at one point. Hammouchi, however, refused the prestigious offer, saying “Moroccan I was born, Moroccan I will stay, and Moroccan I will die,” according to Jeune Afrique. His loyalty to his country paid off. When he was made the director of the DGST in 2005, at just 39 years old, he not only became the youngest intelligence head that Morocco has ever known, but also earned a place among the youngest intelligence heads in the world. While Hammouchi has been widely credited for the reform and incredible effectiveness of both the DGST and DGSN, he has also been subject to criticism. In February 2014, France accused the widely respected intelligence officer of “complicity in torture” for his alleged involvement in the torture of activist Ennaama Asfari. French police officers went as far as delivering a summon of Hammouchi to the Moroccan Ambassador in France’s residence. The accusations caused a diplomatic rift between the two allied countries, and Morocco briefly suspended all judicial cooperation with France. The accusations caused such offense that protests broke out in front of the French Embassy in Rabat and French President at the time, Francois Hollande, had to call King Mohammed VI in attempt to repair the situation. Holland insisted he was unaware of the police summons against Hammouchi. Just a year later, France had changed its tune regarding Hammouchi. After Moroccan intelligence revealed the location of Abdelhamid Abaaoud and his accomplices, the terrorist mastermind the November 2015 Paris attacks, Patrick Calvar, the head of the Directorate General of Internal Security told Hammouchi he had “saved France.” Jeune Afrique’s feature on Hammouchi is the latest of many glowing profiles in international media of the security powerhouse. In April, Jeune Afrique also labeled him a “terrorists’ worst nightmare.” “If Morocco features today at the forefront in terms of anti-terrorism, it owes it in large measure to his incomparable knowledge of the Islamist network,” Jeune Afrique’s April article on Hammouchi added. In July 2018, the Italian daily newspaper II Post dubbed Hammouchi a “the superagent who never sleeps,” describing him as “powerful, respected, and controversial,” almost like “a movie character.” That same month, Spanish outlet El Pais also paid tribute to the “superagent,” saying that the “security of Europe is linked to cooperation with [him].”

Rabat – The International Conifer Conservation Programme is conserving endangered conifer trees from Morocco in a park in North Berwick, Scotland. The species is the rare Moroccan cypress (the scientific name being Cedrus atlantica) from a valley in the High Atlas Mountains. The initiative to save the trees is a partnership between the Scottish organizations East Lothian Council, North Berwick in Bloom, and the International Conifer Conservation Programme (ICCP), which is based at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The ICCP conserves conifers as they “are among the world’s most threatened groups of plants yet contain some of the world’s most ecologically and economically important species.” Conifers, Latin for “the one that bears a cone,” are of great economic value for softwood lumber, paper, and plastic production. The softwood derived from conifers provides about 45% of the world’s annual lumber production. Some conifers also provide foods such as pine nuts and also Juniper berries, which are used to flavor gin. Threats to the species include exploitation, agriculture and forestry, climate change, and direct exploitation. The Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh says on its website dedicated to the trees, “Exploitation has increased over the last 50 years. Range-wide declines of up to 75% are estimated to have occurred between 1940 and 1982.” A series of droughts, crown defoliation by processionary caterpillars, cedar bark stripping by Barbary Macaques, and damage by cedar bark beetles “seem to have exacerbated the recent decline.” Recent studies have indicated that the current series of droughts are as intense as any that have occurred in the last thousand years. The Edinburgh Botanical Garden reports, “Projections for future climate change indicate a continued decrease in precipitation.” Martin Gardiner, the ICCP coordinator, said: “Growing threatened trees such as these away from logging, forest fires and other threats they face in the wild is providing a valuable ‘safety net’ for the future survival of these species. “This small area in the Lodge is an important demonstration of how trees are crucial to life on Earth and why it is important we all play a part in conserving them for future generations.” Over the last 27 years, the ICCP has worked in more than 50 countries around the world, focussing on Chile, New Caledonia, Lao PDR, Vietnam, China, and other parts of Southeast Asia.

Rabat – Congolese soccer team TP Mazembe shared a short report responding to the second leg of the African Champions League final, in which Morocco’s Wydad Casablanca was subject to  poor referee performance. The Congolese team titled its report “Esperance, champion of shame?” suggesting that the Tunisian soccer club did not deserve the win after the VAR scandal. On Friday, referees rejected an equalizer from Wydad Casablanca, arguing that is was an offside. This decision shocked Moroccan players, their fans, and non-fans alike. When WAC players put pressure on the referee team, asking for the Video Assistant Referee system to be used to determine whether their goal was legitimate, the referees said that VAR was unavailable due to technical issues, stirring controversy. WAC decided to abandon the game after the referee’s decision, a situation which prompted the Moroccan delegation from the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) and President of African Football Confederation (CAF) Ahmad Ahmad to intervene. WAC players were convinced that in light of the injustice, there was  no point in resuming the game, and therefore abandoned the game nearly 15 minutes after the start of the second half. After WAC decision, CAF awarded the Champions League trophy to Esperance Tunis, who were able to score a goal in the first half. WAC was able to tie the game during the first leg after being deprived of a penalty and a legitimate goal, which would have changed the course of the game if there was no VAR controversies. Commenting on Esperance Tunis’s win, TP Mazembe described the Tunisian football club as “undistinguished champions.” “Without glory, the trophy was finally given to the players of Esperance.” The Congolese club also criticized CAF, emphasizing that CAF missed “its season in the champions league in terms of image and credibility.” The statement of TP Mazembe was also echoed by its manager Frederic Kitenege who decried the referee’s performance and heavily criticized CAF President Ahmad Ahmad. In a  tweet, the TP Mazembe manager said that the game was suspended for more than 20 minutes and no decision was made. The refusal of WAC’s goal “should have been verified by the VAR instead of the CAF President showing up on the pitch to discuss with the Moroccan coach.” In his last tweet, the manager said: “Very courageously, the President of the CAF on the podium with his members to hand out medals and Cup at EST without the WAC or referees.”

Rabat – The second leg of the African Champions League final between Wydad Casablanca and Esperance Tunis turned out to be a terrible disappointment after a poor refereeing decision. While Moroccan soccer fans were hoping for a better referee performance during the second leg of the final,  a worse decision was made by referee Bakary Gassama, who refused to review Walid El Karti’s dismissed strike through the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), a necessary element during the competition. VAR had been used against Wydad Casablanca previously during the first leg, resulting in a penalty against WAC and deprivation of a legitimate goal. The game finished with a 1-1 draw, leaving Moroccan  fans disappointed that referee performance did not improve. To their surprise, Wydad Casablanca and fans who followed the players to Tunisia faced a nightmare from CAF, Espérance Tunis fans, VAR, and referees. After Esperance Tunis took the lead in the 41st minute with a goal by Mohamed Belaili, the Moroccan team responded with a legitimate goal in the 58th minute, which was rejected by referee Gassama. Wydad strongly protested the decision, urging the referee to use VAR to check whether their goal was not legitimate as an equalizer. The referees, however, were embarrassed after they argued that the VAR is not available due to technical issues. Wydad abandoned the game after being denied its goal due to the injustice.  The requirement of VAR Since VAR is a necessary element during the game, Moroccan football fans were angry after being deprived of a legitimate goal due to technical issues with VAR in a key game like the African Champions League final. VAR already caused trouble for another referee during the first leg. CAF was urged to suspend one the referee due to poor decisions against Wydad Casablanca.  Paragraph 15 of Article 2 in CAF Champions League regulations stipulates that “If it is established that the absence of the designated referees was the fault of the host association, the host team shall be declared loser by 2 to zero and shall be eliminated from the competition, regardless of the result obtained on the field.” Now, in the absolute absence of the technology during the game, football fans and observers are now speculating corruption within the CAF after the VAR controversy. Speculation of bias confirmed with testimony The fans’ speculation about a lobby inside CAF has been echoed by the former President of Esperance Tunis Slim Chiboub, who said that Tunisia has an influence inside CAF. After the first leg of the final, Slim Chiboub acknowledged that refereeing mistakes in the first leg disappointed Wydad Casablanca. Chiboub also hinted that Tunisian sporting authorities have been influencing decisions in CAF competitions. “We do influence…We have always been influencing in the CAF,” Chiboub said, referring to Tunisia’s influence on CAF decisions. “We are there to influence. When the federation put a member in [in the confederation] isn’t for protecting its interests? When someone is elected [to the CAF board], he goes there to serve the interests of his country; if there is a good referee he brings him, if there was any bad referee he should put pressure so he won’t be appointed…. This is the mission done behind the scenes.”

Rabat – Al Karama is a non-benefit association founded in 1999 which specializes in microcredit. Made under Morocco’s national microcredit law (18/97), it is focused on supporting the dynamic development of microenterprise by providing budgetary and specialized help to its customers. The association is supported by interns from the US and the UK. As of March 2012, Al Karama’s Gross Loan Portfolio was MAD 35,4 million (USD 4.2 million) and it served 16,200 customers through 46 branches and satellite workplaces in three areas of Morocco. Al Karama is centered around a need-based clientele, loaning mainly to women (62% of customers) and social advancement projects. Al Karama’s presence in provincial regions is critical (30% of portfolio).  Al Karama headquarters are located in Rabat Morocco. The initial goal of this program is to provide small manageable loans to help kickstart businesses from small as fruit stands to as large as a bakery. The type of clients they aid are people with no credit or people who are illiterate, and therefore do not have access to the traditional banking system. This makes it extremely hard for people in this situation to gain any start-up capital with a traditional loan. The process of being approved for a loan The process begins, with the help of Al Karma agents, by presenting the business plan and declaring any collateral the entrepreneurs have, if any. The agents then go out into the communities and meet with the clients’ peers to carry out a proper analysis of the client’s ability to pay off the loan and measure the shape of their current business, if relevant. Once this process has been completed, the agents are then able to create a profile of the client’s ability to pay off a loan with interest and they are either approved or denied the loan. These microloans are an asset to the locals trying to build a business who would otherwise be turned down if they went to a traditional bank. To compensate the amount of trust needed to provide these loans, the interest rates are higher than a traditional loan given in a bank.  The most common businesses that the firm works with are bakeries who usually need early capital to fund the ingredients required to make their products, as well as utensils, and appliances to boost production. The interns provided through the Moroccan Center for Arabic Studies come from the U.S. and other countries like the U.K. and are able to work alongside this program. They help guide their clients through the process of running a business as well as well as acquiring funds. Interns Christopher.L and Alex.B who worked in the Marketing group explained to Morocco World News their experience while working with Al Karma, stating: “There is a lot this overall experience has taught and we are glad to able to support the main goal of Al Karma which is to expand services to the neglected Eastern region of the country and provide financial literacy to multiple residents.” In 2010, Al Karama was rated ” β ” by MicroRate. The rating scale is set from A to D and utilizes a  Plus or minus system. The highest rating being, α making Al Karma’s rating extremely competitive. Grameen-Jameel, the Middle Eastern and North African social business, has been supporting Al Karama since 2005. The work was started with Morocco’s first meeting for microfinance associations and strategy producers to talk about the significance of growing administrations to the disregarded Eastern district of the nation. Al Karama has become a partner to  Grameen-Jameel in 2006. Grameen-Jameel has given financing and specialized to support Al Karama.

Rabatr – The President of the Moroccan club Wydad Athletic Club (WAC), Said Naciri, said on Saturday that he is taking the case of a poor refereeing decision that occurred during the second leg of the final of Africa’s Champions League to FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport. “This is unfair and we will take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and FIFA,” Naciri told reporters at the end of the Champions League final. He added that it is a disgrace for the Confederation of African Football (CAF), noting that it is not allowed to begin a game when the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system is not working. Naciri noted that the Egyptian referee Jihad Gricha, who officiated the first leg in Rabat, was suspended following his poor performance.  After receiving a goal at the 42nd minute of play, Wydad leveled the score at the 59th minute by the midfielder Walid el Karti. The referee, Bakari Gassama, dismissed Wydad’s equalizer on the grounds of an inexistent offside.  WAC player demanded the Gambian referee consult the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), which they found to be dysfunctional.  Amid the embarrassing scene in Tunis, Espérance de Tunis was declared winners of the African Champions League.

Rabat – CAF President Ahmad Ahmad has commented on the course of the African Champions League final between Morocco’s Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) and Esperance Sportive de Tunis (ES Tunis), saying that the Moroccan team was subject to a refereeing injustice. He added that “the CAF had an agreement with the VAR company, but at the last moment, we were told that we cannot adopt it for technical reasons.”  According to sources from Royal Moroccan Football Federation FRMF, the CAF Executive Committee will hold an urgent meeting in Paris to discuss the possibility of re-playing the game in a neutral country. The CAF Champions League final was a disgrace to African football as the referee showed clear partiality to the Tunisian club after refusing a valid goal of WAC on the basis of an inexistent offside. Subsequently, WAC players requested the referee consult the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) which turned out to have technical issues. FIFA regulations stipulate, however, that the match should not begin if the VAR is not functional. As a result, Wydadi players refused to continue the match until the problem was fixed.  After more than an hour of interruption, the referee, Bakari Gassama, declared ES Tunis as the winner of the 2019 Champions League title. This left the African continent and the world in shock. Today, WAC president Said Naciri has stated that he will exhaust all ways to bring justice to his team.  Naciri declared that he will take the case of the poor refereeing decision to  FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

By Mohamed Belkhayat Rabat – On May 8 however, I happened to gaze at the sky after Iftar and the new moon was so clear and so high in the sky I thought for sure it was at least three days old, and I promised myself I would research it and write about it.  I later found out that the new moon was born on Saturday, May 4 at 10 pm Morocco time, two full days before the official beginning of Ramadan! I also found out that the moon set 20 minutes after sunset on May 5 in the southern regions of Morocco, which means there was a good chance of seeing the new moon by the naked eye around sunset on Sunday. Yet fasting did not begin till Tuesday. So how does Morocco decide the first day of Ramadan? Or ‘Eid for that matter? Apparently, the Ministry of Habous and Islamic affairs is in charge of the announcement.  However, it is not clear from their site how this is really done. Online articles state that Morocco follows the Malikit school of thought, hence visibility by the naked eye is the acceptable method.  So the ministry deputies throughout the nation are encouraged to call in when they observe the new crescent. Some articles also mention astronomer Hicham Elaissaoui who is associated with Dar Al Hadith Al Hassania, predicted the May 7 date, but it is not clear how.  It looks like a formal process that takes into account hard science is not really in place, and if it is in place it is not clearly shared with the public. In the US, and Europe the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA) and European Council of Fatwa and Research (ECFR) have decided to use astronomical calculation as a religiously acceptable method to predict the new moon.  The agreed upon conditions are stated here for reference: “Somewhere on the globe, at the sunset, the elongation should be at least 8 degrees and the moon should be at least 5 degrees above horizon. If these conditions are met, the new crescent will be visible somewhere on earth. Hence the new lunar month will start the next day, otherwise, it will start on the day following the next day.” Wait, I will explain. When a new moon is born it is exactly between the sun and the earth, forming almost a straight line. That is when the moon completes its revolution around the earth, a lunar month.  This is called conjunction and the moon stays very close to the sun as it moves in earth’s sky, which means during the day it is lost in the glare of the sun and we cannot see it by the naked eye, so only a brief moment around sunset can the moon be visible by the naked eye. It cannot be seen at night because it sets shortly before or after sunset.  The 8-degree elongation and 5 degrees above the horizon at sunset are accurate ways of saying that the new moon has to set after sunset by a short delay in order to see it with the naked eye from anywhere in the world. These numbers can be predicted early in advance with modern astronomy and mathematics.  It is also interesting to note that FCNA (US) is in agreement with ECFR (Europe). Before this agreement came about, FCNA used to base their calculations on similar conditions but referred to local time of Mecca. Now the conditions are defined on a global scale. In the early 80s and 90s, it was common to find neighboring Muslim communities in the US and Europe fasting and celebrating Eid Al fitr to different dates, which was unfortunate because it often created an atmosphere of division.  In those days, I used to look up the US naval observatory data for the new moon, which provided very accurate predictions for the moon phases not just for years but for decades. Why do the navies of the world care? One answer is the tides, some ships cannot be launched at low tides, because the harbor waters are not deep enough. Tides also affect bridge clearance for ships and so knowing the times of low and high water is of great benefit to marine navigation. Finally, it is important to note that life as we know it is water based and it is not farfetched to imagine that the water in our gardens, our farms, and even our bodies follows the same tidal rhythms and hence has a direct impact on growth and reproduction of all life forms on the planet. Why isn’t the science of the lunar calendar given more importance by the ministry of religious affairs?  The ministry is reportedly the richest in Morocco, yet there seem to be no significant investments made by it in astronomy, science, and math.  The ministry should make a serious effort in building observatories dedicated to the lunar calendar and the great science, and mathematics that it generates.  Islamic history is rich with this and one can argue it was this heritage that provided the hard data for the modern Copernican view of the world. After all, doesn’t the Quran say that the light of the sun and the moon were made in such a way that we may know how to count the years and know mathematics?  I call on the ministry of religious affairs to do its job not only in spiritual training but also the sciences and mathematics that the Quran calls for. Imams should be trained in the sciences, especially astronomy, as it is this science that clears the mind of doubt and increases faith.  Imams should be at least familiar with some of the technologies and telescopes that help predict the lunar calendar so that they can, in turn, enlighten the masses instead of keeping them in the dark. The moon’s light was made so that we may know. For those who may be curious about how to get times for moon phases, moonsets and moonrises instead of just the usual sunset and sunrise times, I used the following website made by a small Norwegian company: www.timeanddate.com Note that the new moon for Eid Al Fitr 2019 will be born June 3 at 10 AM UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) this is also local time Morocco since it is on the same longitude as Greenwich.  The website I referenced gives the times for moonset on June 3 as roughly 20 mins after Sunset in the southern regions of Morocco. This offers a small window for possible observation of the new moon, although it will be very young. FCNA already announced Eid as June 4, 2019, for the US.

Rabat – If anything, the second leg CAF champion’s league final between Morocco’s Casablanca’s Wydad and Tunis’ Esperance at the Rades stadium in Tunisia was an unforgettably scandalous night. For those who were left utterly disappointed at the injustice Wydad of Casablanca suffered last Friday in Rabat, where does yesterday’s sabotage stand in comparison? How does one even start to recount the unfolding of what looked like a deliberate, planned footballing fiasco? At the kick off time, yesterday’s second leg confrontation between Tunisia’s Esperance de Tunis and Morocco’s Wydad de Casablanca, there was already a palpable sense of tension and frustration in the air. Nerves were high, even mercurial, on both sides—courtesy of a battle to emerge from the stained first leg, where an untold number of refereeing mistakes robbed the Moroccan side of a significant home victory. Both sides, in this sense, went in yesterday’s game to rise from the lingering bruises of that grandly controversial first leg. By the time yesterday’s game reached minute 60, however, it was clear that hearts would be broken and dreams shattered. As Bakari Gassama, the Gambian referee of the game, stubbornly refused to yield to Wydad’s rightful demands that VAR be consulted to deliberate on whether the goal that had just been ruled out was valid (it was), there was a feeling that here, too, all had been set up for Wydad to end up on the losing end. By all means, what happened yesterday was an emphatic stain on the honor, or respectability, of Africa’s most revered football contest for clubs. Or, as Wydad’s chairman put it, it was a “total shame for African football,” perhaps the most outrageous African Champions League final. To put it briefly into context: Esperance had been leading the game by 1-0, courtesy of a first half in which they were slightly superior. But like in the second half in Rabat, Wydad came back from the 15-minute respite more spirited, more driven. Like in Rabat, Wydad was more present and far more dominant in the second half, leaving their Tunisian hosts with the sole option of defending their goal advantage while playing on counters. And like in Rabat, Wydad pressed higher and scored the equalizer in the first minutes of the second half, at minute 49. But, somewhat unsurprisingly, like in Rabat, too, Wydad’s goal was ruled out. In that moment, it felt as though last week’s refereeing fiasco was after all a prelude to an even grander, vastly dishonorable show. After over an hour of deliberation, the game was stopped. Somehow, unexplainably, with nearly 30 minutes to go, the referee blew the final whistle, declaring the Tunisians the winners of the 2019 African champions League. It was brilliantly laughable, the result monstrously unjust to a Wydad squad which, given how they had been playing, could have won the game. Only after the game was it revealed that, actually, the referee rejected Wydad’s call to use VAR because the system was out of order. But the problem is that Wydad, according to their chairman, Said Naciri, did not know about VAR not being operational. “Why would we have asked for VAR to be used if we were informed that it was not operational in the first place?” Naciri insistently lamented in his post-match interview. While the decision to declare Esperance champions was unfair by all definitions of the word, the revelation that VAR was defective compounded the frustration, leaving space to suggestions the game had been rigged all along, skewed in Esperance’s favor. And no, this wasn’t some kind of one-off. It had little to do with those grotesquely disappointing moments when football can feel understandably painful, bearably unbearable. No, this was deliberate, offensively cunning, planned outrage. How can anyone explain that VAR was not functional on a night of the continental Champions League final? Was it deliberate? The answer, reports have it, is a resounding yes. In fact, this was hardly the first time that Esperance “deliberately broke VAR,” according to former CAF Secretary-General Amr Fahmy. “This is unfair,” Naciri lamented after CAF decided that Esperance were the victors. He said his club “will not keep silent” and “will file complaints with FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sports.” He called the match a “failure for African football” and a display of “refereeing massacre.” Putting aside the human propensity to sympathize with the indescribable pain of undeserved defeat, it is difficult to argue against the crux of Naciri’s point. The Wydad chairman was not only right in his assessment of the game as a disgrace and a dishonor to African football just days ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations. Though his outbursts—which were legitimate, anyway—reverberated with the biting, unforgettable aches of undeserved loss, Naciri was actually pointing to something many of us can sympathize with. When, twice in a row, and in the space of just one week, the same team is outrageously denied a fair chance to win a victory it would have deserved, pointing to conspiracy is perfectly warranted. This is no conspiracy theory. After the thoroughly disappointing first leg, it was almost unbelievable that the scene that unfolded before our eyes at the Rades stadium was actually happening. Even the Tunisian press, usually fiery and fervent when it comes to defending their teams, has conceded, somewhat in spite of themselves, that this was “shameful” and “scandalous” for the image of African football days ahead of the continental footballing showpiece. Perhaps the complaints in the Tunisian media are genuine. But they won’t soothe the Wydadi players and fans. The CAF board, meanwhile, has called for an urgent meeting to “discuss a controversial final.” Wydad fans can be pardoned if that “urgent meeting” comes across like a joke: little will come from the meeting. At this point, perhaps, the onus is on the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF). There will be calls among Moroccan fans that, like its Tunisian counterpart, the Moroccan federation should from now on show more aggressiveness and resolve in defending the interests of Moroccan teams at the continental level. Sending post-match letters, however damning and solemn their tone, will do little to reverse the blatant injustice that marred the experience of Moroccan clubs in this year’s CAF tournaments. (RS Berkane, another Moroccan team, was controversially beaten in the second leg of the CAF Cup final against Egypt’s Zamalek.) While FRMF should, as they have said they would, express their legitimate anger and frustration at the CAF board for such scandalous errors of judgment in the course of two season-defining games, they should really consider being more present in the behind-the-scenes, off-the-pitch battles which sometimes dictate much of what happens on the pitch.

Rabat – Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) suffered a loss in yesterday’s match against ES Tunisia that will go down as an unforgettable scandal in the history of the African football. Following a 1-1 tie during the first leg of Africa’s Champions League final in Rabat, WAC failed to take home the African Champions League title. This loss had to do more with a scandalous CAF decision than a case of WAC failing to deliver.  Although WAC players were under an unprecedented amount of pressure, they displayed composure and a high level of professionalism while delivering better performance in comparison to the first leg of the final in Rabat on May 24.  The first goal attempt from Wydad was in the 32nd minute of play. The second was in the 35th minute.  After few failed attempts to score, ES Tunis scored first by its forward, Youcef Belaili, at the 42nd minute of play. Wydad leveled the score following a head kick at the 59th minute by the midfielder Walid el Karti. The referee, Bakari Gassama, dismissed the equalizer for an inexistent offside. WAC players demanded the Gambian referee consult the Video Assistant Referee (VAR). For the second time in two years, VAR turned out to have technical issues. This left the referees indecisive about WAC’s goal. As a result, WAC players refused to continue the game until the problem was fixed. After an interruption of more than an hour, the referee announced the end of the match, unfairly granting ES Tunis the 2019 African Champions League title.  In addition to CAF’s astounding failure to ensure that the rules of fair play were respected, officials of the Tunisian club are also to blame for the malfunction of the VAR. In a statement to Egyptian club Al Ahly’s official website, former CAF Secretary-General Amr Fahmy said that ES Tunis officials broke the VAR during last year’s African Champions League final between Al Ahly SC and ES Tunis. Due to the Egyptian club’s poor performance and the absence of controversial refereeing mistakes, however, “nobody noticed”. “I knew that the VAR would be broken in the first leg between Al Ahly and ES Tunis and I informed Al Ahly’s officials and the problem was solved,” stressed Amr Fahmy. Following yesterday’s scandal, the manager of TP Mazembe Frederic Kitenge decried the referee’s performance and lashed out at CAF President Ahmad Ahmad. In a tweet, Kitenge said that Gassama’s performance during the first leg of the CAF Champions League semi-final was “mediocre” and TP Mazembe suffered from the referee’s bias in favor of the ES Tunis. In a second tweet, Kitenge criticized CAF’s decision to appoint the same referee to officiate two consecutive home matches for the same club. “Gassama was in the semi-final in Rades and here he is in the final in the same stadium,” tweeted Kitenge. In a third tweet, the TP Mazembe manager said that the game was suspended for more than 20 minutes and no decision was made. The refusal of WAC’s goal “should have been verified by the VAR instead of the CAF President showing up on the pitch to discuss with the Moroccan coach.” Ahmad tried to convince the Moroccan team and officials to resume the game, but his attempt was met with refusal.  WAC was not the only Moroccan football club that suffered from arbitrary refereeing. The same scenario happened with RS Berkane during the African Confederation final against Egypt’s Zamalek. The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has sent a letter to the CAF executive body, protesting the “scandalous” and “shameful” refereeing that cost the Moroccan team a final it should have won had the referee “respected the technical rules of the game.”

Rabat – Residents of Askaoun, a small village near Marrakech in southwestern Morocco, have demanded that officials grant the locals property titles of the area. The request is a response to the disturbances that a Canadian mining company, Maya Gold and Silver, is causing. In 2014, Maya Gold and Silver began working on a nearby mine named Zgounder. The project has created job opportunities and brought the anticipation of the industry to the quiet village. About five years later, however, the townspeople have increasingly grown dissatisfied with the mining company, suggesting the company is no longer welcome.  Central in their complaint is that the Zgounder project has caused undesirable living conditions, including excess noise pollution and interference with irrigation systems. Locals of Askaoun link the company’s activities to water shortages. Residents also say that the project has generated chemical waste.  The people, who do not have a deed to the land but have owned it unofficially for decades, are also claiming that the company is operating without their consent and that their property is being exploited. Residents demanded that Maya Gold and Silver help ease access to water and assist development efforts in the town as compensation. On June 6, 2018, the local authorities agreed to provide residents with property titles as quickly as possible. Parliament members from the Justice and Development Party (PJD) laid out the Askaoun residents’ concerns in a letter to the Ministry of Energy and Mines. It reads, “This land has always belonged to the residents of the village, long before there were any official registers.” Maya Gold and Silver disputed that the land is collective land, belonging to no one. General director Noureddine Mokadem also said the company is “within its rights” as it used the water source. The company said, “The water we are using for silver extraction comes from Ouarzazate, near the High Atlas mountains. Local authorities diverted the water in the 1980s so that it could be used in mining operations. When the silver extraction stopped for several years, people got used to using the water to irrigate their fields and water livestock. But now that we’re exploiting the mine again, we have to use the water that was brought here specifically for the mine.” As for the chemical waste, the ministry said in a 2018 letter that most of the silver mining used a method called flotation, which separates materials while “reduc[ing] the environmental impact that past mining operations may have had.” The letter also stated that Maya Gold and Silver’s operations had actually been approved in 2014.

Rabat – For Morocco, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is a milestone and a historic move on the path to realizing the continent’s long-standing aspirations of comprehensive intra-African exchange.  Speaking at a press briefing after a cabinet meeting, Spokesperson of the government  Mustapha El Khalfi said that “the entry into force of the agreement will contribute to the implementation of the Royal Vision, based on the idea that Africa’s future is the work of the continent itself and its citizens, and that it is time to move forward on this path.” El Khalfi also emphasized the Kingdom’s eagerness to participate in endeavors to accomplish the agreement and implement its provisions. He drew special attention to the country’s role in the milestone, recalling that Morocco was the first nation to require its foundation. The long-term goal of the agreement aims to increase intra-African exchanges by 60% by 2022.  “Morocco was additionally one of the principal signatories to the agreement, based on the royal diplomatic rules in Africa, ” he noted.  This goal-oriented project will reinforce the Kingdom’s commitment to implement the conditions of the agreement.  El Khalfi noted that this mechanism has been put in practice by the signing of a series of bilateral agreements, the number of which is close to 1,000 agreements signed over the last twenty years, in addition to the increase in Moroccan investment within the continent in several sectors, as well as the strengthening of the system of international cooperation in terms of education, with 8,000 sub-Saharan students pursuing their studies in Morocco. The AfCFTA agreement entered into force Thursday, after its ratification by 22 African Union nations.

Rabat – The streaming service Netflix, which has been showing four Arabic-language dramas during Ramadan, is set to release its own Arabic production in June.  Viewing rates usually peak during Ramadan, as families enjoy soap operas after breaking their fast at sunset with the iftar meal, or during the Suhoor, the pre-dawn meal. After Ramadan, however, Netflix will debut its first production in Arabic, Jinn, on June 13. The company has plans to add even more Arabic-language shows to its listings this summer in its effort to “ramp up focus on the Middle East.” Filmed in Jordan, the show Jinn is a supernatural drama about teenagers who encounter two spirits during a field trip to the historic city of Petra. “Jinn is Netflix’s first Middle Eastern original series which will bring Middle Eastern folklore to the modern world,” Artanc Savas, Netflix’s communications manager for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa, said. “We are very excited to see it come to life.” Netflix will be releasing a second Middle Eastern original series, “Al Rawabi School for Girls” though the date is yet to be announced. “Written and directed by Jordanian screenwriter and director Tima Shomali, the show tells the story of a bullied high school girl,” said Savas. The streaming giant also announced a third Arabic original production, called “Paranormal” based on novels bearing the same title by Egyptian writer Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq. “It is great to not only invest in local Middle Eastern content but also to create a global audience for local language shows,” Savas said. Other platforms are competing for Arabic-speaking viewers. Starz Play and Wavo are newer streaming platforms than Netflix. The Saudi company MBC Group, which currently has two streaming services, Shahid and Shahid Plus, has announced that it will be putting out original productions. While some streaming platforms are currently showing content in Arabic, like OSN television network’s two services, OSN Play and Wavo, Starz Play is the top competitor for Netflix in the MENA region with its one million subscribers. With Ramadan being the focal point, these companies are competing to gain millions of Arabic-speaking viewers year-round. “Competing with traditional television in Ramadan is not our strategy,” Maaz Sheikh, Co-founder and CEO of Starz Play Arabia, said. “What we are trying to do is bring more and more relevant Arabic content during Ramadan to our consumers.” Each company has been showing 30 episodes for the 30 days of Ramadan, in other words, only one episode is released each night. “Adding these shows to our roster of licensed content during Ramadan gives our audiences the flexibility to watch the shows they want, when they want,” Savas said, referring to the usual fixed times of traditional TV shows. An estimated 25% to  30% of people in the Middle East watch streaming videos online, according to Mukul Krishna, Head of Digital Media at US-based research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan. Netflix has declined to disclose the number of subscribers it has in the region. Producing original Arabic content is the “next step,” said Sheikh, adding that the “UAE and Saudi Arabia are our two biggest markets, followed by Morocco.”

Rabat – From the peaks of the Atlas Mountains to the banks of the Dead Sea, Muslims in every corner of the world pledge to forgo food, drink, and worldly pleasures, and to surrender themselves to God throughout Ramadan. Between the crescent moons, which symbolize the beginning and end of Ramadan, Muslims purify their hearts and engage in religious reflection within their communities, giving rise to good feelings and joy among neighbors and friends. Though the whole month of Ramadan is holy in nature, perhaps the holiest night of the month is Laylat al-Qadr, often translated as either the Night of Decree or Night of Destiny. The occasion commemorates, in Islamic belief, the night when the archangel Gabriel first revealed the verses of the Quran to the Prophet Mohammed.  Muslims believe that on this night, above all others, God forgives the sins of humanity and listens to the prayers of his followers. Muslims also believe that, on this night, God’s angels descend to earth to perform errands and deeds commanded by God. “Laylat al-Qadr is a night better than a thousand months,” reads verse 37:3 of the Qur’anic Surah, Al-Qadr, and Muslims across the world acknowledge the night as incomparable to any other night of the year. The exact date of Laylat al-Qadr was never mentioned within the Quran, which has been one of many points of contention between Sunni and Shia Muslims. In most parts of the world, Sunni Muslims generally commemorate the night on the 27th night of Ramadan, whereas Shia Muslims typically celebrate it on the 23rd night. With the exact date unknown, many Muslims tend to pray zealously on several nights during the last ten days of Ramadan, as prescribed by the Prophet’s hadith. “Seek out Laylat al-Qadr in the odd nights during the last ten nights of Ramadan,” according to Al Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. On Laylat al-Qadr, Morocco’s cities are alight with activity and celebration can be found in every home throughout the country. Meanwhile, Muslims can be found reciting prayers in mosques and sharing in the overall atmosphere of joy and goodwill. Families often engage in charity acts at this time, before breaking the fast in the evening, giving food and donations to the poor. The night is also a celebration of many children’s first day of fasting, since most prepubescent Muslim children do not fast, except on the day of Laylat al-Qadr. For the past two years, King Mohammed IV has presided over Taraweeh prayer on Laylat al-Qadr and has given religious lectures on these nights. It has not been announced yet whether King Mohammed IV will be doing the same in 2019; however, it is likely given the trend established in previous years. For 2019, Laylat al-Qadr will fall on Saturday, June 1, four days before the end of Ramadan. For children, the first Laylat al-Qadr is an important milestone in one’s life, serving as one of many signs of a child growing into adulthood. During Ramadan, children who have not yet reached puberty are not obligated to fast; however, on Laylat al-Qadr, children will fast for the first time and be rewarded an especially bountiful iftar.  On Laylat al-Qadr, both boys and girls are dressed specially for the occasion, wearing clothes that resemble wedding attire. Boys traditionally don a djellaba robe, accompanied by a fez and balgha, a special shoe used for religious celebrations. Meanwhile, girls will be dressed by a negafa (stylist), who will adorn the child with the finest traditional dress and makeup, as well as gold ornaments and accessories. Girls are also often decorated with henna on their hands. Children receive praise from their parents and Laylat al-Qadr becomes a night that brings families closer together and gives children a chance to grow into their community.

Rabat – After an initiative to add the image of a Torah scroll to the emoji library, The Conference of European Rabbis (CER) has asked the Unicode Consortium for new emojis that show men in kippahs and women in head coverings as a way to make the emoji selection more inclusive. The CER turned to the Unicode Consortium as it exists to develop a universal character encoding scheme which allows people around the world to use computers in any language.  The nonprofit consortium also selects the emoji icons used by the world’s smartphones based on submissions from individuals and organizations who present their case with evidence for why each one is essential. “There are emojis of women in the hijab and Arab clerics, and the Jews have been forgotten,” the CER wrote. “The need for equality and non-discrimination begins with the small things, which in this case may seem minor but have enormous significance and long-term effects.  The WhatsApp application is used daily by millions of citizens around the world, especially the young.” Making emojis more inclusive by including some that look like traditional Jews is a way to make the world more inclusive, the letter to the Consortium said. Gronich, Chief of Staff of the CER, claimed in his letter that “in a world where we hope to accept the differen[ces] and be pluralistic, it seems that the Jewish religion and its symbols are not part of diversity. Our daily struggle against antisemitism starts with the small things of assimilating the Jewish religion on various platforms that expose it and become the norm.  The omission of our religion and its symbols in such a wide media is leaving its mark and makes us the exception and those not represented.” “If it is legitimate to present a family consisting of two men or two women, and to present the traditional attire of the Islamic religion, we believe that there is room for presenting Jewish symbols as well,” it also said.  “The Jewish religion should not be left behind; it should be brought to the center of public discourse and made equal among the other religions.” Jewish-related emojis currently available are a synagogue, the Star of David, and the Israeli flag.

By Abdellah Azzouzi Rabat – As the field of Advanced Mediation flourishes, and there are hundreds of schools and institutions that train mediators and equip them with all the necessary academic, professional skills, and savoir-faire tools to solve conflicts between two or multiple parties, Morocco introduced this concept and practice into the divorce process at the beginning of 2005.  How that change came about and what are its social, political, and cultural backgrounds, as well as what can be done to boost the initiative, will be explored in this article. To start with, many Moroccan women have suffered different types of injustice within the family milieu because of the Moudawana, the Arabic word for the Personal Status Code, which Morocco adopted after its independence in 1956.  The Moudawana enhanced man’s authority over his ‘life-long’ partner (wife), putting all the household powers in the hands of the husband, regardless of his educational status, legitimizing polygamy and forced marriages so keeping women victimized and voiceless for decades. In 2004, after a long struggle for women’s rights and equity led by the Moroccan civil society, especially by the Women’s Action Union (L’Union de l’Action Feminine), the national parliament passed a law that was called “the Family Code Reform”. The reform signaled a turning point in women’s empowerment.  The code restricted polygamy, raised the marriage age to 18 years old, gave wives– if ill-treated by their spouses– the right to request divorce unilaterally; it also gave them the right of self-guardianship and the right to child custody. What is interesting about the history of marital law  is that the adopted family code made Mediation an integral step in the divorce procedure for the first time in the judicial system of the kingdom, though it (mediation/reconciliation) was a common practice in the Islamic tradition that was always there to mitigate couples from bringing the marital conflicts to court.  Nowadays, before the judge makes a decision on a divorce case he or she invites the two parties to have a “reconciliation session”.  However, the sessions are not mediated by independent freelance experts in the field of mediation and conflict resolution, but seem to be informal and quick. The mediation sessions are not run in a comfortable environment conducive to negotiation and are chaired by the judges themselves within a very short period of time (as judges usually turn out to be under a huge pressure because of the workload and the complexities of cases).  The judge often asks one simple question to the about-to-collapse couple, who are usually surrounded and supported by their parents, saying: “would you like to reconcile or not?” The outcomes of these inside-the-judge’s office mediation initiatives usually bring little hope or change to the hard situation in which the young couples find themselves and, therefore, do little to stop the drastically increasing rate of divorce among Moroccans that has serious repercussions on the society and the future generations. If those mediation sessions were mediated by professionals from the academic field of mediation and conflict resolution, there would be a significant impact on the family judicial system. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of broken conjugal ties and shared lives  would be rectified, redeemed and immediately brought to normalcy within a society that has quite enough stories of failed marriages already.  Therefore, the Moroccan Government, namely the Ministry of Justice should outline a plan where mediation becomes institutionalized; this institutionalization, of course, starts from making mediation of conflicts a recognized academic field in the Moroccan higher education system. Scholars and graduates from the fields of languages, law and Islamic thought would  be a good fit for this branch of study.  If this plan is carried out, I predict the rate of divorce, which has been tearing the Moroccan social texture ever since the new Moudawana Code was adopted, fueled by the damage being done to the educational system and to religious values, as well as to the impact of social media on the newly-weds, would surely fall to its lowest levels.
