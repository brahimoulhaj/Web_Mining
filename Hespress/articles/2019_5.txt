Rabat – Moroccan King Mohammed VI chaired the sixth Religious Lecture of the Ramadan series of Hassani Lectures, with the company of Crown Prince Moulay Hassan at the royal palace in Rabat on May 30.  Delivered by the Goodwill Ambassador of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), professor Abdelwahab Zayed, the lecture revolved around the theme of the significance of palm trees in the Islamic faith. The religious evening drew on the Qur’anic Verse 25 of Surah Maryam (Chapter 19), “And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates. So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, ‘Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.“ The lecturer highlighted Morocco’s efforts in providing special care to palm plantation to produce the best quality dates in the Kingdom, initiated by ordering the plantation of 3 million varieties of high quality palm trees in Morocco’s best palmeries, which set on a land stretch of 60,000 hectares.  Zayed noted that palm trees, praized in the Qur’an and sunnah for their health benefits, are always linked to the “good word” and referred to as “inexhaustible source of benefits.”  A staple on every Muslims’ iftar table during Ramadan, the blessed fruit is mentioned more than any other fruit, in more than 20 Qur’anic verses. The verses call attention to their health benefits as invoked in Surah Maryam, when God provided her with dates to relieve childbirth pain.  Nutritionally speaking, the lecturer noted that a number of contemporary scientific studies corroborate the health benefits of the fruit for being rich in carbohydrates, along with glucose, fructose and fibre for digestion, providing the human body with enough energy to carry out their daily activities.  Additionally, dates also contains high levels of mineral salts, vitamins, potassium, sodium, zinc, magnesium and cobalt, besides its richness in blood- and growth-related essential elements such as vitamin A, as well as elements that protect from cancer and heart and kidney diseases. He also highlighted how dates are equally important for pregnancy for containing iron and antioxidants.  Zayed concluded the lecture by presenting a series of books to King Mohammed VI.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI launched the construction of the “Community Medical Center-Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity” in Rabat’s twin city, Sale in the Tabriquet district on Friday. The project is in line with a campaign led by King Mohammed VI, who has been inaugurating several medical facilities throughout the holy month of Ramadan. The project seeks to ensure the right of access to health services for all citizens and promote the health sector. Initiated by the Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity, the project seeks to serve a population of 300,000 people to reduce the pressure on existing hospitals in the region. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the project also aims to increase access for the area’s economically disadvantaged by providing closer medical centers to prevent them from taking long trips to receive care. The new facility will be built in a space of 9,000 square meters. It will include a medical emergency room, screening rooms, and consultation rooms. The center also will provide a medical technical center with two surgery rooms and a maternal health center. Additionally, the facility will also house a primary health care unit for vaccination and maternal and child health in addition to  a rehabilitation unit, a dental unit, and a medical analysis laboratory. Finally, the center will include a pharmacy and a morgue. King Mohammed VI has inaugurated several other projects throughout the month of Ramadan. The latest projects were an addiction treatment center in Benslimane, a city in the Casablanca Settat region, on Tuesday and the launch of a program to support self-employment for former prisoners last week.

Rabat – At the Evry mosque in Paris, a power struggle has flared up between the Moroccan government and the government of the UAE. At the beginning of Ramadan, Evry mosque hosted an Iftar in honor of Ali Nouyami, the Emirati minister in charge of the World Council of Muslim Minorities. This consequently raised concerns about the mosque’s loyalties, and whether it would pander to the interests of the UAE in the future. The concerns were further exacerbated by the mosque’s irreplaceable “rector,” Khalil Merroun, who was suspected of planning to expand the institution’s board of directors to authorities loyal to Abu Dhabi. Suspicions were subsequently swept aside when Merroun published a statement firmly claiming that the mosque belongs to the kingdom of Morocco and that its loyalties solidly lied with Rabat. However, this has not discouraged the UAE from attempting to spread its influence elsewhere in Europe. The UAE’s designs for global influence More recently, the Emirati government in Abu Dhabi has been struggling to expand its influence in Europe; however, the country’s attempts at seizing power in the Middle East and Africa have long foreshadowed the UAE’s designs on becoming a globally recognized power. In Libya, the UAE has perpetuated the ongoing conflict by funneling money to the Libyan National Army (LNA) and forces loyal to Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who continues to lay siege to the country’s capital of Tripoli. Meanwhile in Sudan, the UAE has been providing significant support to the incumbent military regime, which continues to aggressively put down protests in an attempt to maintain control over an increasingly dissatisfied civilian population. In both of these conflicts, the UAE’s fingerprints are permanently etched onto the bullets and bombs used to terrorize civilian populations and butcher thousands in brutal civil wars and violent uprisings. However, perhaps the most devastating attempt by the UAE to establish dominance in the region has been through its role in the ongoing crisis in Yemen, which has claimed thousands of lives through senseless violence and will continue to claim more so long as the conflict continues. This consistent pattern of meddling with foreign affairs has become a trademark for the UAE, which continues to set its eyes on Africa and the Middle East even as it grows more focused on expanding into Europe. Moroccan influence under assault In every circumstance where the UAE has attempted to seize influence from another country, it has come into conflict with one actor or another in the course of their expansion. In the case of the Evry Mosque, Morocco is said to have taken the UEA’s meddling as a direct threat to Moroccan influence in France in terms of the practice and interpretation of Islam. A long-time French partner, Morocco’s political and cultural proximity to France has meant that the North African country has carried considerable clout in “French Islam.” With Moroccans being among the most represented nationalities in France, Rabat maintains an iron grip on its role as a dominant voice in French Islamic circles. However, this has not dissuaded the UAE from attempting to oust Morocco and establish itself as a powerful influence to challenge the North African kingdom as a leader in the Islamic community. In attempt to discredit Moroccan influence in European Islam, Abu Dhabi has consistently condemned mosques associated with Morocco, labeling them as Salafist and portraying them as threats to Islam. Meanwhile in the gulf nation’s own borders, the Emirati government has heavily criminalized Malekism, the principal theological school of Islam across North Africa and the Maghreb. Pushing even further, the UAE has attempted to slander Malekism within Europe to further diminish Moroccan presence in the continent. As a result of this power struggle, Islam in France and across Europe has become divided, with the ongoing political conflicts in the gulf and elsewhere in the Middle East fueling the UAE’s desires to empower itself at any cost.

Rabat – The material, imported from Japan, is embellished with Swarovski crystals which form a shiny, textured floral pattern.  It is the most expensive hijab to date and a product from Bawal Exclusive, a Malaysian hijab brand that’s known for selling exclusive hijabs made with Swarovski stones. The Booming Sahara hijab broke the record set by Bawal Exclusive itself last year after another limited edition hijab went up for sale for RM33,000 (approx. $7,873).  While Uzbekistan and Austria have deemed the hijab prohibited in their respective academic systems, in Malaysia, the hijab has come to also symbolize wealth and status. There, designer scarves as expensive as $8,000 are trending. A possible reason as to why a religious garment, which is traditionally a symbol of modesty, is now also a status symbol, is the upward mobility many Malaysian female millennials are now afforded thanks to education and economic improvements.  Vice says that today Malaysian women are “richer, more educated and better traveled than ever before, they are redefining their roles at work, in society, and at home. The perfect accessory for this newfound status? Luxury hijabs.” Vice Fashion reports, “Women’s labor force participation is now 54.7 percent, nearly double the figure in the 70s and 80s. In universities, they outnumber men.”

Rabat – As Muslims all over the world settle into their new Ramadan routine, here in Morocco the streets are filled with the smell of sweet pastries, aromatic soups, and freshly baked bread. With Ramadan- the holiest month in the Muslim calendar- comes a time of restraint, self-reflection, and observance. It also hails the beginning of a month filled with delicacies from kitchens all over the country and offers a wonderful insight into the delights of Moroccan cuisine.  As a first-time observer of Ramadan, I’ve noticed in particular the change in food on Moroccan tables: the sudden surge in the presence of chebakia, mountains piled high, and the emergence of every kind of briwat imaginable. One of my favorite times of day now is the quiet, peaceful moment before the sounding of the cannon to signal the beginning of iftar, the evening meal. Each day, as the whole of Rabat, rushes around to buy food for their tables, I observe what Morocco will be feasting on. Flitting from one stall to another, the suq comes alive with people bustling about, filling their bags with giant watermelons that line the streets and fresh msemen made before your eyes. Hands dip in and out of overflowing spice sacks – with everything from saffron to ras el hanout –  and a chorus of cries from vendors is met with responses from hungry customers. Aptly known as ftour, meaning breakfast in Moroccan Arabic, this is exactly what will happen in a few hours – the breaking of the fast. The food eaten at iftar differs somewhat from the morning meal, suhoor.  At both mealtimes, families come together to share food and socialize after a day without food or drink. Iftar is usually a heavier meal than suhoor, owing to it being the first food in over 12 hours. The delicacies served at both meals, however, reflect the rich cultural past of Morocco and showcase some of the best dishes the country has to offer. A tradition in many Moroccan families is breaking your fast with three sips of water and eating a date. Dates play a big part in Moroccan cooking all year round, but they’re found in abundance during Ramadan. The date palm is regarded as the “tree of life” in the Story of Genesis in the Quran, which accounts for their ceremonial presence as the first thing to taste at iftar.  A healthy way to break the Ramadan fast is with soup. Harira is made with chickpeas, tomatoes, and lentils. Like with any popular dish, the recipes for Harira differ from family to family, with different methods being handed down for generations. A delicious, hearty, soup, harira is the traditional way to break the fast.  Another favorite is hssoua belboula, made with milk, barley, and cumin. A filling soup that is rich and creamy, it’s perfect after a day without food. This is served at both iftar and suhoor.  We all know Moroccans love semolina, and this is what they put in one soup along with milk, honey, and anise seeds. Quick and easy, some Moroccans go heavy on the honey to make it extra sweet. In the days leading up to Ramadan, my neighbor would fling open her kitchen windows and the smell of homemade almond briwats would slowly waft out. Finally tasting these puff pastry delights, I understood why she had been making batches to last her and her family all through Ramadan. The Moroccan sweet tooth comes into its own throughout the month of Ramadan, with chebakia and sellou found on almost all iftar tables. Chebakia, a small sesame cookie, comes in the shape of a flower and is fried and coated with honey. Sellou, also known as sfouf, is a unique sweet made from flour and fried almonds and often contains other nuts and spices. Fekkas, a biscotti-esque cookie, is found in all different shapes and flavours. A common version is with almonds and raisins, as is the way in Fez with the tradition of serving children Fekkas in a cup of milk for breakfast. Their sweet orange-water smell gives them away instantly as being a Moroccan Ramadan staple. Getting to the bulkier foods now, iftar is incomplete without some form of carbohydrates. Round flatbreads known as khoubz often replace a knife and fork in Morocco, and double as brilliant edible sponges to mop up every last delicious taste left on your plate.   Msemen is a regular at iftar, as it is all year round in Morocco for both breakfast and an afternoon snack. Served sweet with honey, amlou or jam, msemen can also be made with kefta (ground beef) to make a mouth-watering savoury alternative. Similar to mesemen is meloui – also known as rghaif. Made from half semolina and half white flour, meloui is folded into strips before being rolled up – just like the carpets you see lining the suqs. It’s flattened, cooked, and served simply with butter or honey.  Beghir, Morocco’s answer to French crepes, and hercha – another year-round favorite – are also enjoyed at iftar and sehoor. Batbout, also called mkhamer, toghrift or matlou, is a soft, chewy bread that acts as a good sandwich filler. As well as all of the above, there are other favorites that appear at iftar and suhoor. Boiled eggs are common and are a great source of protein and fat. Jben, a fresh Moroccan cottage-cheese, is also served. For Moroccans living along the Atlantic coast, fresh fish is commonly served as well. The table would be incomplete without a large tajine for everyone to share. Be it fish, chicken, lamb or vegetable, a big dish for everyone to tuck into is a must, and a symbolic way to show the essence of Ramadan as a time for sharing. Named after the dish in which it is made, people will often add fruit such as dates and raisins, as well as aromatic spices. Traditionally used by Morocco’s first inhabitants, the Amazigh, the tajine is at the heart and soul of Moroccan cooking. After a whole day without drinking, it’s important to rehydrate. This is done in style during Ramadan, with tea, fresh juices, and smoothies all featuring. Avocado milkshakes are a delicious and satisfying choice after fasting. Alternatively, many Moroccans swap the Avocado for the popular Middle Eastern orange and dried apricot smoothie known as qamar el-deen. Mint tea, a constant in any Moroccan’s diet, is always served with food at both iftar and suhoor. Would any Moroccan meal be complete without it?

Rabat – The Moroccan House of Representatives signed a draft law to set up the Headquarters of the African Observatory for Migration and Development (OAMD) in Rabat on Wednesday.  As indicated by this draft law, the OAMD will embrace the assignment of gathering data and developing its trade while also encouraging coordination among African nations on migration issues.  The foundation of this observatory was recommended a year ago by King Mohammed VI of Morocco when he served as the African Union (AU) administrator on the issue of movement.  In July 2018, the AU heads of state supported the ruler’s proposition.  The signing of the agreement Morocco and the African Union (AU) consented to an arrangement on Monday to set up the Headquarters of the African Observatory for Migration and Development (OAMD) in Rabat.  The agreement was marked by the presence of Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita and Chairman of the AU Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat on the sidelines of a UN Intergovernmental Conference on Migration held in  Marrakech.  At the 31st AU Summit in July in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, and the AU heads of states supported the proposition by King Mohammed VI. “The Observatory offers an important tool for analyzing the phenomenon of migration and obtaining reliable statistics that are specifically African,”Faki told the press.  For Bourita, the OAMD is the start of the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration, which emphasizes that better information will prompt better management.  Over 150 nations received the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration at the UN intergovernmental gathering in Marrakech on Monday.

Rabat – Approximately 45 minutes away from Chefchaouen lies the footpath leading to the waterfall. From here, the route to the cascades consists of nearly two hours of hiking through rough terrain, most of which is uphill. Though the Cascades d’Akchour is a beautiful sight, the journey to the waterfall is equally beautiful, and gives hikers an opportunity to see the Rif Mountains. Here is the journey to the Cascades d’Akchour in pictures:

Rabat – A diplomatic source attending the China-Africa forum said that  Polisariomembers have not received an invitation to attend the “important event.”  Organized by China, with the African Union Commission, the forum in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, focused on the theme “the belt and the road dialogue for China-Africa cooperation.” The event, which was held on Thursday, convened senior officials from the African Union, African ambassadors as well as Chinese officials, Maghreb Arab Press reported. The source added that that the “snub inflicted on the Polisario is scathing, especially since the forum is being initiated in collaboration with the African Union Commission.” Morocco’s permanent representative to the AU Mohammed Arrouchi said that the “Chinese partner, as part of its relations, attaches great importance to the defence of vital interest, including the territorial integrity of our two friendly countries.” He added that  the Chinese partner “has taken great care to thwart any infiltration maneuver by the separatist entity within the framework of today’s event as part of the Africa-China partnership.” Morocco maintains strong diplomatic ties with major powers, including China. In 2017,  a  memorandum of understanding  was signed between the two countries, regarding China’s Silk Road initiative. The memorandum is one of many Chinese projects which seek an expansion of economic and diplomatic ties between China and Africa. The continent, particularly East and North Africa, forms an important part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an ambitious and far-reaching development strategy aiming to create a new “silk road” through extensive investment and infrastructure projects overseas. In recent years, Morocco and China have strengthened their relationship, signing a $140 million deal in March for public projects following a 2017 agreement on Morocco’s involvement in the BRI.

Policeman will use two new types of breathalyzers to calculate drivers’ blood alcohol levels through a two-stage process. The first breathalyzer will test whether the driver has had any alcohol. If the reading is positive, the second breathalyzer will then be used to calculate the blood alcohol content, and whether or not it exceeds legal levels in Morocco (0.1mg/L). Morocco introduced blood-alcohol testing in 2004, but it wasn’t until 2016 that it was officially carried out by police on a national scale. According to the ex-Deputy Minister for Transport, Najib Boulif, the period from 2014 to 2016 was only meant to “familiarize drivers with blood-alcohol testing,” meaning that the anti-drunk driving campaign in Morocco didn’t truly begin until late 2016. The new two-stage testing technology coming to the roads next week will contribute to decreasing accidents and road deaths, a key concern for Moroccan authorities. 3,485 people died on the roads last year, a slight drop from 2017 figures. In 2017, the Ministry for Transport launched a national strategy to halve the number of deaths on the roads by 2026. At first, the Ministry hopes to reduce the number of deaths to 3000 per year by 2020.

The ONP reports that 386,246 tons of fish, seaweed, and shellfish were caught between January and April 2019, up 15% from the same time last year. The value of the catches totalled MAD 2.8 billion ($288 million), an increase of 14% from last year. Seaweed fishing increased drastically by 242% to 9,194 tons. Seaweed is used all over the world in a variety of different products. Most goes to human consumption and food products like agar-agar, while the rest goes to other products like cosmetics and fertilizers.  Shell fishing increased by 121% (156 tons), and fish and crustaceans also increased by 5% and 4% respectively. ONP also noted a sharp increase in the number of fish arriving in Morocco’s Mediterranean ports (54%), and a 13% increase in fish arriving at Moroccan ports on the Atlantic. Morocco is investing in its fishing strategy and is aiming to increase its yields to 1.6 million tons per year by 2020. The artisanal and coastal fishing industry yielded 1.31 million tons in 2018, valued at MAD 7.3 billion ($752 million). Morocco is the top fish producer in Africa, and the 25th fish producer worldwide. The fishing industry represents between 2% and 3% of Morocco’s GDP, and generates over 700,000 jobs. Moroccan fish exports contribute to 58% of the country’s total food exports.

Washington D.C – Kohler’s resignation comes at a time when the political process he led since his appointment in August 2017 had been revived after more than eight years of stalemate. Kohler’s impact on the political process  There is no doubt that Kohler’s sudden departure is a major setback for the UN political process to help the parties to the conflict achieve a mutually acceptable political solution. To better understand the negative impact this resignation will have on the political process, it should be examined in its political context. It comes after two round tables in which all parties to the conflict, including Algeriaand Mauritania, took part and three weeks after the Security Council adopted a new resolution in which it urges them to cooperate in good faith to pave the way towards a settlement.  Although the round tables held in Geneva in December 2018 and March 2019 did not lead to any substantial progress or address the substantive issues, the fact that Kohler brought all parties together, including Algeria and Mauritania, after more than eight years of stalemate, was in itself a diplomatic achievement. Kohler managed to achieve in less than two years what his predecessor, Christopher Ross, had failed to achieve in more than nine. Kohler breathed new life into the political process and thanks to his charisma and his gravitas, he enjoyed the relative trust of all parties. With his resignation, the political process is likely to return to square one. As an immediate result, it is likely that there will be no roundtables until early next year or even later. Therefore, the provisions of resolution 2468 adopted on April 30 will come to naught.  Uphill road to appoint a new personal envoy  During the remaining four months of the mandate of the UN Mission in the Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, the focus of the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council will no longer be on ensuring that the parties participate in a new round table, but to appoint a successor to Horst Kohler. Given the complex nature of the conflict and the failure of five former UNSG personal envoys to successfully lead the political process, it is unlikely that Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN, will succeed in appointing a new personal envoy before the end of MINURSO’s mandate on October 30th. Guterres took more than seven months to appoint a new personal envoy following his inauguration as UNSG on 1 January, 2017. Although the former personal envoy Christopher Ross resigned in early March 2017, it was an known within the UN since the end of 2016 that Guterres wanted to appoint a new personal envoy to move the political process past the impasse. Guterres’ mission to find a successor will be all the more complicated since he will have to reconcile the positions of all parties and appoint a personality that can earn their trust. As in the past, the parties will engage in fierce diplomatic maneuvering behind the scenes to influence the decision of the UNSG. With the presence of John Bolton in the Trump administration, it is likely that he will try to influence the choice of the future personal envoy as well.  Behind the scenes maneuvering to sway the decision of the UNSG Algeria and Polisario, who have often welcomed that the personal envoy be American, will strive to make sure that Kohler’s successor will also be American. In the coming weeks, the lobbying firms Foley Hoag and Keene Consulting, which work for Algeria, will certainly double down on their efforts to convince the US administration of the need for an American to oversee the UN-led political process of the Western Sahara. Conversely, Morocco, which has had disappointments with former personal envoys James Baker and Christopher Ross, both Americans, will certainly try to ensure that the new personal envoy be European. The two times that American diplomats led the political process, they took positions that undermined Morocco’s interests, and were even accused of bias in favor of the Polisario. In 2003, when James Baker was the personal envoy of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Anan, he proposed the so-called “Peace Plan for the Self-Determination of the People of Western Sahara.” The plan proposed a transitional period of 5 years, followed by a referendum of self-determination with the option of independence among the two possible options. More still, Baker proposed that the Security Council implement the peace plan without the consent of the parties. Although the UNSG tried to add autonomy as a third option to reassure Morocco and secure its approval, Rabat rejected it. The plan sparked such concern in Morocco that Moroccan diplomacy began to question whether Baker’s plan had been proposed at the behest of the US administration. It took a meeting between King Mohammed VI and US President George W. Bush on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September 2003 for Rabat to be assured that the US position on the conflict had remained unchanged and that Baker’s plan did not represent the American position. A similar scenario happened with former personal envoy Christopher Ross. Ross was appointed to replace Dutch diplomat, Peter Van Walsum, who had repeatedly said that the option of independence of the Western Sahara was not viable.  Ross took office in January 2009, almost two years after the start of the 2007 political process and four rounds of negotiations under his predecessor Van Walsum. However, instead of building on his predecessor’s work, Ross preferred to take a new approach and seemed willing to consider the option of independence.  Moreover, during most of his term, the political process deviated from his main objective, insofar as Ross appeared receptive to the weaponization of the issue of human rights in the Western Sahara by the Polisario and Algeria. This prompted Morocco to withdraw its confidence in him in mid-2012, to only recant its decision after it received assurances from former UNSG Ban Ki-moon that the parameters of the initial political process would be maintained. Morocco’s preference for European personal envoy  By contrast, Morocco’s interests were strengthened during the mandate of Peter Van Walsum and Horst Kohler. After three years as a personal envoy of the UNSG, the former Dutch diplomat became deeply convinced that the establishment of a new state in southern Morocco was not viable, hence the need to find a political solution. Likewise, during Horst Kohler’s short term, the Moroccan position was further strengthened to the chagrin of Polisario and Algeria. Three resolutions were adopted during his mandate: Resolutions 2414, 2440 and 2468. They placed an unprecedented emphasis on the need for the parties to strive to find a compromise to achieve a “realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise.” In addition, Resolutions 2440 and 2468 have progressively paved the way for the Security Council to consider Algeria as a party to the conflict. The unprecedented inclusion of Algeria in these two resolutions on an almost equal footing with Morocco, responds to a long-standing request from Rabat that the UN consider Algiers as a party to the conflict, since the Polisario would not have existed or lasted without its logistical, financial, political, military, and diplomatic support. This involvement of Algiers in the process was a necessary condition for Morocco to participate in any discussion or round table with the Polisario. Moreover, the last three reports of the UN General Assembly and the latest Security Council resolutions called on the Polisario to stop its actions and provocations in the Guerguerat area and to refrain from deploying its administrative functions in the area east of Morocco’s defense wall, including Tifariti and Bir Lahlou. In addition, the UN Secretariat and the Security Council have put an end to the mirage of the “liberated zones” long peddled by the Polisario. Polisario’s allegations concerning these zones suffered a further setback in the last UNSG’s annual report on the conflict in which he summoned the separatist movement to meet with MINURSO representatives in the Rabouni region, in the Tindouf camps, and not in the “liberated zones.” Contrary to what has been said, the hypothesis that Kohler resigned because of pressure from Morocco is not plausible. To be sure, Kohler took a step that was not viewed favorably by Rabat. Since taking office in September 2017 and despite Morocco’s opposition to any involvement of the African Union in the UN-led political process, Kohler made no secret of his intention to involve the AU and the European Union in the process. Morocco had to engage an all-out diplomatic offensive to prevent the involvement of the AU and the EU and ensure that the Western Sahara remain an exclusive prerogative of the United Nations. Nevertheless, once the African Union solemnly affirmed that the conflict is within the exclusive purview of the UN, Morocco benefited from Kohler’s mediation efforts. To say that Morocco is behind his resignation omits all the aforementioned facts and shows a lack of understanding of the balance of power within the Security Council. If Morocco had such an influence on the political process and on the Security Council, it would have gotten rid of the former personal envoy, Christopher Ross. Even after declaring him persona non grata in 2012, Morocco had to reconsider its position and its decision to collaborate with him. If Morocco failed to make its position prevail at the time partly because of US pressure, it would be even less able to do so now with the presence of John Bolton, notorious for his bias in favor of the Polisario. Even if Morocco were tempted to put pressure on Kohler to force his departure, it would risk the wrath of the Security Council, which has just expressed “its full support for the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy to sustain the renewed negotiations process in order to achieve a solution to the Western Sahara question.” Beyond Kohler’s health condition  Beyond the health reasons cited by Kohler, it appears more plausible that his sudden decision was made because of the highly complex nature of the conflict. After nearly two years of talks and discussions with both parties and members of the Security Council, Kohler likely realized that no matter how hard he tried to ensure a successful outcome of the political process, his good offices will fall short because of the intransigence of the parties and the lack of political will in the Security Council to adopt an approach that can end the conflict. One more plausible explanation of his resignationis his conclusion that after two round tables and almost two years of sustained efforts that none of the parties are ready to budge on their positions and no matter how many round table he would oversee, his efforts would fall short of achieving the desired outcome. In addition, the adoption of Resolution 2468 and the abstention of Russia and South Africa have perhaps served as wake-up call for Kohler that it would be futile for him to continue. This was the second Russian abstention since Kohler took office. Despite the progress Kohler has made since taking office, Russian abstention was as a clear sign that none of the permanent members are ready to support a solution that undermines the interests of its allies involved in the conflict.  Rather than continue to oversee a political process that has no chance of succeeding and in which four of his predecessors have failed, Kohler has most likely preferred to throw in the towel and avoid being trapped in a vicious cycle.   Samir Bennis is the co-founder of Morocco World News.

The World Bank-funded project to support youth employment will run over 5 years until 2024. It aims to improve access for youth to economic opportunities in the Marrakech-Safi region of Morocco through three strategies. First, it will set-up a regional network of “Youth Employment Centers,” across the seven prefectures in the region. The centers will deliver professional training sessions to benefit over 19,000 youths. Second, it will also develop Morocco’s entrepreneurial sector by setting up a regional program to support local micro, small, and medium-sized projects that have high growth and high employment potential. The program is expected to benefit 25,000 youths and to create 1,500 jobs. Finally, the project will reinforce existing institutions that work on youth employment. Since last year, the rate of unemployment in Morocco has dropped, with the creation of new jobs in both rural and urban areas. However, the unemployment rate of Moroccans aged 15 to 24 remains high at 24.1% (in April 2019). The World Bank funds will help target this issue. The signing ceremony for the loan was attended by the Minister of Education, the Minister for Employment, the Deputy Minister for General Affairs and Governance, the Wali, the national coordinator of the National Initiative for Human Development, and the director of the National Agency for Promoting Employment. The project fits within a broader 5 year partnership between the World Bank and Morocco, which aims to increase private sector employment, reinforce human capital through improving the education, health and social security system, and promote territorial resilience through improving urban infrastructure and sustainable access to water across the country. The World Bank lent MAD 6.6 billion ($681 million) to Morocco in February this year under the partnership to help the country introduce digital technologies into banking and economy. While they promote development in Morocco, loans have raised concern. The 2019 Global Firepower Index (GFP) found that Morocco owes $51,480,000,000 in external debt. In January, the High Commissioner for Planning (HCP) Ahmed Lahlimi Alami warned Morocco’s economy would continue to be weighed down by debt this year.  He noted the overall public debt of the economy would increase to 82.5 percent of GDP, slightly up from 82.2 percent in 2018. “Debt is becoming heavier and we must try to increase national savings, ” he added.

The number of children under age 5 who died in 2000 reached nearly 10 million compared to 2017, which saw 5.4 million deaths. Child labor rates also saw a dramatic decline of 40%, the report shows, despite falling short of the 2050 target to end all forms of child labor.  The report shows that 173 countries out of 176 have improved the situation of children in the past 20 years through enrolling children in school, providing better access to health care, and reducing malnutrition.

Rabat – The Algerian interim government has deployed police to crack down on peaceful protests.  The police arrested a group of nearly 30 people, consisting of mostly youth who have been leading the protest against Algeria’s interim government calling for radical change.  Police did not arrest any older people or women with children that were present at the protests. According to AFP, the protesters condemned the arrest, emphasizing that they had not committed any offense. Friday marks 15 weeks of protests, with demonstrators challenging elites from the era of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who resigned amid unrest in April. Addidiontally, protesters have been rallying against Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah, as well as the election scheduled for July 4. Other arrests were made last Friday by Algerian authorities. The arrests were denounced by the Algerian political party, Socialist Forces Front (FFS). In a statement, the party condemned the systematic repression and violence used against the protesters, who have been demonstrating peacefully. The party also called for the release of the protesters. Since the protests began on February 22, Algerian army chief Gaid Salah warned protesters against causing a delay in the election. “Holding a presidential election could help [Algeria] avoid falling into the trap of a constitutional void, with its accompanying dangers and unwelcome consequences,” Gaid Salah argued. On Tuesday, Salah echoed his previous statement, calling for “mutual concessions” amid the unrest. Salah also suggested a “serious, rational, constructive and clear-sighted dialogue” and “mutual concessions” to overcome the crisis.

Rabat – Marvel’s “Spider-Man: Far from Home” will feature a Mulism in hijab as Peter Parker’s friend. The British model Zoha Rahman, now among one of the first Mulisms in Marvel, will take this new role this summer. The actress shared the story behind her landing the role and what it means for the underrepresented Mulsim community. Rahman was working as a model when her agency sent her casting for the role. She had no idea what it was for. “Marvel and Sony take their confidentiality very seriously, so I only found out five minutes before what the part was for and I didn’t have time to fully process it,” she explains. So in January, when the trailer for the latest Spider-Man film was released, viewers created a buzz on social media about the new hijabi character. Even now, however, details about the character remain unknown to the public. Rahman suggested the cast wants the character to be a surprise: “I’m not allowed to elaborate much on my role – all I can say is that I’m Peter Parker’s friend and we are all on this amazing European trip. You’ll have to catch us in the cinemas to find out more!” Rahman was immediately hired. “I was at a train station when I got the call from production telling me I got the part,” she explains. “I felt so many emotions at once – shock, happiness, nervousness, gratefulness.” The British model studied law and then pursued her passion for modeling, which made her conservative Pakistani immigrant parents uneasy. “I grew up in Pakistan and immigrated to the UK with my family, where I studied towards becoming a barrister. But halfway through my Masters, I decided to take this huge leap of faith and change my career path.”  Rahman said, “The first few times I was scouted, my father said I should focus on my studies and not get involved,” she says. “And when I got offered my first movie role, my mother was completely against it, so I used to hide my projects.” She then began working with companies like Qatar Airways, Acuvue, and Wagamama. “Because I worked so hard and persevered, [my family] began to realize that this wasn’t a distraction, it really was a career I wanted to pursue,” Rahman said. “We are a people who have known centuries of strife, constant readjustment, and continuous scrutiny, so it’s no surprise that the community wants stability and prosperity for their children and will always encourage a more secure career path. A safer option.” Rahman’s family is now more than onboard with her career — they now are her first fans. She said, “Now they have magazines that I’m featured in on their coffee table and they proudly show them to their friends! It was a journey of growth and understanding for us all.” Rahman says, as this is her first major role in film, that she’s benefitting from this exciting and intense work experience. “The set embodied everything I love about working as an actor and because of how fast paced it was, I got a wealth of experience in just a few months. It was a lot of hard work, very long days and nights, but it was so worth it.” “In all my years of dreaming about working on a Hollywood set, I never thought it would become a reality,” she says. She is now acting alongside Zendaya, Samuel L Jackson, and Jake Gyllenhaal. “We’d be in hair and wardrobe, joke about, have lunch and get the scenes done. It was only when I got home that I’d think to myself: ‘Did I really just do that? Did I really hang out with so-and-so today like it was nothing!?’” Rahman exclaimed. However, Rahman is well-aware of the lack of diversity in Hollywood. Studies have proven the entertainment industry fails to reflect diversity as it is in reality, and this inconsistency makes the opportunity even more special for her. “It’s a sad by-product of the lack of representation on screen that actors like myself never truly believe in themselves,” she said. “I feel like the Muslim identity is used as an agenda in the media, we rarely see someone who is going about their life and just happens to be a Muslim. I do see a change, but it needs to get better on a much larger scale,” Rahman said. “The roles that are on offer for actors of color, like me, are limited,” she said. “It’s always a sidekick, or a best friend or a shopkeeper. I want to work towards getting into audition rooms where I am seen as an actor who can play any role, not just the ‘South Asian woman’ or the ‘Muslim woman’.” However, Rahman remains optimistic about the future of her career and the trailblazing that inevitably comes with it: “I will continue to grasp every opportunity that comes my way,” she said. “I want to create more space for underrepresented actors because this isn’t just about me. I want to color in every screen I can – literally!” Spider-Man: Far from Home will be out in cinemas this July and tickets are now available for pre-sale.

Rabat – Over the next four years, Belgium will allocate €3 million to encourage youth self-employment under a new Belgian-Moroccan project. The “Supporting Youth Entrepreneurship Development in Morocco” project aims to promote youth entrepreneurship and job stability, especially in rural areas. The project has been in the works since 2016 and is in line with both countries’ broader goals of international economic integration and cooperation.    Unemployment has been a long-standing issue in Morocco and is particularly high among youth ages 15-24. The country’s youth unemployment rate is currently 24.1 percent, according to Trading Economics’ 2019 first quarter report.   The project follows Morocco’s National Integrated Youth Strategy and coincides with the 2017 National Plan for the Promotion of Employment (PNPE), which both aim to equip young people with the skills and knowledge to succeed in a professional environment. Belgium’s ambassador to Morocco and Moroccan Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim signed the agreement Wednesday. Implementation will first focus on the Beni Mellal-Khenifra, the eastern region, Fez-Meknes, and Draa-Tafilalet.

Rabat –  The Sale Court of Appeal has postponed the trial of the 24 defendants in the Imlil Murders for the third time. The trial was postponed to June 13.  The decision was announced on Thursday, when the defendants appeared before the judge in connection with the killing of two Scandinavian tourist near Mount Toubkal in December 2018. The trial was postponed after the court listened to the four main suspects involved in the murder of the two Scandavian tourits. Admitting During the hearing,  the four suspects involved in the murder confessed the  charges, according to state lawyer Abdellatif Ouahbi. The Moroccan suspects also admitted their links  to the Islamic State otherwise known as ISIS. One of the suspects said that he regretted committing the crime, emphasizing that their targets were “foreigners.” He also denied that the suspects were targeting Moroccan authorities. The other 19 suspects will appear before the court again for statements on June 13.  Kevin Zoller Guervos, a Spanish-Swiss suspect arrested for his alleged involvement in the crime also appeared before the judge today. The lawyer of Kevin asked  the judge not to take into account the initial interrogation recorded by the police after the arrest of his client. He said that  the statement session at the police did not respect the investigation standards as  there was no interpreter sworn-in during his statement The public prosecutor at the court, however, asked the judge not to accept the lawyer’s request, pointing out that the judicial police investigator was speaking in French, the first language of the Swiss suspect. Swiss suspect’s family claims innocence Attending today’s trial, the mother of  Kevin Guervos told the press that her son is “far from being a terrorist.” Gema said that her “son is a humane person,”  who is far from“extremism and far from terrorism and all that.” She added that the 24 suspects said that “they didn’t even  know Kevin. What the police are saying is not what they said.” Kevin’s Moroccan wife echoed Gema’s statement, saying that one of the main suspects admitted that he only met with her husband twice. She said that the court reduced some charges against her husband, a statement which was denied by a lawyer  of the suspects after the trial. The mother of Gema said before the trial there is “no evidence” against her son. “You cannot accuse a person if there is no evidence.” Defending her son, Gema said that  Kevin is a person “who loves everyone.” “Please don’t think that he is a terrorist. He is a father, the father of three children.” This is not the first time the mother of the dual national has said that her son is innocent. In an interview she gave to  El Mundo in January, Gema said all allegations against her son are “lies.” Gema, who lives in Spain, claimed that her son was with family in Geneva when the double murder was committed on December 17. The suspect picked the name  Abdellah after converting to Islam in 2011. On December 28, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) announced the arrest of Guervos in connection to the murder. BCIJ head Abdelhak Khiame, said that the suspect was not directly involved in the murder, but he knew the suspects. In the interview, Gema  acknowledged that her son had experienced a difficult adolescence after his father’s death when Guervos was just 15. She said that her son “smoked a lot of joints, burned cars, and had committed a number of robberies. The suspects appeared before the court first on May 2, but the trial was postponed to May 16 to give the defense time to prepare. The suspects, however, had to face the judge again on May 30 after the trial was postponed in response to a request from the victims’ lawyers, who asked  the court to engage the Moroccan state as a key party in the case. The 24 suspects face multiple charges including using weapons, attempting to manufacture explosives, and plotting activities to undermine national security. The suspects will also face charges of forming a criminal network, and committing terror acts, as well as inflicting intentional harm.   Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Uland were beheaded while camping near Imlil, one Morocco’s prized tourist destinations. Police arrested the suspects in less than 48 hours after the murder.

Rabat- Slim Chiboub, the former president of the Tunisian football Club Esperance of Tunis, has acknowledged that refereeing mistakes in the champions league final robbed Wydad of Casablanca of an important victory in the first leg. The match took place on the heels of a fiery media campaign in Tunisia to prevent “unfair refereeing” against Tunisian clubs in African tournaments. Chiboub hinted at the Tunisian media and sporting authorities’ combative attitude when it comes to defending Tunisian clubs. He said there is a strong Tunisian lobby that has been influencing decisions in CAF contests, especially when it comes to appointing referees for games featuring a Tunisian club. “We do influence…. We have always been influencing in the CAF,” Chiboub said referring to Tunisia’s influence on CAF decisions. “We are there to influence. When the federation put a member in [ in the confederation] isn’t for protecting its interests? When someone is elected [to the CAF board], he goes there to serve the interests of his country; if there is a good referee he brings him, if there was any bad referee he should put pressure so he won’t be appointed…. This is the mission done behind the scenes.” Wydad took on Esperance on Friday in Rabat. The game ended in a 1-1 draw, but left Wydad fans utterly distraught and frustrated over the number of refereeing mistakes in favor of their Tunisian opponent. Even as they were reduced to 10 men, with their captain Brahim Nakach receiving a red card at the beginning of the second half, Wydad was thoroughly dominant and created more scoring chances. Throughout the game, however, there were repetitive refereeing mistakes that held Wydad back from taking advantage of those chances and tended to be more in favor their Tunisian guests. Examining the game in a radio interview, with a local Tunisian broadcaster, Chiboub sympathized with the frustration of Wydad fans, saying that the Moroccans would have won the game had it not been for the referees’ obvious bias for Esperance. He particularly pointed to a Wydad goal the referee ruled, arguing that it should have stood. “The referee’s decision on the goal was an error,” he said. The two teams will face each other again on May 31, with the aggregate result of the two legs set to determine the winner of this year’s most prestigious trophy for African clubs. Meanwhile, after receiving two equally vehement complaint letters from the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRFM) and the Wydad board, CAF proceeded to suspend Gehad Grisha, the Egyptian referee of the Wydad vs. Esperance game.

Rabat – Leading Muslim figures in Islamic centers in Finland  have released a statement addressing the incident on Sunday May 26, when far right politician Marco de Wit tore up the holy Quran in the presence of witnesses and police.  The statement  follows a meeting held by Islamic Center leaders on Wednesday, May 30. In the statement, they denounced the “hostile” and “blasphemous” nature of the public display, which they said brings into the open a deep-seated racist attitude towards Muslims and Islam. The statement called for Muslims of Finland to “show patience and wisdom” and to seek legal justice rather than react rashly and meet the negative expectations of Muslims created by populist ‘fear mongering’ and divisive politics which seek to cause ‘contrived disputes’. The statement also urged all Muslims to avoid staging strikes and protests and to respond peacefully. Yakup Yilmaz, A Turkish businessman and a member of the World Turkish Business Council’s European Committee, who reported the news on Sunday, May 26, said that de Wit hurled insults at the Prophet Mohammed and Islam as he shredded the sacred Qur’an. He reported the “hate crime” to a police officer, who was present during the incident but “did nothing.”  According to Anadolu, it is not unprecedented for de Wit to engage in such incendiary behaviors towards other faiths, he has previously committed the same act against the Jewish sacred text, the Torah.  The Finnish national broadcasting company YLE, reported a study conducted by an academic researcher WHICH asserted that hate crime, despite being outlawed in the Finnish penal code, often avoid harsh sentences within the justice system.

The far-right, previously holding only 3 seats, has won 18 seats in Sunday’s elections in the lower house. Also in the right-wing is the Belgian federal parliament’s first observant Jew, Michael Freilich, who wants to address is immigration. Freilich feels strongly about the Marrakech Pact, which seeks to reduce the root causes of migration while making it safer for people who choose to move across borders. In 2015, more than a million people streamed into Europe, often by foot and under painful conditions. By signing the pact, countries pledge to respect the human rights of refugees and economic migrants, reduce the detention of migrants, and offer them basic social services. Freilich said, “The chaos with uncontrolled migration is no longer possible,” said Freilich. “The Marrakech Pact has been the deciding factor for me. I advocate a controlled migration to the Canadian [immigration] model.”
Belgian King Philippe began consultations Sunday to form the government.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI received US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, as he visited Morocco this week to discuss the “Israeli-Palestinian Peace Plan.”  Of Jewish faith, Kushner took advantage of his chance to visit a Jewish pilgrimage site. Accompanied by Trump’s personal envoy for international relations, the representative visited the tomb of Rabbi Haim Pinto Hakatane in Casablanca. Rabbi David Pinto, with an American delegation and members of the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met Kushner at the site. In a video, Jared Kushner expresses his joy at realizing his “dream of many years.” In the same video, his Moroccan host speaks to a representative of the Moroccan delegation, describing Trump’s advisor “as [his] son” to him. Kushner took a guided tour of the historic cemetery in the Casablanca medina while the rabbi explained the religious significance of Haim Pinto in Essaouira and his son in Casablanca. The house is an annual place of pilgrimage for the Jews. The visit comes as concerns in Israel have prompted Jared Kushner’s visit to Morocco, calling on the government and the state to sign a “peace plan” proposed by the US administration. The visit has not been well received by some Moroccan groups who have called for a sit-in Friday at 22h in front of the Parliament in Rabat, to reiterate their opposition to the US “deal of the century.”

Rabat – The MAD 19.5 million ($2 million) project coordinated by French research institute CIRAD will run for four years and is funded by the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). It’s purpose is to identify and reinforce small-scale innovative projects in the water management sector in rural Morocco, focusing in particular on successful small-scale farming irrigation practices. These may include drip irrigation, new solar water pump technology, and recycling waste water, as well as innovative water governance measures. The project also aims to identify any other agricultural practices with the potential to reinforce Morocco’s resilience towards water shortages, stated CIRAD in a press release. Once these innovative projects have been identified, CIRAD aims to develop and reinforce them. The Massire project will pair small scale farmers with key players in sustainable development such as irrigation companies, agricultural cooperatives, NGOs, researchers and local Moroccan start-ups, to give them access to the technologies and services needed to develop sustainable farming.

In 2016, a particularly severe drought seriously impacted agricultural production and the country’s GDP dropped by 3.3%.  According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 83% of agricultural land in Morocco is not irrigated. Crop yields therefore suffer significantly from variations in rainfall and droughts. This vulnerability will only increase, as the FAO predicts a 30% drop in rainfall by 2050, making water management an urgent issue for Morocco.

Rabat – In December, ACWA Power brought the 150 MW Noor III focal pinnacle plant online, with 7.5 long stretches of capacity limit in Morocco.  Introduced by Spain’s SENER and China’s SEPCO Electric Power Construction Corporation, Noor III is the world’s biggest operational pinnacle plant and just the second to incorporate liquid salt stockpiling innovation.  The Noor III is located in the Drâa-Tafilalet region in Morocco, 10 kilometers from Ouarzazate, a city in the in Ghessat rural council area. The Noor III plant has exceeded performance targets for the first few months of operations, project partners told New Energy Update. So far, financing costs for the CSP tower plant have stayed at a higher cost than predicted, because of lower introduced limit and problems experienced during early plant operations.  High capital consumption (CapEx) cost of CSP plants and restricted introduced limit means financing expenses stay far higher than for PV and wind plants.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for explanatory trough CSP plants is evaluated at around 45%-half of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), contingent upon the market.  As of not long ago, explanatory trough innovation commanded the CSP showcase with more than 4 GW of the introduced limit, contrasted and 1 GW of the pinnacle limit.  Interest for pinnacle limit is on the ascent as engineers influence the more noteworthy stockpiling proficiency of pinnacle structures. Currently around 610 MW of CSP tower limit is under development in Chile, China, and UAE, according to information from the New Energy Update CSP Global Tracker.  For pinnacle plants, WACC may speak to around a 3% higher offer of expenses, however, this will change before long, said Xavier Lara, the Senior Consultant at CSP engineering group Empresarios Agrupados (EA). Strong early performance data on output, generation, flexibility, and storage integration will reduce reliability concerns for CSP tower with storage and lower the cost of capital for future projects. Increased risks Limited deployment of tower plants has meant individual project performance has had a significant impact on investor confidence. Issues at Solar Reserve’s 110 MW Crescent Dunes CSP power plant in Nevada, U.S. meant that the project missed important ramp-up targets in the first few years of production. Bow Dunes was the first solar pinnacle with liquid salt stockpiling venture and began operations in October 2015.  Power yield at Crescent Dunes was lower than planned during initial operations at the plant and, a year after start-up, the plant was closed down for eight months due to a  break in the liquid salt stockpiling framework. Yield remained lower than predicted in 2018, with a normal limit factor of 20.3% contrasted and a planned limit factor of 51.9%, as indicated by EIA information.  Designers have balanced venture plans to represent higher risk assessments for pinnacle plants.  ACWA Power and partners have recently included a record 600 MW explanatory trough ability to the 100 MW Noor Energy 1 CSP pinnacle stockpiling venture in Dubai. The undertaking was later extended to incorporate 250 MW of PV.  The large portion of more proven parabolic trough technology helped to lower the financing costs, Rajit Nanda, Chief Investment Officer at ACWA Power, told the CSP Madrid 2018 conference in November. “The moment trough was brought in as a larger part of the overall hybrid, it brought about a completely different level of comfort,” he said.  Key focus areas for CSP tower with storage investors will be the performance of the Solar Field (SF), Heliostat Field Control System (HFCS) and Molten Salts Receiver (MSR) and integration with the storage and power block systems, said Lara. Data from the first few months of operation show Noor III is exceeding performance targets on total output, ramping rates, as well as the integration of the thermal energy storage and steam generation systems, Lara disclosed. Lara added that EA is “proud to say that EA is doing its best effort to manage the integration between the “solar island” and the rest of the plant, which was one of the main factors of the failure at Crescent Dunes.”

Rabat – In the first trend, research is not geared towards the status of women in Islam or women’s rights and duties in Islam; rather, it expresses a voice or voices of Muslim women (but also men) seeking to create a comprehensive intellectual framework that would facilitate the discussion of Islamic jurisprudence from a feminist perspective and come up with more egalitarian and fairer legal interpretations.  While the time frame of first trend is located in the present historical moment which may be roughly situated in the period that extends from the early 1990s to the today, the second trend does not see its mission as new and locates its cognitive model in the beginning of Islam.  In both trends, research is mainly conducted at the level of theorizing and seeks to transform Islamic ideals and values into theories and knowledge visions that would stimulate specific interpretative or jurisprudential interpretations. Hence, the main difference between the two trends does not revolve around the expression “Islamic feminism” per se nor around the meaning of this expression, because in the end, both trends may be seen as “Islamic knowledge” that aims at anchoring Islamic justice to the (legal) relationships of men and women within and outside the family.  Simply put, if we are engaged in integrating Islamic justice to the political arena, why not integrate it to the social arena and to the relationship between the sexes in the family and society? Various factors have helped the emergence of Islamic feminism, including political considerations and cultural ideology, which differ from country to country.  The growing religious knowledge of women and the success of Islamic movements in attracting women in their endeavor to invade the public sphere, as well as the intensification of the so-called clash of civilizations between the East and the West and the threat of radical ideologies to women’s rights, are all factors that contributed to the emergence of Islamic feminism. What Characterizes Islamic Feminism? For many male and female researchers in the field, Islamic feminism is a response to Western feminism. In order to avoid generalization here, it should be mentioned that although the history of Western feminism is linked to the history of material philosophy, Western feminism has evolved in the last four or so decades and has now developed in various brands and schools.  Hence, there is the Anglo-American school and the French school, which yielded Marxist, liberal and religious feminisms, as well as conservative religious feminism, such as Christian, Buddhist, Jewish feminisms, to cite only these. In general, Islamic feminism differs from Western feminism at the level of values; hence, for example, whereas Western feminism is generally based on individual freedom and allows homosexuality, Islamic feminism does not. On the other hand, Western and Islamic feminism differ in dealing with modernity and postmodernism.  While Western feminism built its modernist project on a conflict with men for obtaining legal rights and constructing a postmodernist project on gender, Islamic feminism built its modernist project on a feminist discourse in line with human rights principles and its post-modernist project on the struggle of both sexes against a rigid jurisprudence that no longer reflects the spectacular progress that Muslim women have achieved. Furthermore, opinions differ as to the goals of Islamic feminism. Some see it as a way of moving in the direction of reform only; others see it as a way of moving in an interpretive direction aimed at questioning religious texts and replacing the masculine vision adopted in interpreting the legal texts on women’s issues; others see it as a way of transforming feminism into an Islamic one; and yet others see it as fundamentally lacking a recognition of the precise meaning of feminism as a self-centered movement and deplore lack of a methodology that would reflect this. In practice, the basic issue is reference: is the Qur’an only? The Qur’an and Hadith (prophet Muhammad’s sayings and deeds)? Is it gender equality? Is it a mere strategy to gain rights?   The various opinions on Islamic feminism are dictated by ideology and the nature of society: Is it a Muslim majority society? What political, social and legal system regulate this society, etc.  These differences are also attested in what is considered as the root of Islamic of Islamic feminisms.  Some associate these roots the progressive Islam movement that emerged in South Africa as a reaction to the apartheid regime; others associate them with the Turkish scholar Nilofar Gul (1991) book; others with the Itanian “Zanan” magazine, which expressed the disappointment of the Iranian feminists with the revolution; others link the roots of Islamic feminism with academics who studied the religious texts without self-identifying as Islamic feminists such as the Egyptian writer Nawal al-Saadawi, the Moroccan sociologist Fatima Mernissi, and the Tunisian academic Olfa Youssef. Between these different and varied views, women’s issues in Arab and Islamic societies remain the central focus of any ideology because women are the main link between the individual and society.  The questions that emerge at this juncture are: What kind of feminism does Morocco aspire to in the age of rapid transformations, not only in terms of individuals but also at terminological level? A forum to be organized in Fez at the beginning of June 2019 will discuss these issues.

Rabat – The Moroccan National Health Security Office of Food (ONSSA) has released an alert warning against the consumption of mint leaves.  Following a nationwide study, ONSSA found pesticide residues and high levels of unapproved chemicals in bunches of mint leaves, an essential ingredient in the manufacture of mint tea, the iconic Moroccan drink.  The ONSSA has sent a letter warning not to consume mint leaves to all the walis of Morocco, signed by the Regional Directors of the Public Office, as the situation “poses an immediate risk to the health of the consumer.” ONSSA underlined that it will put in place a series of measures to resolve the problem. In a letter addressed to the wali of the Souss Massa region, the ONSSA requested support from the local authorities to help inspectors implement emergency measures. The details of the measures were listed in a letter to the wali of the Tanger-Tétouan-Al-Hoceima region. The ONSSA is requesting that walis give verbal warnings to farmers not complying with health standards and destroy all mint that does not meet health standards. ONSSA is also requesting that wholesale markets and supermarkets require distributors of mint leaves to present the results of laboratory analyzes proving that the leaves meet health standards.

Rabat – Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco arrived inSaudi Arabia on Thursday to represent King Mohammed VI at the Gulf and Arab League  “urgent” summits, convened by King Salman of Saudi Arabia. On May 18, King Salman invited leaders of Arab countries and Gulf states for two urgent summits to discuss “aggressions and their consequences” across the region. The Saudi initiative comes after Saudi Arabia accused Iran of ordering the attacks against the two Saudi oil pumping stations at Yanbu, on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. In addition to Morocco, Qatar also announced its decision to accept Saudi Arabia’s invitation to attend the Mecca summits. Sources quoted by the Independent Arabia said that the participation of Prince Moulay Rachid seeks to “increase the level of representation and due to the importance of the three summits, which might result in the consolidation of the Arab position towards the recent attacks by Iran.” In 2016,  Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on Morocco’s non-attendance at the  Arab League summits, emphasizing that the absence was due to the lack of important concrete initiatives “which could be submitted to Arab Heads of State, this summit will only be an occasion to take ordinary resolutions and deliver speeches which pretend to give a false impression of unity and solidarity between Arab States.” Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs accompanied the Prince to Saudi Arabia. The minister joined a meeting of  Foreign ministers of the member States of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which kicked off on Wednesday evening in Jeddah. Qatari Prime Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani will represent Emir of Qatar during the summits. Arab leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Iraq, Palestine and Mauritania will all attend the summits. However, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is expected not to attend the summit. Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs  Mevlut Cavusoglu will represent  the Turkish President.

Rabat – As unemployment rate in Morocco is still high, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced that the government will set up a “vigilance committee” designated to oversee the job market and study the unemployment-related challenges faced by Morocco. Responding to the challenges,  El Othmani said that the new committee, which will operate nationally, regionally, and sectorally, will evaluate how well policies, strategies, plans are implemented, according to a government statement. The decision aims to “put into place Morocco’s national plan” regarding the creation of job opportunities as outlined in the operational program 2018-2021, which the Ministerial Committee on Employment ratified in 2018. One of the tasks of the committee would be to run “periodical monitoring” of the outcomes achieved by the sectoral plans and strategies in terms of job creation and loss, and to pinpoint setbacks against the strategy targets. It will also work on anticipating future job opportunities as well as developing ways to reach employment targets. According to the same statement, this committee will also undertake to develop and unify new approaches, as well as “putting forward practical measures to increase the chance of harmony between the sectoral plans and wider policies.” The committee will be comprised of a number of representatives of various sectors and institutions, who will examine the quantitative and qualitative data on the labour market, from economic sectors, projects that are faced with employee-related issues. The committee will also find ways to bridge gaps in the job market. The committee will involve over 15 government ministries.  The number of job opportunities the government created in the public sector has increased, amounting to 138,791 within the last three years.

Article 2-307 of the new law proposed in parliament this week would impose a prison sentence of 1 to 3 months and fines from MAD 2,000 to MAD 5,000 on anyone who attempts to prevent an academic examination process, by any means, reports Moroccan news outlet Al Massae. The proposal received strong reactions from parliament, particularly from the deputy of the Party for Justice and Development Amina Maelainine. Maelainine expressed concerns about this “repressive” proposal, calling to cancel the blanket prison sentences. “Our suggestion is to move away from the restriction of liberty and to instead move towards disciplinary procedures outside the criminal code,” Maelainine stated. According to Maelainine, reports Al Massae, prison sentences would only be appropriate for those who disturb an academic exam by using violence, particularly using firearms, which is a already a crime punishable by imprisonment.  Morocco values the integrity of its education system and has strong laws against cheating in high school exams.  In September 2016, the government passed a law imposing disciplinary sanctions on students caught cheating during exams, or for falsifying or usurping identity to take an exam. These include an immediate fail, and prevention from re-taking  the exam for up to two years. It also includes criminal sanctions. Identity fraud in an exam and the leaking exam papers is punishable by prison sentences from 6 months to 5 years, and fines from MAD 5 000 ($514) to MAD 100 000 ($10,300). The lawmakers’ proposal this week to criminalize the disturbance of exams only reaffirms its concern over exams not running smoothly.

Rabat – Moroccan police arrested a 56-year old Italian suspected of being a leading member of one of the Italian mafias known as La Camorra on Wednesday in Tangier. The suspect is arrested in connection with criminal acts, including blackmailing businessmen, violence, international homicide, and transnational drug trafficking. Morocco’s police arrested the suspect in collaboration with the members of the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST). The arrest comes in line with an international arrest warrant issued by the Italian judicial authorities as well as an international search notice from Interpol, a statement from the General Directorate of National Security said. The DGSN put the suspect in custody for further investigation, pending the extradition procedure. The arrest of the suspect is part of Morocco’s international cooperation in the fight against international criminal networks. Wednesday’s operation comes after the arrest of two high-profile European criminals in the last six weeks. In March, Moroccan police arrested another Italian suspected of being a leading member of the Mazarella club, affiliated with the Camorra. The suspect was on the run since 2014. In addition,  Moroccan police also arrested Spanish suspect Roberto Izquierdo Riegi otherwise known as “The Russian” in Tetouan. He was sentenced to 58 years in prison by the court in Cadiz, Spain, for kidnapping and murder. He escaped prison in November of last year, during a stay at a hospital in Madrid, and was on the run for 5 months. Morocco’s efforts against criminal network have received applause internationally.  In addition to their role in combating criminal networks, Morocco’s DGSN  also combat irregular immigration, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and terrorism.

Rabat – While on the streets of Algiers the Algerian political establishment faces its most serious popular challenge in decades, the death of Kamel Eddine Fekhar, a prominent dissident, has dealt a serious blow to the Algerian regime’s human rights record. Announcing Fekhar’s death in a Facebook post on Tuesday, May 28, the dissident’s lawyer, Salah Dabouz, did not shy away from squarely pointing fingers at the country’s culture of “impunity” and politicized justice. For Dabouz, the rapid and seemingly out of control circumstances that led to Fekhar’s “scheduled death” means the government, through its repressive security mechanism, is directly responsible for the tragedy. Fekhar, who was detained at a prison facility in Ghardaia, 600 km south of Algiers, started a hunger strike days before news emerged of his death. According to his lawyers, Fekhar was in dire need of medical assistance in his final days since his health was rapidly deteriorating due the “inhuman” detention conditions. But, he suggested in his Facebook post, inadequate medical care and the indifference of judges to his health condition meant the activist’s death was “planned.” Dabouz asked: “Did authorities at the Ghardaia Justice Court intend to physically eliminate Dr Fekhar in the midst of the ongoing revolution so that his death goes unnoticed and escape public attention?” A former elected official of the Socialist Forces Front (FFS) and a prominent militant for the autonomy of the Mozabites, an Ibadi Berber group in the Ghardaia region in northern Saharan in Algeria, Fekhar had a troubled history with Algerian authorities. His fierce opposition to Algeria’s “repressive” and “discriminatory” policies against Mozabites made him a target for police arrests and long stays in prisons. Fekhar was most recently arrested on 31 March for a particularly damning speech in which he accused Algiers of segregation and discrimination against certain groups. But his most known clash with Algerian authorities happened in July 2015 in the aftermath of violent inter-community skirmishes in Ghardaia. Fekhar, who by then had become one of the loudest and most respected voices of the fight for Mozabite autonomy, was suspected by Algiers of having ties to foreign rivals, mainly Morocco. Back then, he was arrested and charged with 15 indictments, including “incitement to hate and violence” and “disruption of public safety.” He spent a little over two years in detention before social pressure forced the government to release him. The Algerian press has vociferously responded to the news of Fekhar’s death, with some of the country’s most prominent journalists unapologetically taking on the government’s “unfair” and “discriminatory” policies. Like Fekhar’s lawyer, the country’s media personalities have pointed damning fingers at the Algeria’s politicized judiciary system as well as its police force. Sid Ahmed Semiane, an Algerian journalist and documentary filmmaker, said he was “lost for words” after learning the news of Fekhar’s “sad” and “shocking” death. He added, “Kamel Eddine Fekhar died as a political prisoner. It is a shame, an abject crime.” Journalist Otman Lahiani brought the indignation to another, higher level. For him, the dissident activist is the victim of Algeria’s police state, where holding views different than the authorities is perceived as a crime. At stake in post-revolution Algeria is the need to “arrest and prosecute those responsible” to ensure that what happened to Fekhar does not happen to others, he stressed. For its part, the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH) lambasted the country’s political system for its “stubbornness” and “contempt” in targeting dissident voices. The FFF, Fekhar’s political family, denounced the “arbitrary, inhumane, and unbearable” detention conditions that precipitated his death. In a press release, the party “condemned the dictatorial tendency of our country’s decision makers” and demanded that other political prisoners “languishing… in [Algerian] death camps” be released immediately. The shock of Fekhar’s death comes as Algeria continues to be entangled in a web of popular anger, an eruption of anti-government sentiment after years of ineffective political leadership. According to French outlet Le Point, students in Algiers demonstrated on Tuesday against the government and in solidarity with Fekhar. Meanwhile, while popular indignation at Fekhar’s death is still fresh, Algeria stands accused of blatantly disregarding human rights during ongoing anti-government demonstrations. After the recent death of Ramzi Yettou, a 22-year-old who died while protesting against the government, international advocacy groups like Amnesty have called on the Algerian government to be more accommodating of human rights. Claiming that Yettou died as a result of head injuries sustained after members of riot police violently hit him, the international advocacy group has demanded that an “in-depth investigation” be opened to shed light on the death of the young protester.

Rabat – Islamophobia has been a persistent hot topic in parliament in recent months as debate over a definition of Islamophobia and ongoing complaints within the Tory party continues under the backdrop of increasing national and global violence against Muslim communities. MCB, which represents mosques, schools, and charitable organizations, formally urged the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to step in on repeated reported cases of Islamophobia within the UK’s ruling party, after repeated disregarded calls for the party to investigate and take action against its accused members. “It is a sad day for us to have brought this complaint to the doors of the EHRC, but the concerns of Muslims at large about Islamophobia within the Conservative Party have fallen on deaf ears,” Harun Rashid Khan, MCB Secretary General said in a statement.  An ongoing issue
 MCB cited 150 examples of Tory islamophobia and emphasized a trend of intolerance, lack of action on complaints, and denial within the party, such as Boris Johnson’s description of women wearing burkas as “letter boxes” or “bank robbers.” Lack of action suggests “a culture within the Conservative Party where Islamophobia is not only widespread but institutional,” Khan said, regarding MCB’s decision to bring the issue to the EHRC. Tory Chairman Brandon Lewis told Hope Not Hate, a British political action group, there is “absolutely no place for [Islamophobia] in this country or in the Conservative Party.” While 14 Tory party members have been suspended because of islamophobic Facebook posts, Lewis has not yet said how many complaints the party received in total, despite calls to be more transparent in their processing of complaints. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims, a non-partisan group aiming to support aspirations and challenges faced by British Muslims, proposed a working definition of Islamophobia to be used in parliament in December 2018. Their definition states: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.” While the definition, which is not legally binding, has been adopted by the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, the Conservative party said it needed “further consideration,” because of its implication on free speech. The National Police Chief’s Council (NPPC) added that the current definition could cause confusion in police investigations and limit counter-terrorism enforcement. “Free speech cannot be an absolute right or freedom to harm, but as it stands this definition risks shutting down debate about any interpretation of the tenets of Islam which are at odds with our laws and customs, which in turn would place our police officers and members of the judicial system in an untenable position,” NPPC Lead for Counter-Terrorism Neil Basu said in a statement. Recent attacks add to urgency Outside of parliament, MCB has called for greater aid in protecting Muslims and mosques following the New Zealand Christchurch attack and recent violence within the UK. The number of attacks on Muslims within the country has been on the rise, with street incidents increasing by 30 percent and online incidents increasing by 16.3 percent from the previous year, according to a 2017 report by TellMAMA [Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks].  “Every single one of us who goes to the mosque could picture themselves in that mosque in New Zealand, living those exact moments. With guys going around Birmingham smashing up mosques, it brings it a bit [closer to] home,” resident Abdullah Saif told Aljazeera following the March 2019 string of attacks on Birmingham mosques. The risk of being a victim of a hate crime was highest for Muslim adults and 46 percent of Muslims said “prejudice against Islam makes it very difficult to be Muslim in this country,” according to a report by the APPG on British Muslims. In response, the government has increased the funding any religious group can apply for to increase security at their place of worship. The MCB request coincides with EHRC’s announcement of a formal investigation into anti-semitism within the Labour Party. The EHRC responded that it is following its “usual processes” in addressing complaints and has not confirmed a full investigation.

Rabat – The Algerian Prosecutor has called for a thorough, unbiased investigation into the death of protester Ramzi Yettou, 22, who was killed last month. The human rights organization Amnesty International has amassed evidence including witness statements from an emergency healthcare volunteer, two relatives, two legal advisers, and a specialist. The evidence shows that Ramzi dies on 19 April due to wounds inflicted by police batons.  As indicated by Amnesty International’s witness testimonies, Ramzi was beaten on the head by police as he was going to head home after attending a hostile government protest in central Algiers on 12 April 2019. The protest had been disbanded by security forces using tear gas and water cannons.  “Eyewitness accounts strongly suggest that Ramzi Yettou was brutally beaten on the head by police, causing injuries that appear to have led to his death.” Said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International. “Algeria’s authorities have a dire track record of not holding members of the security forces to account for human rights violations, which makes it all the more crucial for them to ensure that the investigation into Ramzi’s death is meaningful,” added the AI representative. Algeria’s prosecutor orders an investigation Amnesty International reviewed a copy of a police report authorizing Ramzi’s burial which cited the cause of death as “undetermined”, prompting Algeria’s prosecutor to order an investigation into the circumstances of his death. The prosecutor stated, “Ordering an investigation into Ramzi Yettou’s death is only the first step towards justice. It is crucial that the investigation is independent, impartial and effective, and those police officers involved are suspended while the investigation is ongoing.” “Failing to hold the perpetrators behind Ramzi Yettou’s death to account will only embolden the police and send the message that they are free to operate above the law and that they can commit crimes without facing any consequences.” Added the prosecutor. At the scene of the crime According to Amnesty International, Ramzi was about to head home to the town of Bougara (Blida) after attending a protest in Algiers on the afternoon of 12 April with approximately five friends. Police stopped the truck they were traveling in after the driver attempted to drive down a street in the wrong direction. When the police attacked them, some of the group managed to flee and others were beaten with batons. Before he lost consciousness, Ramzi told a first aid volunteer, who found him lying on the ground with blood on his jacket, that he had been beaten by police.  According to the volunteer, his nose was bruised, and he had a small superficial injury measuring around a centimeter under his eyebrows that was not bleeding. The first aid volunteer asked the police to call an ambulance, which arrived around 30 minutes later and transferred him to the Mustapha Bacha hospital where he underwent head surgery because of internal bleeding. He never regained consciousness and died on Friday 19 April.  Ramzi and his friends made the 50 km trip to Algiers every Friday to join demonstrations against the country’s ruling elite and political system which started earlier this year.

Rabat – In countries besieged by violence and cruelty, the blue helmet of United Nations Peacekeepers has, in many cases, become synonymous with a hope of safety. However, the blue helmet has also become a target for insurgent groups and militias, with dozens of peacekeepers giving their lives each year. When violence overtakes a foreign country, the world has two choices: stand by and watch their fellow humans descend into bloodshed or risk their own citizens’ lives in service of others. Morocco’s choice has always been the latter, and the kingdom was recently honored for its commitment to United Nations Peacekeeping Operations. On May 29, the globally recognized International Day of Peacekeepers, the United Nations paid tribute to the sacrifices of Moroccan volunteers in UN Peacekeeping Operations, many of whom gave their lives in pursuit of peace, especially in Africa. Contributing more than 2,100 uniformed peacekeeping volunteers, Morocco ranks 13th in the world for peacekeeper contribution, and has been “an essential partner of United Nations peacekeeping operations for many years,” said UN peacekeeping spokesman Nick Birnback.  From the bullet-littered jungles of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to the blood-stained grasslands of the Central African Republic (CAR), Moroccan volunteers with UN Peacekeeping operations have served in some of the most dangerous conflict zones in the world. During their struggle towards bringing peace to the world, 43 Moroccan peacekeepers have lost their lives. “We thank them for their commitment to preserving international peace and security, especially in Africa,” Birnback said. Last Friday, International Day of Peacekeepers was commemorated with a ceremony at the UN headquarters in New York, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres honoring the 119 peacekeepers slain in 2018 and 2019 with the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal, a posthumous award for UN peacekeeping forces. Guterres also laid a wreath of flowers in tribute to more than 3,800 peacekeeping troops, police officers, and civilians whose service towards the UN has saved countless lives in conflict zones around the world. Sent on dangerous assignments Moroccan peacekeepers have served in some of the most hostile and dangerous regions of the world, including the DRC and CAR, two of the deadliest countries for peacekeeping forces. In the DRC, conflict continues to smolder across the country after the Second Congo War (also known as the Great African War), which claimed over 5 million lives through fighting and its aftermath between 1998 and 2008. Despite attempts by the Congolese government and UN intervention forces, the conflict has not yet been resolved, and thousands upon thousands continue to live under harsh conditions in the middle of a warzone. In the CAR, a civil war has been raging since 2012 between government forces, the primarily-Islamist Séléka rebel movement, and the primarily-Christian Anti-balaka militia alliance.  Following the successful Séléka overthrow of the government, movement disbanded, but conflict continues between ex-Séléka militants and Anti-balaka forces. The crisis has experienced some of the worst human rights violations in recent history, including lynchings and pogroms against the country’s Muslim population. Despite UN intervention in the conflict, the bloodshed continues and over a million people have been forced to flee the violence. More than 2,000 of Morocco’s 2,100 peacekeeping volunteers are currently deployed to these two countries, where dozens of peacekeepers have already been murdered and dozens more are likely to fall as peace remains out of reach.

A survey conducted by the employment agency Rekrute found that 52% of Moroccans believe that Ramadan has no impact on their professional lives.  “What does your daily work life look like during Ramadan?” and “How does Ramadan affect your productivity at work?” were some of the questions asked to the 1,945 Moroccan who took part in the survey.  The answers revealed that 57% of those surveyed do not notice a drop in productivity at the office during Ramadan, whereas 43% admitted that fasting does affect their productivity. While one might assume the majority find Ramadan to be more difficult during the summer, those surveyed said the season in which the holy month falls makes no difference to productivity. 63% are indifferent, 22% say they are more productive if Ramadan falls in autumn or winter, while 15% actually feel more productive in the spring or summer.  The survey also looked at vacation days during Ramadan: 22% of employees take days off during Ramadan, compared to 78% who do not see any point in using their vacation days during Ramadan. While many offices change their working hours during the holy month, the answers varied when the employees were asked what shift would be best. 53% answered they would prefer to start their day earlier at, around 8 am, in order to leave the office as early as possible, whereas 29% prefer to start later around 10am. 18% said they were indifferent to schedule changes. After breaking the fast, 61% of employees do not continue working while 19% return to the office for a few hours and 20% continue their work from home. 29% of employees surveyed believe that Ramadan actually has a positive impact on their workplace behavior, while 19% think it affects them negatively. 52% simply answered that Ramadan has no effect either way.  The study also found that many employees say they actively try to improve their overall habits and health during the month: 36% report that they eat lighter meals with less fat and sugar, 22% do more sports to prevent or reduce stress, and 18% reduce their coffee and cigarette consumption. The study concluded by adding that all employs responded they are more calm and patient during the month of Ramadan, and display the values connected to Ramadan more, such as empathy and sharing, which in turn has a positive effect on the workplace, according to Rekrute.

Rabat – Beginning on June 10, Moroccans booking an appointment for a Schengen Visa must pay the service charge in advance. This is a new procedure that Spain has issued for making Schengen visas appointments. From June 10th, online applicants for these visas will have to pay MAD 220 in management fees for the BLS website. The BLS service fee, however, must be paid within three days of making an appointment. If payment is not made within 72 hours, the appointment will be automatically canceled. This is now stated clearly on the BLS website. The company follows in the footsteps of its neighbor TLS contact, which also manages Schengen Visas for the Spanish consular services in Morocco. France already applied this procedure for visa applicants on 1 December 2018. However, at MAD 263, the fees are higher than the rate for Spain. According to the consular services of both countries, this measure of payment in advance for making appointments has been adopted to streamline traffic and counter false appointments, an issue which mainly concerns tourist visa applications and not long-stay visas and business visas. Spain has been increasing efforts to control the number of visas it issues since it is a border country for the EU, where irregular immigration has long been a problem.

Rabat –  Morocco’s international mining firm Managem announced that it has retrieved the gold cargo seized by Sudanese authorities earlier in May. On Tuesday, the company  said that the gold shipment  is part of “regular deliveries and the company has completed all the administrative formalities.” Quoted by Reuters, the company added that Sudanese authorities have been “able to acknowledge our scrupulous compliance with regulatory procedures.” The firm also announced that the gold shipment  had now been “cleared for export.” Reuters reported that Managem retrieved the 241-kilogram gold cargo, while earlier reports said that the gold cargo weighed 84 kilograms. Managem’s statement comes after authorities in Sudan intercepted an aircraft belonging to the Moroccan mining company earlier this month. The aircraft, which was carrying the gold, reportedly lacked “authorization.” The Sudanese authorities denied that the incident had anything to do with contraband concerns. The director of the Sudanese Chamber of Commerce Ibrahim Abou Bakr,  also denied all speculation, emphasizing that all “administrative export procedures were appropriate.” He added that Managem had all the  “mining concessions like all other companies” and that the aircraft used for shipping the load of gold “belonged to another company, which rented it to Managem.” Abu Bakr also commented on the amount of gold carried by aircraft, emphasizing that the total load of the goal is estimated at 96 kilograms. The Moroccan firm specializes in producing silver, cobalt, gold, and copper. It also is also active in other countries including Cote D’Ivoire, Mali, Conakry, Gabon, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in addition to Sudan, according to Reuters.

Rabat – The MIPIM Awards, an internationally-renowned real estate competition, compiles and ranks the most outstanding and accomplished real estate projects internationally in 11 categories.  More than 200 projects from 56 countries were taken into consideration. The jury met in Paris to evaluate the various projects according to their originality in terms of innovation and design, their ecological and architectural qualities, and integration into their environment. This year, the Anfa Club Pavillion in Casablanca snagged 6th place in the category of most beautiful real estate projects. The estate, developed by Yasmine Signature, consists of two four-story semi-detached buildings with apartments ranging in size from 45 to 300 m2. Two French architects, Edouard François and Pierres-Yves Rochon, are to thank for the design of both the interior and exterior. The Deputy General Manager of Yasmine Signature, Omar Berrada, says he is “delighted” by the Anfa Club Pavillions’ placement on the list. “The Anfa Club Pavilions is the only project in the Casa Anfa neighborhood where green and natural spaces make up 70% of the total area,” he added. The price of a property at the Anfa Club Pavilion starts as low MAD 1.2 million and goes up to more than MAD 9 million. The price per square meter varies between 23,000 and 26,000 dirhams.

Rabat – While the imam may not be speaking about the video itself, his comments touch on the center of a serious debate about the differences between women and men. The video in question shows a person wearing the “ihram,” a white robe men wear for the pilgrimage to Mecca. However, despite the individual wearing men’s clothes, they appear to be female, which could suggest an androgynous identity. Viewers are confused by the combination of a female phenotype taking on the gender role of a man. The apparent crossover is gaining attention as an unacceptable example of male and female parts coexisting.  Sheikh Adel al-Kalbani, the former imam of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, condemns rigid gender separation, saying the practice has become so strict that it contributes to a “woman phobia.” In his comments, he was referring to the rules which make life for Saudi women vastly different from life for Saudi men. The comments were made during a televised interview. In the context of Saudi Arabia’s conservative politics, Kalbani is known to be a more liberal religious leader, as he allows music and card games which have been banned in public. Saudi has only just recently allowed women to drive, and even then there must be a male guardian present. These sorts of restrictions extend to the mosques, which is what Al-Kalbani criticizes in his interview. Al-Kalbani also said that women under today’s conditions are more segregated than they were during the Prophet Mohammed’s time: “In the Prophet’s era… the men used to pray in the front and women prayed in the back of the mosque without a partition, not even a curtain.” “Sadly today, we are paranoid – in a mosque – a place of worship. [Women] are completely separated from men,” Al-Kalbani noted. He also said that women should be addressed by their names. Calling women by their names is a practice from the time of early Islam. Saudi Journalist Jasmine Bager elaborated on the many ways women are addressed in Time Magazine, “As it stands now, our names are not spoken. Instead, women are often referred to as a man’s daughter, wife, sister or mother. In fact, a woman’s name is considered so private that it’s embarrassing or shameful to some if they are made to say it. Strangers will call a woman ‘auntie’ or ‘teacher.’ And we are traditionally not addressed at all by men who are not related to us.” Al-Kalbani continued the dialogue over the strict social segregation in Saudi by saying in the interview: “Today, it is a separated room, some even far from the original Prophet’s Mosque area, I believe this is some type of phobia toward women.” The grandson of Saudi Arabia’s former grand mufti believes that the partition is necessary to ensure women must pray behind men. He dismissed Kalbani’s comments with an insult: “Honestly, a cow is more useful than Kalbani,” Saleh ibn Baz said.

For the 99th year running, the Sefrou festival, also called the “moussem of the King’s fruits,” will celebrate the region’s cherry growing industry, and its unique cultural heritage. The festival was listed in 2012 on the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list, which recognizes practices worldwide that celebrate cultural identity and promote respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. The Sefrou festival will include artistic events, conferences on cherry farming, open air concerts, sports competitions, and the annual “Miss Cherry” pageant. If anything like last year, folkloric shows, an art exhibition, and “fantasias,” will also be on the cards. The official schedule for this years’ festival has not yet been released. The event provides an opportunity for local associations and cooperatives to commercialize their products and promote the region’s economy. The festival is one of seven Moroccan heritage items on the UNESCO list.  Also on the list are the moussem of Tan Tan that brings together nomadic Moroccan tribes, the cultural space of Jemaa El Fna plaza in Marrakech, the Mediterranean diet, falcon hunting, argan cultivation and exploitation, and the Taskiwin dance from the Atlas Mountains.

Rabat – Having arrived in Morocco on Tuesday with Trump’s senior adviser Jared Kushner, US special envoy for international negotiations Jason Greenblatt expressed gratitude to King Mohammed VI for hosting the iftar (breaking fast ceremony) at the Sale Royal Palace on Tuesday. The official tweeted his thanks to the Moroccan monarch, emphasizing that he was “honored” to share iftar with the King, Crown Prince Moulay El Hassan, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, and Kushner. “Thank you to his majesty for a special evening and for sharing your wisdom,” said Greenblatt. The US senior official also recalled the diplomatic ties between the US and Morocco during his brief note on the evening. “Morocco is an important friend &amp; ally of the United States.” Morocco and the US share strong political, economic, and military ties. Morocco also enjoys wide support among many members of Congress. The North African country is among the few counties to sign a Free Trade Agreement with the US. The US and Morocco also partner in counterterrorism to combat the global scourge of terrorism and extremism. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that King Mohammed VI held talks with Jared Kushner on strengthening the “long-standing, solid, and multidimensional strategic partnership between Morocco and the United States, as well as on developments in the region of North Africa and the Middle East.” The Kushner visit Greenblatt arrived in Morocco with Trump’s son in law, Kushner, who is tasked with promoting the US Middle East Plan during his tour. Honored to share an Iftar this evening with His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, FM Nasser Bourita &amp; Jared Kushner. Thank you to His Majesty for a special evening and for sharing your wisdom. Morocco is an important friend &amp; ally of the United States — Jason D. Greenblatt (@jdgreenblatt45) May 28, 2019  Kushner is also expected to visit Jordan and Israel ahead of the US-sponsored economic symposium, which will take place on June 25-26 in Manama, Bahrain. The conference aims to encourage investment in Palestine as promised by the US administration. During the symposium, Kushner is expected to unveil his much-awaited “Deal of the Century,” which aims to end the Israel-Palestine Conflict. The deal focuses on an economic and human development approach. The Bahrain economic conference will serve as a platform where the US will showcase the advantages of the’ Deal of the Century’. The conference will house workshops to convene finance ministers and regional business leaders in a forum discuss the economic future of the region. Kushner said in an interview with CNN earlier this month that the deal’s focus would be the finding of a “realistic and viable” political future for the region. While several countries already supported the symposium and confirmed their attendance, the Palestinian Authority announced its decision to boycott the business event in Manama. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesperson for Palestine’s Mahmoud Abbas, said that there will be no peace discussion if the political aspect of the conflict is not given the spotlight it deserves. “Any plan without political horizons will not lead to peace.” Rudeineh’s statement was supported by Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas who said last week that Palestine  will “not take part in such a conference.” “We will not sell our country based on an economic project,” he said. The officials also called on Arab states to boycott the event. Morocco’s support  Palestine has condemned the US approach to the conflict, emphasizing that Trump’s administration serves Israeli interests first. The tension between Morocco and the US intensified when the US announced its decision to move their embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision which met with worldwide criticism. The decision received a backlash from Arab leaders, including King Mohammed VI. The King shows Morocco’s support to the Palestinian cause at every possible event, denouncing any moves against the status of Jerusalem. In December 2017, King Mohammed VI was among the first leaders who addressed a letter to Trump to warn him against the Jerusalem embassy. The King also signed  Al Quds call with Pope Francis during his visit to Morocco in March. The Jerusalem call aims to emphasize the multi-religious and trans-cultural character of Jerusalem. The latest move to defend the Palestinian cause was during a meeting held between King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan, who visited Morocco in March. The monarchs also discussed the latest development in the region, including Trump’s decision to sign a proclamation recognizing Israel’s control over the occupied Golan Heights. The two Kings condemned Israel’s move towards the region. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967. Annexing the territory in 1981, Israel has since maintained control over the region.

Rabat – The Public Prosecutor at the Rabat Court of Appeals has ordered an investigation into the death of a protestor. Abdellah Hajili was accompanying his daughter at a Contractual Teachers’ demonstration when the incident took place.  The incident dates back to April 24 when the deceased called “spiritual father” by the teaching community for his unwavering support of their cause, was among the protesting teachers with his daughter, Houda. During the protest, Hajili allegedly sustained serious wounds when police used water cannons and violence to clear out protestors who were holding an overnight sit-in at the parliament building in the Capital, Rabat. The statement says that the deceased will undergo a post postmortem examination to pinpoint the causes and circumstances of his death, adding that the authorities will take due legal action in this matter.  On May 27, following the death of Hajili, the National Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contract (CNPCC) released a public statement expressing sorrow and sympathy, while calling for a three-day strike in Rabat in commemoration of the deceased, who they called “a martyr.” The CNPCC “barbaric police intervention,” urging all human rights groups to join forces to denounce the “arbitrary approach against peaceful protests.” Contractual teachers staged several strikes across a number of Moroccan cities, protesting the conditions of teachers in the public sector and calling for the abolition of fixed-term contract. The teachers argue that fixed term contracts are “discriminatory” in that it does not guarantee them the same rights permanent teachers enjoy. Strikes began on February 20, to commemorate the February 20 movement, and since then contractual teachers have been in a tug of war with the Ministry of Education. Both held several meetings to negotiate a mutual settlement. The discussions yielded no positive results. Both the government and contractual teachers’ representatives have accused each other of reneging on promises made during negotiations and no compromise has been reached. The contractual teachers returned to work, in response to calls from parents’ associations, to avoid a “blank year” (annee blanche) for students, which would nullify all exams taken this academic year.

Rabat – King Roger II invited Charif al-Idrisi to his kingdom and gave him a high ranking in the kingdom’s scientific circles. He also named  Charif al-Idrisi as head of a group of scientists, scholars, historians, and geographers to establish a world map with new scientific specifications, benefiting from the experience of seasoned travelers and the knowledge of traders, sailors, and explorers. The Moroccan geographer’s scientific and cognitive input, which span over 15 years of work, investigation, and scrutiny, key to the development of the world map which was engraved on a large silver plate and in a book called “Nuzhat al-Mushtaq Fi Khtirak Al Afaq.” (The Excursion of the One Who Yearns to Penetrate the Horizons — Library of Congress translation). Unfortunately, while the book has survived, the engraved silver plate has been lost in unknown circumstances. Al-Idrisi left the island of Sicily to Tunisia after the massacre of Muslims in 1161, when approximately 1165 Muslims were killed. Have we told you something new about the renowned geographer’s life?  The historical research available on Charif al-Idrisi leads us to ask questions about the more mysterious aspects of history. Searching for the truth about the man who changed the face of geography typically prompts a deep investigation into the hidden truths of history. How did the King of Sicily and southern Italy, Roger II, know Charif al-Idrisi? He was not a famous traveler or author of great achievement, nor was he a prominent scientist or author. Knowing that the city of Palermo, the capital of Sicily, had a prominent scientific status across Europe and that the court of King Roger II was full of intellectuals, poets, artists, historians, and others, what was the added value of the presence of Charif al-Idrisi? Why was he given a first-rate scientific and social status? Who was more in need of the other, was it the Norman / Christian king of Sicilia or the Charif al-Idrisi Skalli, an Andalusian / Muslim? Is it necessary for us to delve deeper into the life of the great geographer and traveler; where are the significant movements and historical stages in the life of Charif al-Idrisi? Should we believe that King Roger’s passion for science, knowledge, and geography was the sole reason he opened his palace to Charif al-Idrisi? Through further investigation, we are not questioning all historical research dating back to the 12th century. Rather, it is merely a matter of seeking to give historical context and due diligence to history by looking at the life of Charif al-Idrisi in a broader light.  We can try to solve this problem either by asking new questions or by connecting the dots to understand Charif al-Idrisi’s journey. But getting the context right requires that we first understand, and examine, the life of King Roger II.  With the presence of three popes during his reign, Roger II struggled with other Italian kings and dukes, due to his dream of uniting southern Italy and the institution of the Vatican. Finally, he was given the pope’s blessing as King of all Italy and as representative of Catholics on the Muslim Island of Sicily. All this required a great political understanding to make Sicily a cultural hub and a crossroads for religions, peoples, and languages. It was an island where Muslims constituted more than half of the population (with a presence of more than two and a half centuries), while Jewish and Byzantine were minorities. There were few Catholics among the Island’s soldiers as well. The wisdom of King Roger II, who was fluent in Arabic, Latin, and Greek, made him give many Muslim leaders the freedom to control their lands and their affairs, as well as making them commanders in the army. He also had the Byzantines as advisors and commanders in his armies. On the other hand, King Roger had ambitions in the south of the Mediterranean, and so after concluding trade agreements with the Fatimid state in Egypt, he invaded Tunisia and part of Libya, Algeria, and Greece and entered into clashes with the Byzantine state in the Balkans. Historians have uncovered King Roger II’s intention to build a Norman empire on the ashes of the Roman Empire, including part of Andalusia. King Roger II’s first wife was Elvira, daughter of the king of Caston in Spain, Alfonso VII and Isabella or Princess Zaida, who married King Alfonso after the death of her husband Mamon, the Prince of Cordoba Ben Mohammed El Moatamid, Prince of Seville. When Queen Elvira died at the age of 35, King Roger II was distraught and did not leave his house for a long time. However, the questions must also be about Charif al-Idrisi, especially his familial ties to “Ben Hamoud” who are Idirissi Cherifians who established  “Hamudia state” in Andalusia, Gibraltar, Ceuta, and Tangier for more than 40 years after the fall of the Idrissid state in Morocco.  After many conflicts with the kings of the sects, as well as what is known in Andalusia as the vast sedition, some of them returned to Ceuta and Tangier and others to the island of Sicily. Mohammed bin Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Idris bin Yahya bin Ali bin Mahmoud was born in Ceuta in 1099/1100 and studied in Cordoba. He moved to many countries, including Britain, Asia Minor, Constantinople, Greece and other countries of the Mediterranean and the Balkans. But his relationship to bin Mahmoud was as important as Mohammed Abu al-Qasim al-Hammudi, governor of an area on the island of Sicily and a senior state official in the kingdom of Roger II, presented Charif al-Idrisi to King Roger II before 1138 when he traveled back from the Orient and stopped in Sicily.  King Roger II addressed him saying, “You from the Caliphate, and when you were among the Muslims when their kings plotted to kill you, and when you were at my home safe,” as stated in the book “Al Wafi Bi al Wafaiat” by Khalil ibn Aibek Al Safadi. It is by now clear that there were common interests between the kingdoms and peoples and al-Idrisi’s invitation to Sicily was not purely scientific but political as well. King Roger II needed to establish political and societal stability through the presence of Charif al-Idrisi along with his statesmen, especially with the presence of Muslims who were numerous in Sicily for two and a half centuries. Charif al-Idrisi is from a family that lost power in Andalusia, which is also his wife’s family region. al-Idrisi knows the region’s geography and history. In addition, al-Idrisi, who studied in Cordoba,  toured the east and Asia Minor, making him the best man for king Roger II’s ambitions on the political, societal, and scientific levels. He was assigned to carry out a prominent scientific project, known as “The Book of Roger.” It was a world map attached with Nouzhat Al Mouchtak book. When King Roger II died in 1154, Charif al-Idrisi lost power inside the royal court. After the massacre of Muslims in Sicily in 1161, al-Idrisi fleed the island. Four years later, rumors said that al-Idrisi died either in Ceuta or Tunis. We do not assert that we are telling “the truth,” but we focus on threads that may help us re-create the biography of a traveler that many regards as the greatest geographer, the founder of geography as a science. It is a biography that many historians, orientalists, and researchers have narrated very differently.  After centuries, great efforts are still required to shed more light on Charif al-Idrisi’s scientific history of intellectual genius. Translated from Arabic into English by Hamza Guessous

Rabat – King Mohammed VI chaired the fifth religious lecture at the Royal Palace in the Casablanca royal palace on May 27. The lecture was  attended by religious leaders from a number of African and Middle Eastern countries.  Themed “Constants of the Islamic identity in Africa and the challenges related to its preservation,” the lecture, delivered by Omdurman University professor Safya Abderrahim Tayeb Mohammad, addressed the leading position of Islam in Africa as one of the main markers of identity on the continent. The lecture focussed on verse 13, Chapter 49 (Al Hujurat Surah), “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is knowing and acquainted.” The female Sudanese lecturer discussed how Morocco was the fountainhead of the Islamic faith throughout the African continent, with the Sunni school as the dominant doctrine. Noting the significant role of the Mohammed VI Foundation of African Ulema (scholars), she noted that Africa, which is facing a number of challenges including combating terrorism and illiteracy, could benefit from the teachings of Islam. She explained that African Scholars are facing a daunting task when called upon to tackle the issues tearing the African continent apart, which she again ascribed to the “weak religious framework.” The evening was attended by a number of leading religious figures from across Africa and the Middle East, including Senegal, Saudi Arabia, Mali, the Ivory Coast, as well as from Great Britain, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka.

Rabat – The Moroccan General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), led by Abdellatif Hammouchi, arrested two high-profile European criminals in the last six weeks, reinforcing its international reputation as an effective law enforcement agency. On March 18, DGSN arrested Antonio Prinno, a 44-year old Italian suspected of being a leading member of the Mazzarella club, affiliated with the Camorra. On the run since 2014, he was arrested in Ourika near Marrakech. He had been listed on Interpol for premeditated murder and owning firearms.  Two weeks later, on March 29, DGSN arrested the Spanish criminal Roberto Izquierdo Riegi aka “The Russian” in Tetouan. In 2018, Riegi was sentenced to 58 years in prison by the court in Cadiz, Spain, for kidnapping and murder. He escaped prison in November of last year, during a stay at a hospital in Madrid, and was on the run for 5 months.  According to the DGSN, Riego entered Morocco using a fake Spanish passport, before being found and arrested in Tetouan, reported Spanish newspaper El Pais. Abdellatif Hammouchi has received praise for his leadership of the DGSN and his contribution to cementing the Moroccan police force’s capacities. DGSN actively works in anti-terrorism, promoting Morocco’s national security. In early May, DGSN dismantled an eight-person terrorist cell linked to ISIL suspected of “propaganda” and “attempts to carry out terrorist attacks in the Kingdom.” DGSN also arrested six people in Sale, Rabat’s neighbour city, in connection with terrorism activities on April 23. Throughout March, DGSN  also made a number of other arrests linked to terrorism.  Jeune Afrique, one of Africa’s most widely read magazines, listed Hammouchi among “Africa’s most influential personalities in 2019” last month. The magazine lauded the “incomparable” success of Hammouchi’s four-year tenure as the head of DGSN, describing him as “the nightmare of terrorists.” Morocco’s expertise in this field has international value. Following the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka on 21 April, DGSN cooperated closely with India and Sri Lanka, to identify suspects. According to the Indian press agency IANS, DGSN shared key information within 48 hours, which contributed to a number of arrests. Acknowledging Morocco’s leadership in countering terrorism, IANS said that Morocco has “one of the most successful records of counter-terrorism and de-radicalization in the Islamic world.” DGSN also works to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking, as well as drug trafficking.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI  hosted an iftar (a breaking fast  ceremony) in honor of President Trump’s son-in law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, according to Moroccan News Channel Al Oula.  Tasked with solving the American Middle East Peace Plan, Jared Kushner arrived in Morocco on Tuesday along with with US officials Jason Greenblatt and Brian Hook.  The visit is part  of Kushner’s tour in preparation for Washington’s upcoming economic conference scheduled for June 25-26 in Manama, Bahrain. The conference aims to encourage investment in  Palestine. Trump’s administration seeks to garner support for the US efforts to broker peace between Israel and Palestine. Jared Kushner will also visit Jordan and Israel after his visit to Morocco. Last week, Palestinian authorities condemned the decision of the US-led economic symposium in Bahrain, emphasizing that it was not  consulted during the planning process of the conference. The Palestinian Authority also decided to boycott the conference, emphasizing that the plan aims to  force Palestinians to “sell” their country. Nabil Shaath, adviser to the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said last week: “We will inform Bahrain that we will not take part in such a conference.” He added, “We will not sell our country based on an economic project.” The Palestinian government also called on Arab states to  boycott the conference. Several Arab countries, especially in the Gulf have announced their support for the event, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE.

Rabat – Eid al-Fitr celebrations start at the beginning of the month of Shawwal on the Islamic Calendar, which is based on the moon and lunar cycles. As a result, the date of Eid al-Fitr and the start of Shawwal changes every year. According to the Islamic calendar, the start of the month is marked by the sighting of the first crescent of the full moon. Since the start of the month is marked by the moon, a new month begins in the evening. Conversely, on the western Gregorian calendar, the start of the month is determined by the earth’s position around the sun and months begin on a predetermined date. This discrepancy between the two calendars causes Islamic dates to shift by 10 or 11 days every year compared to Gregorian dates; therefore, the date of Eid al-Fitr changes each year and can be difficult to determine. What date will Eid al-Fitr most likely fall on in 2019? Although the celebration of Eid al-Fitr is dependent on sighting the crescent moon , many countries and organizations use astronomical charts and calendars to determine the date far in advance. In Saudi Arabia and several neighbouring states in the Arabian Peninsula, the Umm al-Qura Calendar, created at the Institute of Astronomical &amp; Geophysical Research of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) in Riyadh, is used. This calendar is also popular in parts of the world such as North America, but it has been heavily criticized by other Muslim communities which wait for the actual sighting of the crescent moon. Last week, Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani announced that the crescent moon would be spotted in all Arab and most Muslim countries on Ramadan 29, 1440, which falls on June 4 on the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the first day of Shawwal would fall on June 5. This claim corroborated the Umm al-Qura Calendar prediction, which also predicted that the crescent moon would be first sighted on Tuesday, June 4.  From Rabat to Mecca and Doha, all signs point to Eid al-Fitr falling on June 5 in most countries in the Middle East and North Africa. In the west, Eid al-Fitr is expected to fall on similar dates this year, with the crescent moon expected to be visible in the both the United Kingdom and United States on June 4.

Like Uber overseas, or its Moroccan counterpart Careem, Goki will pair private drivers with customers who need a ride. Goki’s special feature, however, is that its customers will be parents who need to bring their children to school, to dance class, to a birthday party, or to anywhere within the Rabat-Sale-Temara region. Parents will be able to order a “Goki” driver through the app, who will pick up their child from a specified place, and bring them to where they need to be. Parents will also be able to set up a Goki driver schedule a number of days in advance to fit in with their family schedule. The app will be launched in September and will operate in 30 suburbs in the Rabat-Sale-Temara region, covering more than 60 schools. “Gokidok is in the same price range as buses and taxis, but in comparison to these services, we offer greater flexibility and we save time for children and their families,” Achraf Zelmat, Gokidok’s founder, told online newspaper HuffPost Maroc. The monthly cost of the service will be MAD 1 290 ($132), for one return trip per day. High school students will be able to use the service alone, but primary school students will need to be accompanied.  Parents will also be able to rate a driver. If a family is satisfied with the service, Gokidok will try to pair the driver with the family more often, to promote a relationship of trust and stability for the child, Zelmat explained. Technology is changing the ride-sharing and public transport industry in Morocco. Careem, which operates like Uber overseas, offers private ride sharing services, competing with the local taxi industry.  Other apps, like Heetch, or a more recent competitor Roby, work within the taxi industry, connecting professional taxi drivers with clients. Gokidok is currently the only service designed specifically for children, and may therefore have a niche.

Rabat – Algerian army chief Gaid Salah has once again called on  protesters to engage in a dialogue with the interim president to end the major  crisis in Algeria in the wake of the resignation ofAbdelaziz Bouteflika. On Tuesday, the army chief called for “mutual concessions” between the interim government and demonstrators, who have been calling for a radical change since February 22. Gaid Salah stated that the priority for the unrest to be solved is to “move towards a productive  dialogue that will help our country,” according to APF. The army chief also warned against any delay in the election, scheduled by the interim government for July 4. The Defense Ministry said: “Establishing dialogue means the willingness of all to listen to each other… and a sincere desire for the need to find appropriate solutions without delay.” Salah also suggested  a “serious, rational, constructive and clear-sighted dialogue” and “mutual concessions” to overcome the crisis. Gaid Salah also referred to  the Algerian civil war of 1990, urging the protesters to learn from “previous experiences and past events.” “The Algerian people do not want to forget” the bloody civil war that tore apart Algeria “in the 1990s,” he said, calling for “lessons from previous experiences and past events” before repeating that he has “no political ambition”.   May 24 marked the 14th week of protests across Algeria.  Throughout the protests, demonstrators have carried banners and Algerian flags, opposing the July 4 election. This is not the first time when Gaid Salah called for a dialogue with protesters.  Amid the unrest, Algeria’s military chief Gaid Salah has warned protesters against election delay once before. “Holding a presidential election could help [Algeria] avoid falling into the trap of a constitutional void, with its accompanying dangers and unwelcome consequences,” Gaid Salah said last week. The Algerian government  also deployed hundreds of police officers to “surprise” the protesters.  The Algerian political party,  Socialist Forces Front (FFS), denounced the crackdown on protesters. “The FFS strongly dencounces the systematic repression and violence used this morning by those in power against protesters and those who want to rally [in] the capital to march peacefully.” The party demanded  that all individuals under arrest be released immediately.

Rabat- The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) is unhappy with the treatment inflicted on Moroccan clubs in the finals of two continental footballing showpieces. In a letter it addressed to the CAF president in the aftermath of the African Confederation final between Morocco’s RS Berkane and Egypt’s Zamalek, the FRMF decried the “scandalous” and “shameful” refereeing that cost the Moroccan team a final it should have won had the referee “respected the technical rules of the game.” The letter, which the FRMF shared on its Facebook page on May 27, adopted a solemn tone to protest the “deplorable” circumstances that saw Morocco’s Berkane lose to its Egyptian counterpart in the penalty shootout. According to FRMF, the game between the two sides was fraught with “bad interpretation and application of the rules.” In addition to controversially favoring the Egyptian side in the course of the game, the letter suggested, the referee “shamefully” ignored a rule that cost Berkane the penalty shootout. “In the penalty shootout that sealed the game, Zamalek’s goal keeper move from his line before the shot while the rule stipulates that he should stay on the line and face the penalty shooter until the ball is kicked,” FRMF explained. It added that while VAR’s intervention helped the referee spot the Zamalek keeper’s anticipated move, the referee failed to follow up on the decision by not yellow carding the keeper. Mahmoud Abderrahim Janach, Zamalek’s goalkeeper, had already been given yellow card during the game, and a second yellow would have resulted in a red car, synonymous with expulsion. FRMF is consequently reproaching the Ethiopian referee of the match to have “allowed a player who should have been expelled to continue to play and influence the outcome of the match.” FRMF’s letter comes amidst CAF-condoned conspiracy complaints among Moroccan fans. On Saturday, a day before the Berkane-Zamalek game, another Moroccan club, Wydad of Casablanca, took on Tunisia’s Esperance de Tunis in the first leg of the African champion’s league final. The game was fraught with controversial referee decisions in favor of the Tunisian side. In response, FRMF addressed CAF a letter in which it equally denounced the unfair treatment inflicted upon Wydad and requested that CAF “take necessary measures” to prevent a repeat in the second leg.

Rabat – The African Football Confederation executive body decided to suspend the Egyptian referee, Gehad Grisha,for six months.  The decision was made as a result of the several mistakes the Egyptian referee made during the  African Champions League final between Morocco’s Wydad of Casablanca(WAC) and Esperance de Tunis last Friday.  Moroccan sports channel Arryadia posted the news on its Facebook page on Tuesday. The suspension decision follows WAC’s complaint letter to the CAF president, Ahmad Ahmad, in which the Moroccan club denounced the unjust refereeing mistakes made by the referee as well as his  clear bias in favor of the Tunisian club. WAC said in the letter that the referee’s decision changed the course of the game by depriving them of a valid goal and a clear penalty. The first leg of the final with the Tunisian team ended in a draw, 1-1. The second leg of the final will take place on May 31.

Rabat – For Morocco’s 35 million citizens, healthcare can be broken down to two options. The first option is private healthcare and its bankrupting expenses; and the second, governmental public healthcare and its poor standard of care. The Moroccan Constitution promises citizens the right to healthcare; however, when over 40 percent of the country’s population lives in rural areas, this access is often difficult, sometimes impossible, to put into practice. Corruption within public hospitals and medical facilities is commonplace, with the right to health and life being put up for sale at a price set by doctors or nurses willing to accept bribes. When care can be accessed, patients often struggle to afford the expenses associated with it, driving families into poverty and dissuading the injured and sick from seeking medical help. However, speaking during a parliamentary hearing session on Tuesday, Moroccan Head of Government vowed to improve the health sector, primarily through reform of the system’s governance. During his speech, Othmani emphasized his government’s existing focus on the health sector, pointing out that the administration had already raised the public health sector’s budget to $1.6 billion, up 16 percent from 2016. Othmani also argued that expanding health care coverage was the most important approach to reforming the health sector, saying that health coverage had already been increased to 60 percent from less than 47 percent in 2017. To remedy other existing issues within the health sector, Othmani announced that the government had developed a plan to drastically reform healthcare in 2025. The plan will follow a roadmap centered on improving the health sector in six stages: quality of services, equal access to these services, solidarity and interdependence, continuity and proximity, performance and efficiency, then responsibility and accountability. Recently, unrest within the public health sector has also seen a new wave of growth, with nurses and doctors staging strikes and demonstrations in response to unfair working conditions and poor industry standards. These strikes have had a profound influence on the workings of an already dysfunctional public health sector, especially due to Morocco’s pressing shortage of doctors and medical staff. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that a country have 13 doctors per 18,000 people. Meanwhile, in Morocco, there are only 3.5 doctors in both the public and private sectors per 18,000. This crisis has only deepened following the resignation of over 400 doctors last month after the government failed to meet protestors’ demands for improved working conditions and adequate medical equipment in public hospitals. Following the wave of resignations, the Independent Syndicate of Public Sector Doctors (SIMSP) threatened that more resignations would follow unless “the government does not respond to our demands, namely improving the working conditions in hospitals and providing the necessary equipment and an adequate number of personnel.” Health professionals have announced another strike to take place from June 10-14, which threatens to severely disrupt the functioning of public medical facilities unless the Moroccan government complies with demonstrator’s requests.

Rabat – The government is facing obstacles regulating standards for cigarettes, which specify that there should be only 10 mg of tar, 1 mg of nicotine, and 10 mg of carbon monoxide in each single. In all, 96% of cigarettes sold are “out of the ordinary.” However, 71% of Moroccan cigarettes actually contain 14 mg of tar. The cigarettes mainly come from two operators: the Marquise brand from the Moroccan Tobacco Company and Winston from Japan Tobacco International, according to L’Economiste. The company behind Chesterfield isn’t a major brand on the market as it has less than 2% market share. If the government were to ensure that the tar content was at 10 mg, tobacco sales could decline and along with it the tax revenue. The reason is that smokers are less likely to buy cigarettes with a lower amount of tar. International importers are not willing to align with the standards due to the pressures of competition, despite Japan Tobacco international boasting that it is a leading company in “Reduced-Risk Products brands.” The Moroccan Tobacco Company, on the other hand, is taking a “reasonable time to adjust its production tool, review its processes, invest in R &amp; D.” Other companies are also giving excuses as to why they have not met the cigarette standards, arguing that they buy tobacco well in advance to make the products for trade. However, the standards were set seven years ago, in 2012. Because the standard should apply to locally manufactured tobacco as well as imported, and enforcing it appears to be a challenge, there are some who push to annul the cigarette standards altogether.

Rabat – Laylat Al Qadr is also known as the night of decree, “a night better than a thousands months” as described in verse 37:3 of the Qur’anic Surah, Al-Qadr.   The night of decree is when the Prophet Mohammed explored the first ayah or verse of the Quran, Al-Alaq, which was revealed by the Angel Gabriel. The verse was revealed when Prophet Mohammed spent a month in solitude to pray and fast at the Cave of Hira in Mecca. In Morocco, and across the world, an atmospheric sensation stimulates the soul on a nightthat serves as an opportunity for Muslims to seek forgiveness and success from God. The night of decree in Morocco is an important holy celebration. Men and women, as well as children, wear white and colorful jellabas, they go out to mosques across the country to pray extra prayers or taraweeh. One of the best views the night of Laylat Al Qadr is the Hassan II mosque surrounded by worshippers as they perform  taraweeh after night prayer, while best verses of the quran and takbeer “ the Arabic phrase Allahu Akbar” are raised. Any prayers and virtuous deeds performed with good will and pure intentions  are worth more than a thousand months or a lifetime of worship, a reason that encourages Muslims across the globe to take this opportunity to purify their souls and ask for forgiveness. Saturday, June 1 will mark Laylat Al Qadr in Morocco.  The exact date of the night was not mentioned in the Quran, but Muslims traditionally celebrate  it on the 27th night of Ramadan. As the exact day of the night of decree is not marked, many Muslims devote their time during the ten last days of Ramadan to prayers and to reciting Quran to avoid missing the holy night. “Seek out Laylat al-Qadr in the odd nights during the last ten nights of Ramadan,” according to Al Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Children celebrate in a different way Moroccan children have a unique way to celebrate the night of decree, aside from its spirituality and significance in Islam. Children who have not reached puberty try to fast for the very first time as their parents promise them presents of food and sweets as a treat. After  the taraweeh prayers, parents dress their children up with traditional clothes, including caftans and jelabas. Girls also go to the nearest negafa (stylist), who will dress them up like arouss or a bride.  The negafa also does henna decorations on girls hands which they show off in an ammaria, a special sedan chair for Moroccan brides. Boys typically wear jellabas and balgha (Moroccan traditional shoes) and crown their heads with a fez , they  ride horses with their fathers or by themselves to pose for a souvenir photos. Parents also take their children to  photo booths to commemorate the special night.

Rabat – Since June of 2017, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have had increasingly hostile relations following a blockade on the Qatari peninsula by numerous Arab nations. Alleging that Qatar had been promoting terrorist organizations, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and the UAE cut off ties with Doha, and relations in the region have remained unstable since. However, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has made efforts to mend relations by inviting Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to an emergency Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit to be held on May 30. The summit, to be held in Mecca, was planned in response to recent “aggressions and their consequences” in the region, specifically several attacks by Houthi militants on Saudi oil tankers and drilling sites. Accepting the invitation, Al Thani landed in Jeddah last night, marking the first Qatari plane to land in Saudi Arabia since tensions between the two countries flared up two years ago. The region recently experienced a wave of hostility following Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia, whose government blames Iran for supporting and funding terrorist organizations on the Arabian peninsula.  Although Tehran has denied these claims, Saudi Arabia continues to blame the Iranian government for funding Houthi insurgents, as attacks and attempted attacks in Saudi Arabia become more frequent. Tensions also flared following a decision by Washington to send military assets to the Persian Gulf in response to alleged Iranian aggression and plans to attack the United States; however, these allegations have not been confirmed. Though Saudi Arabia and Qatar have begun to mend relations after years of hostility, bringing a greater chance for peace in the region, the nations of the Arabian Peninsula must still try to resolve their differences with their neighbours across the Persian Gulf if there is to be any chance for a permanent and lasting peace in the Middle East.

Rabat – For more than 14 weeks, Algeria has been in a state of disarray as protests and riots have swept across the country, ultimately forcing the country’s former leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down after nearly two decades of rule. Throughout the ongoing conflict, Algerian authorities had consistently promised a return of order following scheduled elections on July 4; however, the likelihood of these elections was cast into doubt earlier this month when an anonymous source suggested that holding an election would not be possible until later this year. Despite these claims, Algeria’s Constitutional Council announced on Sunday, May 27, that two candidates had registered for the July 4 election, dispelling with the anonymous source’s earlier claims. Although no major party from Algeria has put forth a candidate, two candidates unknown to the Algerian public, Abdelhakim Hamadi and Hamid Touahri, have been declared as the country’s two contenders for the July election. The Algerian Army is currently overseeing a 90-day transition period before a new government is elected, and the military has continually pressured protestors to end demonstrations before the election in July. Protestors have demanded the removal of all Bouteflika-era bureaucrats and have voiced a desire for a complete overhaul of the Algerian government. However, even after the announcement of two non-establishment candidates, demonstrators remain dissatisfied and protests continue throughout Algeria. Calming the protests Tensions remain high in post-Bouteflika Algeria, with protests continuing to sweep across the country well after demonstrations had successfully ousted Bouteflika from power.  With demonstrations showing massive success thus far, protestors have set their sights on the outright removal of all government officials associated with the corruption and nepotism of Algeria’s old guard, including the incumbent interim president, Abdelkader Bensalah, and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui.  As a result, protestors have remained heavily opposed to the prospect of a July 4 election, fearing that the election will be tarnished by the corruption of the old Bouteflika regime. Meanwhile, several local mayors and magistrates have already spoken out against the election, claiming that they would not be participating in the election or organizing polls in their jurisdictions. Throughout this popular opposition to the election, the Algerian Constitutional Council and Algerian Army have maintained their position that an election is a necessary prerequisite to establishing stability in the country, and have urged protestors to end demonstrations as the impending elections grow closer.

Rabat – Now extinct, the trilobite is an ocean creature, related to the spider. “The trilobite was one of Planet Earth’s great survivors, first appearing in the fossil record 520 million years ago before finally falling prey to the Permian extinction after nearly 300 million successful years,” News Atlas says. This 11-inch specimen found in Morocco dates from 509-497 million years ago, measuring 15 x 24 x 2 ½ inches (38 x 61 x 6.5cm). In their time, trilobites were so common and diverse that they are now often used by geologists and paleontologists to date the rock formations in which they are found. Exactly why the trilobites became extinct is not clear, though a combination of causes is likely. The remnants of trilobites can range from the preserved body to pieces of the exoskeleton, which is shed in the process known as ecdysis. They are believed to have never developed facial sutures, having pre-dated their evolution.

Rabat – Mounir Satouri will be one of four new Green party representatives in France, part of a larger Green wave elected into the 2019 European Parliament. Born in Morocco, Satouri left the country when he was 16 and settled in the French region Ile-de-France. He will represent the 78th department, Yvelines, in the European Parliament for the next five years. Satouri joined France’s green party (EELV) in 2001 and has remained active since then as a regional representative. Satouri hoped to be elected to the European parliament, but cared more about the success of his party in elections overall, he told French news outlet, Le Parisien. EELV made larger gains than polls predicted, ultimately coming in as the third largest party with 13.5 percent of votes. France’s far-right group, the National Rally (RN) has the majority by less than a point over President Emmanuel Macron’s party La Republique en Marche (LREM), according to preliminary results. The surprising growth of the Green party was a recurring trend across EU members and is now the fourth largest voting bloc in parliament overall.  Satouri said one of his goals is to renegotiate the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to help farmers move towards cleaner agriculture. The high voter turnout and recent citizen protests confirms the importance of environmental issues for citizens, Satouri said to Le Parisien.

Rabat – A group of angry Algerian protesters blocked the way of the country’s Energy Minister on May 27. The demonstrators barred Minister Mohamed Arkab and his delegation from making an official visit to Tindouf, an eastern Algerian province, home to the Polisario-run refugee camps at the border with Mauritania and Morocco. Chanting anti-government slogans, Algiers residents in the vicinity of the airport staged a sit-in in solidarity with the anti-establishment protests, Huffpost Algeria reported. The improvised sit-in came after other ministers of the interim government were denied access to a number of public spaces, the newspaper added, explaining that such actions are an extension of the generalized and lasting anti-government fervor that hit the country in late February. What started off on February 22 as an eruption of popular anger mainly aimed at venting years of frustration and disappointment at former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika for obsessively wanting to rule the country, even as his advanced age and failing health prevented him from doing so, has morphed into a nation-wide movement to drive out all the remnants of the Bouteflika presidency. As far as Algerian protesters are concerned, there will be no impetus for effective change until the entire Bouteflika establishment, which includes most of the current interim government, is forced to surrender to a generational power shift. Algerians are asking for a whole new generation of politicians more concerned with the daily lot of Algerians and more equipped to deal with the changes that have taken place in the country, according to Algerian media. Algeria is an established supporter of the Polisario Front, the separatist group claiming independence in Western Sahara and currently operating in Tindouf, its de facto capital city, with the blessings of the Algerian regime. Most recently, the Algerian government put its plane at the disposal of the Polisario leader, Brahim Ghali, to travel to South Africa, another diehard Polisario backer. Ghali was due to partake in the swearing-in ceremony of South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa. While barring an Algerian minister from travelling to Tindouf has no connections with Algiers’s Western Sahara stance, recent reports have indicated that the country’s ongoing cycle of domestic instability has considerably crippled its pro-Polisario lobbying and Public relations efforts in the international community. According to a source who spoke to Morocco World News ahead of the latest UN resolution on Western Sahara, the fact that the resolution was more Morocco-friendly than any other resolution was largely because Algiers, which was more concerned with meeting its domestic rising challenges, did not invest as fiercely as it used to in its pro-Polisario activism.

Rabat – Asmaa Beauty, a YouTuber with more than a million subscribers, has started an online debate with her tutorials on how to be a “good wife.”  The videos, many of which have almost a million views, give advice on how to take care of your husband’s feet, get along with his family members, and generally serve him.  The video regarding her husband’s footcare caused a stir in particular, and a debate on social media ensued. One Facebook user commented “I hope she will also publish how her husband massages her feet when she is tired. We have to fight against gender stereotypes and cliches.” Another user commented that while “she is free to make the videos she wants, in the extremely macho society of a developing country where we rarely see or hear husbands helping the women at home to see the same degree, this is old fashioned and not interesting.” Others also argued that while it was fine to do as she pleases behind closed doors, it should remain private and publishing it on YouTube may send the wrong message.  “It is not the act of taking care of her husband’s feet that poses a problem in itself, we can take care of the husband as we wish, but to expose it in such a way is too far,” a user commented. Although many of the videos have received negative comments, the beauty YouTuber does have a dedicated following. Many of her fans weighed in on the debate, coming to her defense. “Watch the video and you will see that she finds it a pleasure in taking care of her husband. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as nobody forces her and it is mutual. Some of you could learn something from this young wife.” Just this weekend, 5000 people flocked to the Asmaa Beauty Center in Kenitra to meet the influencer in person.

Rabat – The International Islamic Academy of Uzbekistan, according to its own description, “is specialized to educate religious and secular knowledge as an educational and scientific structural subdivision under the supervision of the Committee on Religious Affairs on the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Board of Muslims of Uzbekistan.” Muminjonova explained the reality of the law making all schools a religiously neutral zone, even one offering a masters in Studies of the Quran, saying; “There is a sign at the entrance, it says that women may only wear dark skirts and white jackets. Skirts have to be worn below the knee. I was told to wear this uniform and take off the hijab.  But I could not go along with that because those rules contradict my religious beliefs,” Muminjonova added that, before the university expelled her and nine other students last September, it had presented an ultimatum: “[They said] ‘either you take off a headscarf, or you will be expelled.’ ”She said that being asked to take off the hijab was “like being forced to give up on my faith.” When Muminjonova refused to abide by the hijab ban, she was not allowed to attend classes or stay in the dorms.  “Muminjanova was officially expelled for her extended absence from classes, and others were compelled to write their own requests to the Islamic Academy to leave, allegedly for lacking finances and other reasons,” Yelena Urlayeva, a local independent human rights defender who chairs the Human Rights Alliance, said. Muminjonova’s family attempted to sue the International Islamic Academy of Uzbekistan. After no success in either district and city courts, Muminjonova’s family took the case to the Supreme Court. A defiant Muminjonova said that if the court ruled against her, she would take her case to international courts. The court finally ruled in favor of the academy, arguing that no laws were violated in imposing the dress code. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom said that “severe violations of religious freedom persisted” and advised that the State Department put Uzbekistan back on the watchlist along with North Korea and Saudi Arabia. Both Saudi Arabia and North Korea are accused of “infring[ing] upon individuals’ ability to adapt, change, or renounce their religion or belief, worship in accordance with their religion or beliefs, or be free from coercion to practice a particular religion or belief.” The University was founded as a state-run institution by the president at the time, Islam Karimov, in April 1999. President Karimov saw radical Islam as a reason to keep tight control over religion in Uzbekistan, fearing it would be influenced by the extremists in neighboring Afghanistan.  Since President Karimov’s death, anti-religious policies are still being created and enforced. For example, Under Uzbek law, the appearance of citizens in public places in religious attire may trigger a fine or administrative arrest for up to 15 days. Only [the clergy] can wear religious clothes. As well, selling a hijab in the market is punished by a fine of five to 10 times the monthly minimum wage to 15 days in jail. Political Rights publication Forum 18 News says, “Only state-recognized religious communities with centralized religious bodies (such as the Spiritual Administration of Muslims, Russian Orthodox diocese or Baptist Union) are allowed to run their own educational establishments. Those who conduct religious education outside these officially-approved organizations face fines or jail sentences.”

Rabat – Two prisoners from the Rif mass protests, known as Hirak Rif, were released from the Hoceima prison on Monday, May 27, on completion of their sentences. The two men were arrested in 2016-2017 when people from the Rif region took to the streets to protest marginalization, underdevelopment, and corruption. Authorities arrested the two Hirak protesters after the Casablanca Criminal Chamber sentenced them to two years imprisonment, which the court of appeals upheld. Nine Rif protesters are expecting their imminent release on completion of their sentences. 20 Protesters in total were given 2 year prison terms. Last year, 11 of the Hirak protesters, who were still on trial at the court of Appeals, were released on the occasion of the Muslim sacrifice feast Eid Al Adha. King Mohammed VI granted amnesty to 184 prisoners, who were linked to Rif popular movement, according to the Human Rights Minister Mustapha Ramid.  Moroccan sources, quoting the Ministry of Justice, claim that the amnesty included 889 imprisoned, which state-owned news agency Maghreb Arab Press confirmed, making no mention of Hirak prisoners. Mohamed Aghnaj, lawyer of the protesters, confirmed that 11 protesters were set free. He added that the amnesty included Hirak protesters who were serving less than three years. The death of a fishmonger named Mohcine Fikri sparked off the mass protests in 2016. Attempting to retrieve his confiscated ware, Fikri was crushed to death in a garbage truck allegedly on the orders of a police officer.

Rabat – The annual Multi-faith Iftar is organised by the NGO “Marocains Pluriels” (Diverse Moroccans) and took place on Sunday at the Saint Jacques Parish in Mohammedia, north of Casablanca. The event brought together religious representatives from each faith, including the Archbishop of Rabat, the Imam Omar El Mrini, the Chief Rabbi of Casablanca, as well as the King’s advisor Andre Azoulay, and embassy representatives from Norway, Burkina Faso, France, Italy, Canada, Denmark, and the Vatican, among others. Over 200 people attended the event, sharing a traditional Moroccan iftar meal and breaking the Ramadan fast together as a symbol of religious and cultural tolerance. Andre Azoulay, the King’s advisor, emphasized that Morocco was built by a number of civilizations, in particular “the great Berber civilization, the great Jewish civilization, the great arabo-muslim civilization, Africa, Andalusia, Europe.” He added the event was about not about politics.  “We are not here by obligation. [The event] is not conceived, organized and attended for reasons of political necessity. We are here for reasons of the heart, because we want to be, and because we find in this great pleasure and joy,” reported Moroccan news channel 2M. The Juniors, the youth branch of Diverse Moroccans, opened the evening by reading a text calling on the values of unity.  “Whereas elsewhere, men and women are stigmatized for being Jewish, Muslim, or Christians…in Morocco, Muslims, Jews, and Christians raise the flag of harmony.” Inter-religious dialogue Inter-religious dialogue has been an important theme of 2019 in Morocco. Pope Francis made a two day visit to the country in March, holding a mass for 10 000 people at Prince Moulay Abdallah sports complex in Rabat. It was the first papal visit to Morocco since 1985. In his official welcoming speech, the King described the Pope’s visit as “ deeply symbolic, with historical and civilizational consequences.” Speaking about the importance of combating terrorism, he added that “co-understanding negates all forms of radicalism.” “I protect Moroccan Jews and the Christians from other countries who live in Morocco,” the King emphasized. The foreword of the Moroccan Constitution of 2011 expressly promotes the values of “openness, moderation, tolerance and dialogue for the mutual understanding between all cultures and civilizations in the world.” The constitution defines “Islam as the state religion, which guarantees free exercise of all religions.” However, while the practice of other religions is tolerated, the conversion of Muslims to another religion is banned. Some Moroccan converts to Christianity are therefore forced to worship in secret. Proselytizing is also illegal and punishable by up to three years prison.

Rabat – Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani announced on Monday that his cabinet created over 138,791 jobs in the public sector under the finance bills of 2017,2018, and 2019. El Othmani’s statement at the House of Representatives comes amid a set of national protests, condemning the lack of job opportunities and the unemployment rate in Morocco. The government leader said that the number of jobs created in the public sector had increased compared to the 2012-2016 period, when only 71,442 jobs were created. El Othmani added that his government has put in place a series of measures to reduce the unemployment rate. The measures include the support of employment programs and intensifying the government’s efforts in the field of public employment. “The employment programs have contributed to the achievement of important results in reducing  the unemployment rate, by monitoring 201,241 jobseekers through the integration program.” El Othmani added that the employment programs contributed to the achievement by reaching 102,581 self-employed entrepreneurs at the end of April 2019, compared to 32, 400 in 2015. The politician also explained that the government’s measures aim to create jobs and support youth employment, emphasizing that they made a significant contribution to reducing the unemployment rate. Pressure of unemployment Faced by the pressure of unemployment and social protests, the government has pledged several upgrades to programs in hopes of ensuring better education and to guarantee job opportunities for students after graduation. King Mohammed VI has made the unemployment rate a priority in most of his recent speeches and meetings with the government. On February 28, King Mohammed VI chaired a working meeting with the government to discuss programs to upgrade vocational training and improve operations and teaching methods. The King has been calling for the government to upgrade programs for vocational training, which he believes could increase employment. The unemployment rate remains high among youth aged 15-24, at 27.5 percent, according to the statistics issued by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) earlier this year. Morocco’s overall unemployment rate fell slightly from 10.2 percent to 9.8 percent from 2017 to 2018.

Rabat – As the Middle East prepares for the American-organized peace conference in Bahrain next month, there remains significant skepticism and opposition towards the United States’s plans for brokering peace between Israel and Palestine. Meanwhile, American President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House aide Jared Kushner has decided to tour the Middle East prior to the conference. The tour is an attempt to sway popular opinion and win support for the American-led Middle East Peace Plan. Accompanying Kushner are Trump’s special envoy for international negotiations Jason Greenblatt, and Trump’s special Iran envoy Brian Hook. Kushner first plans to visit Morocco before traveling to Jordan and Israel later this week Hoping to win over the populations of countries involved with the Peace Deal, which has become the subject of severe criticism from the Middle East.
 The Associated Press reported that Kushner already arrived in Morocco; whereas the AFP has reported that Kushner has left the US and will be arriving soon. The planned conference in Bahrain stirred up controversy earlier this month when it was discovered that the Palestinian Authority had not been consulted during the planning process of the conference. The planned conference is supposedly focused around developing Palestine and resolving the country’s conflict with Israel. As a result, the Palestinian Authority has already refused to attend the conference, citing additional concerns that the plan would force Palestinians to “sell [their] country.” “We will inform Bahrain that we will not take part in such a conference,” said Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian State President Mahmoud Abbas. “We will not sell our country based on an economic project.” The Palestinian Authority has also urged other Arab nations to boycott the conference, though Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have already declared their support for, and participation in the conference.

Rabat – A 55-year-old Iraqi clinic manager is on trial for sexually harassing one of his employees, an unnamed 23-year-old Moroccan nurse, in December last year. The 23-year-old was visiting her boss’ office to pick up her unpaid salary when the incident took place, according to Dubai’s Court of First Instance. “When I raised the matter with him, he suddenly got nervous. He came close to me from behind his desk,” the woman said during the public prosecution investigation. The man then allegedly started groping her and openly asked her to have sex with him, and the woman says she panicked and attempted to push him away.  “He then slapped me on my face. I filed a complaint against him and later saw a doctor for a check-up,” the complainant said. A medical report shows that the complainant sustained an injured nose and scratches on her neck following the incident.  The clinic manager denied the charge in court, and the complainant dropped the charges against him. The court, however, has decided to proceed with the trial. The man has faced similar allegations in the past, having been accused of sexually harassing an employee before, according to Dubai news outlet the Khaleej Times.  The trial will continue on June 9.

Rabat – Spanish Ministers are requesting that the European Commission in the European Union introduce a carbon tax on power imports in order to meet the EU’s environmental goals as concerns about climate change increase. Last week, Spain’s Energy Minister Teresa Ribera and Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero sent a letter to EU Climate chief Miguel Arias Canete and Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of taxation and customs.  “If Europe ends up importing goods produced under lower climate standards, the emissions we avoid will be counterbalanced, or even overcome, by those generated in countries where goods are manufactured,” read the letter. Though the ministers did not mention any specific country, the Spanish news outlet El Pais claims the proposal is intended to limit power imports from Morocco. Spain, one of Morocco’s foremost commercial partners in the EU, has regularly imported  Moroccan renewable power. In 2018, Spain became a net importer of Moroccan energy produced by thermal plants. The EU aims to achieve a 40% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.

Rabat – According to Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani, Eid Al Fitr, or the “Feast of Breaking the Fast” will be celebrated in Morocco on June 5, marking the end of Ramadan. On this day, all Muslims are required to pay the Zakat Al Fitr, a special charitable donation given at this specific time of the year to those less fortunate.  For the donation to be considered as Zakat Al Fitr, rather than regular charity, the amount must be paid up to 48 hours before the Eid Al Fitr prayer.  “Whoever pays it before the prayer, it is accepted Zakat, and whoever pays it after the prayer, it is ordinary charity,” states a Haddith of Islam, narrated by Abu Dawood. The High Council of Ulemas has confirmed the minimum Zakat amount to be paid this year in Morocco is MAD 13 ($1.34).  “It is an obligation to pay the Zakat in line with the Sharia law,” said the High Council of Ulemas in a press release yesterday. Traditionally, Zakat was paid in foodstuffs (like grains or flour). Each Muslim had to donate one “Saa” (450g). A Moroccan fatwa from 2010 (1431 in the Hijri calendar) confirmed that Zakat in Morocco can be paid as a monetary amount. The High Council of Ulemas sets the Zakat amount based on the price of wheat, and the amount can vary every year. The 2018 Zakat amount was also MAD 13 ($1.34). In 2017, the Zakat was MAD 15 per person ($1.55). Zakat can be paid to Islamic organizations, imams in mosques or directly to an individual in need.  While the minimum amount to pay this year is MAD 13, any higher Zakat donation can be made.  Traditionally, the head of the family would pay the Zakat for all family members, including children.

Rabat – Members of the Moroccan Royal Navy in the Mediterranean rescued 249 irregular migrants on board of several makeshift boats on May 25-26. The rescued undocumented migrants included women and children, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported. Authorities brought back the migrants to safety to the ports of Ksar-Sghir, Al Hoceima, and Nador. The Royal Moroccan Navy carried numerous similar operations throughout the year. One of the latest operations was on May 19, when the navy rescued 169 irregular migrants on board of several makeshift boats. A military source said that the coastguard managed to bring the irregular migrants back to Morocco’s Mediterranean ports. Morocco has been facing pressure due to the significant numbers of undocumented migrants entering the country. In response,  Morocco has strengthened collaboration with Spain to curb the flow of immigration. Spain repeatedly supported Morocco by calling on the European Union to assist the North African country’ efforts on migration. In May, the Spanish Minister of Defense, Margarita Robles, said that her country has “full confidence in the collaboration with Morocco.” Spanish news outlet ABC quoted the Spanish Ministry of the Interior, saying that the number of irregular migrants in Spain dropped by 52% from April 2018 to April 2019. ABC emphasized that the significant decrease owing to Morocco’s efforts. Morocco’s government announced that the Moroccan security services thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, compared to 88,761 of foiled attempts in 2018.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI has launched a national program to support micro-projects and self-employment in favor of former prisoners. The program was initiated by the Mohammed VI Foundation for the reintegration of prisoners for an overall cost of more than 13.5 million, compared to MAD 8.1 million in 2018. The project seeks to provide “financial or equipment support to former prisoners with a personal life project in sectors like trade, industry, services, crafts, catering, agriculture, or construction,” reported Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The program will benefit 478 former prisoners from the regions of Casablanca-Settat, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, Marrakech Safi, the eastern region, Fes Meknes, Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, Laayoune Sakia El Hamra, Guelmim-Oued Noun, Souss-Massa, and the Draa Tafilalet regions. The beneficiaries of the program also include  18 people who have been convicted of extremism and terrorism. While serving their prison terms,  they participated in the reconciliation program or Moussalaha, a project that seeks to ease the reintegration of detainees into society. The Moroccan government trusts the reconciliation program. The royal cabinet offers royal pardon to free terrorism-convicted defendants who have successfully completed the requirements of the Reconciliation program. The program involves human rights and radicalism experts who provide psychological support and rehabilitation to convicts. It was launched in 2016.  The initiative depends on three fundamental points: reconciliation with the self, with principal religious texts, and with society. MAP reported that the inclusion of the inmates convicted for terrorism in the national program “has a strong social impact, testifying to the particular interest that  the King gives to the future of incarcerated citizens.”  The program, according to the newspaper, is a perfect illustration of the King’s “firm determination to ensure convicts, without any discrimination or exception, an adequate socio-professional integration after their release.” The initiative is also in line with the monarch’s vision to strengthen security in society, combat crime, reduce recidivism, and create income-generating activities (IGAs) to improve the future and quality of life of people who have been in conflict with the law.

Rabat – Head of the General Presidency for the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques Sheikh Abdulrahman Al-Sudais has called on local and international visitors to avoid crowding the Grand Mosque in Mecca during the last ten nights of Ramadan, the most blessed days of the holy month.  During the last teen days of Ramadan, Muslims from all over the world converge to Mecca and Medina, site of the two holy mosques to perform Umrah.  Praising Saudi Arabia’s royal family, Al Sudais said that Muslims in the area should cooperate to secure the success of the three summits convened by King Saudi Arabia this month. The summits, scheduled from May 30 to  June 1, are convened by the Saudi King who called for urgent Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and Gulf Cooperation Summits. Saudi Arabia stated that the urgent meetings will take place to discuss “aggressions and their consequences” in the region.

Rabat – A confrontation between the far-right anti-immigration neo-nazi group Pigeda and a group of Muslims took place on Sunday, May 26, in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven.  The anti-islam groups staged a demonstration near the mosque of al Furqan, where the group allegedly planned to insult Islam.  The groups had allegedly carried out anti-muslim campaign which included roasting pigs at mosques during the holy month of Ramadan before local police intervened and arrested a dozen counter-protestors. Around 400 Muslim residents took to the streets to denounce the act of sacrilege, calling for peace and coexistence. The incident turned bitter as four police officers were injured after both groups began stone throwing at each other. Edwin Wagensveld, the leader of Pegida, told local radio station Omroep Brabant that the group had not planned to roast pigs at mosques but merely to deliver criticism. However, the right wing group has previously been condemned for a pig-roasting campaign in 2018.  The head of the racist group has pleged to organize a second demonstration.  Standing for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, Pegida’s members inspire neo-Nazi sentiments and often use the symbol of the swastika at demonstrations. The group has several branches across a number of European countries.

Rabat – Morocco is taking part in China’s International Big Data Industry Expo 2019, which kicked off on Sunday, May 26, and will run through Wednesday, May 29, in the capital of Guizhou province, Guiyang, Southwestern China. Running for the fifth year since 2015, the international event is the first national-level Expo on big data worldwide. The 2019 Expo is themed “Data creates value, innovation drives the future.” Morocco will be represented by Abdelhamid Souiri, Deputy Speaker of the House of Councilors, and Mohamed Idrissi Meliani, the Director General of the Digital Development Agency (ADD). Talking about Morocco’s participation in a speech at the opening ceremony, Souiri praised King Mohammed VI’s last official visit to China in 2016, noting that it strengthened the Chinese-Moroccan collaboration and strategic partnership. He added that the visit opened up prospects for stronger political relations between Rabat and Beijing and bilateral cooperation, which will help create potential job opportunities in the future.  The annual exhibition is seeing a large turnout and participants, which has grown over the past 5 years. This year’s event boasts 159 exhibitors compared to 59 last year.  Souiri recalled the memorandum of understanding  Morocco and China signed in November 2017, regarding China’s Silk Road initiative, which he said “marked a turning point” for both countries.

Rabat – The public sector Nurses and health professionals movement in Morocco has announced a 5-day national strike from June 10-14.  Strikers will protest the government’s lack of action following a dialogue with the group, which rejected offers made during the negotiations.  Health employees will conduct sit-ins in front of Morocco’s regional directorates of health, on June 12, as well as a march starting from the Health Ministry headquarters towards parliament, on June 13. The national strike will affect the normal functioning of public hospitals as many hospital facilities will be shut down. Recovery and emergency units will remain open during the strikes. The public sector nurses expressed their disappointment with results of dialogues with the Ministry of Health which they considered as ‘poor in comparison with workforce expectations.’ The movement accused the government of procrastination, saying that the Ministry is belittling the demands made by the public sector health professionals and attempting to exclude them from negotiation and dialogue.  Nurses are demanding fairness in compensation of professional risks, an end to unfair administrative and judicial proceedings, and a reduction from 6 to 4 years in the wait time to pass promotion exams, as well as an increase in quota to 50% from 33%. The public sector healthcare professionals are also demanding the integration of all unemployed nurses and health professionals by creating sufficient financial positions to accommodate a large number of graduates in all specialties to fill the sector’s needs and reject all forms of contracting.

In partnership with the Moroccan Ministry of Education, UNICEF has launched the fourth phase of its “Child to Child” program, which aims to promote school enrollment and assist children who have dropped-out of schools across Morocco. “Child to Child” is an educational program designed to promote the enrollment of Moroccan children in the education system and to prevent dropouts. The program, running to 2030, identifies children who do not attend school and works to reintegrate them into the education system.  “The program aims to identify students who are not in school, and prepare them for re-inscription,” said UNICEF representative Giovanna Barberis. It includes a “Second Chance” program for children who have already dropped out, supporting them through an educational follow up program, explains the UNICEF press release. It also aims to sensitize schools, students and families to issues associated with school drop-out, such as exclusion and marginalization. “The children, teenagers and young people that leave school fall back into illiteracy. They have no certificates to access professional training and they don’t have the competencies required to participate in society,” Berberis noted.  While most children attend primary school in Morocco, attendance rates drop significantly for high school education. According to a November 2018 UNICEF report, 99.1% of children aged 6 to 11 attended primary school in 2016/2017. However, overall only 66% of children aged 15 to 17 attended high school. Numbers drop significantly in rural areas, and for girls. Only 69.4% of girls aged 12 to 14 and 32.2% of girls aged 15 to 17 in rural areas attended high school.  “The right to education is fundamental. It is the key to accessing all other rights and breaking the cycle of inter-generational poverty,” said Barberis.  The “Child to Child” program is funded in part by the Canadian government. Phase 4 was launched in a small community school in Mejlaou, one hour south of Tangier, at a meeting attended by government representatives of the National Initiative for Human Development, UNICEF, local education associations and a number of children who have already benefited from the program.

Rabat – Algeria has reacted to the resignation of Horst Kohler, the UN envoy for Western Sahara. Algiers says that it “deeply regrets” Kohler’s resignation and will remember the former German president as a serious broker in the Western Sahara conflict. Western Sahara analysts and observers were shocked earlier this week by the bombshell announcement of Kohler’s resignation. In a declaration read by U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Wednesday, the UN noted that he decided to step down due to health reasons. Kohler, now 76, had decided that he was no longer up to the strenuous tasks that come with bringing four-decade-long foes to the same negotiating table, keeping them there, and, as is the hope of the political process Kohler was spearheading, brokering a lasting and thoroughly negotiated settlement. In its reaction to Kohler’s decision, Algeria echoed the sentiments of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Morocco, who shared their thoughts immediately after the news was made public. The new Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister Sabri Boukaddoum said on Thursday, that Algeria “takes Personal Envoy Horst Kohler’s resignation with deep regret.” Boukaddoum went on to highlight his diplomatic role in restoring hope among observers and actors alike noting that his approach in the conflict could lead to genuine confidence building in the decades-long stalemate. While Algeria saluted Kohler’s “serious efforts” in the Sahara dossier, the statement made sure to renew Algiers’ commitment to what has come to define its Western Sahara stance—and by extension its foreign policy towards Morocco: A referendum on self-determination. “Algeria remains convinced that the solution to the Western Sahara issue is for the people of Western Sahara to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, in conformity with international law and UN tradition on issues of decolonization.” The mention of “decolonization” and “self-determination” blatantly disregards the latest UN resolutions and recommendations on the way forward for the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict. Resolution 2468, the latest on the issue, urges all parties—including Algeria—to let go of the self-determination card and instead pave the way for a politically negotiated settlement. The resolution champions compromise, realism, and pragmatism, a move that has largely been interpreted as is a disqualification of a referendum on self-determination. But Algiers’ commitment to its default Western Sahara policy also raises serious questions as to what awaits the next UN envoy. Kohler, who was appointed in August 2017 to replace American Christopher Ross, has won plaudits for convincing the four parties in the Sahara dossier—Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Polisario—to sit at the same roundtables. Kohler’s tenure has generated hope about the feasibility of a lasting solution in Western Sahara, with observers and diplomats alike suggesting that Kohler’s efforts have sparked a “new momentum” for the UN agenda in the conflict. With Kohler now gone, however, it remains to be seen whether the new momentum he helped broker will survive him.

Rabat – Algeria has once again offered its presidential plane to transport the Polisario leader, Brahim Ghali, to Johannesburg for the swearing-in ceremony of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ghali arrived in Johannesburg’s airport on Friday, May 24, at the invitation of the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, re-elected for a new term, whose swearing-in took place on Saturday. Ghali was received at the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs by a number of high ranking South African officials including the Director of African Affairs and the Middle East. On March 25, Algeria made its presidential plane available to transport the Polisario leader to Pretoria to attend a conference of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Despite this move and its financial, political, diplomatic and military support for the Polisario, Algeria keeps claiming that it has no vested interests in the Western Sahara conflict and it seeks only to help the Saharawis to “exercise their right to self-determination.” For over a decade, Algeria has forged an anti-Morocco alliance with South Africa to thwart Moroccan efforts to achieve a political solution to the conflict that safeguards Rabat’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa is a true supporter of the Polisario Front and claims that he “stands for the struggle of Sahrawi people for freedom and independence.” Relations between South Africa and Morocco have fluctuated since 2004 when Morocco withdrew their ambassador to South Africa due to South Africa’s Pretoria recognizing the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).

Rabat – The Moroccan government spokesman, Mustapha El Khalfi, has said that the government will back the controversial Bill 63.16, which provides compulsory health coverage to the parents of the insured public sector employees. El khalfi said the bill, which has been awaiting action ever since it was referred to the the house of councilors in 2016, would boost the purchasing power of the employees. He added that through the implementation of the bill, Morocco’s health coverage spendings will see an increase. He presented the bill as part of the country’s endeavor to universalize access to basic health care to a wider cross-section of society. El Khalfi found it “irrational” that this bill has been shelved for three years. The bill, he added, will serve Morocco’s wider’ ambitious social project to the benefit of Moroccan citizens. El Khalfi noted that the Head of Government, Saadeddine Othmani, has reaffirmed his willingness to put the bill to good use for approximately one million insured employees in the public sector. The reason why parliamentarians do not to see eye to eye in putting the bill into force is due its mandatory aspect MPs say it should be optional.  Based on the principle of solidarity and contribution among all social actors according to article 1 of health coverage code, the bill, critics have argued, would benefit some Moroccans off the backs of others. Critics lament that the law imposes salary and pension cuts even to all public sector employees, even those whose parents have died. Earlier, El Othmani accused the Speaker of the House of Councilors, Hakim Benchemach, fof impeding the process of implementation after the law was referred to the lower house of parliament.

Rabat – Spanish police discovered three migrants, two men, and a 15-year-old girl, inside car dashboards and engines trying to sneak into EU from the Morocco-Melilla border. Two of the three migrants showed symptoms of asphyxia, disorientation, and joint pain because of the vehicle fumes and the cramped positions they took to fit into the cars. The individuals, clinging to the same car, were attempting to flee Morocco. One person was behind the rear seats of the car, while the other two were hidden in the dashboard. Three vehicles were searched in a space of just three hours. A fourth truck was searched in the Spanish port of Melilla where a 20-year-man was found in the base of the vehicle. According to police, he had “taken advantage” of moments the driver’s attention was elsewhere, enabling him to crawl inside the vehicle. The drivers, all Moroccan, have now been detained and will appear in court. The drivers are aged 19, 30, and 31. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recently released data showing that Mediterranean migrant arrivals have reached 19,830 in 2019.  Though there has been a 30% decrease from the 28,325 Mediterranean arrivals of this time last year, in 2018, the IOM reports that irregular immigration rate to Spain is 7,666, roughly the same as the 8,150 immigrants this time last year.

The taxi ordering app Roby Taxi has been operating for three months in Marrakech and, since February, in Casablanca. Disrupting the taxi and ride-sharing industry, it is planning its expansion to the other major cities of Morocco. Through an app, Roby connects registered taxi drivers with clients needing a taxi ride. It operates similarly to Uber internationally and its Moroccan counterpart Careem, by providing a platform where public transport supply can meet demand. Unlike these apps though, Roby operates exclusively in the taxi industry. It only employs registered Moroccan taxis, and not private vehicles. “It is an intuitive application, providing a well thought through service that is offered by valued and experienced professional drivers (of real taxis),” emphasizes Roby.  Additionally, Roby highlights what makes them different is that clients are dealing with professionals.  “Our drivers all have IDs and are approved by the State, holding trustworthy licences.” Taxi drivers sign up to the platform for a flat fee of MAD 490 ($50.6) per month. They make no other payments to the platform, so they receive the full amount from each ride. Customers can order a taxi through the app, paying a flat fee of MAD 15 ($1.5). The ride is then charged at the normal taxi rate. Prices don’t change depending on supply and demand, as is the case with Careem and Uber. “No more price surges in periods of high demand. With Roby Taxi, no more price scaling, but rather a clear pricing grid in accordance with State rates,” Roby says. Over 1,200 taxi drivers have signed up to operate through the platform. Clients can pay in cash, as they would usually do in a taxi. They can also pay via the Roby app if taxis have signed up to this feature. Roby plans to expand to Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, Safi, Essaouira and Agadir by the end of the year. “Our objective is to work with 150,000 taxi drivers out of the 240,000 taxis drivers in the country in the next five years,” founder Yann Blay told Moroccan official news channel 2M. Approximately 1,500 drivers and 10,000 clients currently use the app.  Roby competes directly with a similar taxi ordering app “Heetch,” which was launched in Casablanca in 2018 and operates in Rabat and Marrakech. Unlike Roby, Heetch charges taxi drivers of commission of MAD 5 per ride. Global ride-sharing giant Uber tried its luck in Morocco. It launched in 2015 and operated for three years before withdrawing from the country because of regulatory issues. Dubai-based competitor Careem, however, found an operating niche and took over the private ride sharing market. Uber announced in March that it will buying Careem for MAD 33.6 billion ($3.1 billion). Careem will however continue to operate under its own brand, in Morocco and internationally.

Rabat – A recent report from Open Data Inventory (ODIN) ranked Morocco 43rd  out of 178 countries, with a score of 58. Morocco is represented in the report by Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP),  which shared a press release to commend Morocco’s position. The press release said that Morocco is ranked “first in the North African region, 2nd in the Arab region, and 3rd in Africa.” “This ranking… [shows]  the progress of the HCP in the field of Open Data. It is expected to improve with the planned integration of new indicators in the Institution’s Statistical Data Base (BDS) and the opening of anonymous micro-data of its statistical operations to interested users,” said HCP in its press release. The ranking uses a range of sources and measures to provide an accurate and fair assessment of the “coverage and openness of official statistics in  178 countries.” “The purpose of ODIN is to provide an objective and reproducible measure of the public availability of national statistics, and their adherence to open data standards. ODIN evaluates openness on a spectrum, measuring the degree of openness rather than classifying datasets as open or closed,” said the report. According to the executive summary of the report, Morocco is among the countries that witnessed a “positive change in openness.” The countries with the greatest positive change in openness are (Morocco +40, Singapore +28, Romania +26, Hong Kong +21, Cyprus and Tunisia +20).  The report, however, emphasized that “openness scores and coverage scores are not independent” as data availability and comprehensiveness are also important factors in openness.  “The five openness elements cannot be assessed when data is not publicly available. Therefore, increases in coverage due to the release of new datasets nearly always lead to some increase in openness.” The report also indicates that Morocco’s openness score increased from 25 to 65 between 2017 and 2018.  “All openness elements increased in score except metadata availability, although HCP has stated that work in this area is on their future agenda.”

Rabat – The Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF) has criticized the referee’s judgment during the first leg of the Africa Champions League final game between Wydad Casablanca and Esperance of Tunis (Hope of Tunisia), held on Friday in Rabat. In its letter addressed to the African Confederation of Football (CAF), the federation highlighted the two major mistakes made by the referee. FRMF stated that during extra time in the first half,  the referee “validated the goal” scored by WAC. However, the referee “surprisingly” asked the players to wait so he could “go and consult [the video assistant referee] VAR.” The football federation also condemned the decision to not grant a penalty in the 56-minute of the second half. The performance of the referee team caused uproar as Moroccan football fans took to social media to express their anger at the unjust decisions made by the referee team during the game. FRMF concluded its statement saying that: “We are waiting for a quick response” on the matter. The statement added that it is waiting for CAF to propose “possible”  compensation in favor of the Moroccan football club, as well as“sanctions that could be imposed in these cases.” In addition to the FRMF, Wydad Casablanca football club also addressed a letter of complaint to the President of CAF, Ahmad Ahmad.  According to Wydad Casablanca, otherwise known as WAC, the referee’s decision contributed“significantly to change the results as the referee team deprived the Moroccan team of  a legal goal and a clear penalty.”

Rabat – A new survey, Islamicity Index, has found that Western countries better reflect Islamic institutions than countries where Islam is an inherent part of the governmental system. Conducted by the Washington-based Islamicity Foundation, the survey aimed at gauging the degree of compliance with the rules outlined in the Quran and practiced by the prophet Mohammed.  The survey measured the level of each country’s “Islamicity”, where the concept was based on economic and human development, laws and governance, human and political rights, and international relations, but not on Muslims’ adherence to core personal beliefs such as daily prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage. According to the index, Morocco placed 94th out of 153 Muslim and non-Muslim countries in the 2018 Islamicity Index, with a score point of 4.06.  Morocco’s highest rank in the survey was 69th, which was on the legal and governance levels with 5.14 score points. Its second highest rank, placing 85th, was in terms of economic growth, with a score of 4.53. Inversely, the North African country ranked 132nd in terms of human and political rights, scoring 2.68 and 114th in terms of international relations with a 3.56 score. Morocco ranked 15th against 40 other Muslim-majority countries, including Saudi Arabia. Where the index placed Morocco at 94 out of 153,Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, ranked 85 and 86, respectively. The four Muslim majority countries—United Arab Emirates, Albania, Malaysia, and Qatar—taking the lead against other Arab countries placed well behind 44 other non-muslim countries, including Israel, Panama, as well as Malta and Japan, which made it to the top 20.  Topping the list of the 153 countries surveyed was New Zealand, followed by Sweden, Netherlands, Iceland, and Switzerland who scored highly on economic development and human rights, justice, governance and international relations. The survey was carried out by Hossein Askari, an Iranian-born professor of International Business and International Affairs, and Scheherazade Rehman, director of the EU Research Center at the university.

Rabat – In one of the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) facilities in the American state of Virginia, Muslim inmates are faced with restrictions on food during the month of Ramadan.  Ramadan is a holy month when Muslims partake of food, drink, sex, or any behavior that could be harmful to the mind, body, and soul. A joint letter written on Friday, May 24, by the civil rights advocacy groups Muslim Advocates, the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), and Virginia Prison Justice Network (VAPJN), described the conditions of Muslim inmates as “unlawful” and clearly in violation of the US constitution. Unlike non-Muslim inmates at Red Onion prison in Pound, Virginia, Muslim inmates do not receive their suhoor (pre-dawn meal) before their fast begins, while others at the River North in Independence, Virginia, are provided with their iftar (evening fast-breaking) meal only after one hour or more after sundown. They are also denied access to drinkable water during non-fasting hours. The letter emphasis the discrimination against Muslims, noting that access to potable water for other inmates is not restricted during the same non-fasting hours of Muslims. It added that the Virginia Department of Corrections “has systematically burdened the religious exercise of Muslim inmates during Ramadan…and subjected them to unlawful and inhumane conditions.” The groups wrote in the letter that the ill-treatment of Muslim inmates “not only jeopardizes” their health but also “violates their well-established rights  under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause and Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.” The groups call on the prison department to make sure Muslim inmates observe their Ramadan fast unburdened, and that prison staff receives training regarding Ramadan practices “to increase oversight of facilities’ meal delivery.”

The 27-year-old complained about the ban on Twitter, saying “The thought police of the radical progressives at Facebook have reached me as well!” A Facebook spokesperson replied, saying: “Yair Netanyahu posted several posts which included hate speech – this clearly violates our community standards. Due to that, this content was removed from our platform, as we would do for anyone posting similar content about any protected characteristic.” “Following this, Yair Netanyahu decided to share a screenshot of a removed post and called people to share it – which is the same as writing the hate speech all over again.”

Rabat – A short clip circulating on social media has surprised many, showing the Crown Prince Moulay Hassan in casual mode. The video shows the Crown Prince Moulay Hassan following his uncle, Moulay Rachid, through the throne room of Rabat’s royal palace.  As he passes the camera, the Crown Prince, who just turned 16 on May 8, flashes a peace symbol with both hands. The video comes from a live broadcast of the throne room uploaded to YouTube by Spanish media channel La Vanguardia. It was shot on March 30 in Rabat, during Pope Francis’ official visit to Morocco.  The scene takes place after the speeches of Pope Francis and King Mohammed VI on the esplanade of the Hassan tower, and before the signing of the Al Quds Appeal in the same throne room. Between the two official events, the camera was broadcasting the throne room live as the royal palace employees performed microphone tests as Prince Moulay Hassan and Moulay Rachid walked through.  King Mohammed VI and Pope Francis arrived half an hour later. During the signing of the Al Quads Appeal, and the Crown Prince Moulay Hassan sat a few steps behind his father and next to his uncle, Prince Moulay Hassan is back in the throne room. The video was shared on the Facebook page “Casa Bel Visa” late on May 25 and has been seen 124,000 times in just eleven hours.

Rabat –  Medical students will continue with a series of ongoing protests despite the recent call from Morocco’s Minister of Education,Said Amzazi. In this call, Amzazi tells students to end the strikes and return to class, stressing that the dates for the final exams have been decided and will not change.  The National Commission of Medical Students announced that the students will take to the street for another march on May 30. The students will begin their march from the headquarters of the Ministry of Health to the parliament. The committee also announced that some medical students will boycott their 7th year internships in regional and provincial hospitals for two weeks, starting May 27. On May 20, Amzazi said that the Ministry of Education has taken the necessary measures to make up for the time that medical students missed during the continuous protests. He also said that the ministry decided on the dates of exams.  “Those who will take the exams are are welcome, and those who will miss it should shoulder their responsibility,” said Amzazi. The students have been on strike for nearly two months to protest against a range of issues including the privatization of medical education and services,  the need for enhancing the training conditions for medical students, and the need for necessary medical equipment in training spaces. Earlier this week, medical students rejected a draft agreement from the government. The agreement proposed by the ministry of health includes the “reduction of expenses and material costs for dental students.”  The draft agreement also proposed that “private faculties need to create their own hospital training space.” The agreement also wants to “increase in the number of positions awarded to medical graduates in pharmacy and dentistry.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI addressed a message to President Cyril Ramaphosa on his inauguration as President of the Republic of South Africa on Saturday. In the message, the King expressed his “sincere congratulations to the South African President, wishing him every success in his mission to serve the interests of his people and to realize his aspirations for further progress and prosperity.” The message from the King comes amid decades of tense interactions with Pretoria due its position on the Western Sahara conflict. South Africa has long supported the separatist group of Polisario, vowing to back its “independence claim” at the African and international level. The strained relationship between the two countries dates back to 2004 when Morocco recalled its ambassador to South Africa when Pretoria recognized the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Ever since, Pretoria has been doing its utmost to oppose Morocco during international symposiums and events, including the UN Security Council. In April, South Africa abstained from voting on Resolution 2486, which extended the mandate of MINURSO in Western Sahara for six months. South Africa deemed the resolution  “unbalanced.” South African representative to the UN Jerry Matjila said after the vote: “This is again an example of an African issue being decided by those that are not from the continent.” In addition to its position on the resolution, Pretoria hosted a symposium to generate opposing voices against Morocco’s territorial integrity in March. Algeria, Polisario’s first supporter, was among the first attendees at the SADC Solidarity Conference with the Sahrawi People in Pretoria, meeting March 25-26. Namibia co-hosted the conference against Morocco’s interests. Algeria, South Africa, and Namibia, against Morocco’s sovereignty over the region, have long held links with the separatist group of the Polisario Front, supporting their independence claims. Despite the hostile moves, Morocco’s diplomacy has always relied on reinforcing a win-win diplomatic cooperation based on respect for states’ sovereignty, and the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs. Furthermore, Morocco has categorically refused to interfere or comment on the Bouteflika crisis. Morocco has also proposed a dialogue initiative to Algeria to break the stalemate, a call which has not yet received an answer.

Rabat – The Spanish government has called on theEuropean Union to provide Morocco with multi-year financial aid to enable the North African country to deal with pressure due to theflow of undocumented migrants. Spanish news outlet El Pais said that three Spanish officials emphasized the importance of the increase of financial support to Morocco. The officials conveyed their support during the EU’s Deputy Director General of Migration and Internal Affairs, Simon Mordue’s visit in May. The list of Spanish officials who demanded an annual financial contribution to Morocco from the EU included General Director of International Relations and Immigration of the Ministry of the Interior, Elena Garzón and Head of the General Commissariat of Foreigners and Borders, Juan Enrique Taborda. “Both asked that Brussels guarantee a multi-year fund to Morocco,” the news outlet added. The Spanish authorities also called on the EU to submit aid promised to Morocco “seven months ago,” referring to the 140 million euros. According to El Pias the allocation was not “transferred in full.” Spain and Morocco have been facing considerable pressure on both sides due to the flow of irregular migrants. The pressure urged Spain to repeatedly call on the European Union to help the North African country in the Mediterranean. The issue also reinforced cooperation between Morocco and Spain. The Moroccan government announced that security services have thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, compared to 88,761 of prevented attempts in 2018. Spokesperson of the Government Mustapha El Khalfi said on Thursday that the decrease in the number of irregular migration attempts reflects the “great” effort of Morocco’s law enforcement forces against the issue of undocumented migration and the trafficking networks active in this area.

Rabat – Morocco’sWydad Casablanca football club has addressed a strong message to the President of the African Football Federation (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, to denounce the performance of the referee during the first leg of Africa’s Champions League Final against Espérance of Tunis held on Friday night in Rabat. In the message, the football club stressed that the referee’s mistakes during the match “changed the course of the game,” an argument supported “unanimously” by the people who watched it. According to Wydad Casablanca, otherwise known as WAC, the referee’s decision contributed“significantly to change the results as the referee team deprived the Moroccan team of  a legal goal and a clear penalty.” The club called for an immediate “intervention and investigation into the case to ensure justice for the club.” WAC entered the game as a heavy favorite. The referee’s unjust decision, however, shocked football fans who accused the referee of a “clear bias” in favor of the Tunisian team. In the press release, WAC listed all the mistakes of the referees during the game, concluding its letter with a powerful message citing the ethics of soccer and the reforms that CAF has previously implemented against such mistakes and injustice. “It is not the course of a final that is in play, but the course of a global reform project that CAF carries under your mandate,” wrote the club. Wydad Casablanca concluded that its club “continues to believe in the beautiful destiny of African football, [and] will go to the end to assert its rights, and contributing as much as it can in the new destiny of this sport in our continent.” The first leg of the final with the Tunisian team ended in a draw, 1-1.  The second leg of the final will take place on May 31. It remains to be seen whether CAF will address the club’s demands for justice in the coming days.

By Andrew Seger Rabat – The restaurant is run by AMSAT, the Moroccan Association of Support and Assistance for People with Down Syndrome. This is astonishing in a country where more than half of disabled people are unemployed. In the US, unemployment amongst the disabled is only about 10%. Meryem Moussa places each table setting with extreme delicacy. She takes care to make sure the fork and knife are perfectly straight, and she delivers a bread basket to every table with a beaming smile. Moussa has down syndrome. “I dream of being a famous actress and singer, but I also want to be a big and successful chef,” she said. “I believe that step by step I can fulfill those dreams.” Moussa has worked at this restaurant in Rabat, Morocco’s capital, for more than five years. She works alongside 40 other chefs and servers with down syndrome. Special educators teach them cooking techniques, service, and catering. The AMSAT Educational Restaurant is open for lunch, serving upwards of 40 people a day. The restaurant’s wall décor and placemats are the colorful products of AMSAT’s art class. On display throughout are framed pictures of smiling employees, and shelves are lined with treats from the kitchen: You can take home orange marmalade, assorted cookies or even some fresh crustacean oil. Visitors can watch through a huge window as the chefs with down syndrome prepare every plate that goes out. “This person with down syndrome, she has the possibility to have an account in the bank? No— she can’t. You can’t give him an account,” Mounir said. “Can this person use a bank card; can you give him medical coverage? All these problems— you can find nothing in Moroccan law,”  said Mohamed Mounir who is with the AMSAT organization. Mounir said because of their disability, people with down syndrome also struggle to work a full eight-hour workday. That means even when employers are willing to hire someone with a disability, they have to work out a special salary and schedule, and these employees generally need extra supervision and training. “There is still a very negative view of handicapped people, that they can’t do anything,” Bouchaib Bouzekrawi, a psychologist for AMSAT, explains. He continues, “So there is a lot of work to do to change this view, and this is exactly why we wanted to open the restaurant to the public, so they come and see that these are real meals prepared and served by these young people.” Legal status AMSAT is now working to draft a law that will give legal status to people with mental and developmental disabilities. Mounir said that would give them the opportunity to open bank accounts, sign contracts with employers, and get job insurance. But, he said, AMSAT won’t stop there. “I think it’s possible. Our dreams are that the person with disability can live alone in an apartment as couple. To love! If you come back in ten years, in the cinema you can sit next to a couple with down syndrome. This is our dream.” The restaurant was launched in 2010 with funding from the European Union. It began just as a training program, teaching eight or nine workers to prepare traditional Moroccan dishes like chicken tajine with lemons and olives, a traditional Moroccan meal cooked in a special clay pot.  The restaurant opened its doors to the public four years ago, and its success has inspired AMSAT to try and open similar facilities nationwide. ‘It’s a beautiful experience’ “The results are magnificent,” Khadija Sebbah, the head chef and director of the restaurant, exclaims. “It’s a beautiful experience!” Sebbah said after employees have been with them for a few years, AMSAT helps them find internships with other local restaurants. She said there have been even more exciting benefits. Employees including Moussa have traveled to France every year to represent Morocco in culinary competitions. “When I went to do this challenge, I had a lot of self-confidence… I was surrounded by great chefs who were there to judge us and give us marks,” Moussa recalled. “This was an important experience in my life.” Moussa ranked fourth in the competition with recipes for chicken legs, squid, and potatoes with fennel. She said she could not have done it without the careful instruction of her guides at AMSAT. The judges applauded her independence and motivation, and she even earned style points for the presentation of her plates. Moussa said she hopes to share what she’s learned at AMSAT and eventually teach her own students how to cook. Aside from her dream to be an actress and a singer, she said she wishes to one day cook for people all over the world.

Rabat – Three people were killed and 14 others injured in a traffic accident on Saturday in Tangier, northern Morocco, local authorities from Tangier’s prefecture said. Local authorities and civil defense members rushed the wounded to the Tangier’s provincial hospital to receive the necessary health care, the same source said. Authorities opened an investigation under the supervision of the public prosecutor’s office to determine the cause of this tragedy, it added. Morocco is known to have a high rate of traffic accidents. The US Department of State released its 2019 report on Crime &amp; Safety in Morocco. The report describes Moroccan traffic  as “erratic, aggressive, and even reckless.” “On average, more than 11 Moroccans die in motor vehicle accidents every day; the fatality rate for motor vehicle accidents is approximately twice that of the U.S,” the report said. The report warns travelers that “it is common to see vehicles driving counter-flow and ignoring traffic signs/signals. It is common for drivers to execute right turns from the left lane and vice-versa.”  “Trucks are often overladen and in disrepair…Pedestrians often walk into traffic without looking, or intentionally dart between moving cars. Riders on mopeds and motorcycles routinely split lanes and do not yield to vehicles making legal turns,” it added.  The already perilous roads combined with Ramadan, a time when many drivers are irritable and prone to dangerous behavior, suggests that individuals driving during the holy month should take extra caution.

Rabat – Millions of Moroccans watched with a sense of powerlessness as the referee’s decision influenced the course of the match in favor of Espérance of Tunis. This injustice should have caused an uproar throughout Morocco and pushed Moroccan media to denounce the referee’s clear bias in favor of the Tunisian team. Unfortunately, Morocco does not have an influential press that can put pressure on rivals when the country’s interests are at stake. When Tunisia’s SC Sfaxien lost the second leg of the African Confederation Cup against Morocco’s Renaissance Sportive of Berkane earlier this month, the Tunisian press unified to denounce the alleged injustice their team suffered at the hands of the referee. Although Senegalese Referee Maguette Ndiaye did not wrong the Tunisian team, both the Tunisian press and the Tunisian Football Federation launched an aggressive campaign against him as well as the Confederation of African Football (CAF), accusing them of bias in favor of the Moroccan team. More still, the president of Tunisia’s football federation traveled to CAF’s headquarters in Cairo and made the case for his country’s team before CAF’s disciplinary committee. The campaign was arguably the main reason why CAF has taken lenient penalties against some Tunisian players, despite Tunisian players and their technical staff assaulting the referee. This unprofessional behavior should have been enough evidence for CAF to impose heavy sanctions on the Tunisian team. Against all odds, CAF showed inexplicable leniency towards SC Sfaxien and its players. Africa’s football governing body imposed a mere $40,000 fine on the Tunisian club, banned three players from playing three to four matches, and banned two technical staff members for five matches.   After the scandalous injustice to which Morocco’s Wydad of Casablanca (WAC) was subjected in the Champions’ League final in Rabat, one might argue that the Tunisians outsmarted the Moroccans. Their campaign was meant to influence CAF’s decisions in the then-upcoming final of the Champions League. This fierce media campaign was undoubtedly present in the mind of the Egyptian referee who deprived Morocco’s WAC of a legitimate goal and a penalty. After yesterday’s match, sports observers, as well as a number of former international referees, agreed that the referee favored Espérance of Tunis to the detriment of WAC. Former Syrian international referee and current analyst at beIN Sports, Jamal Charif, clearly said that the goal denied to WAC was legitimate. The campaign has even affected CAF’s decisions in appointing the referees of the African Confederation Cup and the Champions’ League Finals. In an unprecedented move, almost the same referees will officiate the four matches either from the pitch or from the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) room.  The Moroccan press and the Royal Moroccan Football Federation should have denounced this move and mobilized their clout to urge CAF executive committee to reconsider its decision. Instead, Moroccans preferred to look elsewhere and did nothing to prevent others from sabotaging Moroccan teams’ chance to win the finals.   After yesterday’s incident at Prince Moulay Abdallah Stadium, one can only wonder where the Moroccan press is. Is it hibernating and waiting for others to defend the Moroccan teams? Why have the Moroccan media not followed in the footsteps of the Tunisian press and launched a similarly fierce media campaign against the Egyptian referee? Why has the President of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, who is a member of the CAF executive committee, remained silent after last night’s event? What happened to WAC yesterday may happen again to RS of Berkane in tomorrow’s second leg of the African Confederation Cup Final in Alexandria. It may happen in the second leg of the Champions’ League final next Friday in Tunis, or befall the Moroccan team in the African Cup of Nations next June. Why have the media failed to launch a campaign to denounce the Egyptian referee and pressure CAF to ensure that such a scenario will not happen again? Despite the existence of dozens of Moroccan newspapers and hundreds of news websites, it is clear that there is no committed press interested in defending the interests of the country. Most news outlets focus more on publishing trivial, sensational subjects that will bring the greatest number of readers or viewers. Until Morocco has a strong, committed, and influential press that unifies when the country’s interests are at stake, we may continue to witness episodes such as the one we saw last night against WAC. It is up to Moroccan press to ensure that neither CAF nor any other football governing body will ever disregard the grievances of Moroccan teams and their fans.

Rabat – The US administration has pulled Morocco to its side back to negotiate the supply of the MIM-104 Patriot American air defense system, according to Spanish news outlet Defensa. Washington has already imposed sanctions on all countries that acquired the Russian missile system, such as the case of North Korea, Iran, China, and Turkey. Complying with the US penal code, many US allies including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Morocco withdrew from dealing with the Russian, while Iraq continues to use the Russian air defense system to pressure the US.  Morocco has already shown its intention to buy Chinese air defense systems “HQ-9B” or French SAMP-T, but negotiations with Russia were the most advanced. Defensa also reported that the Moroccan army lacks any long-range air defense system, unlike neighboring Algeria, which acquired in recent years a very advanced Russian and Chinese missile system.  Morocco considered Algeria’s acquisition of Russian and Chinese missiles as a threat which prompted it to urgently seek an air defense system to enhance its air capabilities. Many countries in the Middle East have Patriot Air Defense Systems, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Israel, Kuwait, and Qatar. Others, including Bahrain, are on the waiting list to receive the system. The American Patriot system is a medium-range surface-to-air missile defense system against all air threats, whether fighter or unmanned aircraft, ballistic missiles or even raft missiles. After its introduction in 2002, the American air defense system was later upgraded by several US military technology companies.  The MIM-104 Patriot system was tested during the first Gulf War and received modifications afterward.

Rabat – Tuesday, May 22  marked an unexpected surprise for the Arab World. It was the day that Moroccans and fans across the Arab world had the chance to meet again with the prominent Moroccan  singer, Aziza Jalal, who was out of the spotlight for 35 years. The singer made her first appearance since 1985 on a television show aired by MBCtelevision channel. The TV show is called “Likaa mina sifr” or “meeting from scratch.” In the show, the singer also wowed audiences across the world when she performed her legendary song “Mestanyak,” translated as “I am waiting for you” in English, with the same passion and maybe a little bit more.  The  interview with Jalal was also posted by the television show on Youtube. The interview generated more than 70,000 views and hundred of comments. “Who can say that she is 60-year old,” one of the people commented on the video. When the sound was out from her lungs, Jalal’s fans across the world were mesmerised by the singer’s soft, strong vocals which remain unchanged after 35 years of absence.  Fans ‘waiting for you,’ too The artist announced her retirement from public life in 1985 when she married Saudi businessman Ali bin Butti al-Ghamdi, who asked her to give up  singing in public as one of the marital conditions. The proposal suddenly ended her career in the music industry, leaving her fans disappointed, knowing that she could have added even more hits to her already impressive list of songs. The singer’s return to the spotlight has coincided with the recent death of her husband. The singer  had made a name for herself as one of the top Arab singers in the 70s and 80s. Not too little to late, her vocals have made headlines again as she astonished the world by  singing a few verses from her song during the television show. Jalal’s song “Mistaniak” was covered by Lebanese singer Nancy Ajram, one of the most popular and commercially successful Arab artists. The song’s lyrics come from the repertoire of the great Egyptian musician Mohamed Abdelouahab. The composer of the song was renowned musician Baligh Hamdi. The singer, however, had several other famous songs, including Min Hakek T’atebny (You have the right to blame me,) and Houa El Hob Le’baa (Love is a Game.) Jalal’s early songs achieved commercial success in the UAE and in Egypt, and with the help of songwriter and poet Abdel Wahab Mohammed and artist Sayed Makkawi, among others, she quickly became a household name in the entire Arab world. Speaking on the MBC show, the music icon recalled intimate memories from her childhood, as well as instances in her path to fame and success in the music industry. She also expressed her unique attachment to her hometown, Meknes, and how her childhood in Morocco had shaped her life and character. The interview with the music legend and her performance of the song “Mestaniak” has gone viral on social media, making her devoted fans eagerly wonder whether this appearance will mark the onset of her full return to the music scene. Early career Before fame and marriage , the singer dedicated  her life to the study of music. Young Aziza Jalal studied music in Meknes before participating in a singing competition called Mawahib (Talents)  supervised by renowned Moroccan singer Abdelnabi Al Jirari in 1975. During the competition, the singer performed songs of well-known Egyptian and international Arab icons, such us Shadia and Ismahan.  The singing competition was the start of the singer’s career in the Arab music industry before she eventually disappeared, subsumed by the demands of marital life.  Abandoning music for love Born in 1958 in the city of Meknes, near Fez, the singer abandoned her career to marry the love of her life, Saudi businessman Ali bin Butti al-Ghamdo, who also made several sacrifices in order to marry the iconic singer. al-Ghamdi  is believed to have defied his conservative family’s rejection of his marriage to the popular singer. Jalal lived in the Saudi city of Taif with her husband and her three children for the last 35 years.

Rabat – While it’s possible to explore Morocco in person, an alternative is traveling through literature. Online literary magazines are some of the best places to find current stories about experiences in Morocco, an ancient nation, in the 21st century. Below is a list of contemporary nonfiction that take the reader through Moroccan streets. Items on the list are organized first by title, then excerpt, summary, and finally info on the writer. “Wandering through the market, I collect a collage of vivid images. A butcher has made a colorful curtain of entrails, creating mellow stripes of all textures. Camera-shy Berber tribeswomen are in town today selling goat cheese wrapped in palm leaves. A man lumbers through the crowd pushing a ramshackle cart laden with a huge side of beef. He makes a honking sound, and I think he’s just being funny. But it isn’t the comical beep-beep I’d make behind a wheelbarrow. Small-time shipping is his livelihood, the only horn he has is his vocal chords, and he is on a mission.” As a solo traveler, Rick Stevens spends his birthday observing the alleys of the city of Tangier, in northern Morocco. He depicts everyday life in the city’s grimy, hustle-and-bustle streets which are both old-fashioned and modern. Already a travel writer, Stevens has a gift for capturing curious surroundings in a way that puts the reader in the middle of the active but chipper old medinah. Rick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio. He is the author of Travel as a Political Act. “We were not at the international border. We were in the middle of nowhere, and it was hard to discern on whose authority these fellows were detaining us. But they had guns—pistols holstered in their belts—and when they asked for our passports, we complied. They looked the passports over very carefully, and then their leader singled me out.” This is a short but humorous story from American writer Bill Donahue, who is in a group selected for an ID check. Though he has reason to be intimidated by the officers in the desert — they have guns — they seem to be genuinely interested in him in the way that many policemen are curious about the foreigners who choose to explore Morocco. Bill Donahue is a writer for Outside, Harper’s, Wired, The New York Times Magazine, and other publications. “All along the way we had met, talked to, and enjoyed the hospitality of Berbers who had spoken to me in the hope that I would tell the world about their need of roads, hospitals, and schools. Falling from pack animals was no rare event in their parts. Living with the resulting pain and even disability was also common. Quitting now would mean letting down the people I had come to Morocco to write about.” In the mountains as an assignment for National Geographic, Jeffrey Taylor wanders through scenes of Morocco’s quiet, natural side: Jbel Mgoun and Jbel Toubkal, the eastern High Atlas, the  Tichka Plateau, and more. While on his trip, Taylor takes a serious tumble and debates with himself whether he should continue the journey or go no further. Taylor meets caring people of humble means from villages nearby. Jeffrey Tayler is a contributing editor for The Atlantic and the author of six books, including River of No Reprieve: Descending Siberia’s Waterway of Exile, Death, and Destiny. His latest is Murderers in Mausoleums. His second book “Facing the Congo”ranked No. 28 on World Hum’s Top 30 Travel Books of all time. He was the subject of a World Hum interview. “In the morning I walk the hilly, winding roads, paint peeling from shutters and walls, elegant balconies fallen into disrepair. The sans serif lettering on the businesses describe a 1950s heyday unmatched since. I pass a motorcycle held together by packing tape. Every day the same old man is sharpening knives on a whetstone spun by what looks like a stationary bicycle.” This piece is one of five from a small collection of essays called A Travelogue in Five Parts By Nicholas Kulish. The backstory is, Nicholas Kulish spent more than half a decade tracing the path of Aribert Heim, a Nazi concentration camp doctor who fled postwar justice in Germany. The research for his book on Heim, The Eternal Nazi, co-authored with Souad Mekhennet, led him to Denmark, Austria, Egypt, Morocco, and across Germany. Other entries from his travels are available online at Believer Magazine. Nicholas Kulish is the East Africa correspondent for the New York Times. His latest book is The Eternal Nazi. “We proceed across the shady town outskirts in downbeat silence. There are late stirrings in households around us, windows squeaking open, babies’ cries. During the Ramadan fasting month, folks are obliged to rise before dawn to take a meal prior to sunrise. The ballyhoo in the street at 4:45 AM this morning woke, shocked, and excited us. What a thing, to parade the streets, banging drums in the darkness, hollering reminders to eat before the next fifteen hours of going without. The morning staff at the riad explained that people take a simple meal and return to sleep until the first call of the muezzin. Muslims often rest throughout the morning during Holy Month in the summer season—“unless our job is to serve the breakfast to guests,” the waiter tiredly added, placing glass bowls of yogurt and fruit salad before us.” Mindela Ruby travels with her husband from Madrid to Casablanca, describing seeing, for the first time, Chefchaouen, the Call to Prayer, a friendly local guide, relics of colonization, Ramadan, Fes, and more of Morocco’s ancient, majestic beauty alongside another aspect of her experience, symptoms of an infection. Ruby makes doctor visits on her vacation, not allowing her medical troubles to ruin the land of a thousand Kasbahs:  “And I, giggling and swaying alongside him to the next song, begin reclaiming what some enterprising candida fungi almost stole from me—the dizzying exultation, in all its complexity, of Morocco.” Ruby is the author of Mosh It Up (2014) and has also published poetry and short prose in journals including Rivet, WomenArts Quarterly, East Bay Review, Frigg, Arcadia, and Foliate Oak. She is a contributor to the new anthology Unmasked. Her poetry has been Pushcart and Best of the Net nominated. She completed a Ph.D. at the University of California.

Rabat- A recent study has established that learning English is associated with greater personal growth and improved employment prospects. The study, conducted by Wall Street English, one of the world’s largest providers of English lessons for non-native learners, concluded that mastering English is among the frequent requirements of leadership and management positions in a number of companies in the non-English speaking countries. More specifically, the study’s findings indicate that a better command of English is directly linked with a 25% increase in individuals’ monthly earnings, 18% in personal happiness, and 12% in overall positive life experiences. “The better their English, the happier they feel,” the study reported, hinting at a strong correlation between English language mastery and personal outlook on life. The functioning of the ever-shifting and globalizing workplace is perhaps the ultimate manifestation of English’s meteoric rise in popularity and significance in non-English speaking countries. When faced with a choice between two qualified employees for an important managerial position, for example, companies across the world tends to prefer the candidate with better English communication skills. Among the people interviewed for the study, 68% said that learning English has had a positive impact on their professional lives. They said the language has increased their employment opportunities while improving their long-term career projects. By contrast, only 34% of non-English speaking professionals reported having the same positive outlook on their personal growth and career prospects. “English learners declared that English has opened them new doors in terms of career improvement, with 31% saying that they learned English in the hope of finding jobs they are most passionate about,” the study noted. While an essential part of individuals’ motivation to embrace English, however, career opportunities and economic calculations are far from being the sole motivations for the world’s English language enthusiasts. For an increasing number of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students, personal growth goes beyond professional position and monthly wage. Also important in the global embrace of English is people’s need to expand their social, intellectual, and cultural horizons. With English being the lingua franca of a relentlessly globalizing world, lack of proficiency in the language diminishes people’s experience of global trends in all fields. While some reported learning English to have a better grasp of global hits in the music industry or watch their favorite Television series (Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and Game of Thrones were among the most cited series) in their original versions, others said they added English to their linguistic arsenal so they can make the most of their travels and foreign encounters. Jim Macgowan, a worker at Wall Street English employee, explained that in addition to improving their students’ professional and financial prospects, English has been for the students a springboard for making global connections and experiencing new ways of being in a globalizing world.
“As globalization brings people closer, English is reducing [social] gaps by creating new opportunities for world citizens.” The study comes as Morocco finds itself caught in a fierce debate between conservative and liberal Moroccans on the government’s plan to reform the Moroccan education system by teaching scientific subjects in foreign languages rather than in Arabic. According to the reform’s supporters, proficiency in languages other than Arabic will make Moroccan students and academics more competitive in the global knowledge market. Said Amzazi, the Moroccan minister of education, said in a recent interview that the reform is a requirement of globalization. “Do we want to train our children in a vacuum in a model predefined for eternity and without regards for the changing world around, or do we rather want them to be equipped to be citizens of the world, capable of integrating themselves in competitive work settings, and having mastery over technological advances impacting all the fields?” Amzazi asked, explaining that Morocco has an obligation to “catch the train of globalization.” On the other hand, there is the camp of Moroccans who seem uncompromisingly committed to what they call “Moroccanness” and “national pride.” Largely conservative and Arabophone, that section of the Moroccan population has vehemently opposed the linguistic reform bill, decrying a policy move they say will effeminate Moroccan culture and identity at the expense of languages such as French. But while authorities are pushing for the introduction of foreign languages, there is the perception that French, the heritage of centuries of bittersweet relations with France, is set to have the upper hand. And as the two groups engage in an acrimonious debate over “the future of Morocco,” there is a third group of Moroccans who have said that, should the government choose to go ahead with the linguistic reform, English is a far better option than French. This group’s reasoning is the same as the Wall Street English’s study. With French being far from the prestigious language it once was and English the undisputed language of global transactions, the third group posits, English should be the natural choice of any policy move aimed at changing the language of instruction in Moroccan schools. Mohammed Belhaj, the owner of Rabat’s sole all English book store recently told Morocco World News that the advent of English is such that English will eventually have the better of the zeal of Morocco’s Arabophones and Francophones alike. “The world is getting smaller and English is becoming more popular in Morocco,” Belhaj said, adding, “I’ve been in business for many years now because interest in English keeps growing. And you can’t fight growth.”

Rabat – Thousands of protesters  in Algeria gathered again after Friday prayers, renewing their determination to stand against the interim government. This Friday marked the 14 week of protests, with demonstrators repeating their calls for radical change and the resignation of all the surviving elites from the era of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. With the same slogans as in the previous weeks, the protesters carried banners and Algerian flags, opposing the July 4 election, which Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah announced in April. This week was marked   by massive security crackdown. Fearing that it may lose control of an already alarming situation, the government has lately been deploying hundreds of police officers  to “supervise” the demonstrations. Algerian news outlet TAS  reported that the Algerian police made many arrests during the protests.  The news outlet also shared a statement from the Algerian political party,  Socialist Forces Front (FFS), which denounced the crackdown on protesters. “The FFS strongly dencounces the systematic repression and violence used this morning by those in power against protesters and those who want to rally [in] the capital to march peacefully.” The party demanded  that arrested individuals be released immediately.  Amid the unrest, Algeria’s military chief Gaid Salah has warned protesters against election delay. “Holding a presidential election could help [Algeria] avoid falling into the trap of a constitutional void, with its accompanying dangers and unwelcome consequences,” Gaid Salah said on Monday.

Rabat – Members of the Moroccan Jewish community in the village of Ait Bayoud in the Essaouira province began celebrating the Hiloula of Saint Rabbi Nessim Ben Nessim on Thursday. Hiloula is a religious event celebrated by the Moroccan Jewish community. The main purpose of Hiloula is to pray for a good life and the resolution of problems. The Jewish community lights candles, touch the memorial stone and prays at the tomb of the saint. Jewish Moroccans from across Morocco and around the world flock to Essaouira for the event.  The annual commemoration of Saint Rabbi Nessim Ben Nessim is a time not only full of emotions for the Moroccan Jewish community but a time of immense pride and a chance to connect to their origins. It is also an opportunity to celebrate peace, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence. A ceremony at the sanctuary of Saint Rabbi Nessim Ben Nessim was held on Thursday evening, in the presence of Adil El Maliki, the governor of the province of Essaouira and local authorities.  Simon Levy, President of the Holy Places of the South, gave a speech sharing his joy at holding the religious ceremony. The speech also praised the fraternity and tolerance of the Moroccan people. Levy called on Moroccan Jews living abroad to return to Morocco. He said they should ” come to Morocco, their birthplace, the crucible of their culture… to invest in this beautiful country.” “We invite them, above all, to take advantage of all the securities and facilities that the Kingdom offers to investors,” he said, recalling that “Morocco, homeland, will remain forever a point of pride to all.” For his part, El Maliki pointed out that  Rabbi Nessim Ben Nessim’s Hiloula is special this year because it coincides with the holy month of Ramadan. This is not only a time for “prayer, piety, and contemplation for both communities, Jewish and Muslim, but also fraternity, sharing and conviviality,” he said. ”Our country has been able to maintain and consolidate these values ​​of fraternity and tolerance, thanks to the King’s effort to preserve the historical legacy of our country and to promote its heritage,” El Maliki continued, citing a program the King recently launched to restore the medinas of multiple cities. He added that in Essaouira, this program particularly concerns the Mellah district, including the Slat Al Kahal Synagogue. The urban landscape of the area, as well as the local amenities, will be improved in order to enhance the cultural heritage of the area.

Rabat – Morocco’s government reportedly supports Saudi Arabia’s call to hold urgent Gulf and Arab league meetings to discuss “aggressions and their consequences” in the region. Morocco has not officially commented on Saudi Arabia’s call, but an anonymous government source told Le360 that Morocco supports the Saudi move. “Morocco is well known for its experience in mediation,” the source said. “It will spare no effort to defend the Arab, Palestinian, and Muslim cause.” The unnamed government source also emphasized that Morocco might take part in the summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which will take place on June 1 in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, May 18, Saudi Arabia called for summits of the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) following the sabotage of vessels in the Gulf and attacks on pumping stations in the kingdom by Houthi drones. Saudi Arabia has blamed Iran for the attacks.   The news outlet did not, however, provide details about Morocco’s alleged move, saying “it has not been possible to know more about Morocco’s participation in both the Arab summit and in the OIC summit.” In the last few months, there have been many reports about  the alleged friction between Morocco and Saudi Arabia.  Morocco recalled its ambassadors from both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi in February . As the move came after Saudi medias made hostile comments on Moroccan interests, especially Morocco’s Western Sahara position, there were suggestions that Morocco’s decision was in response to its two Gulf countries’ shaky commitment to fundamental Moroccan interests. With  an overt challenge on Morocco’s territorial integrity, observers emphasized, the diplomatic relations between Morocco and its two Gulf neighbors signalled the end of an era, moving from strong and brotherly ties to being on the brink of total collapse.  Morocco denied the rumors, however, emphasizing that its diplomatic ties with the UAE and Saudi Arabia are strong and historic.  Rabat did not exactly there were disagreements with its Saudi ally. Instead, it sought to take a measured stance on the friction, underlining that disagreements are part of foreign affairs and can reversed through renewed commitment to reciprocity. Morocco insisted, however, that there relations with allies should be governed by constant principles and red lines.  Most recently, in April, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, visited Saudi Arabia during his Gulf tour to convey a message from King Mohammed VI.  Upon meeting both King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), Bourita renewed Morocco’s commitment to regional peace and security. He said that Morocco’s actions in the region have always been motivated by the eagerness to preserve shared interests by maintaining regional stability and solidarity.  Morocco’s support for the Arab League meetings would be a show of solidarity with Saudi Arabia and would firmly banish rumors of discord between the two nations.

Rabat – Moroccan preacher Hassan Kettani has issued a fatwa against men wearing jeans during prayer time because it apparently draws too much attention to their rears as they kneel to pray. “Among the mistakes that people make when praying is wearing tight clothes, causing their rear to appear in a hideous manner during prayer,” the statement published on Kettani’s Facebook page read. Under Morocco’s religious law, Kettani is not qualified to issue fatwas, as only members of the religious council have that authority.  Kettani, who is based in Morocco and Spain, has been described as an ideological leader of the Salafia Jihadia movement, a militant group based in Morocco and Spain with links to Al-Qaeda. Kettani frequently speaks out against what he believes to be western influence corrupting Moroccan society.  In 2003, he was imprisoned in connection to the Casablanca bombings, that left 45 people dead. It is to date the deadliest terrorist attack in Morocco’s history. Kettani was pardoned eight years later due to efforts from his lawyer, human rights groups and Islamists in Morocco’s parliament.

Rabat – The ethical committee of football’s international governing body, FIFA, has opened an inquiry into the leadership of Ahmad Ahmad, the president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The decision comes managing CAF’s former secretary filed a complaint accusing the president, Ahmad Ahmad, of corruption and sexual harassment. Spanish sports outlet Marca reported on yesterday that after weeks of hold-up on the case for lack of a strong basis for opening a criminal inquiry, FIFA is finally proceeding to investigating Ahmad Ahmad’s tenure as CAF president. March 31 was the departure point of the case, with CAF former secretary general, the Egyptian Amr Fahmy, lodging a complaint with FIFA’s ethical committee. In the complaint, Fahmy pointed at Ahmad’s mismanagement of CAF funds as well as sexual misbehavior with four unnamed female colleagues. More specifically, Fahmy’s letter to FIFA accused Ahmad of ordering the transfer of $20,000 to the accounts of a number of African football federations’ presidents. The letter noted that the transfer was part of a bribe to a number of countries, including Cape Verde and Tanzania. But the letter did not provide specifics about what the motive of the bribes. The complaint also recounted how Ahmad disbursed a whopping $830,000 from CAF funds to spend on what Fahmy deemed unnecessary equipments purchased from French manufacturer Tactical Steel. To make matters worse, according to Fahmy, Ahmad had a habit of financing his lavish lifestyle with CAF money. The Egyptian cited Ahmad’s huge collection of cars, explaining that the CAF president spent over $400,000 on cars in Egypt and his country, Madagascar. Ahmad is also said to have a personal first-rate office in Madagascar which also operates off CAF’ coffers. CAF’s executive board sacked Fahmy following his allegations, with Ahmad categorically denying the accusations. The news comes just a few weeks ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN), the continent’s most popular footballing tournament. This year’s CAN, to be played between June 21 and July 19 in Egypt, will be the first to feature 24 teams, up from 16 in earlier editions.

Rabat – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recently released data showing that Mediterranean migrant arrivals have reached 19,830 in 2019.  There has been a 30% decrease from the 28,325 Mediterranean arrivals of this time last year, in 2018.  Deaths of irregular immigrants have reached 512, compared to last years’ 638. Though the data reflects the entire Mediterranean region, these numbers would support the claims that Morocco is cracking down on irregular immigration. The IOM reports that irregular immigration rate to Spain is 7,666, roughly the same as the 8,150 immigrants this time last year. Greece is proving to be a more common destination for irregular immigrants as irregular arrivals in Greece this year are nearly 1,000 greater than Spain, at 9,430. Regardless, the arrivals are fewer than they were this time last year. The report adds, “arrivals to both Spain and Greece account for 86 percent of all arrivals, with the balance arriving this year in Italy, Malta, and Cyprus.” The reason Spain and Greece account for so much is most likely Italy’s numbers. Irregular immigration to Italy, meanwhile, is down by nearly 9,000, at 13,61 this year from the 10,775 last year. Cypress is up at 980, while last year it was at 37. Last years’ Malta numbers are unreported.

Rabat – Spanish daily news outlet El Espanol reported that pornographic website, Xhamster, has released visitor statistics from the last two months. The data shows traffic from Muslim countries, which show Moroccans and Iranians as the most common visitors to the pornographic site. During the first days of Ramadan, porn consumption fell notably in most countries. But, in countries like Morocco and Iran, consumption gradually returned to average traffic levels through the end of the month, where visits to the pornographic website decreased by only 11.8% and 14.3%, respectively. The list of statistics includes 21 Muslim-majority countries, with Oman listed third in terms of porn visits,showing a decrease of 27.08%, followed by UAE (27.8%), Lebanon (34.5%), Malaysia (35.5%), Qatar (38.7%), Iraq (39.1), Turkey (40.7%), and Indonesia (44.9%). The website has experienced a significant  decrease in traffic from Syria with 47.2% appearing close to the bottom of the list at 11th from the end, ahead of  Kuwait (48.1%), Saudi Arabia (53.2%), Jordan (57.7%), Palestine (61.2%), Tunisia (61.9%), and Afghanistan (66.6%). The lower rate of porn consumption in Gulf countries could be attributed to laws which prohibit pornographic websites. In order to access them, people use a VPN to change their IP address to another country where porn websites are not subjected to restrictions.  Countries, where porn traffic fell to more than 70%, were Libya with 74.1%, Egypt with 74.2%, and finally Yemen at74.6%. Surprisingly, since they do not have such a conservative culture as Saudi Arabia or Iran, our Algerian neighbors are the first to abstain from watching porn during the holy month of Ramadan with a major drop of 76.1%.   According to the website’s CEO Alex Hawkins, the traffic experienced the strongest drop in the first days of Ramadan, “but everything has changed over the last few days, and porn has come back stronger than ever.” “After the first week of Ramadan, the trends have changed again. Days after the start, in Tunisia 50% of the traffic lost during those days has been recovered. In the United Arab Emirates, the figure was up to 70%. And in Iran it has gone back to normal,” declared Hawkins to El Espanol. Based on the statistics, the website made mocking comments about Iranians and Moroccans, saying that their “pillars of Islam are looking a bit limp.”

Rabat – Theresa May has bowed to pressure from the Conservative party and announced that she will resign as their leader, effective from June 7.  The resignation comes after the Prime Minister’s latest Brexit plan was strongly condemned by her MPs on Tuesday. The new plan included concessions aimed at attracting cross-party support. The ten-point plan angered Tory backbenchers and members of her own cabinet, while still failing to please the Labour MPs it was meant to convert to her cause. The move is part of a three-year struggle to reach a Brexit deal that all parties could accept. May delivered the news in an emotional speech in front of the official residence in Downing Street.  During the speech, May spoke of her party’s many achievements during her time as leader, including tackling the deficit, reducing unemployment, and boosting funding for mental health. However, she admitted: “It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit.” She reiterated that she had “done everything” she could to convince MPs to support the withdrawal deal she had negotiated with the European Union, but it was now in the “best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort”. May added that her successor would have to build consensus in Parliament in order to deliver Brexit. “Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise,” she said. She concluded her speech with a shaking voice, saying “I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold. The second female prime minister, but certainly not the last.” “I do so with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.” Labor Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that May had been “right to resign” as the Conservative party is “disintegrating.” Theresa May is right to resign. She’s now accepted what the country’s known for months: she can’t govern, and nor can her divided and disintegrating party. Whoever becomes the new Tory leader must let the people decide our country’s future, through an immediate General Election. — Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) May 24, 2019 Several members of the Conservative party tweeted in support of May’s speech, including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has already announced his decision to run for leadership. In his tweet, he called May a “true public servant” and that delivering Brexit is a hugely difficult task for anyone.  I want to pay tribute to the PM today. Delivering Brexit was always going to be a huge task, but one she met every day with courage &amp; resolve. NHS will have an extra £20bn thanks to her support, and she leaves the country safer and more secure. A true public servant. — Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) May 24, 2019 
The Conservative party hopes to find a new leader by the end of July, and Boris Johnson, Esther McVey, and Rory Stewart have all announced their intentions to run for the position along with Hunt.  Until then, May will still serve as Prime Minister and will host US President Donald Trump during his upcoming visit.

Rabat – The Ministry of Education, on Thursday, reiterated y its determination to continue dialogue with the labor unions representing contractual teachers. Despite the end of strikes and protests, the co-representatives of the contractual teachers appear to have refused to enter into further dialogue with the ministry. On Thursday, the Ministry issued a statement to express surprise at the decision of the major labor union representatives and the senior members of the Regional Academies of Education and Training (AREEF), to boycott  the meeting scheduled for yesterday, Thursday, May 23, “despite the various measures taken to hold this meeting.” In the statement, the Ministry also emphasized its commitment to “coordinate with the relevant government authorities to find the appropriate solutions.” The contractual teachers decided to suspend their strikes in April, stressing that the decision was for the benefit of their students and a desire to protect the rights of Moroccan students. In a  statement  issued by the National Coordination of the ‘Forcibly Contracted Teachers,” union representatives stressed the protests would be suspended only with the students’ needs in mind, while the teachers would wear black badges during working days to “mourn the dignity of teachers.’ The contractual teachers had been in a strike for nearly two months, protesting poor working conditions. The teachers, who described themselves as “forcibly contractual educators,”  due to a strategy put in place in 2016, by the Moroccan government to hire teachers under annually renewable contracts.  The teachers have been rallying in the street since February 20, demanding to be hired into the public sector. The contractual teachers also called for the abolishment of fixed-term contracts, calling for the end of “discrimination” between contractual teachers and public sector teachers. Following the decision to suspend the protests, the Moroccan government, especially the Ministry of Education vowed to facilitate dialogue with labor unions to meet their demands. Earlier in May, the Minister of Education, Said AMzazi also announced his decision to suspend all the administrative measures taken against the teachers.

Rabat – Moroccan security services have thwarted more than 30,000 irregular migration attempts in 2019, compared to 88,761 of foiled attempts in 2018. Spokesperson of the government, Mustapha El Khalfi, announced on Thursday that the decrease in the number of irregular migration attempts reflects the “great” effort of Morocco’s law enforcement forces against the issue of undocumented migration and the trafficking networks active in this area. El Khalfi met with the p after the weekly government council, telling them that the 2019 statistics were shared by the Ministry of Interior. The Minister added that the statistics “testify to the considerable efforts” made by Morocco to combat irregular migration networks, especially those active on the Morocco-Spain axis. Spain and Morocco have been facing considerable pressure on both sides of the axis due to the flow of irregular migrants.  The issue prompted the two countries to strengthen their cooperation to fight irregular migration networks. Spain has been a strong supporter of Morocco’s efforts on migration, repeatedly calling on the European Union to help the North African country in the Mediterranean. The European country also expressed satisfaction with Morocco’s efforts, emphasizing that the number of irregular migrants in Spain dropped by 52% from April 2018 to April 2019.  The Spanish Minister of Defense, Margarita Robles, lauded the cooperation between the two countries, saying that her country has  “full confidence” in the collaboration with Morocco. The Moroccan-Spanish collaboration has been reinvigorated in the last months, especially after the recent visits of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco in November 2018 and the Spanish royal family in February 2019. In a recent interview, Sanchez stressed the significance of the ties between his country and Morocco, saying that Morocco is a “special ally” for Spain. “Progress and prosperity in Morocco,” he said, are key to the stability of the region. During Thursday’s Press Conference, El Khalfi also commended Morocco’s strategy in handling the issue, emphasizing that “Morocco continues its policy of fighting [irregular] immigration with a humanitarian approach, noting that the Royal Navy has intensified its rescue operations of irregular  migrants, and, at the same time, “Morocco is implementing the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration adopted last December [2018] in Marrakech”

Rabat – The Moroccan statistics body High Commission for Planning (HCP) has released a report analyzing the demographic trends of the Maghreb region and their key influencing factors.  According to the report, between 1980 and 2018, the population of the Maghreb (Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya) doubled from 49.8 million people to 99.9 million people, with an average increase of 1.3 million people a year. Noting the population across the region will continue to increase, the report warns that the growth in population will place pressure on education, health, employment, housing, water and infrastructure resources across the region. It paints a bleak picture of the Maghreb in 2050, but concludes the best way forward is to invest in youth. While the Maghreb’s population is increasing, the rate of population growth is decreasing.  HCP finds that the key factors that have influenced the change in growth rates are a drop in mortality rate and birth rate due to changing social patterns. Providing figures on the child mortality rate in the Maghreb, the report notes that while the rate has decreased, with less children dying at birth (Tunisia has the lowest rate at 1.4%, and Mauritania the highest at 6.1%. Morocco sits at 1.8%), number are still well above European averages (Spain 0.23%, Portugal 0.16%, France 0.28%). HCP finds the Maghreb has also experienced a significant drop in birth rate in the last 50 years. In the 1960s and 1970s, women across the region were having on average 7 children, the report notes. In contrast, in 2018, women were having on average 2.6 children. According to the HCP, this drop is due to changes in marriage practices and the increasing use of contraception. Thirty years ago, women in the Maghreb were getting married on average around 18 to 21 years of age whereas in 2000, the average marriage age in the Maghreb was over 25 years old. Maghreb culture and religion do not permit sexual relationships or childbearing outside marriage, HCP notes. Therefore, any increase in the average age of marriage leads to a logical decrease in the childbirth rate, HCP concluded.  The report also identifies general changes to the role of women in Maghreb society, which paired with an increased use of contraception, all contribute to a drop in birth rate. HCP finds that family structures across the Maghreb have changed, with a shift towards smaller nuclear families, rather than the traditional extended family groups. The report concludes that based on past patterns, future generations will likely aspire to live in smaller, nuclear families. It warns this will likely lead to increased pressure on housing needs across the Maghreb region, and notes an urgent need for new housing infrastructure. HCP projects that the Maghreb’s population will grow to 131.9 million in 2050 (45.5 million in Morocco, up from 35 million in 2018) and that a key challenge for states will be the continued urbanization of the population. The report projects that by 2050, 79.9% of the population will be urbanized, with the highest rate of urbanization in Libya (88.4%), and the lowest in Mauritania (72.9%), with Morocco following next (73.6%). Between 1980 and 2018, the regional urban population tripled. HCP warns that future urbanization will require “colossal efforts” in relation to infrastructure, water, transport, health, and waste management to sustain the population. It will also require countries in the Maghreb to intervene to prevent the marginalization of urban populations due to poverty. The report warns of significant pressures on job markets, as between 2018 and 2030, 4 million new job seekers will be searching for work across the region. Referencing the increasing rate of university educated individuals, it warns the Maghreb will need to find avenues for its educated workforce. Aging population  The population in the Maghreb is aging quickly. The number of people over 60 years of age will almost triple by 2050 to 30.5 million. Countries will face increased pressure on retirement schemes. The report flags that, in 2018, only 20% of Moroccans over 60 received a pension, as opposed to 35% in Algeria and 38% in Tunisia. An aging population means that countries will need to increase spendings on health, the report notes, especially as nuclear families are less likely to look after older family members.  Countries will also have to shift their spending towards age-related pathologies (heart disease, diabetes, cancers, etc.) at the expense of addressing infectious diseases. HCP recognizes the brain drain is causing qualified workers from the Maghreb to migrate towards countries in Europe or elsewhere so that they might have a better chance with more professional opportunities. It warns countries to need to address the issue, particularly given that educated workers could represent a development potential for the region. It emphasizes that if the Maghreb does not make any efforts to maintain connections with its diaspora, workers might be absorbed into the overseas society they have moved to. With this, the Maghreb will lose any potential benefits. According to the HCP, the key solution to tackling demographic pressures across the Maghreb is to invest in youth. For HCP, the Maghreb’s first priority should be massive investments in education (particularly for girls and vulnerable youth), training, employment, social security and health of youth. It recommends that countries establish employment and training strategies to promote youth engagement and promote entrepreneurship. It concludes by noting that young people should be involved in decision making processes and the creation of any programs set up to meet their needs. Youth participation is, therefore, the key to addressing inevitable demographic pressures in the Maghreb.

Rabat – Morocco’s Council of Government adopted a new decree on “renewing the status of officers of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN)” on Thursday, May 23. The project, which was presented to the government council by the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Noureddine Boutayeb, is set to further the modernization and expansion process Moroccan police have actioned over the last decade. The move primarily aims to improve the financial conditions of security employees , government spokesperson Mustapha El khalfi said in a press conference after the council. According to El Khalfi, the project was prepared by DGSN leadership under “high royal instructions.” But, he noted, renewal of status implies that, in addition to improving the financial resources and working conditions of DGSN agents, there will be bold steps to renew and expand both the service’s personnel and response capabilities. Part of the new status pertains to facilitating both promotion and recruitment of DGSN agents, El Khalfi added. In terms of promotion, the bill envisages decreasing the level of seniority required to have access to promotion to the higher ranks. For the rank of police chief for example, qualified officers will take a national exam whose results will determine their fit for promotion. In response to surging security challenges, both at the national and international levels, the new project will ensure that DGSN officers are more responsive and better equipped in carrying out their duty. The news is the latest in a series of similar moves to modernize Morocco’s security forces. Despite its established reputation for domestic stability and successful anti-terrorism, Morocco under King Mohammed VI has multiplied efforts to stand out in the security field. Most recently, in April of this year, King Mohammed VI launched the construction of a new headquarters for DGSN. During his speech, the King emphasized the necessity of improving the police’s human and financial resources to assist them in providing quality security for the country. “They work day and night and are subject to tremendous pressure, as they are exposed to danger when they are on duty,” the King said, urging the government to “provide security authorities with the necessary human and material resources to enable them to carry out their duty properly.” Also behind multiplication of modernization and expansion projects is Morocco’s ambition to be a regional leader in the field of security, with the kingdom aspiring to export its model to other countries in Africa and the MENA region.

Rabat – Algeria’s dream of becoming a global leader in the phosphate market has been halted by the ongoing political headwinds facing the country’s political and business establishment. The Eastern phosphate cluster in the Tebassa region was projected to boost Algeria’s phosphate industry’s competitiveness in global and continental markets. According to latest developments, however, the project is on the brink of demise. Since the start of the ongoing anti-government fever, the project has seen succession of failures that have decidedly cooled investors’ enthusiasm. According to reports, interminable delays in the completion of facilities have raised questions about the effectiveness and use of the mega-project. On May 16, government-owned Algerian Energy Company (AEC) announced that no candidates have so far responded to the call for tenders which the Algerian government launched to attract foreign investors to the project’s construction phase. The lack of bidders to join the efforts of the Algerian government means that neither the fertilizer plant in Annaba, a seaport city in Northern Algeria, nor the desalination plant in Guerbes will be completed on schedule, AEC stated. It is even possible, AEC’s announcement ruefully conceded, that the project will not continue to completion. In addition to producing enough quality fertilizers for domestic farmers and providing employment opportunities to youth in the areas close to the plants, Algeria hoped to “compete with Morocco” in the global and continental phosphate markets. A $10 billion investment, the mega-project was expected to catapult Algeria among the world’s top fertilizer producers. By 2022, Algeria’s annual fertilizer output would jump exponentially from the current level of 1.5 tonne to 10 tonnes. Meanwhile, on the international trade front, the project would also make of Algiers a key player in the global market. Had the project been completed on schedule, projections for 2022 were for Algeria to export as many as 3 million tonnes of fertilizers, making the country a fierce competitor for Morocco’s OCP. There are many reasons behind the debacle, but observers point to the country’s current political situation as one important factor. While it is not clear whether all projections would have materialized as planned had the anti-government protests not erupted, the project’s general frame would not have been affected as it now is. Former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia is known to be one of the project’s most important sponsors. The Kouninef brothers (Reda, Karim, and Tarik), three of Algeria’s most powerful businessmen, are also considered to be the project’s godfathers. With the Kouninef brothers now in jail and Ouyahia sidelined from political power following the resignation of President Bouteflika, the mega-project’s chances of success are anything but certain. In a country where political and financial powers were personalized for decades under Bouteflika, it comes as little surprise that the symbolic demise of the project’s foremost sponsors would mean complete failure or at least a considerable setback. According to Francophone outlet Maghreb Confidentiel, Algeria’s mega-project was initially greeted with enthusiasm by the global business world. Construction and engineering giants like China’s CITIC had shown keen interest in the construction of the phosphate facilities. However, since the arrest of establishment politicians and businessmen who were the company’s main mouth-pieces in Algeria, enthusiasm for the company has waned considerably. Meanwhile, as the promise of Algerian phosphate project sinks, Morocco’s OCP continues to multiply successes, expand its global reach, and cement a working relationship with a number of governments across Africa. The company recently announced an overall increase in its revenues for the first quarter of 2019. On the African continent, the Moroccan giant is increasingly—and on many levels successfully—branding itself as an indispensable ingredient in Africa’s bid to attain food security and sustainable development.

Rabat – Morocco’s police in Marrakech arrested a Danish national who was the subject of an international wanted person notice. Interpol issued the notice against the 30-year old suspect on November 22, 2018, for alleged membership of a criminal network and serious assault, Maghreb Arab Press  (MAP) reported. The police arrested the suspect for his involvement in a fraud case on May 11. A statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) announced that the suspect is the subject of a red notice from interpol. The red notice was issued due to the suspect’s alleged involvement in a serious assault. The assault may have been a revenge attack instigated by criminal networks in Denmark.  Police have the suspect in custody, and have informed  Danish authorities of his arrest pending the review of the extradition procedure. The arrest made by DGSN is part of Morocco’s strategy to strengthen international cooperation mechanisms in the security sector. Earlier this month, DGSN announced that security services in Marrakech had arrested 13 international suspects between May 16, 2018 and May 2019. The Moroccan police also carried out 16 international arrest warrants during the same period. During DGSN’s 63rd anniversary last week,  police shared data showing that Moroccan law enforcement brought 61,278 people to justice during the same period, including 13,484 individuals involved in cases violent crime and 9,188 relating to criminal damage. The Moroccan police have carried out several operations, similar to the case of the Danish national, to arrest suspects under international search warrants. In addition to its strategy against international wanted suspects, Morocco is also involved in several counter-terrorism projects in collaboration with international governments.  The Moroccan police force are also working with international bodies on operations including tracking suspects involved in undocumented migration networks,  and the fight against illegal psychotropic drugs traffickers.

Rabat – According to a study from the High Planning Commission (HCP), the total population of the Maghreb region will increase from the current total of 100 million in 2018 to 132 million by 2050, a predicted growth of one million a year. The current population of the Maghreb region is mostly centered in Algeria and Morocco, accounting for 77 percent, and this will remain true in 2050. The study analyzed the three factors that have the most direct impact on population growth:  mortality, birth rate, and migration. The study credits the high birth rate in the region for the predicted population growth. If this figure is reached, the population of the Maghreb will account for 1.35% of the world in 2050 as opposed to the current 1.5%.  However, when solely looking at the demographics of the African continent, Maghreb representation will decrease from the current 7.8% to 5.2% by 2050 due to the population growth also predicted in other African regions. The study also assessed past population growth in the Maghreb region and found that between 1980 and 2018, the population of the Maghreb population doubled from 50 million to 100 million, an annual increase of 1.3 million inhabitants. The population growth may have detrimental effects on employment, protection of the elderly, urbanism, water, and health. It will also cause an increase in pollution, global warming and climate change.

Rabat – Other historical figures have been sadly left out of the limelight, leaving us ignorant of their stories and lasting influence. One such legend is Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi. Al-Fasi was welcomed by Pope Leo X at the Papal headquarters in Rome, having been captured in 1518 while returning home from Pilgrimage. “A man with art and knowledge is always welcomed among us, not as a servant but as a protector,” said Pope Leo X to Hasan al-Wazzan as a welcoming speech.   The description paints Hasan al-Wazzan as no average man, bestowing on the traveler his widely famous family name, Leo de’ Medici, as a show of respect and acceptance. The globetrotter name, thus, became ‘Leo Africanus.’ The name de Medici, Pope Leo’s surname, is famous in the city of Florence, Italy, and all over Europe. Hasan al-Wazzan is indeed a legendary character; a globetrotter, a geographer, an ambassador, a researcher, a writer, and a scholar. Hasan al-Wazzan or Leo Africanus was the subject of much research and study in the west. The research and studies were initiated by many orientalists, historians, and geography scholars, including Italian John Baptist Ramozia in his book, “Sailing and Traveling,” in more than one edition since 1550, the Russian Kratchovski in his book, “the history of Arabic Geographical Literature,” Canadian and American historian Natalie Zemon Davis, the German Detrick Richenberg, as well as French orientalists Guillaume Postel and Francois Poyon, just to name a few.  All those names, among many others, have spent decades studying and analyzing Leo Africanus’ personality and checking the accuracy of his manuscripts, as explored by the Italian Angela Kadatsi and Frederic Kristy. The date of birth of Hasan al-Wazzan is either 1483 or 1488 in Granada, Spain. He lived at a crossroads of historical events as he witnessed the middle ages, the birth of the Renaissance, the end of Muslim presence in Andalusia, the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims from the region, and the inquisition. This period was also the beginning of major geographical discoveries.  The renowned scholar also experienced the pain of separation from Andalusia and the migration to Fez or the kingdom of Morocco. He saw the rise and fall of dynasties and empires, witnessing the last days of the Mamluk in Egypt and the Al Watasi dynasty in Morocco, and watched the Ottoman empire take its place in history.  The religious philosopher saw, too, the Catholic Church struggle, the expansion of Martin Luther’s supporters (1482-1546) and Protestantism, and also King of France’s alliance with the Ottoman, and the fear of Pope Leo X of an Ottoman Islamic invasion from the south. Hasan al-Wazzan was a scholar who lived in many worlds as he accompanied a number of philosophers, geographers, and travelers. He studied at the Al Qarawiyyine University in Fez and the Vatican. He brought together mosques and churches and went to perform pilgrimage in Mecca, and lived in the Muslim southern Mediterranean, as well as in the Northern non-muslim regions, and married a Muslim woman. All these elements make al-Wazzan or Leo Africanus a character close to legend, which led some Orientalists to question the credibility of his life, works, and manuscripts, especially his book, “The Description of Africa” which had 8 different editions. The author of “Sailing and Trekking,” Batiste Ramouzio, has even sent a letter to his friend, Hironimous Frakstoro, in which he admitted having to change the text for translation on purpose and make shortcuts to reduce translation costs, which caused him to alter and delete many paragraphs. The location of the Arabic version of the book is another mystery, with some speculating that it can be found in Morocco, and others wondering if it was lost during the move of the Jean Vincenzo library from Venice to Napoli at the beginning of the 17th century. Others believe that he took it with him to Tunisia in 1527. According to a study conducted by Italian historian and orientalist Giorgio Levi Della Vida within the Vatican library in 1939, Hasan al-Wazzan was collaborating with Monk Ilias Bin Brahim al Maroni, who is a great calligrapher and master of Latin, Italian, and Arabic. Al Maroni was brought to the Vatican from Lebanon in 1515 by the Pope Leo X. In the Italian version of the book, “The Description of Africa,” Al Maroni speaks Italian and Arabic as a native speaker, but Al Wazzan was a beginner in the Italian language and did not master it as Al Maroni had. German orientalist Detrich Rosenberg conducted an extensive study about the conditions and ambiguities of writing in “The Description of Africa,” and shed light on a number of factual and historical misconceptions related also to the translation and the veracity of the manuscripts. Leo Africanus is a Moroccan personality who was influenced by the world and, in turn, left his mark in it. There is still uncertainty as to whether he died in Tunisia or Morocco. The uncertainty stretches to his religion and whether he renounced Islam to convert to Christianity, as well as whether it was an obligation or a choice, although his decision to flee to Tunisia suggests that he was under duress.  The location of the Arabic version of his book is still unknown, even though his book was a scientific reference to the West for more than 500 years and helped them to invade Africa. Was his extensive knowledge and scientific genius a threat to the powers of the time? In whose interest was it to bury the truth about a man who so impacted the world? Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi is, undoubtedly, an impressive figure in world history, but he is not the only Moroccan to deserve a place there. The success and distinction of Moroccans living abroad are thanks to the natural accumulation of Moroccan identity through our history.  Moroccans’ integration, distinction, and social and professional prominence in foreign societies of multiple languages, religions, and ethics did not come from nothing. It is a natural extension to the diversity of the Moroccan personality, which encourages shedding light on other Moroccan legends who have influenced the world.

Rabat –  Moroccan astronomer Abdelaziz Kharbouch Al Ifrani has announced that the sighting of the crescent of Shawwal, the tenth month in the Islamic calendar, will be  possible in all Arab and most Islamic countries on Ramadan 29, 1440 (June 4). The astronomer told Morocco World News that the first day of Shawwal will be on June 5, marking the first day of Eid Al Fitr in Morocco. Eid Al Fitr or “Feast of breaking the fast” in English will be celebrated among Muslims worldwide. Al Ifrani, whose previous predictions for Ramadan and other religious celebrations have all been correct to date, said that sighting of the moon with the naked eye will not be possible on June 3.  It is possible that other Arab countries will also celebrate Eid Al Fitr on June 5. The International Astronomical Centre (IAC) has also said that  the crescent in Arab countries will not be visible on June 3.   Sighting the crescent moon with a naked eye will be possible on June 4 in most Arab nations. The astronomer shared his calculations with Morocco World News before Ramadan, emphasizing that the north African country would celebrate the first day of the holy month on May 7. He was later proved right by The Moroccan  Ministry of Islamic Affairs. Other countries started Ramadan on May 6. Countries that started fasting on May 6 will complete  30 days of fasting, while others who started on May 7 will complete 29 days in Ramadan. Muslims worldwide begin the celebration with Eid prayers at dawn in mosques across the globe. Morocco usually gives a three-day holiday for the celebration, it is a time when families visit each other. After the eid prayer, families gather around a table full of various Moroccan pastries, cakes ,and breads, accompanied by mint tea, milk, and coffee.

Rabat – The online community for expats, InterNations.com published data revealing that Morocco is one of the worst countries for  internet connection. Method The data has been collected from the perspective of expats, as these are immigrants who typically need to communicate with their families at home, work digitally, maintain professional and personal contacts worldwide, and keep up-to-date with international news. For a country to be featured in the rankings, the first requirement was a substantial sample size of at least 75 survey participants per destination. In 2018, researchers had a minimum of only 68 participants and still ended up with a total of 18,135 expatriates contributing to the survey, meaning 178 nationalities living in 187 countries or territories were represented. Survey respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with the following factors on a scale of one to seven: Morocco When the results were calculated, the countries were then sorted by their total scores, ranking them into five categories. With the 1st category being the best and the 5th being the absolute worst, Morocco is in the 4th. “Ranking a low 58th place for digital life overall, Morocco is among the worst ten countries in the world for the ease of getting high-speed internet access at home,” the study says. Morocco came in the top ten for getting a local mobile number (10th exactly), but the bottom ten for availability of government services online (63rd). Morocco was also in the bottom for high-speed internet at home (59th out of 68), paying without cash (66th), but relatively average for unrestricted access to online services. In more detail, 56% of expats are unsatisfied with the access to government services online (vs. 26% globally), and one in five (or 20%) is unhappy with the availability of high-speed internet at home (vs. 16% globally). Over nine in ten expats (94%) say getting a local number is easy, which is “eight percentage points above the global average” (which is 86%). Over seven in ten expats (71%) even agree that it is very easy. The best and the worst Other countries sharing negative ratings as the worst countries for digital life are Myanmar, China, Egypt, India, and the Philippines. “Expats in these countries struggle with a lack of government services online, difficult access to high-speed internet at home, or even restrictions in their use of online services,” the report explains. “Destinations such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Brazil, which have always ranked among the worst countries for quality of life, could not change their position in light of poor results in the Digital Life subcategory,” the report reads. In the 3rd category, Kenya was ranked as the best African country to be connected and almost nine in 10 expats there are satisfied with their unrestricted access to online services, which ranks above the global average. The best of the best is Estonia “These excellent results help the country compensate its low rankings in terms of available leisure options (51st) and travel opportunities (65th): all in all, Estonia comes in a good 21st place out of 68 countries for its general quality of life.”

Rabat – In the months following the horrific Christchurch attacks in March, which claimed the lives of 51 Muslims in New Zealand, there have been a number of high-profile threats and discriminatory actions committed against Muslims in the United States. Last month, on April 29, a mosque was ransacked and several Qurans were destroyed in Queens, New York, when a man broke into a mosque in a hate-fueled rage. Earlier this month, on May 15, a fire tore through a mosque in New Haven, Connecticut, leaving significant damage to the property, though no injuries were reported. This week, on May 21, a man was arrested in Miami Gardens, Florida, after threatening to “kill Muslims one by one” on social media. These attacks have been part of an alarming surge in hatred against minorities in the United States, which has been steadily increasing since 2015, according to Abbas Barzegar, the national research and advocacy director at the Council on American-islamic Relations (CAIR). Although we are less than halfway into 2019, CAIR has already tracked over 500 incidences of anti-Muslim bias, and the organization believes that these alarming numbers are only the tip of the iceberg. “We’ve already reported over 500 incidences of anti-Muslim bias or harassment just this year so far,” Barzegar said. “That’s very preliminary reporting. I know a number of our chapters have not filed their reports yet… I believe that’s a very low estimate already of what’s happening across the country.” Hatred on the rise According to CAIR reports, anti-Muslim bias and discrimination experienced a “demonstrable uptick” leading up to the 2016 Presidential Elections in the United States. Donald Trump’s campaign, Barzegar claimed, capitalized on this increase in Islamophobia and perpetuated the growth of anti-Muslim bias. “It was the rhetoric coming out of Trump’s campaign that certified that,” Barzegar said.  “We started to see things in Trump’s campaign, rhetoric-wise, that was typically very far off on the margins: things you would find on far-right radio or the outskirts of the internet. Now it’s becoming so acceptable and mainstream.” Both prior to and throughout his presidency, Donald Trump’s use of hate as a weapon has allowed for fringe white supremacist and far-right groups to bring their ideologies to the forefront of political discussion. Among the president’s most controversial statements are his claims that he witnessed Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the September 11 attacks and that “Islam hates us.” He has also considered creating a database for all Muslims in the United States and preventing Muslims from entering the country. However, perhaps his most controversial and egregious statement has been shutting down mosques across the country, a clear violation of religious freedom and human rights. Despite these attempts at inspiring fear, Muslims across the United States have refused to be terrified into silence.  Following the Christchurch shooting, mosques across New Zealand and the rest of the world were especially crowded, while the arson attempt in New Haven did not prevent Muslims from gathering for prayer just a few hours after the fire had started. “What I’m seeing is that people are hopeful, they’re strong, they’re determined, and they’re not fearful,” Barzegar said. “There’s a solemness there, there’s a melancholy, there might be some anxiety, but there isn’t fear.

Rabat – The Libyan people have already had to bury several hundred of their countrymen since conflict flared up in the country’s northwestern region earlier this year in April. Meanwhile, hospitals are flooded with thousands of the injured, caught in the middle of routine shelling and firefights in the area. Ambulances carrying injured civilians and detention camps filled with refugees have become targets for attack as the country descends towards civil war, with the international community’s attempts at a peaceful resolution being rejected by both sides of the conflict. The men, women and children trapped within the Libyan capital of Tripoli continue to live under siege as neither side of the conflict is willing to work towards a ceasefire, or to make any attempts at ending the bloodshed to preserve the lives of their neighbors. While meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, the turncoat military commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Khalifa Haftar, expunged any possibility for hostilities to end with a peaceful ceasefire. “When the question of the ceasefire was put on the table, Haftar’s reaction to this was to ask: ‘negotiate with whom for a ceasefire today’,” a French presidential official said. Haftar has long styled the military campaign as a crusade against extremist militants within the Libyan government, and has ruled out the idea of a ceasefire until Tripoli is liberated from militants that had “infested” the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). Meanwhile, Fayez al-Sarraj, the prime minister of the GNA, has also refused to consider a ceasefire until Haftar’s forces have retreated from Tripoli and ended the offensive in northwestern Libya. “The request for a ceasefire in Tripoli must be accompanied by the return of those who have attacked to where they came from,” al-Sarraj said to a group of Libyan ambassadors on Thursday. Al-Sarraj also cast doubt upon the strength and legitimacy of Haftar’s forces, arguing that the GNA were defending against the very militants Haftar claims to be combating. “What is being defined as an army, led by Haftar, is actually a motley mix of religious, tribal, and regional groups, and of criminal militias,” Sarraj said. “Haftar believed that entering Tripoli was going to be a walk in the park, thanks to the military support received, but it’s a dream he will never reach.” Haftar’s forces remain entrenched in Tripoli’s southern suburbs by loyalist militants aligned with the GNA, and this stalemate will seemingly perpetuate further bloodshed until a resolution is reached. An irreconcilable stalemate With both sides refusing to negotiate for peace, the innocents caught in the crossfire have been deprived of any opportunity to put an end to the harrowing conditions within the capital. Haftar has maintained his unwillingness to negotiate with what he perceives as a government controlled by terrorist militias and so long as negotiations are off the table, the siege of Tripoli will continue. “[Haftar] considers that the GNA is completely infested by militias and it is not for him to negotiate with representatives of these militias,” the French official said on Thursday. Meanwhile, the government of al-Sarraj has no intentions of collaborating with the LNA until Haftar has pulled his forces back from Tripoli and retreated to their pre-offensive territory, even as his citizens are subjected to daily shelling and nightmarish violence. While forces under Haftar and al-Sarraj remain entrenched in a desperate stalemate at the banks of Tripoli, the two leaders continue to be uncompromising in their resolve and unwilling to be dissuaded by rising casualties in the city. Meanwhile, the international community’s fears of an impending full-scale civil war have become reinforced as an escalation in the conflict looms over the horizon with each day that a ceasefire is not signed.

Rabat – Moroccan footballer Soufiane Boufal, who plays with Spanish club Celta Vigo, has been crowned best dribbler in Spain’s La Liga football league for the 2018/2019 season, outperforming Lionel Messi. With 144 successful dribbles, Celta de Vigo’s Boufal is ahead of Messi (133) and Eibar’s Fabian Orellana (81). Although Boufal made the most dribbles this year, he only scored three goals and made three assists. The 25-year-old attacking midfielder, who was born in Paris, joined the Celta de Vigo football club in western Spain, on a loan from English club Southampton. According to a report from Spanish media outlet Faro de Vigo, Celta Vigo is willing to permanently sign Boufal and will have to negotiate a fee of €15 million, as the club agreed with Southampton last summer.   Celta de Vigo is currently in 17th place out of 20 teams in La Liga’s standings. Boufal made his debut with the Moroccan national team in March 2016 in a 1-0 Africa Cup of Nations qualification victory over Cape Verde. He also made two appearances with the Moroccan team in 2017 in friendly matches against Tunisia and Burkina Faso.

Rabat – This week, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) designated the Moroccan Agency of Nuclear and Radiological Safety and Security (AMSSNuR) as the first African IAEA Capacity Building Center (CBC) for Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR). With this new building included, there are now seven centers worldwide. The IAEA is an “autonomous intergovernmental organization dedicated to increasing the contribution of atomic energy to the world’s peace and well-being and ensuring that agency assistance is not used for military purposes.” The Agency is the world’s “Atoms for Peace” organization under the United Nations. Its other centers are located in China, Russia, the Republic of Korea, Japan (Chiba Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture), and Austria (headquarters). The IAEA Capacity Building Center for Emergency Preparedness and Response promotes expert “radiological EPR education, training, knowledge management and networking and human resource development.” More than ten countries including the United States, Brazil, Spain, and Egypt are also applying to hold centers. The Moroccan EPR CBC will hold IAEA-approved training workshops and events for Morocco and other African countries to “strengthen their national EPR capacities,” according to the press release on the site. The Center will be a resource for the IAEA safety standards and the IAEA’s EPR publications, including lectures and practical demonstrations. IAEA Deputy Director General Juan Carlos Lentijo, Head of the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security, and Khammar Mrabit, Director General of the AMSSNuR signed for the building on May 21 in Vienna. “The IAEA appreciates the willingness of AMSSNuR to expand the IAEA’s network of CBCs for EPR,” said Director Lentijo. “With this signing, we strengthen our cooperation to build EPR expertise in Africa.”

Rabat – For the holy month of Ramadan in Marrakech this week, Muslims prayed in front of the Torah, before the Jewish Holy Ark of Beth-El. This meeting of religions happened as the Beth-El synagogue hosted iftar, allowing Jews and Muslims to break the fast together on May 21. About 220 people gathered in the synagogue whose name translates as “house of God.” In Morocco, while Islam is the official religion, all Abrahamic faiths are present. Jews and Muslims breaking bread together during Ramadan is a result of King Mohammed VI’s policies, which actually “encourage more and more meetings between different religions and children of Abraham, the repair of old synagogues, the restoration of all these old Jewish mellahs.” Together, the two communities share Moroccan culture. “After the prayer, we blessed Morocco and especially King Mohammed VI and his family. Then we went out for a wonderful dinner, ” said Jacky Kadoch, president of the Jewish community of Marrakech. ”A pure happiness to be together, for a dinner shared with family, which was not official,” said Jacky Kadoch. “This is the third year that we are organizing an event during Ramadan.” “A few minutes later, there is prayer. Since ftour was in the big courtyard of the synagogue, I spontaneously proposed to the imam who was present if he wanted to perform the prayer inside the synagogue. What he accepted with a lot of enthusiasm,” said the president of the Jewish community. The evening was peaceful. Jacky Kadoch added, “There are tensions. Sometimes, we look at the Jewish community from another angle because unfortunately there is this concern that we all experience and feel, the Palestinian question, for which we pray every day for it to be arranged, so that all world finds a space to live serenely.”

Rabat – The Moroccan public prosecutor of the Court of First Instance agreed to take the necessary legal proceedings against the man who burned 40 live stray cats to death, in the Western Moroccan city of Safi. The first of its kind in the history of Morocco, the legal case was brought before court following a lawsuit filed by the international animal rights non-profit Comme Chat et Chien (CCC) association (Like Cat and Dog), which appointed one of its own lawyers to the case. According to the secretary general of the NGO Youssra El Hachimi, the cat-killer used to train his dogs to attack cats, which left many cats injured and sometimes killed as a result. There are legal loopholes regarding the punishment of crimes against stray animals in the Moroccan penal code. The laws that protect animal rights  concern pets and household animals.  This has not stopped Moroccan authorities from taking legal measures against such horrendous acts. Adamant that justice must and will be served, the association launched a petition that called on the Ministry of Justice to investigate what it called a “massacre against poor animals” as well as calling on Moroccan citizens to sympathize.

In April, Senegalese football legend El Hadji Diouf expressed hope that Senegal would win the tournament, but acknowledged the presence of strong teams, such as Morocco.  “I hope they win the title as there are many other good teams -Egypt will be at the forefront with Morocco and Nigeria.” The head coach of the Nigerian football team, Gernot Rohr, also placed Morocco among his favorites to win along with Egypt. The most recent statement came from the manager of Cameroonian football team, Clarence Seedorf, who said that Morocco are one of the favorites to win the CAN otherwise known as AFCON. “Ending up with the same points as Morocco, who are one of the favorites to win the AFCON, with only two goals difference says a lot about how we performed and prepared for the other games.”

Rabat – The International Union of Muslim Scholars called on Saudi Arabia to rescind the death sentence of three prominent Islamic figures. The union issued a statement on Wednesday, May 22, stating their “mounting concerns” over the imminent execution planned in Saudi Arabia. After media reports about the beheading of three renowned, moderate intellectuals and scholars, namely Salman al-Awdah, Awad Al-Qarni, and Ali al Omari, which Saudi Arabia has not yet officially denied, the union has called the possible Saudi move a crime. The three scholars were arrested in September 2017 on terrorism-related charges. Media outlets have reported that Saudi authorities plan to carry out the beheadings following the holy month of Ramadan. The Union also urged Egypt and the United Arab Emirates to release all “prisoners of conscience,” urging the international community to take a stand against the crackdown on political dissent seen in the region. The recent operation in Saudi Arabia to wipe-out dissidents and opposing voices has drawn condemnation from international human rights organizations.  In late April, Human Rights Watch decried the mass executions of 37 men, the majority of whom were Shia Muslims, a minority in Saudi Arabia. In 2019,  beheadings in Saudi Arabia amounted to more than 100 executions. Members of the condemned scholar Al Awda’s family reported to HRW that Saudi Arabia has issued travel bans on 17 of al Awda’s family members following his arrest. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, called on Saudi Arabia to release the detainees as a “refreshing step” to show that King bin Salman wants a new Saudi Arabia. The call has also drawn sympathy from social media users who deployed hashtags calling out Saudi Arabia for represssing freedom of speech.

Rabat – A 14-year-old female student in the Lamjaara commune of Ouezzane, Morocco was verbally and physically assaulted by a bus driver who accused her of eating during Ramadan.  The driver also spread rumors to other students and parents that the child ate during the day because she identified as an atheist. Little did he know, the student was on her period, meant that she was allowed to postpone her fast. The girl was just leaving the bus when the driver became “physically and verbally abusive, addressing all kinds of insults,” according to a statement in the Ouezzane section of the Moroccan League for the Defense of Human Rights (LMDH). The victim was targeted by these “extremist elements,” as LMDH puts it. The student is now being protected by her parents, who have filed a complaint with the Royal Gendarmerie.

Rabat – The Sahrawi Association for the Defense of Human Rights (ASADH) issued a statement lauding Spain’s highest court’s decision, to extend the period of the investigation into four Algerians and 23 Polisario members. The 23 individuals are accused of serious human rights violations against Sahrawis in Tindouf, Algeria. “We express … our full confidence in justice to end the case so that the guilty parties are brought to justice and convicted for the serious crimes they are accused of,” said the ASADH. “Human rights are not forgotten and there is no impunity for those involved in these atrocities committed in clandestine prisons of Polisario near the Algerian city of Tindouf,” added the statement. The list of the separatists accused of involvement in human rights violations includes the leader of the Polisario Front, Ibrahim Ghali. In 2007, the Spanish court heard a complaint against Ghali, which included accusations of “torture, genocide, and detention.”  In 2016, Spain highest court  (Audiencia Nacional)ordered the reopening of the case, in which Ghali is accused of involvement in genocide, murder, torture and disappearances against Sahrawi activists, when he was the chief of the “Sahrawi army”  from 1978-1991. One of the victims, according to El Diario, was imprisoned for six years (1974- 1980). The complainant, according to the news outlet, recognizes Ghali as one of the members who allegedly tortured six people. Six other Algerian citizens and Polisario members were also involved in the abuse. Members of the Polisario Front were also allegedly involved in committing terror attacks against Spanish citizens at the Phosboucraa site, Laayoune in October 1974. Polisario’s attacks on the phosphate conveyor belts occurred in Laayoun, southern Morocco between 1974 and 1976. The members of the front attacked the conveyor belts in an attempt to stop phosphate mining.  In January 2018, Spanish monarch Felipe VI received Lucia Jimenez, the President of Canarian Association of Terrorism Victims (Acavite), who informed him of the attacks committed by the separatist group against Spanish citizens.

Rabat – Last year, FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced that plans to expand the World Cup to 48 teams could be brought forward from the initially scheduled completion in 2026; however, these plans may have been too ambitious and FIFA has announced that it will not be proceeding with the expansion. “We have to see if it is possible, if it is feasible. We are discussing with our Qatari friends, we are discussing with our many other friends in the region and we hope that this can happen,” Infantino said. “And, if not, we will have tried. We will have tried because we always have to try to do things in a better way.” After further consideration, FIFA has concluded that there would not enough time to complete “a detailed assessment of the potential logistical impact” of expanding the tournament. As a result, the plans have been tossed aside and the tournament will proceed with the standard 32 team lineup. “Qatar had always been open to the idea of an expanded tournament in 2022 had a viable operating model been found and had all parties concluded that an expanded 48-team edition was in the best interest of football and Qatar as the host nation,” Qatari World Cup organizers said in a statement. “With just three and a half years to go until kick off, Qatar remains as committed as ever to ensuring the 32-team Fifa World Cup in 2022 is one of the best tournaments ever and one that makes the entire Arab world proud.” Despite Infantino’s early optimism, the ambitious plans to expand the tournament would have likely been plagued with difficulties from the beginning. Aside from obvious time constraints, Qatar’s hostile relations with its neighbors would have also posed major problems to the plan’s implementation, as it would have been necessary for Qatar to share hosting duties with other nations in the region. The ongoing blockade against Qatar by its neighbors Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE would have likely caused major setbacks for the plans and could have jeopardized Qatar’s aims of hosting a smoothly run tournament. With the plans canceled, the Qatari World Cup organizers may breathe again and proceed with preparations for 2022, while FIFA may use the coming years to properly reform FIFA tournament procedures and open the World Cup to more teams in 2026.

Rabat – Madonna made shockwaves at this year’s Eurovision in Tel Aviv when her backup dancers displayed Palestinian and Israeli flags on their costumes. The dancer who donned the Palestinian flag, Norwegian-Moroccan Mona Bernstein, was allegedly interrogated by airport security for over an hour. The dancer took to Instagram to explain the tense situation that unfolded in the hours that followed the performance. However, the post was swiftly deleted.  It is important to note that Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv routinely operates strict passport control, and extensively questions all travelers boarding flights out of Israel in the manner they did Bernstein. The post read: “Thank you Madonna for having me as part of your statement, and for having me carry the Palestinian flag in front of the hundreds and millions of viewers. Unfortunately, the suppression in the West Bank is real.”  “The hours following yesterday’s show have been intense, but never had I imagined feeling monitored in the way I was,” Bernstein explained. Israeli authorities reportedly proceeded to thoroughly interrogate Bernstein for an hour and a half. The questions ranged from “Having to tell my whole life story, my reasons for having traveled to Arabic countries throughout my life, my religious relations, my family matters, showing my detailed daily schedules for my stay,” to “having to explain exactly what I did and where I went last time I was in Jerusalem three years ago.” “All presumably for carrying a flag as part of a performance making a statement about a current conflict, to promote peace, unity, and freedom.” “I can’t even imagine the monitoring and suppression the Palestinian people are facing on a daily basis,” the dancer added. Eurovision has been marred by controversy and protests this year due to their choice of Israel as a host country, with many public figures calling for a boycott of the event. Icelandic group Hatari made a similar gesture to Madonna’s, raising Palestinian flags during their appearance at the competition in Israel, causing audible gasps. Palestinian Campaign For The Academic And Cultural Boycott Of Israel (PACBI) released a statement in response to the gestures, saying the most meaningful thing the performers could have done is boycott the event completely and the gesture “cannot offset the harm they do to our human rights struggle by balancing their complicit act with some project with the Palestinians.”

Station F in Paris is the largest campus dedicated to start-up businesses in the world, fostering innovation and supporting entrepreneurs with their projects through its acceleration programs. The campus covers an area of 34,000 square meters, and includes over 3000 workstations as well as conference spaces, cafés and restaurants. Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy wants to bring a similar innovation hub to Morocco. “The National Digital Agency will look in to this project with those in charge of Station F in Paris,” Elalamy stated at the annual Vivatech conference in Paris last week.  While the time frame for the project is unclear, according to Moroccan newspaper L’Economiste, the Moroccan Station F will eventually bring together thousands of start-ups, from Morocco and the rest of Africa. It will provide financial assistance to entrepreneurs, and will also provide business skills training, like when and how to raise funds for a project. The aim is to support a strong start-up environment in order to “move towards accelerated digital industrialization,” explained Elalamy. The Station F project would fit in with Morocco’s broader technology strategy. In 2017, the Ministry of Industry set up the Digital Development Agency (ADD) to support the development and implementation of technology in public administrations, as well as in the private sector.  This year the ADD brought 16 Moroccan start-ups to the Vivatech conference in Paris, raising Morocco’s profile in the international tech industry, and highlighting the country’s technological potential. Vivatech is an annual international technology exhibition bringing together more than 9000 start-ups and 1900 investors from all over the world. It is the second time Morocco has attended the event. ADD also brought 16 start-ups to the conference last year.

New public buses are coming to Rabat in July, and many of these may be driven by women.  This does not mean that women-only buses are coming to Rabat, as was rumored by a number of news sources today.  Public transport company Alsa-City Bus will launch operations in July 2019 in the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region. Three hundred and fifty new buses will hit the roads, replacing the existing fleet run by Stareo, a company who has been in financial difficulty for some time. Moroccan recruitment company Anapec is advertising for 80 female bus driver positions. “Alsa-City Bus approached us with their recruitment needs, and I personally suggested they recruit women for the role,” Anapec’s director Souad Bouhanezi told Morocco World News. “We have put out the offers and are now collecting applications,” she added. Anapec has also set up a training program, so that women who are interested in the role but don’t fully meet the criteria can obtain the required qualifications, Bouhazeni explained.  This way, she adds, Moroccan women are able to access jobs that until now have been mainly carried out by men. “[Alsa-City Bus] is a commendable organization,” she concludes. Moroccan recruitment company Sforhet is also recruiting 100 female bus drivers for the Rabat-Salé-Temara region. When contacted by Morocco World News, Sforhet was not able to disclose the employer. The recruitment of female bus drivers has prompted rumours about whether Rabat wants to introduce women-only buses.  The “pink bus” initiative was first mentioned in 2017 by the mayor of Rabat Mohamed Sadiki, to curb sexual harassment of women on public transport. But the initiative did not gain momentum. According to Abdelilah Mahdani, recruitment advisor at Anapec, the recruitment of female bus drivers has nothing to do with “women-only buses”. “It’s not for pink buses. It’s for Alsa-City Bus,” he said. Lahcen Elomrani, adjunct mayor of Rabat confirmed this morning that the City of Rabat will not have a “women-only” bus.  “The city of Rabat does not intend to introduce women-only buses,” Elomrani told Moroccan newspaper Media24. When contacted by Morocco World News, the City of Rabat was not available for further comment.

Rabat – A new report from the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recognized a shortage in production during the 2019 harvest season. The report issued on May 21 predicts an unfavorable harvesting season in the second half of May due to the irregular rainfall in Morocco this year. The report said that the season began with a good start when the above average precipitation across the principal arable production areas between September and December provided abundant moisture for early planting in October. Irregular rainfall, however, affected wheat growth and “decreased yield potential” between January and March. Morocco has witnessed a week of  continuous rainfall across the country, but it was too late for  “production recovery.” The report said that the overall area of planted winter cereals reached 4.7 million hectares in 2018. “Given the low rainfall amounts and the general expectations of low yields, farmers refrained from the mid-season application of plant protection materials and fertilizers,”  the report said. In April, Morocco’s Agriculture Ministry acknowledged that “the agricultural production season will be average only for the three types of cereals.” The ministry announced that  Morocco recorded 284 millimeters of rainfall as of April, a 12% decrease from a normal year, and dams are at 59% capacity. The report announced that Morocco is expecting a lower cereal production in 2019. “The Government’s preliminary forecasts from late April 2019 point to a cereal production of about 6.4 million tonnes, more than one-third lower than the previous year’s exceptional harvest of 10.5 million tonnes and about 25 percent below average.” The document also emphasized that the wheat imports in Morocco will increase in the 2019/2020 season due to the limited domestic production.  FAO indicated that Morocco is heavily relying on wheat imports in order to meet “its consumption needs.” “Cereal import requirements in the 2019/20 marketing year (July/June) are forecast at 8.2 million tonnes, almost 30 percent more than in 2018/19 and about 15 percent above average.” The report forecast an increase of wheat imports, stating that it is expected to increase from 3.3 million tons in 2018/2019 to about 4.7 million tons this season. “The European Union and Black Sea countries supply most of the common “soft” wheat, while Canada is the traditional supplier of “durum” wheat.”

Rabat – The Provincial Court of Huelva has ordered the reopening of the case of Moroccan seasonal workers, who accused their managers of sexual assaults last year during strawberry picking season in Huelva, Spain. Spanish news outlet El Pais reported that a court closed the case in December 2018, without the judge hearing the complainants. The case of Moroccan seasonal farmers dates back to  2018, when a group of Moroccan female farmers filed complaints against some managers for alleged sexual assault and abuse. On May 2, German investigative NGO Correctiv published a story in collaboration with RTL Nachtjournal and Buzzfeed News on Moroccan female agricultural workers in Spain and in Morocco’s Souss Massa region in the south. In the report, women claimed that they were harassed, verbally and physically abused, and raped in the fields. Morocco’s Minister of Employment Mohamed Yatim, however, said that there were no official reports of “sexual harassment” against women in Huelva. a Moroccan-Spanish delegation also carried out a visit on May 10-11, 2018 in the province of Huelva to investigate about the conditions of women farmers on Spanish farms. Following the visit, the ministry of employment issued a statement, refuting claims that Moroccan seasonal agricultural workers in Spain were being harassed. The ministry also explained that the working conditions of Moroccan women workers are in conformity with the employment contract concluded between the two parties. In November 2018, a Moroccan delegation from the Ministry of Labor and one from the National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (ANAPEC) paid a two-day visit to Huelva, where Moroccan seasonal workers work on farms during harvest. The delegations aimed to prepare for the next campaign to recruit Moroccan seasonal workers for strawberry farms, according to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). The Moroccan and Spanish officials agreed on the need to set conditions for the success of the recruiting operation to ensure the best conditions for Moroccan workers.

Rabat – Morocco’s OCP Group has announced that its revenues for the first quarter of 2019 have reached MAD 12,521 ($ 1.31 billion), up from MAD 10,419 million or $ 1.13 billion in the same period in 2018. The group said that its  earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) reached 4,364 million Dirhams (US$ 456 million), against MAD 2,516 million Dirhams ($ 273 million) in the first quarter of 2018. EBITDA margin increased to 35% from 24% in last year’s first quarter, according to OCP’s press release quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). OCP said that the notable performance stems from a substantial increase in the amount of acid and fertilizers the company has so far produced this year.  OCP added that its gross margin was  42% to MAD 9,003 million Dirhams or $ 942 million against MAD 6,354 million ($ 690 million) last year. The gross margin performance  reflects a “favorable product mix and higher revenues, while raw material prices were stable for sulfur and lower for ammonia,” OCP noted. The group’s first quarter operating profit also reached MAD 2,536 million ($ 265 million), up from MAD 1,158 million ($ 126 million) during the same period in 2018. OCP said that market conditions in the first quarter were in line with its expectations in terms of price fluctuations, MAP added. “Demand from India remained somewhat stronger than anticipated despite high inventory levels; European demand recovered from last year’s lows, and there was a modest uptick in imports to Brazil. Conversely, adverse weather conditions affecting the Spring planting season have kept North American inventories high,” the press release added. OCP announced a successful performance on the supply side, emphasizing that Chinese exports “increased year-on-year tied to lower domestic consumption.” The company added that the EBITDA margin continued to “benefit from the Company’s industrial flexibility across the value chain, which drove favorable product mix and from its commercial agility that positions OCP as a key global supplier across all major importing continents.” OCP, which is the largest phosphate producer in the world, has approximately 21,000 employees. The company also contributes to regional development in several sectors, including mining and fertilizer operations, as well as through its sustainability program.  OCP in Morocco’s South-South agenda On the continental front, the company is increasingly establishing itself as a driver of growth and intra-African food security program.  Since February 2016, when the Moroccan officially launched its African venture with a dozens of branches in sub-Saharan Africa under the banner OCP Africa, it has landed important agricultural contracts with a number of African governments.  The contracts mostly include projects to provide adequate fertilizers to African farmers on the basis of soil type in their regions as well as conventions to assist governments in the construction of fertilizer plants.   Most recently, OCP Africa announced an ongoing project to launch an African platform for digitized agriculture.  According to OCP, the push towards Africa is part of part of the plan to accompany Morocco’s vision of increased intra-African exchanges to reach food security and sustainable development on the continental level.

Rabat – Said El Mejdani, a computer science teacher in Canada’s Westwood High School, has recently been awarded with the ‘Prime Minister’s Teaching Award for Teaching Excellence,’ announced the Fort McMurray Public School District (FMSPD) in a press release, on May 21.  El Mejdani is expected to be officially presented with the award on May 28, added the same source. “I am very honoured to receive this award, especially being nominated by this wonderful group of former students, colleagues and community members. It’s humbling to see our approach to teaching computer science and our student success highlighted by this award,” stated El Mejdani. “The Prime Minister’s Awards for Teaching Excellence have honoured exceptional elementary and secondary school teachers in all disciplines since 1994, with over 1,600 teachers honoured to date,” said the Government of Canada on its website.  Recipients of the award are “honoured for their remarkable achievements in education and for their commitment to preparing their students for a digital and innovation-based economy,” added the same official source. El Mejdani made headlines last year when his Westwood high school students scored the highest marks, 90/90, on a computing and coding competition at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The students attributed their success to their teacher El Mehdani’s effective teaching methods.

Rabat – It has been less than a month since Sound Energy PLC first announced successful gas testing in the TE-10 well in eastern Morocco and received a gas deal proposal from the Moroccan power firm the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE). Judging from its latest press release, however, the future for the company may be grim after an unsuccessful gas test on May 21. After the British company failed to achieve commercial flow rates at the TE-10 well, the price of its stock alarmingly dropped over 32 percent, raising questions as to whether it would be wise to continue the exploration of the area. Despite the grim situation, Sound Energy maintains its belief that there may be up to 20 trillion cubic feet of gas, the company’s CEO expressing confidence in the profit potential for future exploration. “Whilst clearly disappointed with the outcome of the recent well test at TE-10, the team and I are encouraged to have delivered gas to surface from another TAGI discovery and remain confident in the potential of our Eastern Morocco basin,” said CEO James Parsons.  However, the London-based company has also admitted that it is considering the sale of its East Morocco acreage and, following the TE-10 failure, announced that it would be suspending plans to drill its TE-11 well. “We are now approaching the final stages of Sound Energy’s strategy to drill a bold exploration programme in Morocco and then explore options for early monetization,” Parsons said. “Should the board receive the right price for the company’s East Morocco acreage, our intention would be to return the net proceeds of any divestment to Sound Energy shareholders in the most efficient manner possible.” For now, the company has stated that it will be making necessary changes to reduce operating expenses, staff, and staff costs.

Rabat – Representing the Moroccan film “Adam,” directed by Maryam Touzani, two stars of the film, Loubna Azabal and Nisrine Erradi, shared a passionate kiss on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival this week. Photographers were quick to capture the moment, and photos have since gone viral on social media, eliciting mixed reactions. While some praised the bold move, the gesture shocked many. In response to the backlash, Azaba chose to apologize in a video “for the kiss I gave to Nisrin in Cannes. It’s my fault. I kissed Nisrin because I consider her as a sister.”  “It was a naive kiss and it’s my fault, I did not think. I did not want to hurt or shock anyone, especially during Ramadan,” said the actress. “I apologize to the fans of Nisrin, and to the Moroccan people. I apologize to everyone, everyone who was hurt.  “It was a naive kiss because I really think of her as my sister,” she repeated. She finished the video by saying Erradi is “not to blame, as she wasn’t warned.” Touzani’s film, Adam, is about the reality of having a baby out of wedlock in Morocco.  Touzani explained the reasoning behind the featuring of a taboo topic in the film: “There is a facade that everything is alright on the outside even if people are tormented inside. It is good to let in some air and light, and people are relieved and happy things are being spoken about.”

Rabat – The Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) Museum in Marrakech has announced that its new exhibition, “Desert Design,” will showcase the “incredible talent of Berber weavers.” The exhibition, which will run from June 16 to October 8, will feature 30 rugs woven by women of the Aït Khebbach tribe, from the easternmost region of Morocco. The vibrancy and patterns of the rugs, as well as the recycled material used to make them, “bear witness to the remarkable creativity of these Berber weavers, and contrast with the harsh and desolate environment in which they live,” said the YSL Museum in a statement. The YSL museum, next to the famed Majorelle Garden that once belonged to Yves Saint Laurent, opened its doors in 2017. As well as housing a permanent exhibition hall displaying the works of Yves Saint Laurent, the museum also houses a hall for temporary exhibitions, where the “Desert Design” exhibition will be on display. Arnaud Maurieres, the co-curator of the exhibition, explained in the statement how the ‘Desert Design” came to be.  “In December 2010, we were exploring the eastern Moroccan desert, a vast plain devoid of trees, shadows, and water. It was there, in the middle of nowhere, that we came upon two modest earthen structures: the home of our guide, Lahcen, and his family,” Maurieres explained. “Nine people lived within the walls; there was nothing in the unpainted interior that resembled furniture. The only thing we noticed was a pile of rugs in the corner of one of the rooms.” “As they were unfolded to welcome us, the floor suddenly seemed dappled with vibrant colors, which astounded us. Lahcen told us that all the women of his tribe wove such rugs, and asked if we wanted to meet them. It was how our adventure began.” Moroccan designer Younes Duret is to credit for the design of the exhibition. The second co-curator, along with Arnaud Maurieres, is Christine Bouilloc. Bouilloc is the director of the Musee Bargoin de Clermont-Ferrand in Clermont Auvergne Metropole, France,  which is cosponsoring the exhibition. The exhibition will travel to the Musee Bargoin de Clermont-Ferrand after Marrakech, and be on display there from 2 November 2019 through 5 April 2020.

Rabat – The amendment, which was adopted by the House of Councillors last week, was seeking to allow Bank Al Maghrib to issue Amazigh banknotes and coins. Amazigh  activists have reacted strongly to the decision of the Finance and Economic Development Committee at the House of Representatives, canceling an amendment of the draft Law (40.17). The government majority, as well as the Istiqlal (Independence) Party opposed the provision of the bill. The amendment of the bill was suggested by the Modernity and Authenticity Party (PAM). Several renowned Amazigh activists in Morocco condemned the decision of the committee, describing it as a discrimination against Amazigh. Ahmed Dghrni, one of the leaders of the Amazigh movement, told Morocco World News that the decision is discriminatory against Amazigh and against the constitution, which names Tamazight (berber) as an official language in Morocco. Dghrni also argues that the government is not considering Amazigh issues as priorities. The Moroccan Constitution, amended in 2011, describes Tamazight as an official language together with Arabic.  In a statement to Morocco World News, Amazigh activist and member of the House of Councillors  Abdelouahed Darouich condemned the decision, emphasizing that it is a violation of the 2011 constitution and the sovereignty of all people who voted for it. “People are now asking the MPs they voted for about the promises they gave at the time of the election. They are asking about the statue of the Tamazight (Berber) language,” he said. He added that some parties do not want Morocco to have a stable balance between its cultures and languages, criticizing those who opposed the draft law, including Al Istiqlal and the government majority.  Another activist, Mounir Keiji also denounced the decision, emphasizing that the government is not putting the Amazigh as one of its priorities. He added that the importance of Amazigh comes up only during elections as a way to win votes.. “The subject and the importance of Amazigh will be emphasized on the 2021 election, so MPs can secure votes,” he said. Keiji argued that this “decision shows that there is no political desire to ensure justice  for Amazigh, which has been ignored for several years.” The government said that ”the rejection of the amendment comes as it needs time for the organizational law to activate an official character system for Tamazight,” a justification that the activists describe as “weak.” However, several scholars and activists have condemned the amendment proposed by PAM to issue banknotes in the Tamazight (Berber) language. One of the scholars is the well-known Muslim preacher Hassan Kettani, who denounced the amendment, which was met with a backlash. In a Facebook post, the preacher wrote: “ Suddenly, we will find Tifinagh letters printed at our banknotes… further marginalization and restrictions of the language of Islam and Muslims,” referring to the Arabic language.  The post was apparently deleted, but the preacher wrote another post to support his argument. “One of the benefits that I gained from my latest battles is the return to Islamic language (Arabic) and the impossibility of communicating with the Tifinagh despite the insults I receive,” he said. Dr. Hamza El Kettani, another scholar also gave his point of view regarding the decision. El Kattani told Morocco World News that he refuses to consider Tachelhit, an Amazigh dialect spoken in the south west of Morocco, as an official language.  “There are other Amazigh languages in different regions, which are all equal in accordance with the law,” he said. Without expressing his opinion regarding the amendment of the law, El Kattani acknowledged that the constitution recognizes Tamazight as an official language. Casting doubt on its presence, the scholar asked: “But where is this language?” In Recent years, Amazigh activists have expressed concerns regarding a lack of justice with regard to their language and culture. Some Moroccans are still calling for the government to make Yennayer a national and public holiday. Such calls have increased since Algeria made January 12 a national and public holiday for Yennayer for the first time last year.

Rabat – Hundreds of Libyans have already been slaughtered and thousands more have been injured as Tripoli remains under siege for another week. Meanwhile, warring parties on both sides continue to make attempts at gaining the upper hand, with those caught in the crossfire being subjected to increasingly severe human rights violations and hardships. Civilians, refugees, and health workers have all become targets of attack from forces on both sides of the conflict and Libya grows closer to a full-scale civil war with each passing day. After over a month of fighting, the head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Ghassan Salamé, warned on May 21 that Libya is at risk of “descending into a civil war which could lead to the permanent division of the country.” Libya has been in a state of unrest and violence since the outbreak of the 17 February Revolution, fought to overthrow longtime Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011; however, following the signing of the Skhirat Agreement in 2014, there was some semblance of hope that peace would come soon after. Now, more than eight years after the first bullets of the Libyan Civil War were fired, the country still remains in a state of disarray, and recent fighting in Tripoli has prompted concern from the international community that a full-scale civil war may be inevitable. “I am no Cassandra,” continued Salame, referring to the mythical Greek figure whose  prophecies were ignored, “but the violence on the outskirts of Tripoli is just the start of a long and bloody war … imperiling the security of Libya’s immediate neighbors and the wider Mediterranean.” A capital under siege Seven weeks ago, in early April, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and forces from the Libyan National Army (LNA) launched an offensive into Libya’s Tripolitania region and now sits on the edge of Tripoli, the country’s capital city. Since the fall of the Gaddafi government, Haftar has been playing an intricate game of chess with the UN-backed interim government, the Government of National Accord (GNA). The assault on Tripoli is an attempt by the rogue general to corner the GNA into a checkmate, which would allow for the LNA and the Libyan House of Representatives to establish control over the country. Beginning in February of 2014, under the guise of combating extremists, Haftar has swept through Libya, where he now commands military forces in control of the entire eastern Cyrenaica region, as well as most of the southern Fezzan region and northwestern Tripolitania region. During the course of this crusade, Haftar and the LNA have been accused on multiple occasions of violating human rights, while GNA forces loyal to Fayez al-Sarraj have been accused of committing similar crimes in an attempt to maintain control over their territory.  Stranded in Tripoli The ongoing conflict has already forced over 75,000 of Tripoli’s citizens to flee their homes, with more continuing to fight tooth and nail in an attempt to escape the violence. For those that could not escape, the future grows grimmer as routine shelling by attacking forces is accompanied by deteriorating living conditions in the city. As the humanitarian crisis within the city’s walls grows worse, authorities have closed Tripoli’s only functioning airport, leaving the city’s population of 2.5 million people stranded in the middle of a warzone. For those trapped within the Libyan capital, nightmarish conditions and brutal violence are a daily routine. In May, approximately one month after Haftar’s troops began to surround Tripoli, a water control station in southwestern Libya was attacked by forces aligned with the LNA, cutting off water supplies to Tripoli and other cities in the region. With hundreds of thousands of beleaguered Libyans cut off from drinking water, the UN condemned the attack as a possible war crime. “Such attacks against civilian infrastructure that are essential for the survival of the civilian population may be considered war crimes,” UN Humanitarian Coordinator Maria Ribeiro, said. Since 2018, sabotages of wells and water infrastructure have become dramatically more frequent. As of now, 96 out of 366 wells feeding Libya’s Great Man-Made River (GRRM) have been disrupted, cutting off drinking water to an estimated 1.5 million people, including approximately 600,000 children. Meanwhile, there has also been a sharp increase in the number of abductions, unlawful arrests, and disappearances, especially against journalists and activists, since the outbreak of fighting in Tripoli. Indiscriminate attacks on civilians On the night of April 16, as the citizens of Tripoli’s Abu Salim district slept in their beds, rockets were launched into the Hay al-Intissar neighborhood, killing four women, one man and critically injuring a little girl. Though the Hay al-Intissar area is controlled by GNA-affiliated militants, there was no military presence on April 16 and the area is inhabited almost entirely by civilians. “Hay al-Intissar is a strictly residential area. There were families and children minding their own business,” said one witness, speaking to Amnesty International. Two more attacks on civilian targets were conducted within the Hay-Intissar area the same week, with significant damage to residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure, including a mosque, a school, and several ambulances. An Amnesty International investigation concluded that the attack was carried out using 122mm Grad-style rockets, an incredibly inaccurate type of artillery which makes distinguishing between military and civilian targets impossible. “The use of artillery and other imprecise weapons such as GRAD-style rockets in civilian areas is prohibited under international humanitarian law and such indiscriminate attacks can amount to war crimes,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, the MENA Deputy Director for Amnesty International.  “In both documented cases, the attackers blatantly ignored their obligations to take all feasible precautions to minimize suffering to civilians.” Both the GNA and LNA have utilized these weapons during the Tripoli offensive and both sides have accused the other of being behind the attack. However, all of the residents of the Abu Salim district interviewed by Amnesty International claimed that they believed the LNA was behind the attack. Mistreatment and violence against refugees Refugees and migrants are often exposed to the worst imaginable environments, but these conditions often pale in comparison to the unspeakable conditions within Tripoli’s detention centers. In March, an investigation by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) into Tripoli’s Sabaa Detention Center were alarmed to find that one in four of its 300 inhabitants, including 100 children, were malnourished or underweight. They also discovered 31 people locked in a room measuring just 4.5 meters by 5 meters (14.8 feet by 16.4 feet). Left with less than 0.7 meters of space each, inhabitants had no room to lie down or move in unclean and dangerous conditions. “What we see today in this single detention center is symptomatic of an uncontrolled, unjustified, and reckless system that puts the lives of refugees and migrants at risk,” says Karline Kleijer, MSF’s Head of Emergencies.  “We’re talking about the basic necessities required to sustain human life. If food, shelter and essential services can’t be provided in a consistent and appropriate manner, then these people should be released immediately by the Libyan authorities.” An even more significant atrocity is the reckless violence committed against refugees and migrants by both sides of the conflict. On April 23, armed men affiliated with the LNA entered the center, confiscated detainees’ phones and demanded that a group of Christian detainees conducting Easter prayers to stop. When they refused, the armed men fired on the detainees, significantly injuring at least 12.  Civilians as shields In an attempt to dissuade Haftar’s forces from engaging in a more aggressive assault on the city, the GNA has exploited the civilian and refugee population, using them as human shields to prevent the LNA pushing further towards the capital. Since May 7, several airstrikes have landed within close proximity to the Tajoura migrant detention center, a former military base which now holds approximately 500 migrants and refugees. However, an investigation by Amnesty International concluded that these airstrikes were directed towards GNA armored vehicles, suggesting that the detention center was also being used as a military complex. Detainees at the site also revealed that a nearby warehouse within the complex was used to store weapons for the GNA and loyalist militias. They also said that detainees were often forced to participate in military-related activities, such as loading and cleaning weapons for the GNA. “By detaining migrants and refugees in such close proximity to an active military site, the Libyan authorities are endangering the lives of civilians who are completely in their power,” said Mughrabi, the Amnesty International representative for the region. “They should be doing everything possible feasible to remove them away from military targets. The allegations that some of the detainees were forced to work at the military sites against their will also violate international law.”

Rabat – Italian authorities arrested a Moroccan young boy, on Tuesday, May 21, over allegations of arson at a police station in the northern Italian city of Mirandola. The fire reportedly resulted in the death of two elderly people, a woman in her mid-eighties and a man in his mid-seventies, who lived above the police station, following the explosion caused by the fire. Over a dozen others reportedly sustained injuries.  The incident stirred up anti-immigration sentiments especially among far-right parties who are using the arrest of a Moroccan citizen to call for a stronger stance on immigration. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister, who is believed to be a hard-line nationalist, has called on Europe and Italy to to take strict measures to scale down the inflow of migrants, writing on his Facebook page “Ports must be armored, in Italy and throughout Europe.”  He later wrote in a post that the “clearing up illegal migrants is a moral duty,” and the suspect must be put in jail for his “bestiality,” which he said the suspect will pay for, regardless of his age. Salvini’s anti-immigration rhetoric comes while elsewhere in Europe, German rescue boats helped 40 refugees bound for Europe to get ashore the Italian Island of Lampedusa. Salvini not only called for ports to be armored but he also previously barred NGO ships aiding refugees to enter the Italian ports.NGOs claimed the blockade increased the death toll of refugees, contrary to Salvini’s belief that the maritime embargo will block human traffickers.

Vegard Fosso Smievioll and Kjersti Brevik Moller, two law students from Bergen, were denied entry into Laayoune and deported, along with five Spanish lawyers, on Sunday. The students were sent by the NGO Rafto Foundation to observe the trial of human rights activist Nazha El Kahlidi, who is charged in Laayoune with usurping the journalism profession. The trial is controversial, with organizations like Amnesty International calling on Morocco to drop all charges against El Kahlidi.  Norwegian newspaper NorwayToday reported  the deportation of the students in its article on Sunday “Norwegian observers denied entry to Western Sahara.“ The report  prompted an immediate response from the Moroccan Embassy. In a press release Monday, the Moroccan Embassy asserted that the students should not be considered “observers.” “Being an observer, all over the world, is an official statute that includes competencies and legal procedures: no country on earth, Norway included, would ever accept that students could credibly be designated as observers and have the competencies to observe a trial,” said the press release. Students sent to ‘provoke an incident’  The Moroccan Embassy added that the students were deliberately sent by Rafto Foundation to be arrested and “to provoke an incident and catch the attention and the emotion of the Norwegian public.” “Morocco regrets that Norwegian students can be used to distract the parties involved from the positive confidence measures the General Secretary of the United Nations has initiated.” In its article, NorwayToday included unfounded political background under the heading “Western Sahara occupied for nearly fifty years.” The embassy’s press release emphasized that much of the article’s wording conflicts with the official UN position on Western Sahara. In particular, it highlights that while the article designates Morocco as “occupying” the Sahara, the UN in fact considers Morocco an “administrative power.” The embassy also rejects the article’s allegations that Western Sahara has rich natural resources. “Everybody knows there are no rich phosphate resources in the Sahara since the US Geological Institute has made a study that concludes that Sahara contains less than 2% of the phosphate resources present in the rest of Morocco.”  Finally, the embassy reminds that Polisario forbids the UN to enter tindouf refugee camps and that 2015 estimates the number of refugees at 150 000.  It appears that NorwayToday has since retracted any statements on this point, as the article in its current form does not touch on these issues.

Rabat – The United States Capitol held its first-ever Congressional Iftar on Monday, May 20. The celebration was organized by an unprecedented number of Muslim representatives — three — which includes Ilhan Omar (Democrat from Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Democrat from Mich.), and Andre Carson (Democrat from Ind.). The event was hosted in collaboration with a human rights nonprofit called Muslim Advocates. “It’s important to take a moment to recognize how historic this iftar is,” Tlaib said. “This event lifts an entire community that has felt unseen for far too long. We have been unjustly targeted to ignite fear and promote an agenda of hate. Tonight, we recommit to being rooted in justice, inclusivity, and a sense of belonging.” Approximately 100 people attended and the iftar remained a celebration, despite the political tensions surrounding the event. The White House iftar and American Presidents Breaking Ramadan fast at The White House is an annual tradition beginning in 1996 under the Clinton administration. American presidents continued to host iftars until 2017, when President Trump canceled the iftar. In 2018 and 2019, Trump did hold iftar, but the guest lists largely featured Muslim foreign dignitaries and diplomats. Trump failed to invite any members of the American Muslim community both times.  Instead of inviting Muslim Reps. Omar, Tlaib and Carson, to his Iftar at the White House, Trump has arguably been placing them under intense scrutiny, ultimately “pitting” minorities against each other, as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says.  Trump’s divisive campaign to destabilize Muslim representatives is not limited to the Islamic faith.  Using footage of 9/11, Trump chastised Omar’s misused quotes on the the attack and later tweeted, claiming Omar has “tremendous hatred for Israel and the Jewish people,” Omar responded: “You praised people at a neo-Nazi rally […] This is another transparent attempt to sow division b/t minority communities and distract from your own criminal behavior by smearing a Muslim woman. No one should fall for it this time.” Political climate bringing Muslim Congress together The persisting lack of substantial religious, racial, and gender diversity of the American Congress is a much-debated topic. Omar and Tlaib were both running in the November elections for Congress, when Carson, who had already been in office since 2008 said, “I was saying I hope that these folks win, because I don’t want to be the only one.” Even after her election, Representative and Somali refugee Omar recalls “worrying” that “they [would] do everything to make sure that I will not be able to wear my headscarf to represent my constituents.” Months into office, Omar appears to have more confidence about her position, saying about the conservatives who opposed her in Congress, “They are mortified about the fact that they awakened these Muslim women to fight for their space in Congress.” “It doesn’t matter what you do or what you say – if you’re a Muslim, it’s going to get exaggerated,” Carson said. “Ramadan is a time for not only spiritual renewal, but a time to open doors to friends, neighbors and anyone who wants to commune and reflect,” said Farhana Khera, the executive director of Muslim Advocates. “This evening, at a time of unprecedented levels of anti-Muslim bigotry and hate crimes, together we showed that we will not be intimidated or cowed by those who wish to demonize and marginalize American Muslims. We will express our faith, our dignity and our commitment to caring for each other and our nation,” Khera added.

Rabat – Three Saudi Arabian scholars are being held in Riyadh on various charges of “terrorism” will be condemned to death, as indicated by a report. Referring to two government sources and one of the men’s relatives, Middle East Eye announced on Tuesday, that the three people in question – Sheik Salman al-Awdah, Awad al-Qarni, and Ali al-Omari – will be convicted and executed after the sacred month of Ramadan ends. There was no remark from Saudi authorities on the report. Al-Awdah is a internationally famous and dynamic Islamic scholar describedby UN specialists as a “reformist”, al-Qarni is a preacher, scholar and author, while al-Omari is a well known broadcaster. “They will not wait to execute these men once the death sentence has been passed,” one anonymous source revealed to Middle East Eye. Another Saudi government source said the execution last month of 37 of the nation’s nationals was utilized as an “trial balloon” to assess the level of international outcry, the outlet revealed. Ali al-Ahmad, a long-term Saudi resistance figure and leader of the US-based Institute for Gulf Affairs, considered the reported move to execute the three men a “crime to terrorize the Saudi citizens into submission”. “The Saudi court system is more or less a kangaroo court system,” al-Ahmad told Al Jazeera from Washington, DC. However, Yahya Assiri, creator of ALQST, a Saudi human rights association situated in London, called the news report false in a tweet in Arabic. However, he did write, “Nothing is beyond the authorities who are oppressive, brutal and ignorant, but also no one has been convicted or executed … This news is harmful to the victim and the human rights situation and our work.” The trio are anticipating trial at the Criminal Special Court in the capital, Riyadh, say Middle East Eye following their arrest in September 2017. Experts speculate that the arrest was part of a crackdown on alleged enemies of the state, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed Salman. Their arrest provoked the condemnation of the United Nations, as well as human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Al-Awdah, who has in excess of 13 million followers on Twitter, posted a tweet a matter of seconds before being arrested that contained a clear reference to relations between Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbor, Qatar. Riyadh initiated an air, ocean and land blockade on Qatar in June 2017. The move was supported by three other Arab nations: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt. “May God harmonise between their hearts for the good of their people,” Al-Awdah said in the tweet. Saudi Arabia has drawn global criticism for supposed human rights infringement, including the repression of citizens. In a January 2018 report, UN specialists denounced the kingdom’s “continued use of counterterrorism and security-related laws against human rights defenders.” “Despite being elected as a member of the Human Rights Council at the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia has continued its practice of silencing, arbitrarily arresting, detaining and persecuting human rights defenders and critics” the report exclaimed.

The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) has announced the winning bidder for the solar project Noor Midelt I, an 800 MW solar project near Midelt, in north-eastern Morocco. The winning consortium for Noor Midelt I is led by French company EDF Renouvelables in collaboration with UAE renewables developer and operator Masdar, as well as Moroccan company Green of Africa. “At MASEN we are completely satisfied with the results of this bid process and trust the abilities of the consortium chosen to carry out the project. Noor Midelt I is a technologically disruptive project. There will be, in the world, a before/after Midelt, in the same way there was a before/after Ouarzazate”, MASEN stated in a press release. The Noor Midelt solar project will be built over two phases and will be made up of two solar plants which will combine thermosolar and photovoltaic technology to produce 800 MW of renewable energy, with a storage capacity of 5 hours. The hybrid technology will optimize energy production, leading to competitive pricing (MAD 0.68 per KwH at peak time).  According to the press release, construction of Phase I will start in autumn 2019. Preliminary infrastructure works in the area have already been completed, including the construction of a 40km road allowing access to the complex, and the installation of a 50km long electric cable. Moroccan companies carried out the preliminary works, creating over 300 jobs. Noor Midelt I is valued at approximately MAD 7.57 billion ($782 million). It will be financed by a range of bodies including KfW, the European Investment Bank, the French Development Agency, the European Commission, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Clean Technology Fund, adds the press release. The Noor Midelt I project is part of Morocco’s broader renewable energy strategy, which has promoted solar, hydroelectric and wind farm projects across the country. Morocco’s objective is to produce 52% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. In 2018, Morocco reached 35% renewable energy. Noor Midelt will be the second thermo-photovoltaic plant in Morocco, after Noor Ouarzazate.  Noor Ourzazate is split into four phases. Phase 1 began operations in 2016. Once Phases 2, 3, and 4 are completed, Noor Ouarzazate will be the second largest solar plant in the world after Solar Star in California.

Rabat – American actress Eva Longoria is to thank for the footage of  Moroccan comedian Gad Elmaleh having an impromptu dance session with Mexican-Lebanese actress Salma Hayek.  The video was filmed at the Kering dinner, organized during the Cannes Film with the theme of “women in motion.”  The Moroccan comedian took the expression “dance like no one’s watching” to heart, swaying and spinning to the beat of the drums along with Hayek. Lebanese director Nadine Labaki also joined in the festivities.  Elmaleh has a lot to celebrate this year. In April, his new show “Huge in France” premiered on Netflix to critical acclaim. The semi-autobiographical show tells the story of the comedian reconnecting with his son in Los Angeles, and the struggles of culture shock, co-parenting, and dating in a new country.

Fishermen in Agadir are selling their fish directly to the public, choosing to bypass the intermediaries who usually hike up prices during Ramadan. Boat owner Aziz Obad launched the idea in the first week of Ramadan, in a bid to take back control the price of fish and promote sales, reports Moroccan newspaper La Vie Eco. During Ramadan, the price of seafood usually skyrockets, because the intermediaries between fishermen and consumers take advantage of high demand to speculate and increase prices. For example, through intermediaries, prices had sometimes reached MAD 140 a kilogram for prawns, and MAD 100 a kilogram for sole, which for many is unaffordable. Fishermen in Marrakech, Rabat, and Dakhla are also bypassing the intermediaries, reports La Vie Eco, setting up a similar direct-to-public fish sales. Through this new initiative, prices for a kilogram of prawns and sole have hovered around MAD 80 and MAD 25, respectively. Now customers have access to reasonably priced seafood during the Holy Month. Fish trucks set up shop every day in a car park close to the Agadir port, selling directly to the public. On Saturday 1,200 people bought approximately 10 tons of fish. The fish being sold comes from the high seas and was originally destined for export. It is frozen, in accordance with international export norms, reassures Obad. The rise in fish prices during Ramadan is a recurring concern. At the start of this year’s Holy Month, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a strategy to prevent a spike in fish prices, preparing a supply 500 to 600 tons of frozen fish to meet demand in Casablanca, Rabat, and Marrakech. The consumption of fish by Moroccans is below the world average (13.3 kg / inhabitant against 19.3 kg / inhabitant worldwide). The Halieutis Plan, a commercial fishing strategy launched by the King of Morocco in 2009, aims to raise this average to 16 kg by 2020.

Rabat – Moroccan former Head of Government Abdelilah Benkirane has shared a video in which he explains why his party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), is not an Islamic movement. He says it is a political party with an Islamic orientation. “PJD is not a religious party; there’s a huge difference between a political party and a religious movements such as Al Adl Wa Al Ihsan and other groups.” In the 50 minute video, which was published on Monday on his official Facebook Page, Benkirane explained what he sees as the difference between the two. According to him, an Islamic movement focuses on resolving issues that relate to religion. Political parties on the other hand work to find solutions to the problems that a country faces, independent of religion. Benkirane gave the example of Moroccan laws on alcohol and public drunkenness. “Alcohol is haram, but it is the state which is in charge of forbidding it or not.” According to Benkirane, religion and politics can be separate. “The state’s body of laws should not necessarily be in line with the Islamic rulings.” He goes on to emphasize that since engaging in the Moroccan political scene, his party has always promoted a separation of politics and power.  “Our party chose this reference as other parties chose other references,” he said.  Benkirane noted that his political party had come across a number of issues in the employment, health and education sectors. For him, the solution to the issues lies in good management. “If there is no good management, these problems will remain the same however religious you are,” he said.

Rabat – Although the United States banned the supply of US-made equipment to Huawei, claiming that it used international networks for espionage purposes, the company stated that its 5G network would not be affected and that it had prepared precautionary measures in anticipation of such a move. President Trump has recently signed an executive order to ban American companies from dealing with any foreign telecommunication technology providers listed in the blacklist of companies posing a threat to the US national security.  As a result of the executive order, Google announced that it will stop doing business with Huawei by cutting it off from Android services to comply with the US government’s trade blockade. This does not mean that Huawei will no longer use Android but it will be deprived of getting earlier access to Google software updates. Google uses an open source for its Android operating system called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which means that anyone can use it.  Huawei used to get access to the software update months before its official launch. When Huawei receives the update it modifies the standard Android experience with EMUI/MUI and launches updates several months after Google’s Pixel smartphones receive updates. The Chinese company will now provide its own updates from AOSP to its device, rather than Google’s updates. Huawei users in China are already banned from using Google’s various services, such as Gmail, google map, youtube, etc. Outside China, however, Huawei users enjoy using Google applications. It is unclear whether Huawei users will experience a noticeable delay in receiving Android version updates. Android said in a statement that existing Huawei smartphones will continue to benefit from services like Google Play and security from Google Play Protect. For Huawei users’ questions regarding our steps to comply w/ the recent US government actions: We assure you while we are complying with all US gov’t requirements, services like Google Play &amp; security from Google Play Protect will keep functioning on your existing Huawei device. — Android (@Android) May 20, 2019 US chipmakers firms such as Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx, and Broadcom have also announced cutting ties with Huawei for the time being. Huawei has already anticipated the US move to include telecoms companies in the trade blockade. Subsequently, Huawei has been working on developing its own operating system, as part of its ‘plan B.’  The Chinese telecom company is developing the same software used in its smartwatches. The ban would also fall heavily on Huawei’s MateBook line of laptops, which use US-made chips and Microsoft’s Windows.   Huawei has emerged as a telecommunication and technology leader in recent years, competing with South Korea’s Samsung and America’s Apple. The Chinese company is known for making routers and other telecommunication devices and has become the world’s second smartphones seller. According to the Washington Post, the move is likely due to  US concerns about having its western allies’ sensitive information vulnerable to supposed Chinese infiltration. As the Chinese giant’s activities grow, the US and the Trump government’s concerns grew with it. The U.S. concerns may be explained by the 2017 Chinese law requiring Huawei and all other firms to cooperate with Chinese government intelligence agencies. However, the Chinese government has urged the US to prove that China uses Huawei technology to spy on other countries networks. The company was founded by a former Chinese military officer and acquired support from the government to achieve such success. Huawei has been working on developing the next generation of the telecommunication network, 5G, relying on components from at least 30 US firms. Huawei said that this does not present a problem at all and that the 5G network won’t be affected by the US restrictions. The company also said that it has stockpiled 12 months of equipment from the U.S. firms in anticipation of such a move. In an interview with Chinese state-owned broadcaster CCTV on Tuesday, Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei said that “Huawei’s 5G will absolutely not be affected.” He added that “in terms of 5G technologies, others won’t be able to catch up with Huawei in two or three years.” Zhengfei added that the US government was underestimating Huawei’s capabilities. Meanwhile, President Trump has so far failed to convince America’s European allies to take similar steps against the Chinese company.  As concerns emerged right after the executive order that an immediate ban on Huawei would have far-reaching unintended consequences on American third parties, the White House decided to slightly overrule the executive order. Washington lately announced that the US Commerce Department will allow Huawei to trade with American companies for the next three months.  For its part, China says it is poised to throw it geopolitical weight behind Huawei to help the company defend its “legitimate rights.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mounia Boucetta, said on Monday that the government will “meet in Rabat with a commission of the European Union to examine a set of problems related to the issuance of [Schengen] visas.”  The EU-Morocco meeting comes after reports indicated that the wait for a visa is roughly six months at the minimum and increasing.  With 530,000 Schengen visas issued to Moroccans in 2018, Morocco is in the top ten countries of citizens applying for short-term visas. But that also means  Moroccans planning a European vacation have to deal with the problems of overloaded computer systems. Boucetta said that the government is “closely following this issue and in particular the issue of appointments that pose a problem to citizens.” The source of the issue is the consulates’ computer system which processes visa applications. With the processing system continuously working at full capacity, it has become too difficult to meet the demand for tourist visas. Visa appointments for Spain are booked for over six months, while Italy and France have slots open by the end of August. According to the report, these wait times have been increasing. In February, the wait time to apply for a French visit averaged 40-60 days. MPs at the House of Representatives also discussed the issue of Schengen visas on Monday.  Lahcen Haddad, a member of the Istiqlal (Independence) party and former Minister of Tourism, was among the MPs who expressed dissatisfaction with the issue.  “At the same time, European citizens enter the national territory without a visa,” he said. Along with the long wait that Moroccans are facing for Schengen Visas, the EU announced on May 16 that the systems for issuing Visas for nations along the EU border will be updated to reinforce protection against transnational crime and terrorism.

Rabat – As the world continues to inch closer to the catastrophic effects of climate change, Morocco features among the world’s most environment-friendly countries. In its resolution to pave the way towards an even more renewable future, the Moroccan government has put together an ambitious goal of bringing national renewable electricity production to 52%. Imported fossil fuels currently feed 97% of Morocco’s annual energy consumption, costing the kingdom billions every year.  With hopes of liberating itself from an overreliance on foreign trade for energy, Morocco has set out on a number of projects to increase renewable energy consumption while keeping up with growing demand.  Perhaps the most ambitious of these projects has been the Noor Solar Power Plant in Ouarzazate, which could theoretically provide clean electricity for a city twice the size of Marrakech. However, despite the momentum that Morocco has established through its renewable energy efforts, it has lost its place on the Ernst &amp; Young (EY) Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI), dropping from 12th in the world to 13th in the world, just below Denmark. RECAI rankings are determined by analyzing a myriad of factors and assigning each a score from 1 to 5 and then weighted based on importance. The factors include the countries’ macroeconomic conditions as well as technology and natural resources, such as access to sunlight and strong winds. Though Morocco excels in renewable energy fields such as onshore wind and solar, it continues to lack in offshore wind. The country also falls behind in as the hydroelectric and geothermal sources of energy which have made several European countries so successful with renewables. “Morocco is an emergent country,” Yassir Badih, senior project manager at the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy told CNN. “Electricity demand has doubled since 2010 and by 2030 we want Morocco to be one of the first countries in the world for renewables to exceed share of fossil energy,” he continued. While Morocco remains on-track for reaching its 2020 goal of 42 percent electricity production – as well as its even more ambitious goal of reaching 52 percent by 2030 –  it will need to make use of all of its potential natural resources if it wishes to remain a world leader in renewable electricity.

Rabat – In a monthly meeting of the house of councilors for discussing Morocco’s education policy, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani said the government was poised to trigger its 2015-2030 Strategic Vision to modernize Moroccan education. The 2015-2030 Strategic Vision of education reform, which the Ministry of Education is adopting  as its main social project, is aimed at bridging the equality gap and promote quality education, El Othmani stated.  He said the goal of the vision is to live up to the expectations of Moroccans for a “future school and rights of students to knowledge and quality education.”  With the challenges facing the Moroccan education system, which El Othmani said predate the current government, the head of government pins his hopes on the continuity of reforms initiated during his tenure. Reform, El Othmani said, is “the sole gateway to achieving sustainable development.” According to El Othmani, the government seeks to develop a platform of combined efforts from all education institutions to assist schools in bolstering up future generations.  El Othmani noted that education reform rests on a “comprehensive and complementary approach” working towards boosting the quality of education at all levels.   Stressing the important role of vocational training as a driving force for creating job opportunities, El Othmani said that the overall objective is to achieve equal access to schools for all Moroccans. Despite the current social unrest across the kingdom due to contractual teachers and medical students’ protests, the head of government pointed to a “quantum leap” Morocco has made in the area of education.  El Othmani especially spoke about the inroads Morocco has made in terms of vocational training, explaining that Morocco’s success in the field will help make the country a regional model.  Regarding higher education, El Othmani declared that government is working on establishing a “distinct system for higher education and scientific research, which best suits the needs of the job market, in addition to harnessing human resources to to make up for the shortage in education.” He noted that the government has moved extra funds into the education budget.  By El Othmani’s reckoning, the decision to drive up budgets is  an indication that is preparing to successfully tackle the issue of overcrowding, which saw a significant decrease, promising to redouble their efforts towards attaining favorable outcomes in public education sector.

Rabat – A court in Beni Mellal in Central Morocco has postponed the trial of 12 men accused of gangraping a 17-year-old girl identified in news reports as Khadija. The trial was due to occur today but was postponed to June 25.  According to AFP, the trial was postponed at the “request of both sides.” The twelve accused, aged between 19 and 25, are facing charges that include human trafficking, rape, kidnapping and forming an organized gang. A 13th defendant will be tried separately and privately on June 11 as he was underage when the crimes took place.  The victim’s lawyer, Ibrahim Hachante, told AFP that the suspects had confessed to police but most of them then retracted before a magistrate. Khadija’s story made headlines both in Morocco and internationally due to the brutal nature of the crime and the 17-year-old victim’s determination for her story to be heard and her attackers be brought to justice. Khadija came forward in a TV interview on Moroccan station Chouf TV. In that first public appearance, she showed scars, cigarette burns, and tattoos on her body, which she said were inflicted on her by her captors. “I tried to escape several times, but I was caught and beaten,” she said. “They tortured me, they did not give me food or drink, and they did not even allow me to take a shower.” “I will never forgive them – they have destroyed me. I want justice to be done and [for them] to pay for what they have done to me,” she bravely told reporters. “ How many women who, for fear of this hchouma [shame], continue to keep quiet?”  Khadija urged other women to “never remain silent” about sexual abuse and harassment. “For each and every girl or woman, I don’t want this to occur again,” Khadija told the Guardian. “I want this to stop and I want the women to be courageous.”

Rabat – International NGO for animal protection “Comme Chat et Chien”  (“Like Cat and Dog”) has filed a complaint against a man who intentionally burned and killed at least 25 cats in Safi, a port city in western Morocco on the Atlantic ocean. Several other cats were injured.  The  heinous incident occured on May 6, when a man intentionally started the fire as a reaction to a confrontation with one of the  women responsible for feeding the cats.  Youssra El Hachimi, the Secretary-General of “Comme Chat et Chien”   told Morocco World News that the confrontation was sparked when one of the women discovered that the man had been ordering his dog to attack the cats.  The woman knew that the dog used to come to the same place to attack the cats because  she noticed on multiple occasions that many of the cats had several injuries. While feeding the cats, she would also sometimes discover that some of them had been killed.  On the day the dog attacked the cats while she was present, the woman, in an effort to defend the cats under her care, started to shout and threw at the dog whatever she could reach to stop it from hurting the cats. The dog’s owner then came up and confronted her. “He asked her why she was  attacking his dog,” El Hachimi explained. “When the man then attempted to attack her, she ran to her car and called the police,” El Hachimi said. A law enforcement vehicle subsequently showed up, and the woman hurried to tell them what had happened. “The man then hid himself, waiting for the police to go so he could attack the woman. He crashed a part of her car to take revenge,” El Hachimi added. The secretary-general of the NGO added that the case took a serious dimension when the man went to the cats’ shelters and set fire to the place, killing dozens of cats and injuring others. Shocked by the act, the NGO decided to urge its lawyer to file a complaint against the man, emphasizing that torturing animals is a crime. Safi’s Court of First Instance validated the complaint.  Following the court’s decision to further investigate the incident, the case will be the first time for a Moroccan court to criminalize animal abuse and torture. “We have a competent lawyer that will take the necessary measures for the perpetrator to be convicted for what he did,” El Hachimi said. She added that Morocco does have a law to defend animals from torture and abuse, but it is “unfortunately forgotten” since it  is not commonly used.  El Hachimi promises that her NGO will capitalize on this case to campaign for the respect of animals’ rights. She said they will from now do their best to make the law applicable to hold the man  responsible for the fire against the cats accountable for his crime. The NGO also launched a petition to condemn the “shocking” act.

Rabat – On Tuesday, May 21, the Spanish Ministry of Labour, Migrations, and Social Security released new figures on last April’s foreign employees’ membership of the Spanish social security system. According to the report, the average number of foreign worker registrants in the social security system in April stood at 2,086,400, which is higher by more than 59,443 newly registered workers, compared to last month. “The percentage of year-on-year growth stood at 8.07%, with 155,778 foreign workers more than in April 2018,” said the report. Morocco ranked the second largest in terms of enrollment in the social security system for two consecutive years, with 270,432 workers, which is a notable increase compared to 250,782 new enrollments last year. Romania, which also secured the top of the chart for two consecutive years, contributed with a total of 352,232 employee registrations, compared to 339,631 in the previous year. Italy (120,967) came third on the list, followed by China (105,451).  Other foreign workers mentioned in April’s figures, on Spain’s social security foreign membership, include employees from Ecuador (73,323), the United Kingdom (70,289), Colombia (67,796), Bulgaria (64,374) and Portugal (54,409). Of the 2,086,400 social security contributors in Spain, 1,224,349 arrived from countries outside the European Union, whereas the remaining 862,051 foreign workers belonged to one of the EU countries, added the report. 1,166,994 of the social security members were male and 919,406 were female. Enrolling with social security programs enables foreign employees to benefit from a wide range of advantages such as healthcare, maternity leave, monetary assistance, work-related injury compensation, and a retirement pension.

Rabat – When Shimon Peres authorized the 1985 bombing of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunisia, one must presume he had forgotten his earlier oath of loyalty to the Palestinian government, which was revealed earlier this week when his Palestinian citizenship request was uncovered. MyHeritage is an Israeli startup which has used the Israeli State Archives to compile a database of over 67,000 citizenship requests filed between 1937 and 1947 during the British Mandate period. The Palestinian Quds News Network uploaded the documents to Facebook on Monday, receiving, in turn, an outpour of comments condemning Peres and his role in perpetuating the Palestinian conflict. The documents revealed that Shimon Peres, then known as Szymon Perski, had declared an interest in “agricultural work” before travelling to the British Mandate territory. The former Israeli Prime Minister’s signature appears at the bottom of the application, including a statement which declares that, “I will be faithful and loyal to the Government of Palestine.” Peres was known as one of the architects of the State of Israel, especially through spearheading projects to improve the IDF, he was also instrumental in the development of Israel’s nuclear weapons. The former Prime Minister was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his role in creating the Oslo Peace Accords and for other activities designed to resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine.

Rabat – Algeria’s military chief of staff has cautioned against calls by protesters to delay the nation’s presidential race, saying that a democratic election is the only way to solve current political emergency. The Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaid Salah declaration on Monday came only days huge riots in urban areas around the nation, protesting of the military stance on the elections. . “Holding a presidential election could help [Algeria] avoid falling into the trap of a constitutional void, with its accompanying dangers and unwelcome consequences,” Gaid Salah said in a speech. 
“The need to accelerate the establishment of an independent body to organize and oversee the election,” Gaid Salah explained, maintaining that the election “would stop those who are trying to prolong the crisis”. After nearly two decades in power, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika surrendered control on April 2. His resignation was sparked by protests over his decision to run for a fifth term of office. Weeks of demonstration have plagued the North African nation, a noteworthy oil and gas producer, with protests demanding the removal Bouteflika supporters from power and a total update of the political framework. The dissidents want a transitional programme to be set up to audit the constitution in order for free and democratic elections to take place. In his speech on Monday, Gaid Salah appeared to dismiss those requests, portraying them as “unobjective and unreasonable”, adding that they tried to “deprive state institutions of their cadres and denigrate them”. The presidential election is due to take place on July 4.

The Government is working towards ensuring 100% of Moroccan students receive a university scholarship, the Moroccan Minister of Education Said Amzazi told Parliament on Monday. In response to a question about broadening scholarship eligibility in Morocco, Amzazi noted that 95% of students attending university currently receive a scholarship. Maghreb Press Agency (MAP) reported that, according to Amzazi, 382 000 students received a university scholarship during the 2018-2019 academic year. The number of scholarship recipients increased by 4% from 2017-2018; an extra 27 000 scholarships per year, he added. The Ministry’s scholarship budget has increased from MAD 540 000 in 2012 to over MAD 1.8 million in 2019. Each province of Morocco has a quota of scholarships to allocate to students who have completed their high school baccalaureate certificate. They can award scholarships to 80% of applicants, which means 20% of applicants currently miss out. Scholarships are awarded based on financial need, Amzazi clarified. University education is seen by many as a ticket to a better life, in Morocco, or overseas. However, figures released by the Moroccan statistics agency (HCP) in April show the difficulties that Moroccan university graduates then face when finding employment. On average 17.2% of Moroccan university graduates were unemployed last year, with figures rising to 25.9% for students with postgraduate qualifications.

Rabat – The manager of Cameroonian football team, Clarence Seedorf, added himself to the list of renowned football experts who believe that the Moroccan national football team can win the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN) title. In an interview with FIFA, the former footballer said that Morocco are one of the favorites to win the CAN otherwise known as AFCON. Speaking about his team’s performance during the competition’s qualifier matches, Sedroof said that “Ending up with the same points as Morocco, who are one of the favourites to win the AFCON, with only two goals difference says a lot about how we performed and prepared for the other games.” Several other renowned footballers and coaches have also said that the Moroccan national football team is one of their favorites to win the 2019 CAN. In April, Senegalese football legend El Hadji Diouf said:  “I hope they win the title as there are many other good teams -Egypt will be at the forefront with Morocco and Nigeria.”  The head coach of the Nigerian football team, Gernot Rohr, t placed Morocco is among  his favorites to win along with Egypt. “According to the last FIFA ranking, Morocco is currently the best in Africa, while Egypt will play at home and enjoy the support of their fans, and for this reason, both teams are the closest to the title,” he said. The flagship tournament will be held in June 2019 in Egypt.

Rabat – The National Syndicate for Higher Education and Scientific Research (SNESUP) declared a two-day national strike on May 29-30 over “dignity, conditions and financial and psychological state,”in a statement published on Friday, May 17. The decision to come out on strike following talks between the union  and the Ministry of Education, where no mutual understanding regarding the demands university professors had raised could be reached. According to the statement, SNESUP’s are petitioning the ministry for salary rises, which they say have been “frozen” for over two decades now, as well as placing vocational training highest on the list of priorities, besides granting what they called “academic freedom,” and “freedom of initiative.” The statement reads that during a meeting held on May 14, the Education Minister Said Amzazi said that their demands still require extra time for discussion within the government. Denouncing the breakdown of dialogue, the union regarded this response as a retreat by the ministry, saying the need for longer time to put in place the agreements is a betrayal of  the commitment forged between the government and the union. It maintained that this change in policy impinges on the credibility of government, its intent to address wider issues of public affairs. It also blames the government for its disregard for the social issues at large, adding that all this poses a threat to the national stability. The union is threatening to step up action through staging a series of protests, initiated by the May 29-30 national strike.

Rabat – Moroccan director Maryam Touzani’s film, Adam, is about the reality of having a baby out of wedlock in Morocco. The story was inspired by a pregnant woman who was going door-to-door asking for work. “She was from a village and she was heavily pregnant. My mother had no work for her but was afraid to let her go… she wasn’t in a good way and had clearly nowhere to go,” Touzani said.”The girl had been going door-to-door, so my mother took her in for a few days until we worked something out.” Touzani learned that before the woman began knocking on doors in that neighborhood that day, “she had been going from town to town after running away from her family, working as a cleaner and hairdresser until people noticed her predicament and then she would have to move on.” Touzani’s own mother at the time was a widow, making her also a single mother but without the prejudice that comes with having a child out of wedlock. In Morocco, sex without marriage is illegal. Unmarried women in labor are arrested at hospitals, so instead many of them give birth in secret and even then are shunned from society. As a result, many unmarried mothers sell or abandon their newborns, who then become street children.  “In a country like mine, it’s the biggest shame for a woman to have a child out of wedlock,” said Touzani. “She doesn’t want to disappoint her parents so she cannot tell the truth.” “So she stayed with us until she had the baby,” said Touzani. The woman revealed that her plan was to abandon the child immediately after birth. “I experienced how this woman was trying to suffocate her maternal instinct,” Touzani said, “She ignored her belly growing and tried to pretend that nothing was going on. The whole experience moved me very deeply.” Touzani began to write the film Adam years later, when she was pregnant with her first child. She said that the woman who stayed with her small family those days came back to her memory. Touzani chose to keep the way the child was conceived a secret, an interesting choice for the film. The audience never knows whether the woman was raped or had consensual sex.“It’s important for an audience coming from a country such as mine, to not judge,” Touzani explained. “If you give her a past, it would be like she is guilty of something, or not guilty of something and that is really not what the film is about.” The movie version also takes place in the medina of Casablanca, rather Tangier, where Touzani is from. In Morocco, Casablanca generally symbolizes modernity and progressiveness. Yet Touzani points out, “there are so many beautiful things about our culture that are disappearing because modernity takes over and everybody is always in a hurry to do things. So I really wanted to bring this bread back through the process.” There are so many layers of complexity in the story behind Touzani’s film though the unwed, pregnant woman is the outcast, Touzani also associated the film with her mother as a widow: “The widowed mother is not fine and that was something I was very surprised to discover. If a widow is young, then she becomes prey. A lot of men think that she is available because there is no man in her house, and being a widow, she is free to do what she wants with her body.” Director Touzani also explained her reasoning behind featuring taboo topics: “There is a facade that everything is all right on the outside even if people are tormented inside. It is good to let in some air and light, and people are relieved and happy things are being spoken about.”

Rabat – Signed atop the bodies of the tens of thousands of Libyans killed during the numerous conflicts since 2011, the Skhirat Agreement was never more than a thin bandage covering a large wound. However, what little order the agreement did establish is under has become threatened as several members of the Tobruk Parliament call for Libya’s withdrawal from the agreement. On Sunday, May 19, 44 members of Libya’s House of Representatives in Tobruk released a statement rejecting the UN-brokered Skhirat Peace Agreement signed in Morocco in 2015. “We call on the [House of Representatives] to officially announce the withdrawal from the Libyan Political Agreement of Skhirat,” the MPs explained along with the statement. Through denouncing the Skhirat Agreement, the statement also declared all political entities created by the agreement as illegitimate, including the current Government of National Accord (GNA) interim government headed by Fayez al-Sarraj. The move is just one of many by the Tobruk government to further fuel hostilities between the House of Representatives and the provisional government under al-Sarraj. A second war Much of Libya and the rest of the world breathed a sigh of relief following the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, anticipating that the end of the war would end the bloodshed that had overtaken the country for 8 months. Yet, the death of Gaddafi only perpetuated the bloodshed, leading the country into years of factional conflict and ultimately culminating in the Second Libyan Civil War. The Second Libyan Civil War first erupted in 2014 with the outbreak of violent fighting between the Libyan National Army (LNA) and Islamist forces in Northern Libya. Following a military offensive against Islamist forces, the General National Congress (GNC) – the successors of the transitional government following the First Libyan Civil War – condemned the LNA, generating conflict between the two parties. Thousands were killed in the ensuing conflict before the United Nations intervened, resolving to accomplish peace with the Skhirat Agreement. Signed in December 2015 in Skhirat, Morocco, the Libyan Political Agreement was designed to unify the divided governments by establishing the Government of National Accord and allowing the House of Representatives to exist as the main legislative body of Libya. However, before the ink used to write the treaty had even dried, conflict broke out when Islamists associated with Daesh (ISIS) launched a string of attacks in the country.  As the militants fled the country, a glimmer of hope emerged that the war would be coming to an end; however, irreparable conflicts between the House of Representatives in Tobruk and the GNA in Tripoli arose shortly after. Libya fell into disarray once again as the House of Representatives, maintaining control over the LNA, waged war against the GNA and remaining loyalist forces. Libya in 2019 When Libyans first took up arms against one another in 2011, the hope of peace still lingered in the minds of revolutionaries and loyalists alike. Now, more than eight years have passed, but the conflict continues to violently smolder across the Arab nation. The Libyan National Army, loyal to Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and the Tobruk government, controls the entire eastern Cyrenaica region, as well as most of the southern Fezzan region and northwestern Tripolitania region. The Government of National Accord, backed by loyalist militias and international support, controls much of the Tripolitania region, including the major cities of Tripoli, Misrata, and Sirte. Libyan blood continues to paint the region red, and prospects for sustainable peace are rapidly receding as fighting expands and intensifies, especially as it continues to be prodded by international actors. ‘Operation Flood of Dignity’ In April of this year, the LNA launched an offensive to seize Tripoli from the internationally-backed GNA. The assault, code-named “Operation Flood of Dignity’ has seen the LNA seize large portions of GNA-controlled Tripolitania, with Haftar’s forces sitting on the edge of Tripoli preparing to take the city as well. As the fighting intensifies, there have been numerous reports of war crimes, as well as the use of drone strikes in civilian areas by LNA forces. Though Haftar’s forces lack access to equipment capable of launching these air strikes, reports have alleged that the UAE has been providing aid to the LNA, including drone equipment. “The air war in Tripoli has officially entered a dangerous new phase and has become [a target of attack] by a foreign invading power: the UAE,” said Anas El Gomati, Director of the Sadeq Institute, a Libyan thinktank.  “Libya is still Libya, but it’s on the verge of becoming a Yemen on the Mediterranean. Haftar’s promise of enduring peace and stability is a myth. UAE drone strikes cannot deliver unity.” The LNA has also allegedly received aid from Saudi Arabia, with reports emerging that Riyadh had offered Haftar “tens of millions of dollars” to purchase troops and equipment for the invasion. More than 75,000 people have fled their homes in Northwestern Libya in the last two months due to the siege, and hundreds have been killed in the violent fighting both in and around the city. Meanwhile, thousands more are unable to flee, as the Tripoli airport has been shut down by authorities, leaving the city’s 2.5 million citizens stranded. As the invasion continues to grow more intense by the day, forces loyal to Haftar have also disrupted water pipelines to Tripoli in an armed attack on May 20. The city’s population has therefore been left without access to water. Though the humanitarian crisis is certainly not as severe as that in Yemen, the conditions in Libya’s Tripoli grow more and more similar to the conditions of Yemen’s Sana’a, and the potential that Libya will collapse into a state similar to Yemen’s grows more likely by the day. The West responds At no point during its history has the Libyan Crisis involved only Libyan nationals been isolated to participants within the country, rather, the Libyan Crisis has become seen blood spilled from nationals of countries around the world. Not long after the first bullet was fired in the Libyan Revolution did the international community move into the country like vultures flying to a carcass. However, the line between ally and enemy has often become blurred, and allegiances are constantly changing as the conflict progresses. Throughout 2019, while the LNA has received significant support from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Fayez al-Sarraj and the GNA have received the majority of their support from the United Nations and Turkey. Recently, on May 19, the GNA received a large shipment of armored vehicles and military equipment from Turkey, which the collapsing government hopes can help turn the tide in the battle against Haftar’s forces. “The GNA is fostering its forces defending Tripoli with armored vehicles, ammunition and quality weapons,” a pro-GNA coalition said on Facebook. Bolstered by its improved military hardware, the GNA has announced plans to retake occupied portions of the Tripolitania region from the Haftar military, though as it stands now, the engagement remains at a stalemate. The United States has been a major influence in the war since it began bombing the country in 2011 in an attempt to end Muammar Gaddafi’s 42-year reign. However, in April, Washington decided to pull their remaining forces from the country and watch the conflict progress from the sidelines. Donald Trump has, allegedly, given Haftar his support on behalf of the United States in regards to the assault on Tripoli in a phone call between the two men. This drastic shift in US policy towards Libya has reportedly come after discussions with Middle Eastern contacts which painted Haftar as a liberator fighting against jihadist forces in Tripoli. However, this narrative has not been entirely reflected in reality, according to numerous experts, who report that Haftar has no desire to promote democracy and that he himself employs Salafist militants in his forces. Not only a threat to Libya, a threat to North Africa  The move by the Libyan MPs displays a dangerous trend, and foreshadows the potential for the emergence of larger divisions between the Tobruk and Tripoli governments. Just as the Second Libyan Civil War began due to government fractionalization, conflict between the House of Representatives and the Government of National Accord threatens to awaken a larger conflict in Libya and North Africa as a whole. In April, Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita condemned the military escalation in Tripolitania, warning that it could lead to severe humanitarian and political issues in the region. “Morocco has been following the Libyan situation with great concern, especially in light of the military escalation at the entrance of Tripoli and the possible consequences in terms of human tragedy and damaging impact on the stability of this fellow Maghreb (North African) country,” Bourita said. Should the Maghrebi nation of Libya be plunged into an even more severe conflict, it would be catastrophic not only for the people of Libya, but for people in every country in North Africa. Meanwhile, each day that goes by we see Libya’s government grow more and more divided as Libya’s people suffer without an end in sight.

Rabat – The Ruling Justice and Development Party (PJD) has proposed a bill which would make it compulsory for members of parliament to declare assets and properties at their disposal.. Proposed by PJD member of parliament Abdessamad Mrimi, the bill, which contains 20 articles, aims to “increase transparency and protect the management of public funding.” The bill lays down laws that aim to regulate the manners in which declarations are to made and the measures to be taken against non-compliance to the new regulations.  According to Mrimi, the bill puts into force the the principle of good governance and accountability as stipulated under Article 158 of the constitution. Despite the absence of laws that regulate the declaration of assets under the 2011 constitution, the government will adhere to legislation from the former constitution, pending the drafting of the new regulations. The bill proposes that a range of legal provisions, which fall under different legal frameworks, be sorted out under one unified constitutional provision.

Rabat – The organizing committee for the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN 2019) has removed the flag of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) from the competition’s ticketing system. The decision comes after Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) contacted the organizing committee as well as the African Confederation of Football (CAF) to denounce the “provocative move.” The inclusion of the flag had also been strongly condemned by Moroccan media questioning Egypt’s position regarding Morocco’s territorial integrity as the so-called SADR is neither a member at CAF nor the International Football Federation (FIFA). The Egyptian Football Association argued that it was not responsible for the inclusion of the separatist flag and that it is “foreign company” who is responsible for managing the ticketing platform. Morocco considers any action in favor of the separatist as a red line for its territorial integrity. This is not the first time  that Cairo has provoked Rabat with regard to the Western Sahara conflict. Last month, A Moroccan delegation condemned the presence of a Polisario delegation at an African Union conference held in Egypt. The Egyptian ambassador to Rabat, however, denied that Egypt has any hostile intent  against Morocco’s territorial integrity, emphasizing that Cairo is a “very strong ally” to Morocco and would never challenge Rabat’s interests. According to the ambassador, Polisario’s presence was an AU requirement. “I can assure you that our position on Western Sahara is clear,” he said. “Egypt has not and will never recognize what is called Polisario,” he added.

Rabat – The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) has released statistics that are bound to confound critics of Morocco’s program of compulsory military service: large sections of Moroccan youth are indeed interested in joining the military to “serve their country.” In an announcement on its Facebook page over the weekend, the FAR gave detailed information about the latest developments in this year’s call for registration for compulsory service. Most notably, FAR’s announcement indicated the number of conscripts for this year is now set to be 15,000, up from the initial 10,000. According to FAR, the significant change in the initial target is due to the enthusiasm and the patriotic ardor of candidates. Although the program is not compulsory for women, FAR’s figures hint at a substantial interest among female recruits to join the program.
In total, 84,000 candidates, of whom 24,000 are female, have so far enlisted. The registration process began on April 9 and is expected to end on June 7. The selected candidates will be deployed in the social services branch of the FAR in Temara near Rabat as well as at the air and naval bases in the Casablanca region. 1,100 of the 15,000 selected will be female, FAR announced. The announcement comes in the aftermath of a heated debate over the return of compulsory military service, with critics suggesting that the move does not respond to the needs of young Moroccans. As Moroccan millennials aspire to other things, including proficiency in contemporary technical advances such artificial intelligence, one critic argued, imposing military service on young Moroccans was inconsiderate and “anachronistic.” But FAR’s announcement may have suggested that contrary to the barrage of heavy criticism that has marked debates about the military service policy, many young Moroccans actually see the policy in a positive light. The 50% increase in the initial target shows great enthusiasm from young Moroccans. In an interview with Moroccan outlet Telquel, Hassnaa Bellaziz, who was the first female candidate to register for the service, spoke passionately of her eagerness to be among the selected candidates. Bellaziz says she is ready to resign from her current job to both “realize my childhood dream” and serve her country. “Military service will allow me to give something back to my country, and that makes me proud,” said the 22-year-old.

Rabat – Comedian Amine Radi, who filmed himself being beaten by a policeman, has allegedly violated several traffic codes, Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribia reported. On Saturday,  Moroccan comedian Amine Radi filmed himself as he was verbally and physically assaulted by a traffic police officer in Casablanca. The video was met with mixed reactions. Prior to the attack, Radi was commenting on how the policeman called him a “donkey” while telling him to stop. “We are in 2019 in Morocco, and a policeman stops me saying ‘stop donkey.” The live video also shows the policeman assaulting him as he was trying to show his followers the police officer with a live stream.  Al Ahdath Al Maghribia wrote today that Radi has violated traffic code. The newspaper said that the comedian was driving on the wrong side of the road and without a seat belt, which is against the traffic code. Radi filed a complaint against the policeman after the incident. The General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) has opened an investigation to determine the circumstances.. The DGSN added that the General Inspectorate of National Security also launched an administrative investigation regarding the incident. “The prefectural police of Casablanca has conducted a judicial investigation under the supervision of a competent prosecutor,” said a spokesperson for the DGSN. Depending on the findings of the investigation, the officer may be charged for assault  and/or abuse of power.

Rabat – Moroccan Minister of Education, Said Amzazi, has called on medical students to abandon strikes and to go back to their classrooms to attend lectures before the end of the academic year. On Monday at the House of Representatives, Amzazi said that the Ministry of Education has taken the necessary measures to make up for the time that medical students missed during the continuous strikes. He added that the ministry has decided on the dates of exams. During the session for MP’s questions at the House of Representatives, the minister said that the exams will take place in accordance with the decided schedule.  “Those who will take the exams are are welcome, and those who will miss it should shoulder their responsibility,” said Amzazi. On Sunday, the medical students decided to continue their strike and not to attend lectures or training at medical centers.

Despite several rounds of talks, medical students are still insisting that they will not return to their studies.

Rabat – King Mohammed VI inaugurated a local medical center at the Sidi Moumen district in Casablanca on Monday. The project is in line with King Mohammed VI’s approach to improve medical services for all citizens, especially for vulnerable groups.  The construction of the project, which is sponsored by the Mohammed V Foundation  for Solidarity, was launched by the King in October, 2016. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that the facility will  benefit nearly 500,000 people in the region. The center will include consultation rooms, emergency rooms, maternal and child care, as well as a  section specialized in cardiology and ophthalmology consultations.  It also includes an oral care unit, as well as a medical analysis laboratory, a sterilization unit and a medical unit. Other welcome inclusions are an orthopedic rehabilitation unit and a medical-technical center.  MAP added that the facility is equipped with the latest generation equipment.  The medical center has 21 general practitioners, emergency doctors and specialists, as well as 38 nurses. The project  is among the list of other medical facilities that King Mohammed VI inaugurated throughout Ramadan. On  May 16, King Mohammed VI opened the Regional Center for Oral Hygiene in Rabat’s Yaacoub El Mansour district.

Rabat – The organizing committee of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) including the Polisario Front self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in the newly unveiled ticketing services for this year’s CAN. On a ticketing website, the CAN 2019’s organizing committee launched last week for fans of the qualified teams to claim their “Fan ID” for the tournament features the flag of SADR, a Tindouf-based self-styled republic proclaimed by the separatist Polisario Front. Morocco considers support for SADR a red line for its geopolitical interests and national sovereignty, fueling apprehensions that the move might complicate the already frosty Rabat-Cairo relations. But the move is even more surprising as SADR is not among the 24 squads qualified for the continental footballing showpiece. Nor is the self-styled republic a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), nor of the International Football Federation (FIFA). The Egyptian committee’s move comes in the aftermath of sluggish moves from both Rabat and Cairo to address the shaky diplomatic ties between the two North African countries. In protestation at the CAN 2019 committee’s move, the Moroccan Royal Football Federation sent a letter requesting clarification of the “provocative move.” In its defense, however, the Egyptian Football Association said that it is not responsible for the move. “It is a foreign company that in charge of managing the [ticketing] platform,” a spokesperson of the Egyptian FA said. Not satisfied with Egypt’s response, Morocco has lodged a complaint with the CAF executive board. The news comes on the heel of alleged Morocco-Egypt divergences on continental affairs. In April, the presence in Egypt of a Polisario delegation at an African Union (AU) conference raised eyebrows in Rabat, with suggestions that the already weak relations between the two countries may get even colder. Amid suggestions of a Morocco-Egypt rift, however, Achraf Ibrahim, the Egyptian ambassador in Rabat, said last month that his county is a “very strong ally” to Morocco and would never challenge Rabat’s interests. Ibrahim played down the implications of Polisario’s presence at the Cairo conference in April, saying that the front’s presence was an AU requirement rather than an Egyptian policy. “I can assure you that our position on Western Sahara is clear,” the Egyptian said, adding that “Egypt has not and will never recognize what is called Polisario.” But as the surprise inclusion of SADR in the CAN ticketing system implies recognition of the group’s claim to statehood, it remains to be seen whether Rabat will take public pronouncements of pro-Rabat sentiment—and denials of wrongdoing—at face value.

Rabat – In the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order on information and communications technology security, technology giant Google suspended its future services to the Chinese electronic devices manufacturer Huawei, on May 19. “We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,” stated a Google spokesperson to Reuters. President Trump has recently signed an executive order to ban American companies from dealing with any foreign telecommunication technology providers who are considered to pose a threat to US national security. Google’s suspension of services to Huawei concerns “the transfer of hardware, software and technical services,” reported Reuters sources. However, services that are “publicly available via open source licensing” are exempt from this decision. The Google spokesperson also noted that users of current versions of Huawei devices connected with Google are not affected and will continue to have access to Google applications and updates. Future versions of Huawei smartphones, however, are “unlikely to have access to Google’s popular services, including Gmail, YouTube and maps unless a special license is obtained,” said Reuters. Huawei, who will be one of the most affected by the new executive order, is a leading information and communications technology manufacturer that has been at the center heightened trade and political tensions between the US and China over the last few months. The US has repeatedly accused China of using its technological equipment to spy on American networks. Huawei has denied these accusations and offered to sign a “no-spy” agreement. Google has significant international market power via its Play Store services. Without Google’s software and Android updates in its future smartphones, Huawei’s future remains unknown.

Rabat – Arab media announced that one of the rockets was aimed toward Mecca and the other for Jeddah. Saudi Arabia intercepted the Houthi ballistic rockets fired by Yemen over Taif on Monday, as stated by Saudi news outlet Al Arabiya. A week ago, Saudi Arabia announced that the Houthi had released drones which struck two Saudi oil siphoning stations. Referring to a source from Haaretz website, Yemen’s Houthi-controlled SABA news office said on Sunday that the attack on the oil stations was the start of military campaign targeting 300 crucial bases.  Different targets included a military base camp and offices in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia as well as bases in Yemen, SABA cited the source as saying.  Saudi Arabia’s Defense Minister blamed Iran for ordering the assault on the Saudi oil siphoning stations which was carried out by Yemen’s Houthi rebel army.  A week ago, a state-run Saudi paper called for “surgical” U.S. strikes to counter threats from Iran.  The Arab News distributed an article in English, suggesting that following the attacks this week, the Saudi coalition will be moving forward with “surgical strikes.”  Response to Saudi Arabia’s calls Following the drone attacks, King Salman of Saudi Arabia invited leaders to a meeting of the Arab League to discuss “aggressions and their consequences.” The meetings will take place on May 30.  Bahrain, Djibouti, and UAE have responded to the invitation.  The announcement comes after Saudi Arabia accused Iran of ordering the assaults against the two Saudi oil siphoning stations at Yanbu, on the west coast of Saudi Arabia.  The stations were hit by drones loaded down with explosives on May 14.  The terrorist acts, ordered by the regime in Tehran, and carried out by the Houthis, are tightening the noose around the ongoing political efforts,” said King Salman’s son Prince Khalid bin Salman. While the assault was carried out by the Houthis, Saudi Arabia maintains that the order came for Iran.  “We are not agents for anyone,” Head of the Houthis’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, told Reuters. He added: “We make decisions independently and do not take orders for drones or anything else.” Saudi Arabia wishes to avoid a war with Iran, however, have stated that they will take the necessary military action if provoked.

Rabat – The Moroccan Embassy to Spain held an iftar for female seasonal workers in Spain, on the occasion of Muslims’ holy month of Ramadan. Held in collaboration with Chaabi Bank, the Iftar banquet took place in Spain’s southwestern province of Huelva at the family-run company Surexport, on Sunday, May 19, to celebrate the female Moroccans who work in Spanish fruit production.  farms.  Commending the collaborative relationship between Spain and Morocco, Moroccan ambassador to Spain, Karima Benyaich, said, “since his ascension to the throne, His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Morocco has achieved considerable progress regarding the promotion of women’s rights.”  She added that the Moroccan government supports these female seasonal workers, whom she described as a model for circular immigration, from the very get-go to the very end. The number of seasonal workers operating in Spain has witnessed a sharp increase in the last two decades, from 300 hands in 2003 to 20,000 in 2019, which sets an “excellent” example not only for the Moroccan-Spanish bilateral cooperation but also an “exemplary experience” at the international stage. This, she said, is realized thanks to Morocco’s “regular and orderly” migration model. Moroccans have been migrating to Spain steadily since the 1980s. The Moroccan population now totals 812.412, the largest foreign population next to Romanians. The Deputy director of Surexport stated that Moroccan seasonal workers have a level of professionalism, helping them run their company in the best possible conditions. He added that the company in return offer them the best working and living conditions as a form of respect and thanks for their contribution.

Rabat – The White House has uncovered the first phase of the Trump administration’s much-awaited “deal of the century” for the Israel-Palestine Conflict. The deal appears to put greater emphasis on the economic and human development approach to crisis management, reiterating the Trump administration’s desire to go beyond what it perceives as decades of ideological and ineffective diplomacy in the Palestine-Israel question. In its latest announcement on the preparation phase of the “deal of the century,” Washington referred to plans for a workshop on the economic prospects of the deal, in late June of this year. On Sunday, the White House announced that it was organizing a “Peace to Prosperity” workshop in Manama, Bahrain, on June 25 and 26. Washington said the workshop is expected to bring together finance ministers along with global and regional business leaders to discuss the economic future of the disputed regions once a permanent solution is brokered. The choice of finance ministers and business leaders instead of foreign affairs ministers and diplomats is a sufficient indication of the current White House’s plan to upend the traditional way in which the US has tried to broker a peace deal in the Middle East’s longest running and most complex crisis. Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, who is believed to be the mastermind behind Trump’s Middle East deal, told CNN on Sunday that one crucial element of the Trump administration’s philosophy in the Palestinian conflict is to draw attention to aspects of the crisis that have been willfully ignored by successive Washington establishments. According to Kushner, the deal’s central idea is to get past decades of apparently unfounded hostility and move forward, towards a “realistic and viable” political future for the region. Kushner said, “People are letting their grandfathers’ conflict destroy their children’s futures. This will present an exciting, realistic and viable pathway forward that does not currently exist.” At the Manama workshop, participants are expected to dodge the political—and by extension social—aspects of the conflict, especially pertaining to the fate of Palestinians’ demand for an independent state as well as the status of Jerusalem. Instead, debates will revolve around ways to make the disputed regions—especially Gaza and the West Bank—investment hubs and more business-friendly metropoles. Veiled in Trump’s grand plan is the push to modernize and develop the region to subsume Palestinians’ grievances and demands for self-determination. Kushner explained that the first phase of the project will consist in devising an economic plan for the aftermath of the conflict. With infrastructure, industry, financial empowerment, and grand investments as its core elements, the economic plan will aim at making “the [disputed] area as investible as possible,” according to Kushner. Also central in the White House’s announcement of its “Peace to Prosperity” conference is the Trump’s administration’s confidence that its way is the only way. Even as Trump faced—and continues to face—an outpouring of criticism over his unapologetically Evangelical and overwhelmingly Israel-friendly stance on the Middle East’s oldest conflict, the US president has remained unbowed. Judging by Sunday’s announcement, the Trump administration seems to ooze an unbreakable attachment to the security of Israel. But the deal’s principal selling point is that, while upholding Israel’s security concerns, the plan will simultaneously guarantee human development and economic prosperity opportunities for Palestinians. According to the White House, the workshop aims to “facilitate discussions on an ambitious achievable vision and framework for a prosperous future for the Palestinians.” But while Trump wants to kill two birds with one stone—bend the peace plan to Israel’s will while providing guarantees for better economic prospects for Palestinians, the Palestinian leadership is not buying Trump’s idea. Instead, a number of senior Palestinian officials said in the aftermath of the White House’ announcement, Palestinians will not bow down to “blackmail” from Washington. Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesperson to Palestine’s Mahmoud Abas, said that there will be no genuine peace discussions if the political aspect of the conflict is not given the spotlight it deserves. “Any plan without political horizons will not lead to peace,” the Palestinian official said. Saeb Erekat, a well-known Palestinian senior diplomat and negotiator, was even punchier and more scathing in his assessment of Trump’s deal. Erekat complained that the Trump administration did consult the Palestinian leadership about the “reported workshop—neither over the content, nor the outcome, nor timing.” Having been previously adamant that Trump’s Jerusalem move definitely disqualified him as a “serious and reliable broker,” the Palestinian diplomat said in reaction to the planned deal that Palestinians will not engage with Trump’s peace terms. “All efforts to make the oppressor and the oppressed coexist are doomed to fail,” Erekat said. “We do not submit to blackmail and we do not trade our political rights for money.”

Rabat – The 19-year-old singer of Moroccan origin, Bilal Hassani, placed 14th while representing France at the 64th edition of the international singing competition, Eurovision, on May 18. Hassani, who chose to perform his original song “Roi” (King), expressed no disappointment at placing 14th, telling a backstage interviewer that his dream was already realized by simply competing in the competition. “I’m just too happy, my dream came true when I set foot on stage to start singing “King,” and the rest was a bonus, 14th is very, very good.” he said. “I said it from the beginning, my interest was following this adventure, to participate in Eurovision and to do this performance in particular, to present this piece, to really send an honest message to people that they can be what they want to be, and that they can live as who they are,” Bilani continued.  Born in Paris to Moroccan parents, Hassani began singing as a child and competed on “The Voice Kids” in 2015. As a teenager, Hassani began creating his songs and posting them to his growing following on social media.  Hassani is openly gay and has a gender-neutral style, and much of his music explores his experiences in LGBTQ community. His song King, which he performed for Eurovision, has over 7 million views on his Youtube channel, which has over 1 million subscribers. The song is an anthem for self-acceptance and being true to oneself. Although Hassani realized his dream of performing at Eurovision, the 19-year-old faced discrimination along the way. In January, Hassani lodged a lawsuit against unnamed defendants for “insults, incitement to hatred and violence and homophobic threats.” The organization Stop Homophobia supported the lawsuit.  Hassani’s lawyer says that the singer has been targeted by over 1,500 homophobic tweets and has also received death threats. The competition was won by another LGBTQ member, Dutch representative Duncan Laurence. The bisexual singer used the moment to send a message in support of the LGBT community, saying people should be seen for who they are irrespective of their sexuality. Many chose to boycott the event  Eurovision has been marred by controversy and protests this year due to their choice of Israel as a host country, with many public figures calling for a boycott of the event. Icelandic group Hatari raised Palestinian flags during their appearance at the competition in Israel, causing audible gasps. Pop icon Madonna made a similar gesture during her performance at the event, with a Palestinian flag being featured on the back of her backing dancer’s costumes, alongside the Israeli flag on the back of another dancer as the two walked off stage arm-in-arm. Palestinian Campaign For The Academic And Cultural Boycott Of Israel (PACBI) released a statement in response to the gestures, saying the most meaningful thing the performers could have done is boycott the event completely and the gesture “cannot offset the harm they do to our human rights struggle by balancing their complicit act with some project with the Palestinians.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI was not satisfied with his recent visit to Casablanca, where he performed Friday’s prayer on Friday, May 17. Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported that the king had expressed his dissatisfaction with the progress of various socio-economic projects, which “should” be opened soon. Throughout the holy month of Ramadan, King Mohammed VI has opened several new health facilities including the Rabat Regional Dental Care Center. Al Massae, however, reported that, during his visit to Casablanca, the King noticed several incomplete projects that should n, according to their schedules, be due for completion very soon. Quoting authorities in the region, Al Massae added that the delays might cause sanctions among elected officials and directors of development agencies for not regularly inspecting the projects. The newspaper said that the  Casa Amenagement, a public limited liability company based in Casablanca is to blame for the delay in the socio-economic projects.  The newspaper added that a budget of MAD 26 billion has been allocated to the company for the development of the city. Casa Amenagement website has featured a list of projects, which are complete or currently in construction, for the development of the city. Among the projects is the CasaArts, a cultural project which aims to promote culture in the region.  The project is was launched in October 2014. The company said that the project might be completed in September 2019, with a progress of 97 %. “Multidisciplinary space dedicated to all “scene based” art forms (Theatre, dance, music, musical comedies…) it will welcome cultural and artistic shows and events of international standards all year long,” according to the company.  Casa Amenagement also said that the project has been allocated a  budget of MAD 1,44 billion global investment. Most of the sites in the Casa Amenagement project are still under construction, , including the Arab League Park.  The project, which cost MAD 100 million should be completed in June 2019.    “The project of rehabilitation and upgrading of the Arab League Park will be done in line with the fundamentals of landscaping from the beginning of the previous century, as well as the contemporary standards of the environment and equipment,” the company said. This is not the first time when Moroccan newspapers reported that the King has expressed anger over delays in the completion of projects in the city of Casablanca. In January, Moroccan newspaper Assabah said that the monarch spent no more than 24 hours in Casablanca after he opened the extension of the Casablanca Tramway Line 2 on January 23, because he was angry with the city’s officials and especially the local government. Elected officials in the region had not followed up with some development projects which were making sufficient progress according to planning.

Rabat – Since taking office, American president Donald Trump has followed a businessman’s model in politics. He has recently applied this approach to the conflict in Palestine with the unveiling of his long-awaited Middle East Peace Plan, which has placed economic considerations above political ones. On Sunday, May 19, the White House announced that the long-awaited Middle East Peace Plan spearheaded by US President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner would begin in June, following the end of Ramadan. Focusing first on improving economic conditions in the region, the plan would begin with a conference in Bahrain focused on investment and economic development. According to the announcement, the conference would center around improving conditions in the West Bank and Gaza, funded primarily by wealthier Gulf and Arab nations. However, shortly following the announcement of the conference, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh revealed that the Palestinian Authority had not been consulted with, or involved in pre-conference planning and negotiation. “The cabinet wasn’t consulted about the reported workshop, neither over the content, nor the outcome nor timing,” Shtayyeh said on Monday. With the consideration that the conference was principally focused on development within Palestinian territory, the lack of consultation with Palestinian Authority has been widely regarded by Palestinians as insulting. In response, the Palestinian Authority has announced a boycott of the conference, citing concerns that the economic focus of the project would disrupt any real prospects for a successful peace. “We will inform Bahrain that we will not take part in such a conference,” said Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestinian State President Mahmoud Abbas. “We will not sell our country based on an economic project.” The Palestinian Authority has also voiced their opposition to the plan based on the lack of consideration for the Palestinian perspective regarding negotiations and participation in the conference. “There will be no Palestinian participation in the Manama workshop,” said Ahmed Majdalani, Palestine’s Social Development Minister. “Any Palestinian who would take part would be be nothing but a collaborator for the Americans and Israel.” This is not the first occasion where negotiations have broken down, breakdowns in communication and cooperation have long plagued peace projects and negotiation in the region. Meanwhile, the myriad of conflicting perspectives on conflict resolution mean that a resolution for lasting peace remains out of reach. The American vision for Israel Trump’s friendly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is no secret. From the US recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, to blaming Hamas for ongoing flare-ups in regional conflict, the US remain firmly in the Israeli camp . In addition, much of the population of the United States continues to support Israel over Palestine, with the most recent Gallup poll showing that 64 percent of Americans sympathize with Israel over Palestine, the highest level it has reached in over three decades. This swelling in American support for Israel has manifested in numerous ways, including a massive leap in Israeli funding towards West Bank settlements. Since the beginning of Trump’s presidency in 2017, funding has jumped to $459 million from $330 million in the previous year. Thus far, Washington has been unyielding in its support for Israel’s territorial claims and continues to forge peace strategies which allow Israel to maintain its influence and power in the region. This became even more clear in early May, when Kushner indicated that the US may withdraw from its previous approach which focused on a two-state solution. “If you say ‘two-state’, it means one thing to the Israelis, it means one thing to the Palestinians,” Kushner said. “We said, you know, let’s just not say it. Let’s just say, let’s work on the details of what this means,” Palestinian-US relations reach boiling point The Palestinian Authority has been equally unyielding in its demands for liberation and independence from Israel Condemning the proposed plan, the Palestinian Authority, cited concerns that it would be a “consecration” of Palestinian suffering. “The US ‘deal of the century’ is the consecration of our century-old ordeal: no independence, no sovereignty, no freedom, no justice,” said Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki.  “And if they do not think that this situation will have an impact on the future of Israel and the region, one way or the other, they are the ones that are delusional, not us.” The conflicting American and Palestinian perspectives were exacerbated in 2017, when the Palestinian Authority severed ties with the US government following a string of hostile moves by the United States and Israel. Among these decisions was the slashing of hundreds of millions of dollars of US aid to United Nations designed for projects in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as cutting funding for hospitals in Jerusalem which provide medical services for Palestinians. As a result, the gap between Palestine and Israel has continued to grow wider, and this plan has been as heavily opposed as those in the past. “This is not a peace plan but rather conditions for surrender,” al-Maliki said. “And there is no amount of money that can make it acceptable.”

The Moroccan company has signed a deal with the government of the Ivory Coast in a move to improve health services in the west African nation.  Agentis, who specialize in the distribution of medical, paramedical and surgical equipment, will build and fit-out two regional scale hospitals in Aboisso (120 km south-east of Abidjan) and Adzope (105 km north of Abidjan). The Moroccan medical company will also build five health service hubs in the towns of Abengourou (medical imagery), Daoukro (emergency services) north of Abidjan , Seguela (emergency services), and Toumodi (traumatology) north-east of Abidjan, as well as in the small north-eastern town of Bouna (including a laboratory, an operating block, emergency services, a maternity ward and a pediatric unit). Construction of the hospitals and centers is due to be completed in 16 months, reports Maghreb Arab Press (MAP). Agentis is already present in Ivory Coast. In 2017 it opened the country’s first radiotherapy and oncology unit. “Agentis was chosen for its expertise and its commitment, which were confirmed after the building of the national Alassane Outtara center for oncology and radiotherapy ,” said the ambassador of Morocco in Ivory Coast Abdelmalek Kettani.  “It is another sign of Ivory Coast’s confidence in the Moroccan operator,” he added.  He also noted the contract was “extremely important,” showing Ivory Coast’s commitment to develop its health services. The Director of Agentis Adil Mesfioui noted that the contract was yet another example of the “south-south” cooperation promoted by King Mohammed VI and Alassane Ouattara the president of the Ivory Coast.

Rabat – In Durham, an area in Manchester, England, Reverend Lissa Scott and Gerald Lee, a former mayor in the region, invited Muslim men and women to use the aisles of St Matthew and St Luke’s churches as a place of prayer. The invitation was for an event the two churches were planning to hold to celebrate Ramadan, a holy time for Muslims. The Muslims were offered separate spaces for men and women. In further sensitivity to Islamic beliefs, images of Jesus and the cross were to be covered. According to minutes from the meeting on May 9, where these plans were discussed,“ one aisle in church [was] to be cleared of chairs for Muslim men to say prayers.” Gerald Lee wishes to strengthen “racial harmony” with his group, Celebrating Communities, which organizes diverse social events. One of the portraits of Jesus which would have been covered is a well-known copy of The Light of the World by the pre-Raphaelite artist William Holman Hunt. In opposition to the idea of Muslims praying in the church, the Diocese of Durham denied permission to hold Islamic prayers in the church building. He argued that doing so is against church law, as non-Christian worship is not allowed in a Church of England building. A representative of the Diocese said, “they realize that the vicar made a silly mistake.” Christian Episcopal Church Bishop Gavin Ashenden also disapproved of the plans, because they would “disrespect Jesus.” “When Muslims come into our church, we invite them to come in and respect Jesus. If we accepted an invitation to go into a mosque, we would respect Muhammad,” he said. “Islam and Christianity are not Abrahamic cousins in Middle Eastern religion. They’re actually antithetic to each other.” The event celebrating Ramadan is still being held. The new area for Muslims to pray, however, is yet to be announced.

The French State Secretary for Digital Affairs Cedric O has stated that France will offer support to Morocco’s tech industry, helping build the capacity of Moroccan start-ups through training and development. O addressed the Moroccan Press Agency (MAP) at the annual Vivatech conference in Paris, a technology exhibit bringing together more than 9000 start-ups and 1900 investors from all over the world. Sixteen Moroccan start-ups attended Vivatech this year, raising Morocco’s international profile in the tech industry. O acknowledged that France benefits greatly from Morocco’s tech expertise and indicated it would give back to Morocco. “Today, in tech, France can rely heavily on Moroccan talents, but this must done in a win-win way,” O told MAP. In 2017, France launched the French Visa Tech program, which simplifies visa procedures for French companies wanting to hire expertise from overseas. Over 10,000 French companies are eligible for the French Visa Tech program and many have already been hiring Moroccan talent. O met with the Moroccan Minister of Industry Moulay Hafid Elalamy at Vivatech and explained that through a win-win partnership, France would continue to benefit from Moroccan talent, but that France would also “come to Morocco to help Moroccan companies develop and train staff.” “We are working towards this,” O confirmed, without providing more information on a specific time frame for this initiative. Morocco has been pushing a digital strategy forward, recognizing the transformative role that technology has on its economy. In 2017, the Ministry of Industry set up the National Digital Development Agency (ADD) to support digital initiatives in public administrations, as well as in the private sector. “We will make sure our young people who are interested in innovation and the digital sector are properly supported and have possibilities and opportunities including the internationalization of their start-ups,” Elalamy said at Vivatech. Brain drain Brain drain is a concern for Morocco. According to a 2018 survey by Moroccan employment company Rekrute, 91% of Moroccans want to work overseas, to improve their quality of life and their work environments. According to Salwa Belkeziz Karki, the president of the Moroccan Federation of Information Technology, 8000 managerial level employees in the IT sector actually leave Morocco every year, reported Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Youm last year. Some Moroccan companies are working hard to stop the digital brain drain. IT giant Everis, with offices in Casablanca and Tetouan, has recently set up  set up a flexible work program for its employees. By promoting better work-life balance through flexible work hours and remote working, it hopes to retain its best staff.

Rabat – The Minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs, Ahmed Toufiq, said on Friday that King Mohammed VI has authorized the opening of 20 mosques, some newly built or reconstructed and others reopened after restoration.  Speaking before the Sovereign after the Friday prayer at the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Toufiq said that the Ministry had allocated MAD 253 million for the building of 7 new mosques, the reconstruction of 9 others, and the restoration of four large historic mosques, with a total capacity of 27,000 faithful. King Mohammed VI has named two of the newly opened mosques, “Al Masjid Al Aadham” in Tamesna and the Great Mosque of Nador, after himself. Toufiq added that an action plan based on a national mapping of the needs for worship places has been prepared. In addition to preserving the functional and aesthetic characteristics of the Moroccan mosque, compliance with legal provisions, attention to economic needs, and required technical standards will help ensure adherence to the new plan. Toufiq emphasized that the requirements must be respected in construction projects of new mosques both by the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs and by benefactors, adding that new mosques are included each year in a strategic plan to promote places of worship at the national, regional, and local levels. The Minister added that 2,173 mosques have been opened over the past 20 years, noting that many of them, particularly small and medium-sized ones, have been built by benefactors. The Ministry provided assistance to some of these benefactors, who also benefited from tax exemptions under the High Royal Instructions. Toufiq invoked that in parallel with construction sites, a Dahir organizing the control of the mosque building state was published, stressing that the results of the census and operations of control carried out on the basis of the Dahir have led to the rehabilitation of 1,000 mosques. The Minister noted that within the same strategic plan, a program for the preservation of historic mosques was also executed, adding that 70 mosques have been renovated, with a budget of MAD 650 million. The legislation on places of worship had also been reviewed, which requires benefactors wishing to build mosques to organize themselves within associations created by the law, as it regulated the way in which States subsidies are granted to these associations and the control of fundraising.

Rabat – The director of John Wick 3, Chad Stahelski, revealed to Entertainment Weekly that filming was almost derailed thanks to the thousands of cats that call Essaouira home.  “The Moroccans are not big on canines. Love a f—ing cat, though,” the director said. We show up to shoot (…) there were literally a thousand cats, okay? And these cats (…) they’re not afraid of anything.” The situation was complicated further by the two Belgian Malinois dogs in the scene being filmed, who were reportedly constantly distracted by chasing cats.  “You want that dog focused on what he’s supposed to bite, and what he’s not supposed to bite. Hit the mark, right? And there’s ten cats walking around and you’re going, ‘Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.” “You’re sitting behind the monitor going, ‘what’s the dog looking at? What’s the dog looking at? Oh my god, oh my god, he’s going to bite — Argh!’ It got a little crazy between cat-wrangling, and dog-wrangling, and people-wrangling,” Chad Stahelski explained. The original John Wick, released in 2014, was received to great success, bringing in USD 88 million worldwide. The second chapter of the saga smashed the previous figure with USD 171 million at the box office. The story is about follows Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired hitman and widower, who goes on a mad killing spree after Russian gangsters steal his car and kill his dog. John Wick 2 continues the story, introducing a council of crime bosses who run the world. The third installment in the thriller series is expected to pick up the cliffhanger from the previous movie when Wick disappears while being pursued by the entire criminal underworld. John Wick 3 was released on May 17.

Rabat – King Salman of Saudi Arabia has invited leaders of Arab countries and Gulf states for two urgent meetings to discuss “aggressions and their consequences” across the region. The meetings are expected to take place on May 30. The call received a nod from several countries, including Bahrain, Djibouti, and UAE. The statement comes after Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of ordering the attacks against the two Saudi oil pumping stations at Yanbu, on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. The stations were hit by drones laden with explosives on May 14. “The terrorist acts, ordered by the regime in Tehran, and carried out by the Houthis, are tightening the noose around the ongoing political efforts,” said King Salman’s son Prince Khalid bin Salman. “The attack by the Iranian-backed Houthi militias against the two Aramco pumping stations proves that these militias are merely a tool that Iran’s regime uses to implement its expansionist agenda in the region, and not to protect the people of Yemen as the Houthis falsely claim,” he tweeted. Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, but Saudi Arabia insists that Iran has ordered the attacks. “We are not agents for anyone,” head of the Houthis’ Supreme Revolutionary Committee Mohammed Ali al-Houthi told Reuters. He added: “We make decisions independently and do not take orders for drones or anything else.” In response, Saudi Arabia launched a call for emergency meetings to discuss the development in the region. Saudi Arabia said that it is avoiding a war with Iran, but it would respond to any actions if necessary. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not want a war in the region nor does it seek that,” Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir has said. “[Saudi Arabia] will do what it can to prevent this war and at the same time it reaffirms that in the event the other side chooses war, the kingdom will respond with all force and determination, and it will defend itself and its interests.”

The suspect was the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by French authorities in 2017 for links with drug trafficking entities. In addition to providing critical intelligence in a number of joint anti-terrorism operations with partner countries in the past years, Moroccan security services are doubling their contributions in other security cooperation mechanisms. Cooperation ranges from tracking individuals under international arrest warrants to the identification of networks of illegal psychotropic drugs traffickers.

Rabat – Iceland’s representatives at Eurovision, punk band Hatari, are making waves after they raised Palestinian flags during their appearance at the competition in Israel.  Hatari displayed the Palestinian flags as the results of the competition were being announced, leading to audible gasps in the crowd.  Absolute scenes as Iceland unveil Palestine banners to actual, audible gasps #Eurovision pic.twitter.com/f5ObNt653l — Jon Brady (@jonbradyphoto) May 18, 2019 In a statement, Eurovision said the “consequences of this action” will be discussed by the contest’s executive board. “In the live broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final, Hatari, the Icelandic act, briefly displayed small Palestinian banners whilst sat in the Green Room. “The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political event and this directly contradicts the Contest rules. The banners were quickly removed and the consequences of this action will be discussed by the Reference Group (the Contest’s executive board) after the Contest,” the statement read. Pop icon Madonna conveyed a similar message during her performance at the event, with Palestinian flag being featured on the back of her dancer’s attire, alongside the Israeli flag on the back of another dancer as the two walked off stage arm-in-arm. Eurovision, an international singing competition which gathers representatives from most European countries, has been marred by controversy and protests this year due to their choice of Israel as a host country, with many public figures calling for a boycott of the event. Palestinian Campaign For The Academic And Cultural Boycott Of Israel (PACBI) released a statement in response to Hatari’s gesture, saying the most meaningful thing the group could have done is boycott the event completely and the gesture “cannot offset the harm they do to our human rights struggle by balancing their complicit act with some project with the Palestinians.” Palestinian civil society overwhelmingly rejects fig-leaf gestures of solidarity from international artists crossing our peaceful picket line #Hatari #BoycottEurovision2019 #ESC2019 #Eurovision2019 #esf19 #EurovisionSongContest #DareToDreamTogether #DareToDream #Eurovision pic.twitter.com/IP5MaTfQrQ — PACBI (@PACBI) May 18, 2019 The statement called for a complete withdrawal of all contest from the competition as opposed to “fig-leafing” gestures.

Rabat – Recent figures from the Moroccan Foreign Exchange Office show that Ireland topped the list countries with regard to foreign direct investment (FDI) in Morocco, outperforming France, whose net FDI flow stood at MAD 8.12 billion ($ 839 million) in 2018 and MAD 7.73 billion ($799 million) in 2017.  According to the office, foreign direct investment from Ireland stood at MAD 9.7 billion, making the country the main investor in the Moroccan kingdom. Slipping down to second place was France, with a net flow of MAD 3.77 billion ($389 million), followed by Denmark with MAD 3.18 billion ($328 million), then the United Arab Emirates, with MAD 2.79 billion ($288 million), and United States with a MAD 2.19 billion ($226 million) net flow.  Spain held the sixth position despite witnessing an uptick in net flow from MAD 1.29 billion ($133 million) in 2017 to MAD 1.98 billion ($204 million) in 2018.  Foreign direct investment net flows injected in Morocco totaled MAD 34.16 billion in 2018, a marked increase of 25.9% the previous year after the North African country witnessed a decline in foreign direct investment in 2014 and 2015 following the global recession. Foreign direct investment from Ireland is mainly going towards the insurance sector.  A chart of revenue from direct investment from the Exchange Office shows that the investors are attracted by several activities, including the insurance activities (MAD 9.6 billion) in 2018 and commerce for MAD 55 million. Japan also witnessed considerable growth in terms of FDI in Morocco, rising from MAD 5 million in 2017 to MAD 1.58 billion in 2018. In 2017, Morocco placed among the top 5 host countries of foreign direct investment, according to the 2018 world Investment Report. The index shows that there are three areas that attracted foreign investment in 2018, accounting for more than half of direct investment in the country, namely insurance and finance services, totaling MAD 9.66 billion last year; the real estate sector, with MAD 5.35 billion; and manufacturing industries, with MAD 4.88 billion.

Rabat – Forbes has listed Morocco’s Attijariwafa Bank and the Populaire Bank among the 2000 world’s largest public companies in its 17th annual ranking issued on May 15. Forbes ranked Attijariwafa Bank at the 1143 position with $4.1 billion of sales, and  $608 million of profits. Morocco’s Banque Centrale Populaire was ranked 1855 with $2.4 billion of sales, $313 million of profits, and $5 billion of market value. Forbes said that the firms on this year’s ranking account for “more than $40 trillion in revenue this year and more than $186 trillion in global assets.” The company makes its ranking based on a “composite score from equally-weighted measures of the revenue, profits, assets and market value, and the results reveal the major trends shaping the global economy this year.” China topped the list with its Industrial and Commercial Bank, for the seventh year in a row. Forbes said that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China “oversees more than $4 trillion in assets and employs nearly half a million people. “ “The financial sector overall had a good year, too: The rest of China’s “Big Four” banks all made the top ten, and JPMorgan Chase climbed up to the second spot due to rising profits thanks in part to major tax cuts,” according to Forbes.

Rabat – The poll was put to 3,200 Americans, who were asked whether or not they think the Arabic numeric system should be used in the US. Fifty-six percent of participants said no. Seemingly an education-related question devoid of controversy, the poll highlights the bias – unconscious or otherwise – of Americans against Arabs. The statistics show the ignorance of many Americans, as well as bigotry that is found increasingly throughout the US.  At least fifty-six percent of the individuals polled fail to realize that the Arabic numerical system is the one they use. While only 29% of respondents said that they wouldn’t object to Arabic numerals being taught in schools, and 16% said they had no opinion on the matter. The results can be explained by the steady growth of Islamophobia in the US fostered by the rise in right-wing politics and Donald Trump’s presidency.  CivicScience Inc. CEO John Dick tweeted the results of the poll, commenting “Ladies and Gentlemen: the saddest and funniest testament to American bigotry we’ve ever seen in our data”.

Rabat – Sheikh Muhammad Hussein, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, expressed his gratitude towards Morocco for its unwavering support in favor of the Palestinian cause. On Friday, Sheikh Hussein commended King Mohammed VI’s firm position to support and defend Palestinians legitimate rights. The sheikh made his remarks during a ceremony at the Palestinian embassy in Rabat to commemorate the 71st anniversary of the Nakba Day or the “Day of the Catastrophe.” During his participation in the ceremony, Sheikh Hussein emphasized that Palestine would never accept to bargain over Jerusalem. “Palestine represents a people, a civilization, an art, a heritage and a human conscience and it reflects the determination of man to campaign for all his rights,” he said. The grand mufti added that Palestinians will continue to refuse any alternative to Palestine, adding that the 200,000 Palestinians who prayed on the 2nd Friday of Ramadan at the Al-Aqsa Mosque stand as “a clear message to the whole world and to the Zionist enemy,” as well as testifying their commitment to Al-Quds and holy places. The statement from the mufti commending Morocco’s efforts comes as the North African country express its support for Palestine at every possible event, denouncing any moves against the status of Jerusalem. Morocco was among the countries that strongly reacted to US President Donald Trump actions against the region. In December 2017, King Mohammed VI addressed a letter  to Trump to warn him against Jerusalem embassy move. In his letter, the King said: “The city of Al-Quds must remain a land of cohabitation and a symbol of coexistence and tolerance for all,” said King Mohammed VI. “The city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and its great political symbolism.” He also warned that the city of Al Quds must remain a land of chabitation and coexistence. “The city is not only important for the parties of the conflict, but also for believers in the three Abrahamic religions, due to its unique religious characteristics, its ancient identity, and it’s great political symbolism,” the monarch added. In addition to the warning message to Trump, King Mohammed VI also addressed a letter to the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemning Trump’s move to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “Such a decision would ultimately lead to increased strife and tension and undermine all opportunities for peace, not to mention fuel violence and extremism,” said the King in his letter to the UN. In addition to the letters, King Mohammed VI’s latest action with Pope Francis for Jerusalem status also received applause from the international community. During the visit of Pope Francis to Morocco in March 2019, the King and the pope signed “al-Quds call” to protect the multi-religious and trans-cultural character of Jerusalem. In April, the King pledged a “substantial financial subvention” as Morocco’s contribution towards restoring the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

Rabat – Moroccan athlete Rababe Arafi has made another astonishing performance at the international level as she ran a world-leading time in the women’s 1,500 meters, clocking in at just 4:01.15 minutes on Saturday.  The Moroccan athlete has beaten Ethiopian Gudaf Tsegay (4:01.25) and Uganda’s Winnie Nanyondo (4:01.39), respectively. The athlete attracted people’ attention by  using all her force to outperform several international athletes to win the thrilling race at the ongoing Diamond League organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in Shanghai, China. This is not the first time Arafi has performed spectacularly during an international race, as she achieved the third best female performance in Morocco’s history at the IAAF Continental Cup in the Czech city of Ostrava in 2018. During the race, Arafi positioned herself in third place in the 1,500-meter race with a time of 4:17:19.  In 2018, Arafi was the only athlete to win two gold medals at the last Mediterranean Games in June in Tarragona, Spain. She won both the 1,500-meter and the 800-meter races, with a time of  2:01:01. The 28-year old tar specializes in the 1,500-meter race. Arafi was born in Khouribga, in the Beni Mellal-Khenifra region of Morocco.

Rabat – He does not fundamentally wish for a regime change in Tehran, but if he does not get his way in this agreement, he could then push for a  reversal of power in Iran. For now, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the real head of the Iranian state, has repeatedly rejected any possible negotiations with the American “Great Satan”,  who he does not deem trustworthy. Drums of war “We must change this regime.” When he uttered these words in June 2017 in front of several thousand members of the People’s Mojahedin, an organization opposed to the Islamic Republic, John Bolton, former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, did not shock the audience.  On the platform of this annual gathering in Villepinte, France, the neoconservative hawk, a supporter of the war in Iraq, welcomed the Trump administration’s change of tone towards Iran, and declared: “For ten years that I participated in this event, I repeated that the declared policy of the United States should be the overthrow of the regime of the mullahs in Tehran.” This septuagenarian with a lush white mustache, was thought to be a has-beenafter the Iraqi fiasco (he was at the time US Under Secretary for Disarmament Affairs), made an appointment with his public of the day “in Tehran in 2019”. Trump and his hawkish Security Adviser Bolton Today, however, John Bolton heads the National Security Council of the US presidency, and is one of Donald Trump’s closest advisers. According to the Wall Street Journal, he asked the Pentagon last September for plans to launch military strikes against Iran. “People were shocked,” said an unnamed US official to this economic daily, adding: “It was staggering, his cavalier way of talking about hitting Iran.” According to the Wall Street Journal, the Pentagon promptly provided the National Security Council with the requested plans. These included the intrusion of US aircraft into Iranian airspace, and air strikes against military sites in the Islamic Republic. After a rapprochement under the Obama administration, during which the United States and Iran had notably become objective allies in Iraq against Daesh, the two “best enemies” of the planet are again at loggerheads since the American withdrawal of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018.  When President Trump announced to President Macron that he was going to withdraw from the agreement, the latter then asked him: “Do you want to go to war with Iran?” says a source familiar with the matter, to which the American president answered him: “Not at all. I want a better deal.” Threats are escalating but not leading to war Today, between Washington and Tehran, threats are escalating every day, jeopardizing the balanced politics pushed to extremes by both sides. However, in an article written in Foreign Policy entitled: “Trump’s Iran Policy is becoming dangerous” Colin Kahl believes that growing evidence suggests the U.S. president is traveling a path toward war—whether he knows it or not: “If Iran or its proxies respond to U.S. pressure in ways that draw American blood or deal a major blow to critical oil infrastructure in the region, things could quickly get out of hand. Unlike in the latter years of the Obama administration, there are currently no high-level lines of communication between Washington and Tehran to manage a crisis. And hard-liners on all sides seem keen for a fight, looking for opportunities to escalate, rather than de-escalate, tensions.” And, with much wisdom, advises the US Administration to: “dial back the rhetoric”: “Before matters spin out of control, it would be wise for the administration to dial back the rhetoric, open high-level channels with Tehran, and signal a willingness to reenter the nuclear deal as a starting point for new negotiations. But there is zero prospect the administration will take this course. It is doubling down on a strategy of maximum tension, and there is growing evidence it is on a path toward war—whether Trump realizes it or not.” Despite the violent tone between the United States and Iran, political analysts continue to doubt the outbreak of a regional war.  According to these sources, US President Donald Trump is an unpredictable man, but so far, he has shown that he prefers to brandish the threat of war rather than do it. This was seen in Syria and even in North Korea, where after having raised the political temperature many times, he always retreated at the last minute, even going so far as to affirm that his policy of threat has reached its objective by pushing his opponent to step back. US Sanctions ineffectual The same tactic is being adopted today with regard to Iran, knowing that the sanctions continue to seriously affect the internal social situation in Iran. But, all in all, the Islamic Republic of Iran is used to the system of sanctions since its birth. It celebrated its fortieth anniversary last February, and throughout that period it has gone through more serious crises, including the eight-year war in Iraq, which was supported by the international community and the United Nations, especially in the West, whereas at that time (1980) Iran had no allies, neither in the region nor in the world. Since then, Iran has been able to secure a degree of economic autonomy that allows it to consume its own products, without significantly depending on imports from abroad. While the export of its oil represents 40% of its GDP,  large countries including China and Turkey have announced their refusal to comply with the US decision not to buy Iranian oil. Everything will depend, in this area, on the American reaction when Iranian oil is transported to these countries. Iranian missile capability On the effectiveness of US sanctions on Iran, Arti Sangar argues in Daiz Reus: “Despite these interrogations, there is little risk of a war between the United States and Iran, because it would be destructive for the whole region.  Iran would not hesitate to hit the United States where it can hurt, even if it would certainly suffer. Moreover, Iranian officials, including those of the Revolutionary Guards – recently placed by the Trump administration on the list of terrorist organizations while it is an institution of the State of Iran – have increased the threats, the last few days, against the Americans in case of an attack against the Islamic Republic.”  The other reason for excluding the option of war is that the US administration is using the “threat” of the Islamic Republic’s presence in the region to strengthen its relations with the Gulf States.  The logic that prevails today in the American administration poses the question; if there was no Iran, why would the Gulf States need the protection of the United States? Truly, this is a gold mine that the US administration would not be prepared to give up. For its part, Iran, despite the threats regularly addressed to the Americans, would not wish the outbreak of a war either, because it is aware of its consequences for the country, but also on the whole of the region.  Iran does not intend to unleash war, but is prepared to retaliate by all available means, if is attacked. Kian TajbaKhsh, in an article entitled:” Getting Real about Iran” published in Foreign Affairs argues: “U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has singled out Iran as a uniquely dangerous regional actor that must be confronted for the sake of peace and stability in the Middle East. In the last year alone, the administration of President Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, announced its intention to reduce the U.S. troop presence in Syria and the wider region, and pushed for what Pompeo has called an “Arab NATO” to stand against Iran’s regional advances. Such policy shifts have led critics to question the administration’s true intentions toward Iran. Some wonder whether U.S. policy in the Middle East possesses any coherence at all, while others are certain that the administration’s real agenda is to instigate a war for regime change in Tehran. Neither interpretation fully fits the facts, and both fail to account for the evolution of U.S. Iran policy over time.” War remains the last of the options In spite of this more or less reassuring theory, the spiral of escalation in which the region seems to be moving may skid at any moment.  However, the latest statements by the US president on his wish to bring Iranian leaders to the negotiating table, but on his terms, could be seen as the beginning of an attempt to find a way out of the crisis. Almost immediately, the Revolutionary Guards responded by expressing their refusal to negotiate, but some diplomatic circles believe that this could be the beginning of a renunciation of the option of war.

Rabat – It is widely believed that when students are encouraged to speak the foreign language in the classroom setting, either with their teachers or classmates, they find themselves participating in the “negotiation of meaning.”  In other words, they are forced into clarifying their thoughts, intentions, and opinions by expressing them.  As a teacher, I have observed many students abstaining from active class participation. This phenomenon in EFL classrooms is widely recognized by teachers and practitioners. Opinions vary but many teachers agree that the reasons for this phenomenon are complex and multi-faceted.   It stands to reason that the solutions will need to be just as complex and many-layered to be successfully understood and implemented.  By choosing this topic for discussion I hope to pinpoint the main causes behind the phenomenon and humbly put forward possible solutions to help increase students’ level of classroom participation.  The classroom is the most formal setting for teaching and learning processes. This is the context in which the interaction between teachers and students takes place and learning goals are set and achieved.  In the classroom, both teachers and students perform a variety of different actions designed to tackle educational tasks. Among these actions, classroom participation is an important interactional and pedagogical step through which students display their involvement. Classroom participation in this paper refers to student-teacher talk; the extent to which students are involved in classroom discussions.  Many practitioners and experts in the field of English language teaching have stressed the importance of students’ oral participation in the classroom. Interestingly, Petress (2001) contends that low student participation in classrooms is detrimental to the progress of the students and impedes the teachers’ ability to successfully assess students’ progress.  Jackson (2002) argues that classroom participation provides the setting in which students can construct and shape identities as members of the classroom. When students do participate in class and have contributed to the discussions; they feel that they are appreciated by their peers and that what they say is important to the teacher.  Participation is of utmost importance in language classrooms for it adds interest to the learning and teaching process. Sometimes it’s hard to retain the attention of a group of students when the teacher is doing all the talking. Concentration can be preserved by a more interactive approach. Liu (2001) elaborated on four types of student behavior in the classroom as full integration, participation under conditions, minimal interaction, and silent observation.  In this context, we are not concerned with the other three types of students’ behavior; but we are primarily concerned with the second type which is participation. Accordingly, participation occurs when students are influenced by socio-cultural, cognitive, affective, linguistic, and environment.  These often lead to a decrease in student participation and interaction with other students and instructors, resulting in them speaking up in class only when given no alternative. In this section, I will propose some of the causes that make students reluctant when it comes to participation. First, many students are not really linguistically well-equipped enough to hold a discussion and express themselves freely.  They find it hard to express themselves in English. Many of my students began this year not having attended English class regularly the previous year because, as some of them said, they had lost interest.  This has, unfortunately, made them ill-prepared to carry out discussions in English at the level they should have reached.  They simply aren’t linguistically prepared, which makes their reluctance to participate in class understandable. They aren’t yet capable of holding even a short conversation, let alone give their opinions and express themselves freely in front of the class. In fact, they are always telling me that they don’t understand what I am saying. How can they be expected to interact in class? The majority of students can’t and, sadly, they can’t be expected to either. The second reason is the teacher’s use of elicitation or questioning.  When the school year began, I would ask students questions, not paying attention to diction. Session after session, I realized that I had to simplify my language and even noticed that I was beginning to use my body language appropriately to try and convey the meaning of what I was saying to my students. Clearly, when students don’t understand the question, they play it safe and abstain from participating in the classroom. Thirdly, shyness can explain students’ limited participation. When I ask my students a question, I’m convinced that some female students know the answer, yet they remain silent. Shyness is an influencing factor which could affect students’ participation. However, shyness is a behavior that could be the result of any or a combination of the following factors: social introversion, lacking confidence in the subject matter, and/or communication apprehension.  The latter is defined “as the level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person’’ (MacCroskey, 1977). In other words, some students can’t raise their hands and speak in front of their peers and in the presence of the teacher because they are afraid of others’ reactions.  The fourth factor behind low participation is Poor Pronunciation. In fact, this appeared to be a huge source of stress for learners in my class. It is an important issue across language groups because of its immediate effect on interaction.  When you sense somebody does not understand you, your reaction is immediate. You feel you need to improve your pronunciation within a second, which is often hard and stressful. As a result of this performance anxiety, learners become more self-conscious about their pronunciation when they speak in the class and I have noticed that they feel embarrassed if they mispronounce a word.  There are times when I asked my students to read a passage of text out loud. No one volunteers because they are afraid of being laughed at or of being criticized by others due to inaccurate pronunciation. This section will touch on suggested solutions for students’ low-class participation. As far as solutions for the issue of low classroom participation are concerned, it has to be admitted that the teacher alone cannot be held accountable for the issues inherent in the Moroccan educational system in general; among them is limited student participation in the classroom. The best the teacher can hope for is to create an atmosphere in his/her classroom that is free from the challenges explored above.  Students at school need to feel good about being in the classroom.  The way to start creating this feeling is for the teacher to establish a safe environment in the classroom from the first day.  The idea of being in a classroom is to learn. If students already knew everything, there would be no need to be there. It should go without saying that perfection is not expected, especially in the beginning. The teacher should present himself or herself to the students as a guide, someone who is there as a facilitator to learning.  All students should consider themselves starting the school year at exactly the same place, square 1, so to speak. It’s my belief that when students see themselves and their classmates on the same level from the get-go, they will begin to relax about presenting a perfect exterior.  I think that it’s also critical for the teacher to set ground rules in the class that establishes it as a safe zone for everyone.  Zero tolerance on ridiculing students who participate, because of a missed pronunciation or a misinterpreted meaning, will create a more comfortable place in which the students to participate more freely.  If there is no fear of criticism, walls of shyness and apprehension collapse and students feel encouraged to participate actively. Like a party where no-one is dancing, it only takes one brave soul to get it started. Soon the dance floor is full and everyone is enjoying the experience, so to speak. Learning should feel the same way, I believe. When teachers are presenting the lesson to students, it’s important to pay attention to their body language. Are they following you? Are you using the vocabulary they understand? Their faces will tell you everything. When you notice you are losing them, simply stop and take a reading of the class.  Ask if they are following, ask what needs clarification. I do not continue until I know I have got them all back with me. There are still a handful of students who will struggle with shyness, no matter how safe a teacher makes their classroom environment.  Sometimes these kids will need one-on-one encouragement from the teacher; that is to say, the teacher has to approach these students face to face and tell them that there is nothing they should fear and that they should feel free to make mistakes.  The Teacher can do that but in a low key way, so as not to call attention to it so that they don’t feel spotlighted by the rest of the class.  They should be quietly encouraged to feel relaxed when they make mistakes. The teacher has also to assure those shy students that mistakes are learning tools they need to make friends with. Teachers can also help inspire classroom participation by creating fun, interactive activities to present the curriculum.  Education is a serious business, to be sure, but there is a lot to be said for bringing in activities to shake what can become predictable, staid lessons such as suggesting competitions and using humour in the classroom.   I have tried these fun activities and came to the conclusion that I had more students participating in class than ever. As long as the curriculum obligations are met, teachers should try to introduce games, fun competitions and role plays into the class to get students excited.  Sometimes when they are having fun they don’t even realize they have learned something until the class is over. In the case of tests or exams, teacher should create a bonus system for extra grades to help motivate them to reach beyond what they think they are capable of.  In addition, I had some students who misbehaved in the beginning of the year, but session after session I managed to get close to them, I talked to them and they shared their problems with me.educational After that, those students felt that I care about them and they appreciated that. They told me that they want to change their lives and want to study, I encouraged them and they started doing all the things I told them to do, like bringing their copybooks and textbooks.  They started participating in my class even though they have very poor English, but I kept encouraging them. To conclude, teachers have to get as close as possible to their students and help them to understand that the teacher is there to guide them and encourage them to learn.

Rabat – On May 16, 2019, Dutch King Willem-Alexander recently surprised those having iftar at a community center in the multicultural Transvaal district of The Hague. The Dutch King arrived without informing any of the locals that he would come and then sat with four different tables during the event to connect with the residents and community center workers breaking their fast. A youth worker at the community center, Nadir Abdel Moumen said, “it was initially a matter of searching for conversation topics. Should it be chic? Or politics? It ended with the King telling about the areas in Morocco he has visited.” When King Willem-Alexander said that that event was his first Iftar, the locals “helped with his hazing.” Over coffee and orange juice, the king also conversed about their neighborhood and the significance of the community center. “The King gives the impression that it does not matter that we are migrants. It makes you feel important that he comes here to our community center,” Cantu Alkurt, an employee at a local preschool said. King Willem-Alexander visited Musee Dar Si Said in Marrakech in 2005, where he saw the opening of an exhibition organised by the Mondrian Foundation. The Foundation focuses on modern Dutch art, commissioned by Dutch Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Education, Culture and Science, celebrating 400 Years of Morocco and The Netherlands.

Rabat – For Moroccan fans, the championship is yet another opportunity to finally see their dream come true: a second trophy for the national team, 43 years after the Atlas Lions won their first and only title. A close look at the current national team and Moroccan football, in general, suggests that such an ambition are well-founded, now more so than at any time in recent years. Yet, past experiences show that the Atlas Lions tend to disappoint when they are expected to shine. Could this time be different?. Let us first examine previous poor performances at CAN and why this time we have reasons to be more optimistic, without succumbing to misplaced self-confidence. A Lion Without A Roar In 1998 many of us who were kids aged 10, 12, or older were passionate about football. As we grew up and looked back at that period, we realized that we had the privilege to have watched some of the best Moroccan football players in a generation. Tahar Lakhlej, Abdelkrim El Hadrioui, Mustapha Hadji, Noureddine Naybet, Abdejelil Hada, and Abdelilah Bassir were on a league of their own. During the CAN and World Cup qualifiers and finals, they demonstrated their impressive skills and helped their team to achieve what was probably its best ranking by FIFA so far;  at that time, the team was listed among the top 20 teams in the world. Morocco’s memorable win 3-0 against Scotland and their amazing performance against Norway made millions of Moroccans proud despite our team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup in 2016.   During the CAN finals, we were the only team to beat that year’s champion, Egypt, thanks to an unforgettable double kick by Hadji. Despite having a good chance to win the trophy, Morocco lost to South Africa 2-1 in the quarter-finals while Egypt went on to snatch the cup. The irony is that Egypt had failed to participate in the 1998 World Cup. They were in the same group as Morocco during the qualifiers but our team prevailed. What we were left with during that year was the good memories of Hadji and Bassir’s wonder goals, while the Egyptian team did what it did best: winning titles. After their 1998 trophy, they added three more in three consecutive tournaments, 2006, 2008 and 2010. This brings us to a key issue when we talk about Moroccan football. For years we have been kidding ourselves that we are among Africa’s greats and that we have glorious football history while the truth of the matter is that we have only one CAN title and, since 1976, we failed to bring home a second one. Ironically, our team and our football federation used to care more about participating in the World Cup than winning titles. Moroccan football declined and we performed poorly subsequent CAN tournaments and for 20 years fell short of qualifying for the World Cup. Over the last two decades participations in CAN usually came after stunning qualifications. So each time we told ourselves: ‘’This is gotta be it. We are going to win this time’’. But it never happened. The only time we were close to doing so was in 2004 when no one was counting on the coach Zaki Badou and his players to reach the final. In November 2007 our squad forced a French team into a 2-2 draw on home soil during a friendly game which made us think that the Lions were unstoppable. A few months later, after they scored a crushing 5-1 victory over Namibia during their first game in CAN, our team lost the two other matches, 2-3 to Guinea and 0-2 to Ghana. In 2011 the Moroccan football team’s 4-0 victory over neighboring rival Algeria sent thousands of happy fans to the street. They thought their players were set to win CAN the following year. However, a surprising defeat against Tunisia, followed by another loss to the host country Gabon, brought back some home truths: our national team does not deliver in big events such CAN finals, unlike friendly games and qualifiers in which they give the illusion that they can win it all.  Years of accumulated disappointments made Moroccan fans transition from anger to sarcasm, often joking that their team does not deserve its nickname: The Atlas Lions. In Good Shape Over the past two years, our football could not have been better. Our national squad performed well during the last CAN and managed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 20 years. The team also proved to be a worthy adversary to two of the best teams in the world, Spain and Portugal. Major achievements included winning trophies such as the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN) title, which Morocco claimed after an impressive winning streak. Local clubs have shined continentally. Wydad snatched the 2017 African Champions League Cup while Raja took home the CAF Cup the following year. Both teams and long-time rivals won the CAF Super Cup. This year, Wydad and RS Berkane are preparing to take on the Esperance of Tunis (The Hope of Tunisia) and the Egyptian team of Zamalek in the tournament’s two finals. Our clubs and sports officials seem to be more focused on winning. Morocco has become an influential CAF member and our Football Federation’s current president, Faouzi Lakjaa, clearly knows more about the game than his predecessor, Ali Fassi El Fihri, whose term was characterized by a failure to qualify to the 2014 World Cup, a poor performance at the CAN 2012, and the infamous signing of Eric Gerets as Morocco’s manager. The Belgian had no experience in coaching national teams and was also reportedly paid €250,000 a month, the highest in the world. By contrast, Hervé Renard is a two-time CAN winning coach. He is someone who knows African football intimately and has managed to create a strong team that has given Moroccans hope that we can win the continental title. Could our team finally make that happen? Let us hope for the best while remaining cautious, as past experiences remind us not to get carried away by too much enthusiasm before the Atlas Lions are put to the test.

Rabat – Saudi billionaire Sheikh Al Amoudi is demanding that Morocco pay him back 14 MAD billion ($1.5) as a compensation for the Moroccan government’s supposed role in the downfall of the SAMIR refinery. Al Amoudi is the chief executive of Corral Morocco Holding AB, the Moroccan branch of the Sweden’s Corral Petroleum. Corral Morocco Holding AB held 67% of SAMIR’s assets, before the refinery’s financial problems led the Moroccan government 2015 to declare it bankrupt. Moroccan news outlet Medias 24 reported yesterday that the Saudi businessman is blaming the Moroccan government for neglecting and “violating” a number of contract terms with SAMIR. Key in Al Amoudi’s compliant is Morocco’s alleged role in facilitating the financial debacle that saw SAMIR stop most of its activities in 2015. Medias 24 notes that Al Amoudi handed the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) a memo on April 12 of this year. In the memo,  the Saudi billionaire is said to have provided documents that prove “violations” by the Moroccan government in its contact with Corral Morocco Holding AB. Among the many accusations Al Amoudi levelled at the Moroccan government is the failure to implement regulations and contract terms which would have made SAMIR more competitive. The memo argued that Morocco “allowed” SAMIR to go bankrupt. Medias 24 did not provide details about all of the Saudi’s claims, or the ICSID’s stance on the legal validity of Al Amoudi’s demands that Morocco compensate him as much as $1.5 billion. In the meantime, Morocco has not yet issued a response to Al Amoudi’s claims. The Saudi businessman lodged his complaint at the ICSID on March 14 of last year. Back then, as now, the Saudi billionaire vented his frustration on Moroccan authorities for the “organized indifference” that precipitated his company’s debacle. Al Amoudi claims that Morocco’s failure to commit to an investment agreement with Sweden is the primary reason SAMIR went bankrupt. That agreement included protection against expropriation, as well as equal respect of investments. However, Al Amoudi’s complaints contrast with the verdict of the Casablanca Commercial Court, which in November 2018 ruled that SAMIR’s board’ mismanagement was the main reason behind the company’s financial failures. SAMIR is currently in a dire situation.  Even after a Casablanca court in 2016 ruled that the company’s assets be liquidated, interest in SAMIR has been scant. Although there have been bidders, no offer has been completed to date.

Rabat – Independent Member of the Austrian Parliament, Martha Bissmann wore a hijab in a general assembly speech as she protested a recent controversial ban on child hijabs in Austria’s elementary schools. On Wednesday, May 15, the Austrian government approved a law prohibiting girls under the age of 11 from wearing the veil at school. Muslim groups believe the law “sensationalizes a marginal issue and plays on citizens’ fears.”  “This is the first step to ban headscarves in everyday life,”  Bissmann said. The intention behind the ban, according to Austria’s National Council, is to “promote integration in Austrian schools” by prohibiting “ideologically or religiously characterized clothing.” “The ban on headscarves in primary schools will only lead to segregation and discrimination of Muslim girls,” said the Islamic Faith Community in Austria. The group says it plans to take the new law to Constitutional Court. Described by the Islamic Faith Community as “discriminatory,” the law does not apply to the Jewish kippah or the Sikh patkah. Typically, Muslim girls make the choice to wear the veil after puberty. The law applies to prepubescent girls in primary school, who don’t usually wear the veil. Previously, the right-wing of the Austrian government considered banning teachers from wearing the veil, but backed down once it was understood that other religious symbols, like the Catholic cross, would be brought into the debate. A majority of lawmakers opposing the right-wing voted against the ban, which was proposed by Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, a member of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPO). However, conservatives, who make up a majority of the current Austrian government, voted for the ban, which is why it passed. Bissman said that the politicians behind the ban aim to eliminate “high values such as tolerance and freedom of religion.”

Rabat – If you don’t have wrinkles on your forehead, says Mohammed Belhaj, the books you’re reading aren’t making you think enough. This is one of the many book-related life mottos the owner of Rabat’s only all-English bookstore lives by. On most days sunlight streams into Belhaj’s narrow shop as he affectionately dusts off spines and meticulously checks that each book is placed on the right shelf. The wrinkles on his forehead are accentuated by the beams of light reflecting off the glasses perched on his nose. “These are all of my children,” Belhaj told Morocco World News, gesturing at the—by his own estimation—10,000 books in his store. “They make me feel all the emotions between happy and sad. They shape my personality every day.” Throughout his adolescence and into adulthood, Belhaj remembers constantly struggling to find English books to read. At the age of 44, Belhaj had enough of what felt like an eternal struggle and opened Rabat’s first and only all-English bookstore in 1985. That same year, Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union, Calvin and Hobbes comic strips had just made its debut, and Nintendo was released. Ever since, Belhaj’s regiment of books has grown a tenfold, his hair has gone white, and the word he would use to describe Rabat would no longer be “sleepy.” One of the only things that hasn’t changed is how he runs his shop. Like many of his generation, born during the height of World War II, Belhaj has stubbornly refused to go digital—everything in his shop is done by hand. Even though he acknowledges some of the positives of digitization, Belhaj has remained an ardent believer in the power of the human mind. Spend enough time flipping through his books and you’ll land on at least three pages that have been carefully hand-stamped with the store’s logo. Peruse the aisles long enough and you’ll hear the rustle of his hand-written inventory list. “My mind is my computer and my hand is my mouse,” Belhaj said. Each day, Belhaj says, he can make from around one to 30 sales. He hardly keeps track, however. Having already lowered the prices of most of his books to make them more affordable, he focuses on his interactions with customers. “There is something spiritual about the relationship between the owner of a bookstore and the people who buy his books. There is a blind trust between the two. They trust me to provide them  the best books and I trust them to keep me in business,” Belhaj said, gently tapping the tome he records all his sales in. Belhaj orders all of the store’s books directly from the publisher, his wishlist is based on recommendations and requests of customers. “There is nothing quite like the look in someone’s eyes when you finally get to give them the book they wanted,” Belhaj said. “It’s a look that never gets old.” While the look remains the same, the customers giving them to him have changed throughout the years. During his first decade of business, Belhaj recalls, that his contingent of customers overwhelmingly consisted of foreigners. Most of them were young, adventure-hungry travelers traipsing around Morocco in desperate need of something to read on the next bus, train or plane. Through lengthy conversations, Belhaj learned that most of these travelers were inspired to visit the North African kingdom by the words written by literary icons such as Paul Bowles, George Orwell and Tennessee Williams.  Their literature brining legions of adventurous youths to Morocco is a fitting illustration of Belhaj’s faith in books. The inescapable relevance of authors like Bowles, Orwell and Williams, he argues, is proof of literature’s enduring impact on people’s perceptions and imagination. “Their writings changed how the world saw Morocco,” Belhaj said. “Suddenly, it wasn’t such a scary or foreign place.” According to Belhaj, the influence of their writing was undermined by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, which set back the improving image of Morocco and the Middle East. Ever since the collapse of the Twin Towers, the number of foreigners visiting his shop has gradually dropped. Fortunately for Belhaj, the Orwell, Bowles and Williams-inspired foreigners have been replaced by new customers: local Moroccans. In Morocco there is now a slow but steady growth of interest in English books, Belhaj explained, especially among Moroccan youth. Moroccans regularly come in to Belhaj’s shop to peruse popular titles such as “The Hobbit” by  J. R. R. Tolkien, “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck” by Mark Manson and “Into the Wild” by Jon Krakauer. “The world is getting smaller and English is becoming more popular in Morocco. It already is popular,” Belhaj said. “I can see it in my sales.” Despite gaining independence from France in 1956, Morocco has continued to use French as one of its three nationally recognized languages—the other two being Arabic and Amazigh (Berber). French is still currently used as the primary language in both public and private Moroccan education institutions. According to a 2014 general census of population and housing by the High Commission for Planning in, only 18.3% of Moroccans can read and write in English—compared to the 66% that can read and write French. But in recent years, with more international companies investing in Morocco, there has been a push to integrate English into the education system, Even if that seems unlikely in the near future. “French will remain the second language in Moroccan public schools, at least throughout the next ten years,” Said Amzazi, minister of education, said during a press conference in January 2019. According to Education First’s English Proficiency Index, Morocco is currently ranked 67th out of 88 countries studied—falling within the “Very Low” proficiency category.   Amzazi claims it will take Morocco at least another decade to build a large enough base of qualified English teachers before it can commit to integrating English into the country’s curriculum. Despite the not-so-encouraging figures, Belhaj is confident that interest in english will continue to grow. “I’ve been in business for many years now because interest in English keeps growing,” Belhaj says. “And you can’t fight growth.”

Rabat – Moroccan YouTube celebrity Amine Radi has some harsh words about a Moroccan policeman’s behavior, with the YouTuber recording a Facebook Live in a Casablanca street to decry the brutality he was subjected to. The Paris-based comedian, who rose to fame for his satirical videos on traditions and daily life in Moroccan and Maghrebi families, recently traveled to Casablanca for a show. However, from his Facebook Live, the Moroccan YouTuber’s Casablanca experience has had some chilling moments. The Facebook Live scene shows Amine Radi complaining about police violence after an encounter with a policeman who apparently beat him up. “We are in 2019 in Morocco and a policeman beats me up in traffic,” Amine Radi asks multiples times in the video. But the question is more an expression of surprise and frustration. The video footage does not show what could have caused the incident. Radi’s voice is coarse and high. Even as he tries to remain relax, the Moroccan is visibly shell-shocked. He does not seem to understand “why on earth” a policeman would beat him up in “heavy traffic” and in broad daylight for no obvious reasons other than he actually can do without fear of retribution. As Radi complained, the policeman assaulted him on camera for wanting to show his face. Showing an officer’s face in a video is illegal in Morocco. At one point in the video, however, one policeman is heard apologizing to Raidi. But the YouTuber tells him off. “I am sorry brother. I’m in the middle of a Live,” Radi tells the now insistently apologetic officer.  To his thousands of followers, Radi gives a pessimistic, nearly cynical, appreciation of public behavior in Morocco. “Really, this 2019 and they still behave like this here,” Radi fumed. “I have never seen something like this before.” In reaction to Raidi’s harsh criticism, the Casablanca police opened investigations in the Raidi case to shed light on the accusations of “a citizen who is claiming to have been verbally and physically harassed.” The police department of Casablanca opened a judicial investigation under the supervision of the competent prosecutor’s office on Saturday afternoon to clarify the charges against a traffic police officer, supported by a video broadcast live on the social network Facebook, showing “a person who claims to have been physically and verbally assaulted by the police officer,” General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) said in a communiqué. In addition to the judicial investigation, the DGSN launched a parallel administrative investigation to “determine the professional misconduct attributed to the police officer.”

Rabat – On Friday, May 17, a number of associations launched an environmental initiative in Morocco’s economic capital, Casablanca, where young people honored three places of worship of the three monotheistic religions with trees. Themed “the Olive Tree of Fraternity,” the initiative involved planting three olive trees in the Zaouia Harakia Kadiria mosque in the old medina, the Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes Catholic cathedral, and Neve Shalom Synagogue. The tree-planting initiative pays tribute to victims of the Casablanca terrorist attack carried out on 16 May 2003. 33 people died that day as a result of a series of suicide bombings. Bringing together over 10 associations under the label “Tomorrow’s Morocco,” the action went beyond Casablanca, with five other Moroccan cities, Oujda, Fes, Rabat, Essaouira, and Marrakesh. Outside of Morocco, Brussels also pitched in. The action was meant to symbolize the universal values bonding the three monotheistic faiths whereby people lived hand in hand for centuries in the Moroccan kingdom, while calling for togetherness and co-existence as opposed to terrorism and division. Jacky Sebag, the Neve Shalom Synagogue rabbi, took the occasion as an opportunity to express his delight, highlighting that this actions reflects the values of fraternity and coexistence between all religions.  Acharif Omar Lamrani Lamrini, president of the Zaouia Harakia Kadiria mosque, also applauded the idea.  Father Germain Goussa stressed that religion brings human together rather than split them apart. He took Morocco as an example to illustrate what he called the “mutual acceptance” between these religions.

Rabat – In the wake of news about the Spanish government’s decision to set up what it called “smart borders,” Morocco’s has successfully deployed new tactics that helped scale down the number of irregular immigrants storming the border fences at the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in Northern Morocco. Border control chief Khalid Zerouali noted that Morocco’s recent crackdowns on undocumented migrants fell by 30%. He added that border crossings especially peak during the summer. With its recent efforts, Morocco, notably Africa’s main transit countryused by thousands of migrants as a springboard for their “European dream,” prevented approximately 25,000 border crossings this year compared to 89,000 last year.  According to authorities, the North African country has foiled 50 human trafficking networks in 2019. Zerouali explained that thanks to its surveillance technology and manpower, Morocco has grown more vigilant. He said the authorities have spotted the vulnerabilities which used to serve as niches for smugglers during sea crossings. But the success of he new policy has not entirely discouraged migrants from attempting to reach Europe. The number of migrants who clandestinely worked their way to Spain last year stood at 57,000. Al Massae reported on Friday, May 17, that the Spanish Ministry of Interior is investing in a €33 million ($36,8) budget into the project, aiming at deploying high-tech tools that will assist spanish border control authorities in recognizing the identity of potential migrants.  Migrants heading to spain outnumbered hose bound for Italy and Greece, accounting for 60,000 crossings by sea. The figure has dramatically dropped since February of this year. Spanish MP Jose Ramón Bauzá attributes the downward trend to Spain’s toughening stance on border control. Speaking to El Faro De Melilla news agency, the Spanish MP stressed the importance tracking immigrants to step up tightened security control. He said, “We can’t lose track of people entering the country.” Migrants, most of whom come from sub-Saharan countries, show no sign of discouragement. Just four days ago, the Moroccan navy captured three boats with 117 onboard, and arrested 40 others attempting to scale the Melilla border fence.

Rabat – Moroccan women face gender-based violence and harassment on a daily basis. In September of 2018, Morocco implemented law 103-13 combating violence against women. While the law, in theory, gives women more legal rights, it fails to provide adequate resources for women, long-term protection for survivors of domestic violence, or address societal stereotypes targeting victims of physical or sexual abuse. The preliminary results of the 2019 national survey by the Moroccan High Commission for Planning show that the rates of violence against women in Morocco stand at 54.4% nationwide. Violence against women in urban areas is 55.8%, while the rate of domestic violence in rural areas was slightly lower at 51.6%. The ministry conducted its nationwide survey between January 2 and March 10 of 2019. Despite alarming rates of domestic violence in both private and public places, the Minister of Family, Solidarity, Equality, and Social Development, Bassima Hakkaoui, stated that the percentage of victims of abuse or violence who filed a complaint against abusers is only 6.6%. This low value can be attributed to a lack of trust in police and the social shame tied to victims who report abuse. In 2018, Human Rights Watch reported that Morocco had less than 10 shelters that accept domestic violence survivors. All of the organizations are run by nongovernmental organizations and few receive government funding. Where government resources and laws fall short, Morocco’s women have established organizations and associations to fill the gaps.  Morocco World News visited the Wiam Association in Sale, Rabat’s neighboring city. The group dedicates its services to help women who are victims of abuse. Founded by Zahra Kounka in 2004, the association seeks to provide victims of abuse with resources and guidance in the face of trauma. A team of seven unpaid volunteers serve between 30 and 50 women in their offices every month. “We are very proud of our work because we are able to welcome women who have experienced abuse and provide them with resources,” said founder Zahra Kounka. The team of volunteers at the Wiam Association consists of a psychologist, legal aid, mediator, and several teachers. The association receives some funding from the Ministry of the Interior. Several generous donors, including the Danish embassy, also provide financial assistance. Lack of Women’s Shelters  While women’s associations do receive some funding from donors and government programs, the funds are insufficient in terms of the numerous and growing problems surrounding violence against women in Morocco. There are no women’s shelters in Sale, and this is sadly representative of the rest of the country. Instead, women often go to associations or hospitals for help and then are forced to return to their abusers. Saida Kouzzi, the co-founder of the Moroccan women’s rights organization Mobilizing for Rights Associates, told Human Rights Watch, “Access to safe and stable housing is a serious problem for abused women and their children, who are often forced to flee their work and school, become homeless, or return to a violent situation.” Providing Opportunities for Independence Unable to provide shelter given its meager financial means, Wiam Association instead aspires to teach women how to work and ultimately achieve independence. In their office, along with a counseling room, workshop space, and several offices, there is also a large kitchen. Women can learn how to cook or make sweets in order to learn skills which will help them gain financial freedom.  A week before Ramadan, the association’s kitchen was filled with women learning how to make chebakia, a traditional Moroccan sweet eaten during Ramadan. The session not only empowered the women to go home and provide for their families and themselves, but also gave them a chance to bond with and get to know other women who share their experiences. In addition to in-office services, the volunteers at Wiam also travel to other cities to educate women on their rights and help survivors make their own decisions. The association has several campaigns to register children without birth certificates, as well as an initiative at local schools to teach students the importance of respecting women.  “Educational facilities like high schools and colleges need to teach students about violence against women. If we start changing minds at a young age, then the situation will improve,” said Kounka. Legal Limitations for Survivors According to the founder of Wiam, Zahra Kounka, although the law passed in September in theory increased protections, what Morocco truly needs is societal change. Victims of abuse in Morocco face legal, physical, mental, sexual, and financial abuse, yet are rarely protected when they seek help from police. “We need to make a much larger effort to stop violence against women. Even though there is a law in place, there is a lack of consciousness in Moroccan society regarding the topic,” said Kounka. The law requires survivors to file for criminal prosecution to obtain protection, which few can do. Many abusers bribe judges or shame the victims into dropping the case. The law also fails to outline the responsibilities of police, prosecutors, and judges in domestic violence cases, or to fund women’s shelters.  When asked if a victim of abuse could reach out to police for help, Kounka sadly stated that if a woman tried to contact the police while facing abuse, she would have to call many times, and would likely get no response or protection. Within their communities, women face shame and judgment if they seek legal protection from their husbands, thus rarely ever end up going to court. For now, victims of abuse in Morocco have very little resources to escape violent relationships and protect themselves and their children. The few organizations led by Moroccan women, despite backlash and a lack of funding, do their utmost to protect domestic violence survivors. However, according to Kounka, if Morocco wants to stop violence against women it must start with the youth and through social campaigns work towards radical change in the laws protecting Moroccan women.

Rabat – Every October, high in the Anti-Atlas mountains of Morocco, the women of Amalou village prepare pomegranate molasses, using an ancient technique handed down through generations. Grinding the ruby fruit by hand in a stone mill, they collect the pink juice in big terracotta jars, then cook it for 24 hours over a wood fire. The molasses, or “amaghouss” in Tamazight (Berber), was used as a natural medicine, Soltana and Meriem tell us in a two and a half minute documentary. You can learn about amaghouss, and hundreds of other unique cultural, historical and natural features of Morocco on “Marocopedia”. Marocopedia is a website dedicated to digitalizing Moroccan cultural heritage. Midway between a digital museum and a web TV documentary channel, it collects stories about Morocco and its people in “mini-documentaries”, which are available for free online. Marocopedia is a unique project, the first of its kind in Morocco, the MENA region, and Africa. Its purpose? To document and catalogue Morocco’s cultural heritage and share it with the world.  A Digital Culture Museum The original project idea was quite different, Maha Sano Bouzerda, co-founder of Marocopedia, and Robin Wijnhold, Project Manager &amp; Chief Editor, told Morocco World News. “Originally, we wanted to make a TV show for young people, producing Moroccan children’s tales. But when we embarked on this adventure, we were met with a real challenge: the lack of cultural documentation on each region.”  They lacked the material needed to build culturally accurate stories, such as information on people, traditions, the natural environment, and local history; all the things used to paint a picture of human experience. Understanding Moroccan heritage had to come first. “We didn’t set off to create a website to catalogue heritage, but in the end we sort of had to because of the lack of data on oral traditions,” Robin and Maha explained. Authentic, Original Material Over a six year period, the Marocopedia team filmed more than 300 documentaries, across the regions of Tata, Safi, the Atlas Mountains, and northern Morocco. The documentaries are categorized into six themes: nature, craft, music, history, people, and initiatives, and are available in French, English, and Arabic. They are also sometimes filmed in Tamazight, then subtitled. The content is broad. Viewers can meet Hajj Sevilla, the 73 year old mussel farmer, who is reviving the mussel population of the Cala Iris bay, they can learn about the rock climbing club of the Todgha Gorge, or watch an Amazigh (berber) flute performance. Most ideas for the films were developed through discussions with locals. “Given hardly any information was available online, we couldn’t decide in advance what topics to film. It was often once we were there, talking to locals and doing field work that we decided what to film.” The team is currently preparing to produce more documentaries on the southern provinces of the country, and is aiming to eventually cover all regions of Morocco. Read also: Fez’s Annual Festival Celebrates Andalusian Music Special Documentary Series Every Monday Marocopedia publishes a new documentary on the website. This month, it is revealing a special series called “The Last Craftsmen,” in partnership with NET-MED Youth, an international NGO that helps build young people’s capacity.  It will showcase three crafts that have until now never been documented. The first one released on Monday is about Abdelhak Khanboubi, a famous potter who works from his small studio in Safi, a town between Casablanca and Agadir. “These three craftsmen are full of humanity, and they have dedicated their lives to artisanship,” note Robin and Maha.  The purpose of the series and the partnership with NED-MED Youth is to re-engage Moroccan youth with cultural practices, in a hope to revive the practices in the places they have already disappeared, they explain. Local and Global Reach Marocopedia is targeting a Moroccan audience, but also international viewers. “The public, whether from Morocco or overseas, is interested in our content because it doesn’t exist in other Moroccan media, or on any other websites about cultural heritage,” Robin and Maha note. It is “fresh and exclusive.” The team has big plans. It wants to share its expertise and experience with other African countries, and to eventually create another platform dedicated to digitalizing African culture. Marocopedia doesn’t receive direct funding. The organization works in partnership with NGOs like UNESCO and the Roberto Cimetta Fund, as well as the embassies of Morocco and the Netherlands. They are currently looking for partnerships with universities who want to develop anthropological projects. Human Connection Marocopedia is about sharing digital content, but it is also about building human connections. Each video is published with the contact details of the person being filmed, so that viewers can reach out and learn more from them directly if they want to. The artisans can use the videos to promote their work, inviting Moroccans and the international community to discover their crafts, Robin and Maha note. After Marocopedia published the documentary on the rare “sloughi” sighthound, the breeder went on to sell a number of his dogs. He thanked the team warmly for raising the breed’s profile, and contributing to preserving the animal. “The breeder wanted to give us two dogs to thank us, but unfortunately we live in the city and this type of dog needs a lot of space to run.” After the six year filming period, the Marocopedia team has kept in touch with many of the people they met. “Each time we publish a video we get thank you messages, and this gives us yet another reason to continue on the Marocopedia adventure,” Robin and Maha add.

The objective of inter-faith dialogue is to create mutual understanding, respect, and tolerance to work in unity for the peace and prosperity of humanity without harming the identity of any culture or religion. It is believed that every religion has some universalized values as a common ground. The profound study of the Holy Quran shows dialogue as the sole legitimate path to peaceful coexistence and to finding solutions to social and political problems. Islam is synonymous with peace. It encourages its followers to explore every possible avenue for peaceful negotiation to resolve conflicts among people so that they can put their efforts into establishing peace in the society. The Holy Quran asks Muslims to engage in constructive dialogue with people of other faiths on the basis of what they have common; doing righteous deeds. Peace and harmony constitute the soul of Islam. The Qura’nic vision of peace is not limited to the borders of the particular country or the confines of its own followers or community; rather it addresses all of humanity. Islam calls on people of different faiths to have mutual respect for each other on the basis of their common humanity while following their own religions. Peace and progress are the aim of the  Holy Quran. The Quran is the dialogue between the Divine and Human. The Quran addresses all men of every age, in accordance with the degree of their understanding and development. It is a book that teaches human beings the eternal principles of mutual respect, honesty, justice and equality, which are the required foundation for peace and tranquility in the world. The Holy Quran laid down the foundation of interfaith dialogue. There are verses in the Quran advocating to the believers the call for religious dialogue. The models of dialogue in the Quran are stated clearly. The Holy Quran says: “Say, O, Mohammad! O, people, Come to a word that is common between us and you”. (The Quran 2:256). This verse shows that Islam has a keen interest in solving the problems of people living in multi-religious communities, as was the case in Medina, by spreading the message of peace, justice, and safety to all. This message is to be conveyed to the people through an invitation to dialogue as clearly indicated by the Arabic word “ta álu” come together. Fourteen centuries ago, the Quran made the greatest ecumenical call the world has ever seen. It represented the widest statement on which members of all religions could agree. In case this call was rejected, Muslims were to adopt the attitude expressed in another verse. “Your religion is for you: my religion is for me”. (The Quran: 109:6) The Quran wants dialogue to be an opportunity for truth to emerge rather than the opening of a door to offend those who hold different beliefs. The Quran and prophetic tradition enjoined Muslims and as well as the followers of other faiths to engage in meaningful dialogue, cooperation, and the agreement of basic principles. The Peace Treaty of Hudaibiyah in the History of Islam was the result of successful interfaith dialogue. The treaty was signed despite divergent views. Interestingly, the Holy Quran called this peace process as the greatest victory. The Prophet of Islam at Hudaibiyah agreed to enter a ten years Peace Treaty with the people of other faiths. It is important to keep in mind that he was far more powerful than the combined strength of all of the non-believers at that time but he preferred a  peace treaty and agreed to their all conditions unconditionally for the sake of peace. The world is in dire need to heed these noble Islamic concepts, at a time when civilization is fragile.  Violence and extremism have become a cross-border global crisis. What the world needs today is a formula for the attainment of religious harmony. Making peace among people is one of the basic aims of Islam. Islam implores its followers to explore every possible avenue for peaceful negotiation, to resolve the conflicts among people, to and put their all efforts into establishing peace in the society. The Holy Quran appeals to  Muslims to engage in constructive dialogue with people of other faiths. Understanding the Qu’ranic teachings of inter-faith dialogue, we need to follow these principles to strengthen inter-faith cooperation in order to overcome the inter-religious conflicts in various parts of the world so that creative peace can be established on the earth.

Rabat – Through his YouTube videos, Instagram stories, and keynote addresses at conferences, Kamal has been sharing his ideas and quickly gathering a loyal following.   Kamal was born and raised in the Moroccan city of Meknes. After graduating high school, he moved to the capital, Rabat to complete his Bachelor’s degree in Statistics. Shortly after beginning a full-time job with the government, he realized that he was too comfortable, and in need of an exciting challenge.   “I must be in an uncomfortable zone. I just don’t enjoy being comfortable at all.”   Kamal moved to Montreal where he continued his studies, improved his English, and entered the workforce as a credit analyst. For a while, he enjoyed the downtown-lifestyle and built a nice life in Montreal. But before long, he was ready for another challenge and decided to move to a small town called Cambridge, Ontario.   It was here that Kamal discovered ‘the power of solitude’. Being the only Moroccan in a small English-speaking town, he initially spent a lot of time alone. He started going for walks in the forest, reading books in coffee shops, and spending a lot of time in self-reflection. This season of isolation and introspection is what really launched Kamal’s journey to becoming a Moroccan ‘Influencer’, a title held my famous social-media personal.   Regarding the importance of self-reflection, Kamal said, “Get to know yourself before trying to know anybody else. Focus on yourself instead of focusing on others.”  And speaking of the impact his habit of reading has had: “Reading helps you to connect the ideas in your mind, to come up with a NEW creative idea… Pretty much all my successful videos on Youtube, they were inspired from reading.”    Kamal launched his YouTube channel in December 2017, deciding to produce his content in Darija, in order to maximize his impact in Morocco. “Morocco needs a new influencer” is one of his taglines, and his videos have received over half a million views with overwhelmingly positive feedback.   “You will never go wrong in your life by treating people right, or by giving good values to people without waiting for anything back, without having any expectations. The feedback is always great!”  Kamal encourages his followers to take responsibility for their life: “At the end of the day, if you don’t manage your life, nobody’s going do it in your place.”   He emphasizes the importance of learning English: “One of the best ways to move forward in life is to learn English. If you have this… you’ll open a lot of doors.”  And he helps youth recognize the opportunities around them: “Opportunity is the only thing that will never wait for you to get ready. You have to get ready for the opportunity!” Kamal Harrasse is generously investing his energy and passion into the next generation of Moroccans, and his content provides a shining example for youth to always strive for self-improvement.

Rabat – Algeria’ s interim President, Abdelkader Bensalah, yesterday received several foreign diplomats at a collective credentials presentation ceremony, Algerian news outlet APS reported. The diplomats attending the ceremony hailed from Bangladesh, Benin, France, Guinea Bissau, Morocco, Namibia, Vietnam, and Yemen. Presenting his letter of credence to the Algerian leader, Morocco’s ambassador to Algeria, Lahcen Abdelkhalek, conveyed King Mohammed VI’s “greetings and regards” to President Bensalah and the Algerian people. Continuing where the King had left off in his latest “frank dialogue” speech in which he offered that Morocco and Algeria put behind them their tumultuous relations, the King’s message to President Bensalah renewed Morocco’s commitment to paving the way to a much friendlier chapter with its Algerian neighbor. According to Agence-France Presse (AFP), Abdelkhalek’s letter of credence contained a large section expressing King Mohammed VI’s “genuine concern” to see the relations improve between Rabat and Algiers. The letter “reiterated the King’s commitment to consolidating between the two countries brotherly relations on the basis of mutual trust, solidarity, and neighborliness in all domains.” Key to the King’s message to the Algerian president was Morocco’s desire to cement “a tradition of cooperation and coordination to meet regional and international challenges.” In response, Bensalah also conveyed his “greetings and regards” to the Moroccan King. The Algerian president also indicated that strengthening bilateral ties with Morocco is among his interests. The ceremony of presentation of credentials is much more than a mere presentation of letters of credence by a newly appointed foreign ambassador to the highest authority of his country of service. Beyond its ceremonial and symbolic weight in establishing official diplomatic ties between two countries, the ceremony means that the host country is granting the foreign official all the rights to represent and defend their country’s policies and interests within the framework of the Vienna Convention, AFP noted. Pointing out that yesterday’s ceremony was the first of its kind in Algeria since 2016—presumably due to the dire health condition of the country’s former president—AFP indicated that the completion of the ceremony means that foreign ambassadors in Algeria “can now undertake a number of official missions.” Aside from the tense political atmosphere in Algeria, with anti-establishment demonstrations requesting a radical overhaul of political leadership, the news comes amidst a flurry of developments in the well-established—but subtle and indirect—Morocco-Algeria tension on the Western Sahara front. The latest UN resolutions on Western Sahara have notably urged Algeria to shoulder its responsibility in the conflict by showing more willingness to engage in settlement discussions. Morocco, which has consistently argued that Algeria is a full-throated participant in the territorial dispute, has welcomed the move. Although there have been suggestions that a change of regime in Algeria will not change much in Algiers’ Western Sahara stance, Rabat is clearly pinning its hopes on the fact that more involvement and political will from Algiers will be pivotal in finally ending the decades-long dispute. As the current Algerian leadership appears to be more preoccupied with weathering the domestic storms coming its way from an economically frustrated and politically desperate population, it remains to be seen whether much will budge in Algeria’s Western Sahara efforts—and most in Algiers-Rabat diplomatic ties.

Rabat – The country’s fragile political climate has lead to suggestions in some circles that amid unrest and demonstrations, election is more likely to be postponed.  As protests continue well into the 13th consecutive week, the likelihood that the July 4 election will take place grows increasingly distant, according to a source close to the issue.  Speaking anonymously with Reuters, the source claimed that heavy opposition in the streets, as well as difficulties with organization and logistics, are likely to postpone the election until later this year. “There won’t be elections on July 4,” the source told Reuters. Read Also: Algerian Army Under Pressure, Urges End of Crisis Before July 4 Election The person went on to further explain that the election could be delayed until the end of the year, with unstable conditions leaving much of the country in a standstill. The North African country was plunged into unrest on February 16, when then-President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his candidacy for a fifth consecutive term after holding the presidency for nearly two decades. Growing popular discontent and late-minute pressure from the military forced Bouteflika to resign last month; however, protests continue as demonstrators seek the removal of all members of the old political establishment that served under  Bouteflika.  Protests have ultimately sought to remove government officials perceived as corrupt as well as oust wealthy elites in the country accused of corruption and nepotism. Naming the interim president, Abdelkader Bensalah, and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui as two of the many survivors of the Bouteflika regime,protests continue to grow larger and more intense as the opposition grows closer to its goal. Earlier this week, dozens of Algerian police forces were injured while attempting to disrupt protests in Central Algeria. With demonstrators continuing to seek large-scale change in Algeria, protests are likely to grow in intensity for the foreseeable future. There is also a lack of clarity surrounding potential candidates for the election, with two familiar names seeming to be the main contenders: Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi and Ahmed Benbitour, both former prime ministers. Meanwhile, protestors seeking large-scale, radical change to the government may be unlikely to be satisfied with either of these candidates. The army is currently overseeing the 90-day transition period before a new government is elected, but the July 4 deadline grows increasingly unlikely as time goes on. As things currently stand, stability is unlikely to return to Algeria in the near future.

Rabat – During the ceremony, police units demonstrated their capabilities and expertise in various fields, including martial arts, use of weapons, and self-defense in addition to the diverse intervention techniques. The police units exhibited their skills in front of guests including members of the Moroccan government, judicial officials, and members of the diplomatic corps accredited in Morocco, as well as a number of civil and military figures and foreign guests. Also participating in the show was a unit of trained police officers from the Central African Republic and the Comoros who received training at the Royal Police Institute in Kenitra as part of cooperation with other African nations.  In his speech at the event, the DGSN’s general director, Abdellatif Hammouchi, stressed that the 16th of May is an occasion for the Moroccan police to celebrate its achievements in ensuring national safety and territorial stability, and also to present its future projects to improve security services and the country’s security system as a whole. Hammouchi said in a speech read on his behalf by the Director of the Royal Police Institute, Abdelaziz Zakaria, that this year’s anniversary has special significance. It comes in the wake of the construction of the DGSN new headquarters in Hay Riad, Rabat and the launch of the integrated health laboratory for radiography and medical analysis for policemen and women and their relatives. The DGSN’s general director has also stated that last year was an important and pivotal step in the completion of restructuring and reforming projects which included the development of new police facilities. Among the projects was the Institute of Sciences and Forensics for the National Police which was established as a home for various technical and scientific police branches. The establishment of the Institute was complemented by the Scientific Police laboratory’s acquisition of a certificate for High-Quality.  The DGSN has also supported the judiciary police with counter-terrorism units in Sale, Rabat, and Fez. It has created 20 new regional criminal investigation teams to support the use of intelligence in criminal cases, as well as to study and analyze emerging criminal methods. Hammouchi emphasized that the DGSN is coping with the demographic growth in different Moroccan cities, saying that 26 new police stations have been built, as well as the creation of new police departments and traffic accident facilities to maintain public order and improve security. Speaking about police training, Hammouchi said the DGSN has opened new training schools in Fez, Laayoune, and Oujda to ensure distribution of the schools all over the country and bring them closer to the trainees. The DGSN has created an online platform for Moroccans with which they can submit their candidature for police examinations. Applicants now number more than 150,000 people annually.  Hammouchi pointed out that a new procedure for evaluating police officers’ performance and conduct was adopted at the beginning of the year, which was designed to increase objectivity, and establish neutrality and impartiality in promotions.

Talking about the accord with China, Moroccan Minister, Amara, praised excellent  Moroccan-Chinese relations, saying that the partnership Morocco and China entered into will further strengthen cooperation between the two countries, especially with regard to water resources. He added that Morocco will benefit from the extensive experience of the Chinese in water and dam construction, especially since Morocco considers the area of water resources of special importance. Shanzhong, in turn, highlighted the great opportunities for cooperation existing between Morocco and China, and his country’s willingness and determination to strengthen strategic partnership with Morocco in this regard.

Rabat – Spanish police are seeking fugitive Mohamed Soultana, who is allegedly traveling to Morocco, via Spain. Soultana, 42, is wanted in connections with an arrest warrant issued by the German police for being a suspect in murder by firearm in Germany.  Pictures of his face are on display in “ports, airports, and border posts,” according to ABC news. Soultana is a bearded man with dark hair, standing at 1.98 meters, though he could be armed and “potentially” dangerous. According to the German media BILD, Soultana shot a 44-year-old German-Moroccan in the city of Offenbach when she was in her car, waiting for her 13-year-old son to come out of a martial arts lesson. He then fled the country on May 9 through Belgium. The alleged murderer would have been an “acquaintance of the victim,” reports the same source.

Rabat – After an exceedingly disappointing season, despite the addition of football legend Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid, Juventus has announced that Massimiliano Allegri will not be returning to his post as a manager for the 2019-2020 season.  Following Juventus’s humiliating defeats to Ajax in the Champions League quarter-finals and to Atalanta in the Coppa Italia, there has been growing discontent towards the team’s leadership, especially towards Allegri. However, the announcement that Allegri would be leaving the team has come as a surprise, as earlier this month Allegri had laughed at rumors that he would not be returning. “It’s amusing,” Allegri said. “Next week I will meet with the president. We will be speaking in general terms, as we do every year.” Allegri went on to assure Juve fans that he would be continuing as coach in the upcoming season and that he had already planned how to improve the team in the future. “With the president I have an excellent relationship of mutual respect and honesty,” he added “I’ve had my ideas for six months on how to proceed. Now I’ll share those ideas with the president and, together, we’ll see if they work.” Allegri has been the coach of Juventus since 2014, leading the team to five consecutive Series A titles during his time as manager. During his time with Juve, Allegri led the team to the Champions League finals twice, coming second to Barcelona in 2015 and to Real Madrid in 2017.  However, Juventus did not see much success this season, with an early elimination from the Champion’s League being only one of two major humiliations. This season also saw the team’s first loss to another Serie A team, when Juve was defeated 2-0 by Genoa. Now, losing to Ajax in the Champions League, and being stripped of their title in the Coppa Italia will be accompanied by the team’s loss of their coach and new potential for team leadership.

Rabat – 26-year-old Acosta Baruelo was tied to a tree for punishment by her Saudi Arabian employers, for allegedly leaving an expensive piece of furniture in the sun. Her employer stated that he had tied her to a tree in order to make her ‘taste the effects of sun’s heat.’ The issue was reported to the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Acosta was returned home. This was not the first incident reported to the (DFA); there have been multiple cases similar to Acosta’s, however other victims have not been able to return home. The Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) faces three challenges when protecting female domestic workers: lack of direct communication lines, insufficient information, and restrictions from other areas abroad. Due to a lack of direct communication, the DFA is not able to make contact with the necessary individuals or entities to successfully impact on the status of female domestic workers. Lack of information on the workers is half the barrier in most cases of abuse. When an employee abroad is in trouble with the employer, they do not have the option of seeking aid from recruiters. To extract these migrants from the dire situations they find themselves in is a difficult task in itself. Renato Villa, of the DFA Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs, explained that “after a domestic worker is deployed, the next of kin and the embassy seldom have access or communication with the worker. Foreign cultures and laws, particularly in the Middle East, have strict privacy practices and provisions,” explained Villa. “Usually, an embassy official has to go through the police authorities before being allowed to talk with or meet the Filipino, much less rescue her from the clutches of an abusive employer,” he added. The DFA is currently working with the President of the Philippines to help create a future where there are enough jobs in the Philippines that working abroad will become a choice rather than a necessity.

Rabat – As Saudi-UAE coalition forces continue deadly air raids on Sana’a city, the Yemeni ambassador to Morocco, Ezzedin Al-Asbahi, commended the Moroccan government’s stance on Yemen, and the kingdom’s decision to withdraw military forces from the conflict in February of this year. While meeting with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lahbib El Maliki, on Wednesday, May 15, Al-Ashbahi voiced Yemen’s willingness to cooperate with Morocco on international issues, as well as Yemen’s hope to draw inspiration from Morocco in regards to human rights and development. Al-Ashbahi stressed the impact of the war on both the Yemeni people and the surrounding Gulf region in the wake of the recent Houthi attack on Saudi oil-pumping stations. The attacks not only highlighted the heightened tensions in the region, but also perpetuated the conflict with subsequent reprisal attacks by the Saudi-UAE coalition. The death toll in the Yemeni crisis surpassed 70,000 earlier this year, and the international community has become divided on how to end the bloodshed. Morocco’s withdrawal Morocco’s withdrawal from the conflict was largely inspired by “political and humanitarian developments on the ground,” said Moroccan Foreign Minister, Nasser Bourita. The kingdom’s decision to end military intervention in the region has been praised by both the internationally-recognized Hadi-government, as well as by the militant Houthi-movement. Earlier this year, the leader of the Houthi movement, Abdel-Aziz bin Habtour, thanked the Moroccan government for its decision to withdraw from the conflict, adding his hopes that Morocco will continue to work with the international community on ending the conflict. “[The decision] reflects the good, brotherly Moroccan-Yemeni relations,” he said. “Yemeni people will continue to cherish their strong, brotherly ties with the Moroccan people in days to come.” Coalition stance Meanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition continues its interventionist stance towards the conflict, fanning the flames of war earlier this week by conducting a series of bombings in the Yemeni capital which killed six civilians and wounded 52, according to the Houthi health ministry. The United States voiced its support earlier this year for the Saudi-led coalition, arguing that the West should stand with Riyadh in its opposition to the Houthi movement. “If you truly care about Yemeni lives, you’d support the Saudi-led effort to prevent Yemen from turning into a puppet state,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a press conference in March. The US administration has grown increasingly close to the Saudi government under Trump’s presidency, especially in regards to the Yemeni conflict. Led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the interventionist coalition is also made up of military forces from Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Senegal, and Sudan. Qatar and Morocco were formerly associated with the coalition, but have since withdrawn. The Houthi perspective The Iranian-backed Houthi movement has recently began a string of attacks on Saudi Arabia, with the militant organization attacking four Saudi oil tankers on 12 May in Fujirah port near UAE, and two Saudi oil-pumping stations on 14 May. The Houthis have claimed that these attacks were a response to “crimes” perpetrated by the Saudi government throughout its intervention in the Yemen crisis. The movement has also accused Riyadh of deliberately targeting civilians through its recent bombing campaign in Sana’a and other parts of Houthi-controlled Yemen. This claim was corroborated by Yemeni journalist Afrah Nasser, whose home in Sana’a was close to where an airstrike hit. “I know the street. There are no military targets there,” Nasser told Al Jazeera. “There is no excuse from the Saudi-led coalition – it was a deliberate and systematic bombardment attacking civilians.” The United Nations compromise The United Nations has claimed that the crisis in Yemen is “the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.” As of February 2019, 24 million people – close to 80 percent of Yemen’s population – need assistance.  Recently, the UN attempted to implement the Hodeidah plan, which aimed to have Hadi and Houthi forces withdraw from the battle in the principal Yemeni port-city, Hodeidah. If successful, the plan would have been the first voluntary withdrawal of forces in the conflict; however, the recent Saudi attack on Sana’a has threatened to disrupt these plans and has further fueled the conflict.

Rabat – The spokesperson of the Moroccan Government, Mustapha El Khalfi, has denied that Morocco’s Head of Government, Saad Eddine El Othmani, commented on Morocco’s position on Algeria. The minister told Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) that El Othmani did not make any official statement on Algeria, but rather expressed Morocco’s hopes to see the borders between the two countries reopened again. El Khalfi said that El Othmani made his remarks during a “private” discussion during an iftar (fast-breaking). El Khalfi’s statement comes after a news report from Anadolu Agency quoted El Othmani saying that Algeria’s former regime “was very hostile to Morocco.” Anadolu Agency reported on Thursday, that El Othmani allegedly expressed “hope” that Algeria’s rulers “won’t follow the former regime’s policy of fierce competition with Morocco.” El Othmani allegedly told reporters that the diplomatic ties between Morocco and Algeria “can’t  be worse than they were under Bouteflika.” The Moroccan government, however, denied that El Othmani made any official comments on Morocco’s political relationship with their eastern neighbor. The government has made it clear that Morocco is interested in reopening the borders with Algeria. Algeria closed the border with Morocco in 1994.  The country made the decision after Rabat imposed visa regulations on Algerian citizens, following a terrorist attack on the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech. Morocco’s initiatives to reopen the border with Algeria were strengthened in November 2018, when King Mohammed VI called for talks between Rabat and Algiers to break the stalemate between the two countries. On the 43rd anniversary of the Green March,  the King stated that the lack of unity between the Maghreb countries is “an unreasonable situation” which contradicts “the brotherly bonds uniting” peoples of Morocco and Algeria. Talking about the hostile relations between Algeria and Morocco, the monarch admitted that they are “not normal, much less acceptable.” Algeria has been holding a  hostile position regarding Morocco’s territorial integrity, and has long supported the Polisario Front. A Policy of Non-interference In recent years, Morocco has been urging the Algerian government to shoulder its responsibility as a main party in the conflict. Earlier this year, Morocco’s Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, accused Algeria of creating the front, giving it “practically an extra sovereign territory in the Tindouf camps – the only camps in the world that are managed by a non-state entity.” Despite the tension,  Morocco’s government has refused to make known its position on the Algerian protests before and after the resignation of Bouteflika. Asked about Morocco’s position at a previous  press conference earlier in May, El Khalfi  told reporters: “Regarding questions about Algeria’s protests, I will answer you with this sentence: I will not answer this question.” In March, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nasser Bourita, said that Morocco maintains a “non-interference” position with regard to the mass demonstrations in Algeria. Bourita said that Morocco will “neither meddle with the internal developments that Algeria witnesses nor comment on them,” according to AFP. Morocco’s policy respects the states’ sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs.

The unprecedented community and solidarity-oriented  project,, aims at improving the dental care services to benefit citizens living in the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the project is part of the King’s efforts to integrate dental health into public health, and to promote access for the underprivileged, poor, and the elderly, and those with special needs to dental care services.  The center sits on a 1,580-square meter plot of land and will provide quality dental care for both kids and adults. The center will also organize campaigns to raise awareness of the risks of tobacco, self-medicating, and issues relating to dental health.  The new facility will consist of radiology units, consultation units for adults, pedodonotics units, a dental emergencies unit, including an outpatient department, which will be in service from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.  With 17 dental cabinets, the centre will dedicate one cabinet to people with special needs, and two for children.  The facility will also include dental surgery units, including an operation suite, recovery and consultation rooms, as specialized consultations in Endodontics, Orthodontics, Periodontics, and dental prosthesis,as well as a dental prosthesis laboratory, space for training, meeting rooms, and a media library.  The Regional center will employ a host of medical and paramedical personnel, including 14 dental specialists, nurses, and administrative and technical personnel.

Rabat – Egyptian author and filmmaker Moez Masoud has announced that he in the process of completing a film based on the horrific massacre which took place in Christchurch, New Zealand. On April 15, a 28-year old white supremacist gunned down dozens of Muslims at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic center in Christchurch, killing 51 and gravely wounding dozen others. According to Variety, the in-progress movie will be called, “Hello Brother.” The title is based “upon the words of one of the victims of the gunman,” in reference to the welcome words of 71-year old victim, Hati Mohammed Daoud Nabi, as he welcomed the 28-year old gunman into the Al Noor Mosque, where 42 were killed. While basing its narrative on a monstrous public attack, “Hello Brother” sets out to put a special emphasis on the positive attitudes and the mutual understanding needed for peacefully coexisting despite differences, according to Masoud. Variety indicated that “the film will follow a family facing death and destruction in Afghanistan who escape with their lives.” For the Egyptian author, academic, and filmmaker, the whole point is to refuse to surrender to the hatred and spite-filled path terrorists like the Christchurch gunman are trying to impose on our imaginations and politico-religious sensibilities. “In Christchurch, on March 15, the world witnessed an unspeakable crime against humanity,” Masoud told Variety. “The story that ‘Hello Brother’ will bring to audiences is just one step in the healing process, so that we might all better understand each other, and the root causes of hatred, racism, supremacy and terrorism.” Massoud, a polymath currently affiliated with the Islamic Studies department at the University of Cambridge in England, is not new to the cinematic arena. His 2016 movie, “Clash,” won plaudits for its riveting retelling of the Egyptian Arab spring that deposed Hosni Mubarak. The movie went on to be the opening film of the Cannes Festival’s “Un Certain Regard” section. Masoud explained that his overarching objective in his new project is to “bring people all over the world together to discuss that day and continue a positive dialogue for a future based on genuine mutual understanding.” For all of Masoud’s demonstrably well-meaning explanation of the rationale behind his choice to produce a cinematic retelling of the Christchurch story, the news of a movie about Christchurch has not been well received in some circles. Actress Rima Te Wiata slammed the move, saying that it is “bad taste” and “inappropriate” to rush to make a film about an incident still fresh in the memory of families and survivors. “It would be the height of bad taste to see people win acting awards for a dramatization of this real-life mass murder,” Te Wiata said.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of Industry (MIICEN) and the national Digital Development Agency (ADD), in partnership with the National Telecommunications Regulations Agency (ANRT), have arranged for 16 Moroccan start-ups to attend the annual Vivatech conference in Paris. The annual Vivatech conference running from May 16 to 18 in Paris, brings together more than 2000 start-ups from all over the world, as well as investors, university representatives, students, and media. The French President Emmanuel Macron attended the event today. This is the second year Morocco has participated in the conference. “Morocco is everywhere. It’s fantastic,” Macron told a journalist from the Moroccan National Society of Radio and Television (SNRT). “Morocco is a friend with whom we have strong relationship. I believe in digital innovation, […] and I believe in its positive powers. […] It is clear that Morocco has a place here, and at Vivatech,” he added. The 16 start-ups were selected by the ADD for their ability to disrupt the GreenTech, HealthTech, EdTech, TransporTech and Artificial Intelligence sectors, and showcase Morocco’s growing tech innovation sector. Innovative start-ups The start-up “Sowit”, for instance, works to strengthen farming in Africa, by helping farmers access information that will maximize their production. This information includes weather and market price data, but also information specifically tailored to the type of agriculture and the location of the farm, as well as targeted recommendations for irrigation and fertilization. “Ashnoo-share Technologies,” another one of the 16 start-ups, operates in the retail sector. It has created a hologram advertising system that allows companies to better target customers in real time while they are shopping.. The conference is an opportunity for the Moroccan start-ups to raise their profile and build connections. Last year the event brought 80 000 visitors in 48 hours. Morocco has been pushing forward its digital strategy, recognizing the transformative role of technology on its economy. The ADD was created in 2017 to support the development and implementation of technology in public administrations as well as in the private sector.  Working on a range of ambitious projects, last week, ADD signed a contract with digital giant EON Reality to open the first Virtual Reality Interactive Digital Center in Morocco. The center will be located at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University campus in Ben Guerir, a town one hour north of Marrakech, and will use AVR teaching methods to prepare students for a digital world. ADD has an investment budget of MAD 235 million (approximately $25 million).

Rabat – Facebook is taking preventive measures to preempt ill-intentioned exploitation of its users’ personal data. The latest move in the technology giant’s response to global outcry over political manipulation came on Thursday of this week, as Facebook announced that it is shutting Israel-linked social media accounts and groups attempting to influence elections and public discourse in many countries, especially in Africa and Asia. “Today we removed 265 Facebook and Instagram accounts, Facebook pages, groups, and events involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s Head of Cybersecurity Policy, announced in a statement on Thursday. Unlike similar announcements in the past months, when the technology giant rang alarm bells about groups spreading conspiratorial and deceptive content without providing specific details about the responsible entities, the latest statement revealed that the primary culprit behind the series of “inauthentic behavior” is Archimedes Group, a public relations firm based in Tel-Aviv, Israel. “Although the individuals behind this network attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found that some of this activity was linked to an Israeli commercial entity, Archimedes Group. “It has repeatedly violated our misrepresentation and other policies, including by engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior. This organization and all its subsidiaries are now banned from Facebook, and it has been issued a cease and desist letter,” the statement noted. With a robust online presence, including dozens of accounts, hundreds of groups, and millions of followers, the Israeli group principally engaged in the dissemination of content to “artificially increase engagement.” The artificial accounts’ activities mainly targeted Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Angola, Niger and Tunisia,” but they also boasted some visible “activity in Latin America and Southeast Asia,” according to Facebook. Part of the fake accounts’ modus operandi is targeting countries by presenting themselves as locals, especially with local news outlets, to publish “allegedly leaked information about politicians.” The group also publicized and hosted political events, and was involved in circulating online advertisements and slogans. The slogans mostly consisted of smear campaigns or supportive messages about front-bencher politicians in target countries. Archimedes Group has not yet responded to Facebook’s announcement. On its website, however, the Israeli firm presents itself as an agenda-setting/influencing firm comprised of “experts from a wide spectrum of fields,” including “consulting, lobbying, public diplomacy, international public relations, information, and social media.” As far as the Israeli firm is concerned, its teams of experts have taken “significant roles in many political and public campaigns, among them presidential elections and other social media projects all over the world.”
Facebook’s warning comes as the group redoubles efforts to clamp down on security to protect users’ privacy and freedom. Faced with global outrage in the age of fake news and scandals such as Cambridge Analytica, the tech giant is promising to upgrade its security policy to protect users’ freedom and privacy. Recent developments also suggest that sustained efforts to monitor “inauthentic behavior” are part of a charm campaign to improve the tech giant’s tarnished reputation. “We’re constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don’t want our services to be used to manipulate people,” read Facebook’s statement. Despite the company’s repeated warnings and promises to punish any “inauthentic behavior” which jeopardizes the privacy of users around the world, the trend has shown no signs of abating. In recent months, Facebook issued similar warnings against a string of “inauthentic behaviors” and other digitized opinion-influencing platforms originating from Iran. Between January and February of this year, Facebook announced that it had uncovered and taken down hundreds of fake Facebook groups and Instagram accounts which specialized in disseminating Iran-friendly narratives in the US, South Asia, and much of the Arab world, including Morocco.

Rabat – The Portuguese football star, Cristiano Ronaldo,  who has long been concerned with the situation of the Palestinian people, has donated $1.5 million to help prepare Iftar for Palestinian fasters. According to ONWADAN’S CHARITY FOUNDATION, the Portuguese star has chosen to give the money to help feed those in Gaza who are suffering under an Israeli air, sea, and land blockade. Ronaldo is known for being generous with the neediest people, especially victims of political wars in Syria and Palestine. In November 2012, Ronaldo sold his Golden Boot at an auction to raise funds which he later donated to Palestinian children. In March 2013, at the end of the game between Portugal and Israel in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Ronaldo refused to exchange shirts with an Israeli player. He later explained that he could not wear a shirt bearing the Israeli flag.  Cristiano Ronaldo donate $1.5m to Palestine Gaza. Behind every successful person, check out where he pays his homage.

Rabat – On May 13, French-Congolese rapper and singer Gandhi Djuna, known by his stage name Maitre Gims, shared a short video of himself reciting the Quran.  In the video, which he shared on social media, Gims can be seen reciting the beginnings of Surah Yasin in the Holy Quran. Maitre Gims, 33, converted to Islam in 2004. Gims has also recently filmed a music video in Marrakech.  The song, which featured the Colombian singer Maluma, was part of his newly released album. “I wanted to make this clip here in Marrakech, where I live. to highlight this millennial city and its enormous tourism potential,” said Gims in a statement to the press.   Gims also noted that he wanted to “pay homage to this city where I was welcomed with open arms.”

Rabat – The Nike Pro Hijab currently ranks at number seven on the list of the world’s most popular items in fashion, according to the largest global fashion search platform, Lyst, in their Lyst Index, which claims a 125% rise in demand this quarter. The athletic wear hijab, released December 2017, remains a popular product after making headlines for being one of the first of its kind. A triggering factor behind the demand for Nike Pro Hijab is that French retailer Decathlon canceled its own athletic hijab, called Kalenji Hijabi, due to negative feedback, including threats and complaints. Those in opposition to the product include politicians Agnes Buzyn, the Health Minister for French President Macron’s administration, and Aurore Berge, from Macron’s centrist party, La Republique En Marche. Berge even encouraged people to boycott Decathlon’s stores. However, Fiona Lazaar, an MP from Macron’s centrist party, tweeted her disappointment when Decathlon finally withdrew the item in France due to “racism” and “Islamophobia.” The Kalen Hijabi is still available for sale in Morocco. Given that the Nike hijab is still on sale in France and other countries in Europe, North Africa, North America and across the Middle East, it has little competition from other well-known labels. The Nike hijab is on the Lyst list of the “hottest” items, with the political statement that sport should be more inclusive to Muslim women helping its momentum. “Now that Nike has released this line of headgear, the hope is that FIBA, and the sports world at large, will start making Muslim women a priority, too,” wrote columnist for ESPN, A. Davidson. Joining Nike Pro Hijab’s popularity on Lyst are Alexander McQueen’s oversized sole sneakers (first), Prada’s stud-embellished headband (second), Fendi’s baguette bag (sixth), Gucci’s Ace sneakers (eighth), Proenza Schouler’s tie-dye turtleneck (ninth), and Chloe Sawyer slides (tenth).

Rabat – Videos showing men fighting and hitting each other outside the Ghamama Mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, went viral on social media. The footage shows a group of men engaged in a violent exchange before iftar, or breaking the fast, at a public gathering in Medina. The men involved in the violence were heard cursing each other outside one of the oldest mosques in the city. The reason of the fight, which took place last week, is still unclear.  Al Araby news outlet, however, reported that the fight may have broken out due to an argument over ‘sitting positions before the food was served.” Ramadan in Saudi Arabia started on May 6.   Ramadan is a time of fasting, reflection, self-control, and spirituality.  During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from all food and water between dawn and sunset. In addition to fasting, Ramadan is also an opportunity for Muslims to open their hearts and engage in spiritual reflection.

Fez is famed for its tanneries and for good reason. The rows and rows of symmetrical holes filled with dye are mesmerizing and make for an amazing photo. To access the view, one must pass through one of the shops selling leather goods made at the tannery to get to a viewing terrace. It is recommended you keep your wits about you while passing through as to not get scammed, because this is a highly touristic area.  The shopkeepers will beckon you in to view their terrace, and you must always ask what it costs before agreeing so you are not shocked when you are asked for an exorbitant fee on your way out.  The jackets, handbags, and shoes in the shops are made on site from the softest leather in various colors and styles. If something catches your eye, however, be aware you will have to haggle to get a good price. TripAdvisor reviews are full of stories of pushy shopkeepers and spending traps, but you should not let this discourage you as the visit is truly worth it.  When I went myself, I was mostly left in peace and I stood admiring the view for quite a while. My father, a photographer, even paid a small fee to be able to go to the bottom and balance himself around the pits of dye, attempting to get the best shot.  I did give the shopkeeper a tip of MAD 20 on my way out. If you are truly concerned, hiring a guide in Fez is a good idea.  Most people, when asked where the oldest university still operating is, would guess Oxford or Cambridge in the UK. The correct answer, however, is the University of Al Quaraouiyine in Fez, founded in A.D. 861, 200 years before either Oxford or Cambridge.  The tale of how this university was founded is a fascinating one. The story starts when Fatima al-Fihri and her family migrated from Karaouine, Tunisia, to Fez. Her father found success as a merchant in the city and Fatima married.  The al-Fihri family had made a happy life for themselves in Morocco. However, her husband, father, and brother all died in a short period of time, leaving just Fatima and her sister behind.  They left the two women with a sizeable inheritance though, and Fatima, a devout Muslim, decided to give back to the community.  Fatima noticed that the mosques of Fez were not large enough to accommodate the city’s growing population, so she took it upon herself to build a grand mosque, with a madrassa (school) attached. When construction began during Ramadan in A.D. 859, she vowed to fast until her dream was realized.  She could not have imagined how long her legacy would last. To this day, students aged 13-30 attend the school to gain both high school-level diplomas and university degrees. Before attending the school, students must have memorized the whole Qur’an as well as several other texts.  Although the university is not open for non-Muslims to visit, many go just to look through the giant gate at the entrance, which offers a good look into the world’s oldest university. For a perfect example of Merenid-dynasty architecture at its most elaborate, Medersa Bou Inania is the place to go. The medersa (school) was built in the mid-14th century by Sultan Abou Inan, who was infamous for murdering his father and having hundreds of children.  It is believed that the religious leaders of Al-Quaraouiyine mosque encouraged him to build the medersa to redeem his sins.  This might explain why he built the medersa to be so extraordinary; perhaps he felt he had a lot to atone for. The site was built to be both a school and a place for religious congregation, and even though it is no longer an operating school, it is still used for religious purposes. It is one of the few religious sites in Morocco open to non-Muslims.  The marble-paved courtyard of the merdersa is full of intricate details no matter where you look. Upon entering, you immediately see a beautiful running fountain with water fresh from the Fez river.  Carved wood and stucco abound here, as well as cedar columns. Fez is famed for its artisans, after all.  On either side of the courtyard, you will find classrooms and an oratory at the end. Climbing the stairs to the upper floors is well worth it for a view of the spectacular courtyard from above. One of the most beautiful elements of the Medersa Bou Inania is its minaret tiled with green zellige.  Very little is known about these ancient tombs that loom over Fez, except that they were most likely built during the Merenid Dynasty’s reign in the 14th century. Who was buried here and why remains a mystery. Although the tombs lie in ruins today and lack the well-preserved and intricate beauty of some of the other sites on this list, they are still well worth the visit. The tombs are one of the most popular tourist destinations, with added thanks to the panoramic views of Fez the site offers. Ancient Fez, called Fez el Bali, was built in a bowl, and the Merenid Tombs offer a perfect vantage point to look down upon the city. Fez’s 365 minarets dotted all over the city are in perfect view, and the most iconic ones can be spotted by a keen eye.

Rabat – The Austrian government approved, Wednesday, May 15, a law against “ideologically and religiously” influenced outfit, which the ruling right-wing People’s party (OVP) and the Freedom party (FPO) has proposed. The law against hijab, a headscarf worn by female Muslims, excludes the parka, a head covering worn by Sikhs, and the kippah, a Jewish skullcap. The reason why the Jewish kippah and Sikh’s parka are allowed is because the two religious symbols do not fit the definition put in the bill, which refers to “garments that cover all the hair of the head or much of it.” Although the bill suggests that the ban on hijab, which remains valid until the age of ten, will serve “social integration in harmony with the Austrian local customs, preservation of basic values under the constitution, and equality between men and women,” it appears to have hidden motivations. Responding to the motives behind the adoption of the law, targeting the hijab of all other religious symbols, FPO’s Education Spokesman Wendelin Molzer noted point-blank that the law is motivated by a desire to fight political Islam, and aims at emancipating children from “subjugation.”  Failing to comply with the ban, parents will risk paying a fine of € 440 ($491) or serve a substitute imprisonment of two weeks, the law states.  Islamic Religious Community in Austria reject the law, which still has to pass before the Austrian Federal Council, as “shameful” and as a “diversion tactic” intended to land a blow to the religious freedom of Austrian Muslims.  It further added in a statement that the ban will only lead to segregation and discrimination against Muslim girls. The community said it will take legal action against the ban before the Constitutional Court.

Rabat – Moroccan international players Hakim Ziyech and Noussair Mazraoui have won awards for their hard work while playing for Amsterdam’s Ajax this season. The Dutch football club named Morocco’s key footballer Ziyech as its Player of the Year, while Noussair Mazraoui scooped the Talent of the Year Award. Head coach at Ajax, Erik ten Hag, announced the big news on Thursday during the season’s closing ceremony held in Amsterdam yesterday, May 17. The ceremony was attended by thousands of fans.  Ziyech has been inspiring his fans with his professional performances during Ajax games during the UEFA Champions League. Ziyech’s key performances with Ajax have attracted several international football clubs, including Real Madrid, the Bundesliga giant Bayern Munich, as well as Chelsea and Manchester United. In April 2018, Ziyech clinched the title of the player of the year of his Dutch team after he led them to a major win against AZ Alkmaar. Ziyech, however, hinted that he might stay with his current football club, leaving room for speculation about his future. In April the footballer said that he is“ always very picky” in response to offers he receives from football clubs. “Anything is possible. There must be a club that I want to trade in for Ajax. That doesn’t just happen,” he added. Ziyech joined Ajax in 2017. Ziyech also played in many games for Morocco’s national football team, including during the 2018 World Cup.  Mazroui has just renewed his contract with the Dutch football club in April. The club extended the footballer’s contract until 2022. The midfielder’s previous contract extended until 2021.  Mazraoui, who had the option to play for the Netherlands’ national team, decided to represent Morocco with the Atlas Lions instead. Both footballers are expected to participate in the 2019 African Cup of Nations with Morocco’s Atlas Lions. Thanks to their impressive skills, both footballers are have a brilliant future ahead of them, either with their Dutch club or another team, if they decide move..

Rabat – The one seat auto-racing, Formula 1, is considering an invitation from the Moroccan government to add the country to its racing map. The commercial director of the competition, Sean Bratches, has said that “productive talks” have been held with the government of South Africa and, “to a lesser extent,” with Morocco, reported Spanish media outlet, AS. If Morocco is to host a Formula 1 stage, it would be in the city of Marrakech which has already hosted three consecutive Formula-E championships, as well as the WTCC. Morocco acted as host to Formula 1 race in 1958 in Casablanca’s Ain Diab. British racer Stirling Moss won the Casablanca stage. Formula 1’s last visit to the African continent was in 1993 at South Africa’s racing circuit, Kyalami. Between 1967 and 1993, 20 South African Grands Prix were staged at Kyalami. “We race on five continents and the last habitable continent that we don’t race in is Africa,” Bratches said at the Sport Industry Breakfast Club in London. “We have proactively been approached by Morocco and Marrakech to take a grand prix there. There is a high degree of interest,” he added. Bratches highlighted that “Morocco has a high degree of interest for hosting a race in Marrakech, as the country’s government sees Formula 1 as an economic engine for growth and tourism.”

Rabat – Moroccan American Connections in Revere Association (MACIR), a nonprofit organization which aims to empower the local Moroccan American community, will host its third annual Moroccan Cultural Day on Saturday, June 22.  The event will be held in collaboration with the city of Revere, 5 miles from Boston, Massachusetts, and aims to highlight the culture of the growing Moroccan population in the area, which is estimated to account for at least 10% of Revere’s population.  The festival, which is free and open to the public, will feature Moroccan food, live music, henna tattoo art, and local Moroccan vendors.  The best exhibitor will be nominated the 2019 Honorary Ambassador of Morocco to the City of Revere.

As a matter of fact, we will be raffling a free round trip ticket to Morocco and other surprises will be announced soon,” Notable attendees will include Revere Mayor Brian Arrigo, “city officials and some Moroccan celebrities.” Revere is not the only city to honor Moroccan culture this year. Washington D.C. also celebrated its connection with Morocco. The city’s mayor, Muriel Boweson, declared March, 29 as ‘Morocco Day’ in collaboration with the Moroccan American Network.  The event, which will be held annually, aims to highlight the 12 regions of Morocco of 12 years and contribute to the development of these regions. This year, the event honored the city of Zagora. During the Washington D.C. event, Mayor of the nearby city Alexandria, Justin Wilson, announced that his city will also celebrate Morocco with the second phase of Morocco Day on June 8. The festival will feature Moroccan Gnawa music and dance, in addition to jazz and art shows.  Head of the Zagora region Abderrahim Chahid told Morocco World News that Morocco Day in Alexandria will “feature Zagora’s heritage and folklore music, including one of the popular music bands Rokba led by maestro Karfaoui.”

Rabat – Herve Margot, the headmaster of the Victor Hugo high school in Marrakech has been suspended after a former student spoke up about sexual misconduct, asking that the headmaster be held accountable for the “damages” he has caused in the “lives of young women.” The principal accuser, who has not yet been named in reports, is a former student at the school, which is one of Morocco’s many selective and reputed French high schools. Le proviseur du Lycée français Victor Hugo à #Marrakech aurait du mal à controler ses mains et sa langue visiblement. #MeToo @aefeinfo #AEFE pic.twitter.com/3qq09YNLqX — Farah Nadifi (@FFafou) May 15, 2019 p style=”text-align: justify;”&gt;In a lengthy, MeToo-inspired “message” that began circulating online on Wednesday, May 15, Magot’s accuser spoke out against the culture of “silence” and “impunity” that have emboldened the headmaster to continue what the text describes as years and years of inconsiderate and inappropriate conduct with female students and colleagues. “If you’re wondering why you are you receiving this message,” the text started off with a blasé rhetorical question, “well, it is simply because silence is no longer an option.” The text continued: “Many of you may have no idea what I am about to tell you. Some will simply not care and so will make fun of it. But others will relate. So many people have suffered, mainly young women: both teachers and students. Today I say no.” The “message” went on to provide a list of charges for which the headmaster should be held accountable. The litany of accusations levelled at Headmaster Magot includes “wandering hands,” “sexual allusions,” and “misplaced questions and remarks.” The text noted that the headmaster’s “wandering hands” have for far too long got away with uncomfortable touchiness, including “always touching you high on the chest or the bottom of your breasts.” The accuser argued that her decision to come out was motivated by a desire to finally break from the cycle of silence and guilty indifference, to finally “say no.” “I say no to inaction. No to silence. No to half-measures…. I refuse to remain silent and tolerate such unacceptable deeds and gestures.” Most critical perhaps, Magot’s accuser hinted at the potential power of coming out: convincing others who have had similar uncomfortable experiences to feel emboldened and strong enough to denounce their abuser. “Because many of us have suffered the same fate, we have a voice and we do matter. Justice must be done. We can no longer withdraw into silence and let this person get away with all this as if nothing happened.” As a result of the accusations, Magot has been suspended from his post pending investigations and “dialogue” between students, parents, and the school board to determine what happened, the Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE) announced in a statement as the unsigned message went viral. The statement also came as a response to a two-day strike that students at the school staged on May 15-16. Taking the side of Magot’s accuser, protesting students asked that the headmaster “responds for his actions.” According to a statement from the Marrakech Student’s Parents Union (UCPE), the French embassy’s cultural adviser is scheduled to travel to Marrakech on Friday to shed further light on the issue. The French embassy’s envoy is set to meet with students’ representatives, parent associations, and the school board to “discuss and use all democratic means to clarify and solve this issue,” UCPE’s statement noted. The headmaster has so far denied all the accusations.

Perhaps Morocco’s most famed destination, all those who come to Morocco should experience the magic of Jemaa el-Fna at least once. The history of this square dates back to the 11th century, securing it a spot on the UNESCO world heritage list. For almost a thousand years, Jemaa el-Fna has been the social hub and marketplace of Marrakech, and while walking around the square, it sometimes feels like very little has changed. The snake charmers, musicians, and monkey trainers create a truly unique experience.  Travelers are advised not to carry any unnecessary valuables and to be aware of their belongings to prevent being pickpocketed. This Qur’anic school was founded in the 14th century and named after Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf, who brought significant change to Marrakech during his reign. Although it only has 132 dorms for students, during its heyday 900 students would come every day from all over Marrakech to attend the famed school and study theology and law.  The school still stands in perfect condition, making it easy to imagine how these students lived hundreds of years ago. One cannot help but smile at the Arabic inscription at the entryway that reads, “You who enter my door, may your highest hopes be exceeded.”  After walking through a narrow and dark hallway, you find yourself in a large sunlit courtyard. If you look up, you will see wooden lattice balconies, and if you look around you will notice the 5-color zellige tiles and carved cedar details. After climbing the steep stairs to the next floor, you will find the dorms and marvel at the dedication it would require to live in such a small room.  The school is walking distance from the medina (old city) and a dozen other sites worth visiting, making it something you must include in your Marrakech itinerary. Entrance costs MAD 60. Bahia is Arabic for brilliant, and this could not be a more fitting description of this palace. The palace was commissioned by Si Moussa, a former slave who rose in rank to become grand vizier of the sultan in 1866. When his son, Bou Ahmad, took control of the state, the palace grew even more lavish.  Bou Ahmad brought craftsmen in from Fez to add lush gardens, an extra riad, and carved stucco details. Because he also hired a famed architect who previously worked in Andalusia, the mix of Spanish and Arab influence is clearly seen. When Bou Ahmad died in 1900, Sultan Abd al-Aziz came to power and ordered the palace be looted and ransacked. From 1908 to 1911, Pacha Glaoui, a renowned warlord, used the palace to entertain French guests, who took such a liking to the palace that they claimed it for their own. It became the residence of the French Protectorate’s resident general. The palace sprawls over two acres in the heart of the medina and has an astonishing 150 rooms. The large courtyard with green tiles, a beautiful fountain, and carved wooden columns ensures any visitors are instantly impressed upon walking in. The palace is also home to dozens of rooms with beautiful zellige fireplaces and a harem, although it is closed off to visitors. However, visitors are more than welcome to the beautiful gardens. Bahia Palace is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day and costs only MAD 10 to enter. Majorelle Garden is one of the most famed tourist sites in Morocco, and for good reason. The site was initially designed by Jacques Majorelle, a painter who, like many others, fell in love with Marrakech and decided to call it home. He bought a four-acre plot in 1923 and built a house in Moroccan style, but he kept adding to the land over the next 10 years, adding a villa and another six acres of land. Perhaps his most spectacular work of all, Jacques Majorelle worked on perfecting the beautiful garden on this property until his death in 1962. He was once quoted as saying, “This garden is a momentous task, to which I give myself entirely. It will take my last years from me and I will fall, exhausted, under its branches, after having given it all my love.” He painted all the walls a vibrant ultramarine blue, now commonly known as “Majorelle blue,” in order to perfectly contrast the green of the hundreds of different plant species he sourced from all over the world. The love and hard work the painter poured into this garden truly ensured it lives on. While it remained open to the public after his death, it fell into disarray until renowned French designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Berge stumbled upon it on a trip to Marrakech in 1980 and fell in love. Upon hearing the land was to be sold and turned into a hotel, they decided to do everything in their power to preserve the beauty of the garden and eventually bought it. Saint Laurent and Berge moved into Majorelle’s old villa and took it upon themselves to restore the garden to its former glory. They installed an advanced sprinkler system, hired a team of 20 gardeners, and increased the number of plant species from 135 to 300. After Saint Laurent died in 2008, his ashes were scattered in the garden that was so dear to him and a memorial was built in his honor. The garden has continued to improve in recent years, with an Amazigh (Berber) museum filled with artifacts being inaugurated in 2011 and a luxury boutique and a highly rated cafe being added to the site. Costing only MAD 70 to enter, there is a reason this is one of the most visited sites in Marrakech.  The Saadian tombs are one of the few well-preserved relics from the Saadian dynasty, which reigned from A.D. 1524 to 1659. In the 18th century, Sultan Moulay Ismail ordered all evidence of the Saadian dynasty be destroyed. However, he did not dare desecrate their tombs. He went as far as ordering an entrance to the tomb be constructed.  It is thanks to Moulay Ismail’s fear of sacrilege that the Saadian tombs still stand in all their glory today. However, he did seal the tombs, hiding them from view, and they were not rediscovered until 1917. The tomb was constructed as a place of burial for the founder of the Saadian dynasty, Mohammed ash-Sheikh, by his son. The fifth and final ruler of the dynasty, Sultan Ahmed el Mansour, added to much of its splendor. By his death, the site contained 66 tombs across two mausoleums, with princes, royal wives, advisors, and even two Jewish dignitaries.  When the stray cats, storks, and dust were cleared out after 100 years of desolation, the tombs were just as beautiful as ever and opened for visitors. The Italian marble, gold, and intricate zellige show the prosperity of the Saadian dynasty. Outside, a sprawling garden houses the burial sites of 100 more influential people of the time. There is a MAD 70 entrance fee, and the tombs are open to visitors from 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. Koutoubia mosque, located just 200 meters from Jemaa El-Fna square, is named after the Arabic word “koutoubiyyin,” meaning bookseller, because of the hundreds of booksellers that would gather at the base of this mosque in the 12th century. The original mosque on the site, built by the Almoravid dynasty, was not properly aligned with Mecca, so when the Almohads took control of Marrakech in the 12th century, they decided to build a mosque on the same plot of land that would be properly aligned with Mecca. The mosque was built exactly the same as the first one, but the Almoravids soon fell into disarray. Today, Almohad’s Koutoubia mosque still stands as the largest mosque in Marrakech and the oldest and most intact structure from this dynasty.  The mosque was built from sandstone, brick, and ceramic tiles. Its 70-meter-high minaret was used as a prototype for Seville’s Giralda and Rabat’s Tour Hassan. Although the mosque is not open to non-Muslims, it is still worth a visit when you are in the area to see the exterior that inspired architecture globally.

Rabat – Internet users have launched the hashtag, #Qhertouna, (you exhausted us) on Facebook to condemn the illegal and widespread presence of unauthorized car parking valets. Moroccan drivers are fed-up of paying unofficial car parking attendants.  The valets, who hold no official badge from the authorities, are charging Moroccan drivers to park on the streets. Drivers are calling on authorities to intervene to fight against the “fake” car parking valets by regulating the sector and putting signs on monitored streets with fees. Motorists are arguing the state should pay the parking valets since drivers already pay the circulation tax which should cover parking in public spaces.  Some drivers wrote on Facebook that they found themselves obliged to give MAD 2 to valets several times a day. On a Facebook page supporting the campaign, drivers said that anyone wearing a yellow gilet can become a valet and if something happens to the car, the unofficial attendants evade responsibility. Parking in the cities is already chaotic, especially in the summer when people are more mobile.  For instance, at many Moroccan beaches, self-appointed valets are asking drivers to pay between MAD 10 and MAD 20 for parking.  In Rabat, drivers experience similar situations during the Mawazine festival. Drivers are asked to pay from 10 to MAD 20 In order to park their cars in neighborhoods near the festivals’ stages. In these cases, drivers find themselves having to choose between arguing the charge or silently accepting it for the sake of convenience.

Rabat – A group of Moroccan migrants is among the 636 undocumented migrants currently being held in Turkey. Security sources told Anadolu Agency that Turkish authorities were holding 565 Moroccan migrants in the western Edirne province near the Turkish-Greek border. In addition to Moroccan citizens, the list of the migrants also includes citizens from Palestine, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Syria. The news agency also reported that a minibus carrying 16 undocumented migrants from Morocco and Algeria crashed in  Edrine. The crash injured 11 people, including the driver. Like Morocco, Turkey has been one of the routes used by refugees, and undocumented migrants seeking to cross into Europe. The Turkish Ministry of Interior said that nearly 268,000 undocumented migrants were arrested in 2018.  “The migrants were mostly Afghan, Syrian and Iraqi nationals,” said the news outlet. In recent years, the Moroccan government has also been faced with significant numbers of undocumented migrants entering the country. Due to these high numbers, Morocco has collaborated with Spain to curb the flow of immigration. The Spanish government has repeatedly supported Morocco, calling on the European Union to assist the North African country over migration. Earlier in May, Spanish Minister of Defense Margarita Robles said that her country has “full confidence in the collaboration with Morocco.” Spanish news outlet ABC quoted the Spanish Ministry of the Interior, saying that the number of irregular migrants in Spain dropped by 52% from April 2018 to April 2019. ABC emphasized that the significant decrease is thanks to Morocco’s efforts.

Rabat – Despite the 16,000-kilometer distance between Morocco and Australia, an authentic Australian restaurant has popped in Morocco, the first of its kind in Marrakech.  As an Australian expat living in Morocco, I am frequently asked by curious friends if Australia has a distinctive cuisine, and I always respond that I will take them to Plus 61 in Marrakech so they can see for themselves. Named Plus 61 after Australia’s telephone country code, the restaurant made instantly feel at home upon walking in. Sunlit and modern, it reminds me of any cafe you would find on the hipster streets of Melbourne.  The cafe is mostly white except for touches of rose gold, consistent with today’s trends. The vibe is relaxed and informal, in line with Aussie style.      A post shared by plus61 (@plus61marrakech) on May 7, 2019 at 12:28am PDT  Often unbeknownst to those that have not visited Australia themselves, coffee and cafe culture is a huge part of Australian life, and Plus 61 is a perfect representation of that. Because of this, most Australians are coffee snobs, so I had high hopes when ordered a flat white, Australia’s own brilliant coffee invention that I get deeply homesick for. It exceeded my expectations; I had the best coffee I had had in months. I highly recommend ordering a flat white instead of your usual coffee order to get the full experience. Plus 61’s lunch menu is quintessentially Australian: Ingredients are as fresh as they can get with the fruit and vegetables sourced from local farmers and bread, pasta, cheese, and yoghurt are made fresh in-house every day. The meals are inspired by various different cultures, reflecting the multiculturalism of Australia. The menu is subject to frequent change, so the meals are always perfectly suited to the season.  Wanting to try as much of that day’s menu as I possibly could, my family and I ordered multiple dishes and put them in the middle of the table to share around.  There was something on the menu to accommodate everyone: My mother, a lover of anything green, ordered the wild green tart while I opted for lamb and rosemary pasta. We also sampled roast cauliflower and the fish of the day. Conversation soon came to stop as we eagerly tried the dishes, resuming only to comment on how delicious the food was—a very good sign.  We were fortunate enough to have dessert brought to us by one of the two co-owners, Cassie, and the chef Andrew, probably as happy to run into fellow Australians as I was. On offer was Lamingtons, an iconic Australian cake encased in chocolate and coconut. I was overjoyed to taste a little piece of home.     ♨︎ Dream Team – teaming up with the best to make some magic here – come and say hello ✫ . . . ◷ Lunch hours daily from 12pm-4pm – Walk ins welcome – Bookings +212 5 24 20 70 20 (closed on Sundays) . . . 📷@gaelleboulicautpics at @plus61marrakech . . . ◅ ▻ #plus61marrakech #marrakech #morocco #marrakechrestaurant #guelizrestaurant #sydneyinmarrakech #dreamteam #magicmakers #thechef #thecreativemind #theconceptgenius #sayhello #alwayswelcome #eatmoremagic #livemoremagic #marrakechstyle #gueliz #lunch #hotspot #australiatomarrakech A post shared by  plus61 (@plus61marrakech) on Feb 19, 2019 at 2:12am PST Cassie and Andrew were both warm and welcoming in a typically Australian way, and I was eager to hear the story of how Plus 61 came to be.  Cassie, a long-term expat in Morocco, used to sell her own kaftan designs in the Marrakech medina (old city) before taking the plunge into the restaurant business, and it is evident by all the tiny details done just right that she poured her heart and soul into the creation of Plus 61.  She co-owns the restaurant with Sebastian de Gzell, who also co-owns the famed Nomad restaurant in the ochre city. Their chef, Andrew, moved all the way from Australia to provide Plus 61 with the most authentic cuisine possible. I left that day full to the brim and with a big grin on my face, feeling significantly less homesick. I urge anyone, Australian or Moroccan, to try Plus 61 for a slice of Australian life in the heart of the Gueliz neighborhood in Marrakech.

Rabat – Morocco will acquire AH-64 Apache military helicopters from the US within the next two years. How many helicopters Morocco will receive is unknown. The deal to purchase the Apache helicopters has been underway since April last year, but the timeframe of delivery has only just been revealed “Morocco has a pressing need for new sophisticated attack helicopters,” a source told Moroccan news outlet Le360.  The Moroccan government  considered two helicopter models, the US made AH-64 Apache, and the Turkish made T-129 ATAK helicopter, finally settling for the US model mid last year. The AH-64 Apache is one of the world’s most advanced multi-role combat helicopters, used by the US army and many international defense forces. It was used in the Gulf War, and as well as in conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. Last week, the U.S. State Department cleared a potential foreign military sale of 24 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to Qatar, in a deal that could be worth up to $3 billion. Morocco will be the second African country to own the helicopter, after Egypt, which bought a fleet in 1995. Morocco may use these helicopters to protect its borders from illegal migration and drug trafficking.  Morocco’s military budget slightly increased from MAD 29.4 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2012 to MAD 34.7 billion in 2018 ($3.5 billion), according to the 2018 Trends in World Military Expenditure report released in April 2019 by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Morocco received 62% of its arms from the US between 2014-2018.

Rabat – The Moroccan Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Agriculture have imposed new regulations on small-scale chicken slaughter shops, or “riachats,” as well as on the commercial transport of chickens. The aim is to promote better hygiene practices and therefore prevent large scale food poisoning.  According to the  two Ministries, small-scale live chicken sale shops sometimes supply restaurants, yet have no sanitary control. The “riachats” as they are called in Moroccan dialect, may expose buyers to mass food poisoning and threaten public health. Moroccans consume on average 20.4 kg of chicken meat per year. According to the Interprofessional Federation of the Aviary Sector (FISA), in 2018 only 12.4% of the chicken meat consumed came from certified abattoirs. The rest, 87.6% came from unregulated slaughtering in homes or riachats. Hygiene Regulations for Slaughter As of 3 May, riachats will now have to meet strict restrictions, and must fall into one of two meat supply categories. Either they exclusively supply chickens for household consumption, in which case they are allowed to slaughter. They are not permitted to supply restaurants, butchers, or other commercial points of sale. Alternatively, they can supply chicken meat commercially, including to restaurants and butchers, but they are not allowed to slaughter. They can only supply chicken meat that has been slaughtered at an authorised abattoir. Furthermore, any new riachat will need to be approved by a local hygiene committee. The regulations do not mention whether or not the sanitary conditions of existing riachats will be reviewed. Transport The regulations also impose new strict requirements on chicken transport. Any live chicken transported for commercial purposes must have a document confirming traceability. Any chicken without this type of document will be “seized and destroyed.”  The regulations will put into place a ban on the transport of chickens in wooden crates. Cages and boxes must be made of cleanable and disinfectable material.  It remains to be seen how the new regulations will be enforced. The Ministries have not commented on this detail, or on how quickly riachats will have to tighten up their game.

Rabat – Ramadan is a month of fasting, spiritual reflection, and connecting with friends, families, and communities. Night time during Ramadan is particularly festive. Muslims come together to share large meals with friends and families, and stay up late into the night in cafés and restaurants. Traditionally, the Ramadan fast is broken with a meal called “iftar,” eaten at sunset, then another meal, “suhoor” is taken before dawn.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has released recommendations on how to stay healthy during Ramadan. WHO warns that excessive eating at iftar and suhoor can lead to weight gain. By following its recommendations, the month of Ramadan can have health benefits such as weight loss and reduced blood pressure. First, WHO recommends drinking at least 10 cups of water at night, to replace fluids lost during the day. Eating fruit and vegetables with high water content is also useful,  watermelon, for example, or mixed salads with tomatoes and cucumbers. Soups can also help replace fluids. WHO reminds those observing Ramadan that avoiding drinking caffeinated drinks like tea, coffee, and coca-cola, is important because caffeine is a diuretic and can accelerate dehydration. Any fizzy drinks consumed will add calories to the diet. WHO notes beginning iftar with three dates is a healthy, traditional practice, as dates are an excellent source of fiber. It also strongly recommends eating suhoor before dawn. A healthy suhoor should be light, and consist of vegetables, a portion of wholemeal bread, high protein milk products like milk, lben or unsalted cheese, eggs, tahina, and avocado. WHO specifically recommends avoiding fried and sugary food, and all food made with pastry, as it often includes fat, margarine or butter. While the traditional Moroccan sweets, such as deep-fried, honey drenched “chebakia” cakes, appear on many iftar tables throughout Ramadan, they are not necessarily recommended.

Rabat – Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of both Morocco’s Royal Football Federation (FRMF) and Moroccan football club Nahdat Berkane (commonly known as RS Berkane), has said that his club would withdraw from the African Confederation Cup if proven guilty of the allegations leveled against it.  Fouzi’s statements are a direct response to strident warnings from Mortada Mansour, the president of Egypt’s Al Zamalek sports club. Mansour recently accused RS Berkane of “unfair” treatment of opponents. Mansour claimed an RS Berkane executive “deliberately sounded the alarm of a hotel on the eve of an important game to psychologically affect players of a rival team.” The president of the Egyptian football club president was referring to an incident that occurred on the day of the CAF Confederation Cup semi-final game in Morocco between RS Berkane and Tunisian club CS Sfaxien. At 5 a.m of match day, the alarm of the Be Live hotel in Saidia where the Tunisian club was staying went off. Mansour claims that Moroccans intentionally sounded the alarm to perturb the Tunisian team. Mansour said on Friday, May 10, that his club must be properly treated in order for Egyptians to reciprocate with their Moroccan guests Responding to the allegations in an interview with Moroccan news outlet Achkayen, Lekjaa challenged Mansour to provide proof for his accusations. The Moroccan said that his team would withdraw from the competition and surrender its finalist spot to CS Sfaxien if it was proven that someone from both the club and supporters triggered the alarm. Lekjaa also said that the withdrawal would also be applied if there was ambiguity on the goals scored by RSB against CS Sfaxien. According to the hotel report on the incident, Lekjaa stated that the alarm has been triggered due to hookah smoke. Lekjaa also spoke about the refereeing mistakes that led to the qualification of Al Zamalek. During the quarter-final match between Moroccan club Hassania of Agadir (HUSA) and Al Zamalek, the referee refused a valid HUSA goal that would have upended the outcome of the match.  “If someone wants to give us lessons, they should not accept the refereeing mistakes because of which they were qualified,” asserted the FRMF president. “Practicing psychological pressures on rivals is part of football, but the ways to pressure have changed. So the president of Al Zamalek club has to change his methods,” added Lekjaa.   Mansour retracts Two days after his trenchant statements about RS Berkane’s “unfair play,” however, Mansour played down his criticism, saying that he was only quoting the Tunisian media.  In his latest radio interview on the topic, Mansour withdrew his comments, telling Moroccan broadcaster Radio Mars that his point had been to highlight that sporting disagreement should not affect the “friendly relations” between Egypt and Morocco. “I obtained all the information from Tunisian media. I was talking to Fouzi Lekjaa, a brother dear to me because I don’t want to affect the Egyptian-Moroccan relations because of a match,” Mansour explained.

Rabat – The Emirati-sponsored annual Iftar campaign titled “His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Iftar Campaign 2019” officially started in Morocco on May 14. “Over 150 Moroccan charitable associations will take part in the campaign, to assist some 65,000 underprivileged families across the country,” said the Emirati Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on its website.  The UAE iftar campaign, which takes place every year during the entire month of Ramadan, will be implemented in three main stages.  The first step is expected to support approximately 30.000 Moroccan families in the eastern areas of the country. The second phase will focus on assisting underprivileged families in the region of Rabat, Salé, and Kenitra. The concluding stage of the campaign will focus on needy communities across the northern, southern, and central regions of Morocco. Acting Chargé D’Affaires at the Emirati Embassy in Morocco, Saeed Muhair Al Katbi, stated that “the launch of the humanitarian campaign in Morocco marks 13 years since it was first launched,” reported the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Al Katbi also added that the iftar campaign “coincides with the 2019 Year of Tolerance, as declared by President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.”

Rabat – Moroccan passport holders hoping to travel to Europe this summer might have to push back their plans, according to a recent Medias24 report. Appointments for Schengen visas from Italy, France, and Spain are booked through June, July, and August in Morocco. Visa appointments for Spain are booked for over six months, while Italy and France have slots open by the end of August. According to the report, these wait times have been increasing. In February, the wait time to apply to a French visit averaged 40-60 days. The report noted, however, that the wait times only affect applicants for a short-stay Schengen visa, not a student visa or long-term visa.  The delays in the visa process point to an insufficient response on the part of European consular services to growing demand. The Schengen area, which comprises 26 European nations with shared visa and travel policies, has increasingly been a favorite destination for Moroccan travelers.   The number of Schengen visa applications by Moroccan passport holders has increased steadily since 2010, reaching a high last year of 662,578 applications.  That made Morocco seventh out of 169 countries in the number of short-stay Schengen visa applications. About 80% of applicants received visas—a higher number than any other nation in the MENA region. Most Schengen states (including the Spanish, French, and Italian consulates) contract companies to hold and manage visa appointments. One of these subcontractors, like TLS Contact or BLS International, might receive 3,000 requests for a visa appointment per day. According to the report, subcontractors like TLS are large enough to accommodate this number of applicants. This means that the delay in appointments results from slowdowns at a higher level, where consulates are reluctant to adjust to and accommodate heightened demand. However, applications are unlikely to slow. For many Moroccans, a Schengen visa is still worth the wait.

Rabat – The Moroccan delegation at the Pan-African Parliament held in Johannesburg, South Africa, has called for a general census of refugees in the Tindouf camps, arguing that Algeria’s “political game” in Western Sahara is the primary culprit for the continued diplomatic stalemate in the decades-long dispute. Taking part in an ordinary session at the AU parliament on Monday, May 13, the Moroccan delegation drew attention to the dire humanitarian crisis in the Tindouf camps, pointing fingers to the Polisario Front and its “Algerian backers for mismanagement of funds and humanitarian aid given by the international community to assist the Tindouf refugees. According to Moroccan Arabic daily Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, the Moroccan MP’s strongly worded proposal for a census in the Tindouf camps came in response to accusations of “military occupation” and “colonization” from Algerian and Polisario representatives. In what the Moroccan outlet described as a “very heated confrontation” between Moroccan and Algerian Pan-African MPs, Rabat responded to Algiers’ traditional de-colonization and self-determination discourse by pointing to “Algeria’s political responsibility” in the creation and escalation of the “artificial conflict in Western Sahara.” In addition to reproaching Algerian representatives for their country’s involvement in complicating the Sahara question, Moroccan delegates pointed out Algiers’s implication in “serious human rights violations” in the camps, according to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia. “Forced disappearances, arrests and torture, the use of tanks to disperse protesters fighting for their rights to freedom of speech and movement—these have become the daily lot of Sahrawi populations,” the Moroccan delegation protested. Beyond its logistical support to the Polisario Front to “sequestrate and torture dissenters,” Moroccan MPs argued that the Algerian government is also complicit in the Polisario leadership’s massive embezzlement of international aid intended for refugees. The Moroccan MPs added that Algeria and Polisario use the Tindouf population as “commercial capital.” This point further drove home to fellow Pan-African MPs a central element of Rabat’s stance on Algeria’s support for the Polisario Front: that Tindouf refugees are exploited by Algiers and Polisario for their own political ends. Faced with such emphatic criticism, Algerian representatives were bound to respond in kind. Hamid Boucharef, a National Liberation Front (FLN) MP at the Algerian National Assembly, hit back at Moroccan representatives, saying that Rabat’s vitriolic comments on Algeria’s Western Sahara position are but a veiled attempt to “distract attention from much more serious concerns.” For the Algerian MP, the “more serious concern” in the Western Sahara dispute is Morocco’s lack of compliance with “total self-determination for the Sahrawis.” The self-determination-flavored rebuttal emboldened Moroccan representatives to call the pan-African parliament’s attention to Algiers’s “lies” and “face-saving game” when it comes to Western Sahara settlement debates. “Why has Algeria consistently refused demands for a general census in Western Sahara?” asked the Moroccan MPs. The point of that rhetorical question, according to Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, was to show that, contrary to widely circulated ideas in a number of Polisario-friendly circles in the international community, Morocco has never opposed proposals for a lasting solution to the conflict, including a referendum. Instead, the PMPs pointed out, Morocco’s stance has been that without a reliable political base—a general census of “true Sahrawis” in Tindouf— a referendum will be politicized and, as a result, doomed, and would fail to broker a mutually acceptable settlement. While the Moroccan delegation at the Johannesburg Pan-African parliament was adamant about carrying out a census in the Tindouf Camps to “confront Algeria with its own lies and political game” in Western Sahara, it is unlikely that Moroccan diplomats will push for such a move in the near future. The “heated debate” between Moroccan and Algerian pan-African MPs comes as recent developments on Western Sahara signal a gradual paradigm shift in how the international community plans to resolve the decades-long dispute. In the latest UN deliberations on the way forward for a settlement in Western Sahara, there is a consistently increasing consensus on a politically negotiated and compromise-based settlement, a notable move away from a referendum on self-determination. In its most recent resolution on Western Sahara, the Security Council emphasized notions of dialogue, compromise, realism, and political feasibility. The language of the resolution has been unanimously interpreted as favoring Morocco’s proposal of negotiated settlement over Polisario’s separatist claims. But most critical in Moroccan delegates’ perceived confidence at the Johannesburg parliamentary session is Morocco’s unmistakable rise in significance as a continental leader. Only three years ago, when Morocco was still de jure absent from African discussions, Algerian delegates would have easily convinced other African MPs of their stance on Western Sahara. But since its return to the African Union in January 2017, Rabat has taken bold steps to make the continental balance swing in its favor on numerous issues of critical importance for the North African Kingdom. Key among Morocco’s achievements in continental affairs have been the AU’s decision to refrain from pushing for an agenda other than the UN-led political process as well as the increasing perceptions in policy circles that Rabat is boldly establishing itself as an indispensable player in the ever-shifting African geopolitical chessboard. Commenting on Morocco’s consequential return to African affairs, Brahim Fassi Fihri, a recognizable name in Morocco’s Africa and South-South momentum, recently told Morocco World News that the “Africanness of Morocco” is no longer a debatable issue. Fassi’s suggestion is that Morocco’s genuine interest in African development and intra-African integration is gradually giving it the continental upper hand over some countries that have traditionally fought to delegitimize a number of Moroccan positions. “Africa has become the center of gravity of Moroccan diplomacy,” Fassi said, hastening to add that “since January 2017, when Morocco joined the AU, we’ve seen that many countries that used to berate Morocco on its Western Sahara position are now reassessing their own views and policies on the question.”

Rabat – King Mohammed VI, accompanied by Crown Prince Moulay Hassan and Prince Moulay Rachid, presided over the second religious lecture for the holy month Ramadan at the royal palace in Rabat on Tuesday, May 14. Dikr Arrahmane, a university professor and director of the India Islamic Cultural Center in New Delhi, delivered the lecture to the royal family. The theme of the lecture was “Education on Responsibility,” and it invoked the Qur’anic verse of the 31st chapter, Surah Luqman: “And We had certainly given Luqman wisdom [and said], “Be grateful to Allah .” And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever denies [His favor] – then indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy.” Arrahmane spoke about how the Islamic teachers address the virtue of education, drawing on how other philosophical doctrines linked education with spiritual tendencies, mentioning in particular the case of India. The lecturer also touched on the importance of the promotion of moral values and peace; virtues the world is in quest for, he said.  The lecturer stressed the correlation between freedom, education, and responsibility, highlighting the importance of teaching children the virtue of responsibility at an early age, especially at a time where vices of “social decay and rebellion” loom large within societies. Drawing on the moral of the story of Luqman and the divine wisdom he was ordained with, he recalled how Luqman never ceased to offer wise pieces of advice to his polytheistic son, who later embraced the Islamic doctrine.  The lecturer pointed out that education as dealt with in the Qur’an is quintessentially based on moderation between worldly pursuits and that of the afterlife. The religious evening was held in the presence of a number of religious leaders, including Cheikh Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Houssein, grand mufti of al Quds and Palestine, and Jordanian professor Mohamed Ali Ibrahim Zaghoul, as well as religious figures from the African continent including the Burkinabe Cheik Khaled Saif Al Islam, and the Gambian member of Mohammed VI foundation of African Scholars, Mohamed Lamine Touray.

Rabat – Morocco’s General Directorate of National Security (DGSN) will celebrate the 63rd anniversary since its creation on Thursday, May 16. The DGSN  is using the event to highlight its important role in ensuring security across Morocco. They will be showcasing their achievements through several initiatives including  “open days.”  The DGSN said that for the past two years it has been planning the event which is gaining considerable momentum. The first annual open day event, held under the theme of National Security, Commitment and Loyalty, was attended by 80,000 visitors in Casablanca who explored the DGSN’s national role, its strategies, and initiatives.  MAP reported that the number of people who attended DGSN’s second annual open day event reached as many as 260,000 visitors in Marrakech. The DGSN believe that the record of visitors reached is a testament to the success of the event in bringing citizens closer to DGSN to establishing trust and mutual respect between the public and the institution. The DGSN also emphasized the importance of its decision to expand its presence on social media, giving the Twitter account launched in January 2019 as an example. The move, according to MAP, aims to strengthen communication with citizens to meet their expectations. The Twitter account is followed by more than 14,000 internet users. The celebration of the anniversary will serve as an opportunity to honor DGSN’s servants, who ensure the stability and security of the country. On April 24,  King Mohammed VI launched the construction of the new DGSN headquarters. The project will cost MAD 2 billion and take five years to complete. The project is in line with the royal speech made on the 17th anniversary of the King’s Coronation in 2016, in which he acknowledged the importance of the national police.  During the speech, the King also acknowledged the difficulties faced by national police due to limited resources. The monarch also highlighted  that the police “work day and night and are subject to tremendous pressure, as they are exposed to danger when they are on duty.” He continued by uring the government to “provide the security authorities with the necessary human and material resources to enable them to carry out their duty properly.” The DGSN is responsible for providing security and for challenging all threats to the stability of the country, including terrorism, drug trafficking, and transnational organized crimes.

Rabat – Mawazine festival has announced that three more hip hop stars, Aya Nakamura, Travis Scott, and Migos, will perform at the OLM Souissi stage this year. French pop star of Malian origin Aya Nakamura be the first to perform on Wednesday, June 26. In less than a year, Nakamura’s fame has skyrocketed. Her debut album, Journal Intime, is already certified gold. Her music videos depicting the daily life of today’s French youth have amassed over 360 million views on YouTube. After Nakamura has warmed up the crowd, rap titan Travis Scott will take the stage. Scott had a meteoric rise to fame in 2013 after icon Kanye West took the young Houston born rapper under his wing.  Since then, Scott has appeared on tracks with some of the biggest names in rap, such as Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and J Cole. Many of Scott’s hit songs, such as “Goosebumps” and “Butterfly Effect,” are inspired by his relationship with beauty mogul Kylie Jenner, with whom he has a child. The following night, Thursday, June 27, the OLM Souissi stage will see hip hop powerhouse  Migos perform. The trio consists of three rappers who have all made a name for themselves in their own right: Takeoff, Offset, and Quavo.  The group, who are all related, popularized the dance move of “dabbing” with their 2016 single “Look at My Dab.” By 2017, Migos had solidified their place in the rap game with their hit “Bad and Boujee” which hit number 1 on the Billboard Charts. Mawazine, a festival in Rabat with six venues, will take place from June 21 to June 29, and is organized by Maroc Cultures under the patronage of King Mohammed VI. Having drawn over 2.5 million attendees in recent years, Mawazine is the second largest music festival in the world, after Donauinselfest in Vienna, and the largest festival in Africa. The festival attracts international artists as well as highlighting local Moroccan musicians. Last year, the festival saw major international acts, including Martin Garrix, Bruno Mars, Luis Fonsi, and The Weeknd, perform at the Souissi OLM stage. The festival lists the democratization of culture in Morocco as one of its initiatives and provides free access to 90 percent of its shows each year.

Rabat – Thursday, May 16th is the 10th day of Ramadan and marks the 60th anniversary of the death of the great Moroccan sultan, Sidi Mohammed V 1909-1961). In 1957, he became the first official king of an independent Morocco after he had strategically fought the French rule which had installed him as Sultan. The date of his anniversary is calculated according to the Islamic calendar. Born in Fes, Morocco, Sidi Mohammed V was the third son of Sultan Mulway Yusef. Upon his father’s death, it is said that “French authorities chose him to be successor, expecting him to be more compliant than his two older brothers.” Sidi Mohammed V eventually joined the Independence Party of 1944, also called “Istiqlal,” which was a group from the growing nationalist movement. He was obliged to support the nationalist movement in secret so that the French would not suspect a Moroccan rebellion. Sidi Mohamed V took the French by surprise in 1947, when giving a speech at Tangiers.  Rather than continuing with the text, the French authorities had approved, Mohammed Ben Youssef delivered his own speech showing his support for the nationalist cause. The choice to give a different speech is one of the many courageous acts as a patriot before the country was an independent nation for which Sidi Mohammed will be remembered. It is due to Sidi Mohammed V’s efforts that Morocco now has The Manifesto of Independence (1944). An advocate for Moroccan citizens of all faiths Another accomplishment during his lifetime is his refusal to allow Moroccan Jews to be sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust. Sidi Mohammed V performed his duty as Commander of the Faithful by protecting the Abrahamic faiths of Morocco. At a meeting with Nazis and Vichy France, he famously said, “There are no Jews in Morocco. There are only Moroccan subjects.” “I absolutely do not approve of the new antisemitic laws and I refuse to associate myself with a measure I disagree with,” he said. “I reiterate as I did in the past that the Jews are under my protection and I reject any distinction that should be made amongst my people.” His vision of equality touched many hearts as was evident when he died due to complications from surgery and 75,000 Jews “publicly mourned” Morocco’s loss. The country had only been independent for four years at the time of his death. Among the many memorable things about him, “his gaze was attentive, and he possessed an ironic sense of humor that he revealed to friends and relatives.”

Rabat – Morocco’s Administration of Customs and Indirect Taxes (ADII) shared its annual data on the amount of drugs seized across Morocco. The administration reported that Moroccan customs seized 19.2 tons of cannabis resin in 2018, 14.7 tons less than the number of cannabis resins seized in 2017 ( 33.7 tons). The administration added that its agents carried several crackdowns in 2018, including one operation where 240 kilograms of cannabis resin had been concealed inside orange juice cartons. Customs officials also said that they seized 541.3 kilograms of pure cocaine packed in travel bags and 3.9 million smuggled cigarettes An increase in psychotropic drugs The report also showed an increase in psychotropic substances seized in 2018.  Customs seized 836,808 units of psychotropic drugs, including dangerous varieties, such as ecstasy, and rivotril. The number of psychotropic drugs seized increased from 140,000 seized in 2017 to 836,808 in 2018. The report shows that customs seized 132,4 kilogram of hard drugs compared to 476, 7 kilograms seized in 2017. ADII also unveiled the number of confiscated cigarettes, saying that authorities seized 36 million smuggled units, compared to  22.9 million units in 2017. In addition to the operations carried out by Moroccan customs, Moroccan police also announced the seizure of significant quantities of cannabis, cocaine and psychotropic pills in its 2018 annual report. More prosecutions for drug charges In 2018, Moroccan security services seized 1.65 tons of cocaine, over 1.3 million psychotropic and ecstasy pills, 52 tons of cannabis resin, and 693 kilograms of cannabis. Moroccan Government Spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, announced that Morocco had prosecuted 107,000 people in 2017 in drug cases; an increase from 36,000 people per year during the previous decade. In March, a report from the International Narcotics Board (INCB) finds that, in 2017, the largest amount of cannabis was in Morocco. The report shows that authorities seized 117 tons of cannabis resin and 283 tons of cannabis in 2017. “Cannabis resin is mainly trafficked from Morocco, but it is increasingly produced in Europe it self,” the report found.

The Moroccan National Association of Private Clinics (ANCP) has sent a letter to private clinics in Casablanca, asking them to stop bribing ambulance drivers. “It appears some clinics have been bribing ambulance drivers, asking them to bring patients to the clinics,” Doctor Hachem Tyal, the deputy director of the ANCP told Morocco World News. “The issue is not widespread,” he added. “It is not common practice but any occurrence must be stopped.” “It’s a matter of principal,” Tyal stressed. When these bribes occur, the patient’s best interests are no longer the only thing at play, he explained. Bribed ambulance drivers can pressure patients into choosing a particular clinic. “Patients should be completely free to choose where they would like to be treated. It’s not a matter for the ambulance drivers to decide,” Tyal said. The ANCP heard about the bribes through patients and through ambulance drivers and responded quickly. The ANCP has asked clinics, without specifically naming them, to immediately stop the bribes, noting they will use any methods needed to “clean up the profession.” This situation has prompted a review of professional ethics, and the ANCP is currently developing a new ethical framework which will be revealed shortly, Tyal added. The integrity of private clinics came under fire last week when Zouhair Chorfi, the secretary general of Morocco’s Ministry of Finance and Economy, accused Morocco’s private health sector of a “major under reporting” of their taxable income.  “When I go to a clinic and I’m told I can’t pay by cheque, what does this mean? It has to stop! Corruption has to stop,” Chorfi said in the last parliamentary sitting on taxation. ANCP responded promptly, denying allegations and filing a formal complaint against against Chorfi for his “sensational and irresponsible” statement.

Rabat – The European Council of Moroccan Oulemas (CEOM)  an Iftar (fast-breaking) banquet in Brussels on May 14. The council hold this event annually for the Belgian Muslim community. The gathering took place at the Marriott Hotel in Brussels and  attracted a range of high-profile figures, including diplomats, politicians, religious figures, and a host of Moroccan religious leaders. As the council’s secretary, general Khalid Hajji highlighted that the gathering aims at strengthening the principle of coexistence, peace, and prosperity among all members of society. The gathering started off with recitals from the holy Qur’an before Moroccan officials took to the stage to address their thoughts to the assembly. Salah Echallaoui, president of the Muslim Executive of Belgium (EMB), said that the role EMB has always been to champion  “social openness” for Belgian Muslims and to promote the principles of tolerance and togetherness.  In turn, Samir Eddahr, Moroccan ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg, took the floor to highlight King Mohammed VI’s commitment to promoting the principles of fraternization and tolerance among all nations.  He added that, through the Maliki school of thought, Morocco spreads the universal values by which Moroccans have lived for centuries.

IT giant Everis has set up a flexible work program for its Moroccan employees in hopes of retaining to its best staff and stopping the brain drain to Europe. Moroccan IT professionals are flocking to Europe in search of opportunities. Foreign companies come to Morocco to recruit talent, and up to 600 Moroccan engineers leave the country every year to pursue career opportunities. Everis is an multinational IT company, with offices in Casablanca and Tetouan. It employs over 230 people, and wants to hold on to them. To do this, Everis has set up a program which promotes a better work-life balance for Moroccan employees, through flexible work hours and remote working. Quality of work life is a key concern for Moroccan employees, even more so than money. A 2018 study by Boston Consulting Group, the Network and Rekrute interviewed 6 721 Moroccan employees and found that they valued work-life balance and a positive working environment more than they valued salary. Money wasn’t even in the top ten concerns of employees. It is difficult for Moroccan companies to compete with foreign companies when it comes to employing staff. Foreign companies offer better salaries, but perhaps most importantly, they provide an opportunity for Moroccans to live overseas, a goal for many young people. The challenge is therefore to make local companies more attractive to Moroccans. The new program at Everis provides its staff with a number of benefits including the option to work remotely one day a week, Friday afternoons off for an extended weekend, and the option to work “summer hours” from 8am to 3pm during either July or August.

Rabat – Morocco has a large expat population. Many foreigners call it a “transit country” or, in traveler lingo, an ideal place to visit en route to another destination. That is not to say that Morocco doesn’t have its expat nesters who leave behind their old country to build a life in Morocco. For those who choose to call Morocco their home, Moroccan practices steadily bleed into their own lifestyle ‒ seeing time as an endless resource is just one example. However, some traditions are not easy for an expat to adopt. For example, to fully experience customs revolving around food, such as couscous every Friday, depend on having a family there to share it with, when many expats in Morocco are without family ‒ myself included. Perhaps the most important tradition is fasting during Ramadan. This practice is first a religious requirement and is one of the five pillars of Islam. As a result, it has become part of the culture in places where the Muslim population is the majority, including Morocco. Fasting is also a tradition many Moroccans invite foreigners to participate in. Moroccans, who are known to be tremendously hospitable, invite foreigners to “iftar,” or the meal at the end of the day which breaks the fast. Receiving iftar invitations is heartwarming. However, along with these invitations, there may also be a question: “Are you fasting for Ramadan?” Coworkers, neighbors, students, really any friendly face is likely to ask a foreigner if they are fasting. The question is posed so casually. If the answer is yes, the conversation remains light and happy. But answering no could be the quickest way to disappoint a fasting Moroccan. Disappointing an acquaintance with good intentions is uncomfortable, but with the virtue of honesty comes its price. Responses to the negative answer range from the furrowed brow, to the wrinkled nose, to the lips, where recently my neighbor uttered: “Hshouma.” “Hshouma” expresses something heavier and more nuanced than its English translation: “you should feel ashamed of yourself.” Instances like this show that fasting for Ramadan is more than religion and more than a tradition. It seems to be an expectation. Even so, an expectation that remains immune to nationality, faith, or awareness of it. The charming response I have developed to curtail this conversation is a simple shrug and smile. As someone from a culture that encourages individualism, the societal pressure to fast intrigues me. I asked Moroccans about the reasons why they encourage foreigners to fast. As it turns out, it’s not that there is some prize to gain in telling someone outside of this tradition to follow it. Many Moroccans believe that fasting is a good practice and by telling someone they should do it, they believe that they are being helpful. “We do it just to be nice,” Mehdi, a coworker who had just asked me if I was fasting, said. When I told him no, he almost automatically responded, “you should.” Mehdi explained, “It’s just a way to show you care about someone’s health.” Others I asked gave me answers similar to this. Loubna, a Moroccan Muslim who said she had never told a foreigner to fast, offered the idea that from a Moroccan perspective, advising someone to fast is a way of sharing the joys of Ramadan: “It’s just to invite people to enjoy the month.” These responses showed caring and kindness from Moroccan people but didn’t explain the disappointment when I reveal that I do not fast. I still questioned why“hshouma” is an acceptable response to those who aren’t fasting. Or why, in the place of “hshouma,” fellow expats have stories of people openly disapproving of foreigners who don’t fast. “Because [many] Moroccans believe fasting is a good thing, some of them, especially older ones, see people who fast as also good. [Many of them] tend to see people who don’t fast as not so good or beneath them,” Omar, another fasting Moroccan, said. In this way, it appears that fasting is also a way to measure a person, which makes some sense ‒ if you are to judge someone, and we all do, it is better to judge them by their actions than the factors they can’t control. Omar added, “Sometimes people don’t really know why they tell others to fast, just that it can be a habit. It can also be a habit to judge, especially for those who are so traditional they may not have the concept that there are other religions.” This was the first time I’d heard of that there isn’t always a motive behind telling someone to fast. It could be as compulsive as saying “bless you” after a sneeze. It is undeniable that Moroccan culture is group-oriented, in that people who stand out are more likely to get noticed. In the context of Ramadan, this may mean that for foreigners, who already stand out, those who choose not to fast are more likely to attract unsolicited guidance. “It sounds like a sales pitch,” Kristen, an ESL teacher from Canada said. She was right; hearing over and over, from the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker, all the reasons it’s good for you feels like living in a brochure. Not to mention that Ramadan for an expat in Morocco is different, as there is an absence of sentimental memories to give significance to a bowl of harira at the end of a hungry day. To someone traveling alone, and according to Kristen, it might even feel “unnatural.” It is, after all, another society’s tradition. So, you have foreigners who see fasting as foreign. Moving abroad is so immersive that if a traveler doesn’t draw the line between their host country’s practices and their home country’s practices somewhere, they might as well be trading cultural identities. For the foreigners who choose not to fast, there is still an abundance of Moroccan customs that end up seeping into an expat’s own lifestyle, over time.

By Taib Biygautane Rabat – In response to the Christchurch terrorist attacks in March which used Facebook Live to broadcast the incident, Facebook has put into effect new preventive measures. “Following the horrific terrorist attacks in New Zealand, we’ve been reviewing what more we can do to limit our services from being used to cause harm or spread hate,” said Facebook’s Vice President of Integrity, Guy Rosen. “As a direct result, starting today, people who have broken certain rules on Facebook — including our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy — will be restricted from using Facebook Live,” added Rosen. One Strike Policy According to the announcement, Facebook will implement what it describes as the ‘one strike’ policy to live-streaming violations. Users will be subject to restrictions following just one violation of the new policy. The one strike policy will prevent individuals who violate Facebook Live rules from using the service for an unspecified period of time – potentially 30 days. Facebook also plans to extend these measures to other areas of the social network in the near future. “Our goal is to minimize risk of abuse on Live while enabling people to use Live in a positive way every day,” said Rosen. The announcement also revealed a research partnership with the University of Maryland, Cornell University, and the University of California in an effort to develop new technologies that would “detect manipulated media across images, video and audio, and distinguish between unwitting posters and adversaries who intentionally manipulate videos and photographs.” This partnership is an attempt to put an end to the proliferation of edited videos similar to those of the Christchurch attacks on its platform.
The terrorist attacks in New Zealand last Marchclaimed the lives of 51 Muslims while at prayer. The perpetrator used Facebook’s live-streaming service to broadcast the entire incident without being reported or blocked.

Rabat – A child as young as 4 has been accused of harassment after kissing a girl of the same age at an Egyptian school in Bahira, in the region of Gizeh, northern Egypt. The lawyer representing the accused said that the girl’s father filed a complaint against the 4-year-boy, accusing him of kissing his daughter. The court has acquitted the boy of all charges, considering the complaint unreasonable. The case goes back to December 2017 when the father accused the 4-year old of harassing his daughter. Egyptian media sources quoted the boy’s father who claimed that the complaint had been filed due to a disagreement between the girl’s father and the 4-year-old defendant’s grandmother who works at the school where the incident took place.  Egyptian Internet users reacted to the case with sarcasm and levity. One commentator declared that after acquitting the boy, the court ought tot have detained the accuser to carry out a psychiatric examination.  While another internet user has written that the case has been reported on solely to distract the public from important national issues. | براءة طفل من تهمة التحرش بطفلة بالحضانة

Rabat – The Minister of Family, Solidarity, Equality, and Social Development Bassima Hakkaoui shared alarming data on Tuesday, showing that violence against women is still prevalent.  The data is collected from preliminary results of the second National Survey on the prevalence of violence against women in Morocco. The findings of the survey show that the rates of violence against women stand at 54.4% nationwide. Hakkaoui said that the rate of violence against women in urban areas is 55.8 % in rural areas, while the rate of domestic violence in rural areas was slightly lower at 51.6 %. The ministry conducted its nationwide survey between January 2 and March 10. The Minister explained that the most vulnerable women are aged 25 to 29, adding that marital violence against women has the highest prevalence rate. The study revealed that 54.4 % of fiancees and 52.5 % of married women have been victims of violence in Morocco. Violence against women in public places is also common in Morocco with 12.4 % of Moroccan women aged 18 to 64 having suffered at least one case of violence. The study showed that the number of women victims differ between urban and rural areas. Hakkaoui said that women in rural areas are more vulnerable to violence outside the home, with 19.6 % of women having suffered incidents of violence compared to 16 % in urban areas.  E-violence is also increasing in Morocco.  13.4 % of women said they were subject to abuse online and are more vulnerable to this type of abuse. Harassment accounts for 7.2 % of cyber-violence incidents. The data, quoted by Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), shows that a total of 54.4% of women experienced at least one form of violence. One-third of those surveyed had experienced abuse in more than one category.  Silence increases violence During her presentation, Hakkaoui advised Moroccan women to break their silence and to file complaints against perpetrators. “Silence is one of the factors that aggravate the tragedy of abused women, noting that the proportion of women who have spoken to a person or at an institution is 28.2%.” The official said that the percentage of victims of abuse or violence who filed a complaint against abusers is only 6.6 %. Hakkaoui explained that the statistics from this new survey will help to categorize types of violence against women which will help implementation of the newly adopted law 103.13.   The new law on gender-based discrimination was instituted on September 12 and comes after female activists pressure the government to combat violence and public harassments against women. The law provides women with the right to file complaints of sexual harassment and ensure severe punishments for instigators of harassment and abuse.  The law also provides support for female victims of cyber crimes. However, Moroccan activists have found several worrying loopholes in the legislation.  In a previous interview with Morocco World News,  Stephanie Willman Bordat, an international human rights lawyer, explained that the struggle to stop the abuse of women must continue despite the institution of law 103.13. Asked if she is positive about the law, the human rights activist said that “the law is not made to be implemented,” but to amend the current law. Bordat told Morocco World News today that the new law will now criminalize public harassment. “What the law basically did is create a couple of new crimes or it increased the prison time for the crimes that already existed,” said Bordat. However, she went  to decry the lack of systems put in place to implement the changes.  “The problem is that for those to be implemented, the law has to include items related to the reporting and investigation and prosecution. In other words, to be implemented, the law has to put into place the implementing mechanisms. It remains to be seen whether the necessary mechanisms will be implemented to finally protect victims of abuse.

Rabat – On April 11, Abdellah Ghazi, president of the Tiznit provincial council, launched a new bonus program to bring private and public sector health professionals to remote parts of the Tiznit province in Southern Morocco.  Funded by the Tiznit provincial council and the Joud Foundation, a charity set up by the Moroccan political party National Independent Group (RNI), the new program will provide MAD 8 million in bonuses to more than 160 medical staff in the Tiznit province, over a period of four years.  The goal is to bring health professionals to the Tiznit province, to facilitate access to health services for all Moroccans living in the region. The bonuses range between MAD 1200 ($125) and MAD 2500 ($259) for doctors, and MAD 500 ($52) and MAD 1000 ($104) for nurses. Payments also increase depending on the distance of the role from Tiznit, and whether the work is located within 30 km of town, between 30 km and 70 km from town and over 70 km from town. The program also sets up monthly medical visits to the remote mountain towns of Anzi and Tafraout, bringing specialist doctors to these areas where healthcare is currently limited.  The doctors will be paid a MAD 600 ($62) bonus per medical visit, provided they carry out at least 30 consultations. Drivers bringing the doctors to the towns will also receive 300 ($31) MAD.  Part of the planned total budget will also be allocated to improve existing clinics, as well as to provide housing for the health professionals. An unmet demand for healthcare The Moroccan Constitution explicitly recognizes that the people of Morocco have “a right to healthcare.” However, many Moroccans today do not have access to this right. Healthcare in Morocco is characterized by glaring disparities between rural and urban areas, notes the World Bank in a 2018 report “Morocco: Emerging by Investing in Intangible Capital.” Access to essential health services across the country is limited, especially in rural areas. Almost a quarter of rural households live at least 10 km away from basic health services. Adding to this, the number of health professionals across the country is unevenly distributed.  The average number of people to one doctor is 2,107. However, in the rural Taza region in the northern part of the country, the ratio doubles to one doctor per 4,201 people. In 2017, the World Bank found that that 8.5 million Moroccans (so approximately 25%) do not have access to health services. One of the solutions it suggests is the development of mobile health services for isolated populations. The Tiznit initiative does just this. By arranging monthly medical visits to the mountain towns of Anzi and Tafraout, and setting up incentives for rural medical work, the Tiznit initiative is an active step towards ensuring that all Moroccans, one day, are able to enjoy their “right to healthcare.”

Rabat – Another rape case of a minor in the Moroccan city of Tangier is causing an uproar in Morocco.  The sexual scandal involves a 53-year-old French man who sexually assaulted an under-aged boy of  13. Tangier judicial authorities apprehended the culprit, while he was in the middle of the crime in an apartment he rented in the Ibn El Banna’e residence area. His arrest came after one of the victim’s cousins disclosed the crime to the police. Police placed the convict under police custody, while they entrusted the rape victim to his parents on orders of the examining magistrate. Rape is punishable by five to ten years imprisonment under Article 486 of the Moroccan Penal Code. However, another law of the Moroccan Penal Code, Article 475, allows rapists to dodge prison sentences by marrying their victims. Despite reforms, Morocco has made concerning article 475, a move that was warmly welcomed by human rights organizations, many still believe that the reforms need to go further. Concerning the current law on rape, human rights organizations point to a pronounced shortcoming in the penal code where rape, as defined in Article 468, is gender-biased, stating that rape occurs when “a man has sexual relations with a woman against her will.” In the wording, it does not take into account that males can be victims.

Rabat – The Coordination of Teachers Forced into Contract (CNPCC) released a statement on Monday, May 12, declaring a two-day strike from May 13-14.  The statement came after the latest round of talk it held with the Ministry of Education, suggesting negotiations with authorities have so far failed to meet the teachers’ expectations.  According to the statement, the call for strike is fueled by the government’s “indifference, disregard, and procrastination.” The coordination explained that authorities have been deaf to some of teachers’ key demands, among which is the abolition of fixed-term contract. The coordination also called on contractual teachers to boycott professional qualifying examinations, pinning hopes on the next round of talks with the Ministry of Education expected on May 23.  However, contractual teachers expressed reluctance over the coordination’s call, dismissing the move as counterproductive.  A contractual teacher who spoke to Morocco World News noted that the reason behind their reluctance is that teachers have grown distrustful of syndicates.  He said, “syndicates are sell-outs because they betrayed contractual teachers legitimate demands.”  Other teachers mocked the coordination’s statement. They especially dismissed the coordination’s call on teachers to make their best “to make up for student’s lost time,” describing it as contradictory, “of no use,” and a “waste of students’ time.” Previous negotiations Both the ministry and contractual teachers’ representatives seem to be at cross purposes despite holding a series of meetings in the past weeks. There have been no satisfactory outcomes from the latest rounds of negotiations as both parties remain inflexible on their positions. Teachers’ representatives have stressed the importance of sticking to the agreements made in the April 13 and May 11 meetings. They say the government has failed to commit to the conclusions of the two meetings and has continued its punitive administrative measures against some teachers. The government has denied the accusations, however. Meanwhile, the situation gets more confusing with no results achieved so far since the protests broke out on February 20. The current atmosphere suggests there is more escalation looming in the near future. Cell 9 teachers, a group of teachers who are working under scale 9 of Morocco’s salary structure, which Morocco abandoned years ago, are also staging a week-long strike for the third week running. The group is demanding promotion to scale 10 of Morocco’s salary structure to be on a par with all other teachers. Teachers resumed classes on April 15 in response to urgent demands from students’ parents associations. But whether that signaled a drift towards more positive changes in the teachers-government deadlock depends on the next round of talks scheduled for May 23.

Rabat – US President Donald Trump hosted his second iftar dinner at the White House last night, Monday, May 14.  Trump invited various Muslim diplomats and used the event to speak of the “very rough time” Muslims are facing “around the world, citing the recent terrorist attacks on Muslims in New Zealand, Sri Lanka, California, and Pittsburgh. “In their blessed memory, we resolve to defeat the evils of terrorism,” Trump told attendees. “We thank God that that America is a place founded on beliefs that citizens of all faiths can live together in safety and live together in freedom,” he added. He finished off his speech by wishing “all the people around the world Ramadan Kareem.” Trump’s speech is a notable shift from the previous unfriendly remarks he addressed to the Muslim community. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the United States. Trump has also signed multiple executive orders restricting immigration from Muslim countries. Trump did not host an iftar during his first year of presidency in 2017, breaking a twenty-year tradition started by the Clinton administration and continued by George Bush and Barack Obama.  Trump did host an iftar in 2018, but many members of the Muslim community in the US were left off the guest list. “We are no longer invited. We are being snubbed,” said Imam Yahya Hendi, chaplain at Georgetown University who had previously been invited by Obama.  The second iftar dinner comes just a few hours after a Twitter spat with Rashida Tlaib, one of the first two Muslim women in Congress, whom President Trump berated for controversial comments on Israel and the Holocaust during a podcast.
 Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust. She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people. Can you imagine what would happen if I ever said what she said, and says? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2019 
Tlaib fought back in a statement saying her “words have been blatantly misconstrued.” Trump, the Congresswoman went on to argue, “ has once again used his platform to incite hate and violence based on lies.”

Rabat – It prescribes good relations between members of society because if society is strong and healthy, the Ummah, or community, will undoubtedly fare well. It also prescribes respect for other religions and cultures and the search for peace and brotherhood between humanity worldwide. Love thy neighbor: collective solidarity One of the important values of the religion of Islam is beneficial cooperation and mutual understanding according to the following Surah: “Help one another in righteousness and in warding off evil, but do not help one another to commit sin and transgression.”  Thus, Allah instructs all Muslims to help each other form a strong social structure in a community based on the values of solidarity, mutual support, and caring about the welfare of the other. This is further emphasized in a Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad, PBUH: Helping each other is undoubtedly an action that is double-edged: The caring and sharing values have been sanctified by the Prophet in his various Hadiths, he spoke so kindly of the neighbor that the faithful believed they would inherit from those around them. If the Prophet makes the jar “neighbor” a very important member of society, it means that collective solidarity is the most important aspect of social Islam. Furthermore, the Prophet did not specify that the jar “neighbor” must be a Muslim, so this means that good treatment of people in your environment applies to all people irrespective of their religion, color or social status. Besides sharing and caring, Allah instructed the Muslims, to read the Qur’an during this holy month of Ramadan, not mechanically, but rather thoughtfully and reflectively to make its salient contours ring in the Faithfull’s ear and to highlight in his soul and spirit such values such as: Islam is not only about prayer it is about good relationships and good treatment of others:  “Religion is good treatment of others” The Qur’an states quite clearly that Ramadan is preferred to 1000 months because it is meant to be the epitome of Islamic thought and philosophy hinging on such lofty values as: Momentum of tolerance, peace, and benevolence  The month of Ramadan is definitely a month of sharing and solidarity. One of the five pillars of Islam, this month represents four weeks of charity, frugality, and piety during which Muslims must show selflessness and support to the poor. This momentum of solidarity is shared by both Muslims and non-Muslims, reflecting the values ​​of tolerance, benevolence, and peace that bring them together. During this holy month many individuals and associations share and give to families in need so, at the time of the break of the fast, all families can gather to share this festive meal.  This message of humanity is further proof that the values ​​of respect prevail between different religions. Whether in the form of financial aid or basket distribution, benefactors who can afford to help those in need or who are far from their families give generously. In this approach, no part of the population is sidelined, especially the elderly who also take part in the activities organized for them by associations. The purpose of fasting during Ramadan is to welcome religious fervor of great intensity, to seek repentance and forgiveness, but also to prepare the faithful for what might be called social altruism.  The true meaning of Ramadan The month of Ramadan is the 9th month of the Muslim calendar. This month marks the beginning of the revelation of the Qur’an made to the Prophet Muhammad. Ramadan is also the month of fasting par excellence. The fast of the month of Ramadan is one of the ritual obligations of Islam and also one of the five pillars of the Muslim religion. A month of spirituality and solidarity, each year more than a billion and a half Muslims celebrate this event in joy and sharing. Voluntary deprivation of food is a reminder of hunger, suffering, and poverty in the world. From Tangier to Jakarta and from Nouakchott to Kabul, Muslims find on a daily basis the true meaning of the universal of humanity, respect, and mutual help in order to strengthen social bonds.  By fasting, the rich understand what the underprivileged live on a daily basis. While, in turn, the poor can benefit from the generosity of the neighbor to eat well during this month. Popular social activities include food aid operations to help the needy break their fast by distributing food parcels or offering hot meals. These operations are often organized by associations, societies or simply families. It has been reported that the Prophet Muhammad said, “The best alms is the one bestowed during the month of Ramadan”. Ramadan is not about boulimia Very much like Christmas in the Western world, Ramadan has become, alas, a month-long festival of compulsive eating, whereas, in reality, Islam deprives people of food, water, and other carnal pleasures during daylight to awaken in the individual the values of solidarity and empathy. The poor suffer from lack of food all day, every day, and a good Muslim by experiencing this suffering during a whole month. The pain of hunger is meant to be a pedagogical approach to make us aware of the predicament of the other in order to care about him all year long and not only a few days or a few weeks. Ramadan is also about abstaining from eating too much food and stuffing oneself on end at night. Ramadan is supposed to activate in the good Muslim the values of empathy and generosity: sharing food, time, love, and respect with the needy on a daily basis, yearlong. Fasting is also a healthy personal enterprise; it helps the body eliminate the toxins that come in different foods and beverages all the year around. The Alms Almsgiving, whether obligatory or optional, is a fundamental institution of solidarity. It is important to note that the Quranic and prophetic texts do not exclude non-Muslims from humanitarian aid. If a Muslim (sick, pregnant, traveler, etc.) is unable to fast during the month of Ramadan, he is asked to feed a poor man every day. Thus the rite of fasting can be replaced by the rite of almsgiving. In other words, the social act (almsgiving) equates and replaces at the same time the spiritual act (the fast of Ramadan). Why Ramadan? Its purpose is to free the human being from the shackles of material dependence, negative habits, blind consumption, routine, and performance. By this, he reinforces his spirituality and his submission to God (Muslim means the one who is submissive to God -). It is in fact to revitalize his spirituality. Ramadan is the initiation to a true liberation by the fasting of the soul, the invitation to apprehend the divine presence by the fasting of the heart. The solidarity shown on this occasion is also a way for the community of Muslims to bond and to give alms to the poor. Amen.

By Taib Biygautane Rabat – On Monday, May 13, the popular messaging application, WhatsApp, confirmed a grave security breach that “enabled targeted spyware to be installed on phones through voice calls,” reported Forbes. The security breach concerns Android and iPhone electronic devices. In a statement, published by The Financial Times, WhatsApp said that it “encourages people to upgrade to the latest version of our app, as well as keep their mobile operating system up to date, to protect against potential targeted exploits designed to compromise information stored on mobile devices.” “This attack has all the hallmarks of a private company known to work with governments to deliver spyware that reportedly takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,” added WhatsApp. Although WhatsApp did not explicitly refer to a specific company, The Financial Times report identifies NSO Group, an Israeli software firm, as the spyware developer. The spyware exploits security vulnerabilities in WhatsApp applications via audio phone calls to iOS and Android devices. The spyware “can be installed without a trace and without the target answering the call,” reported the Verge. Facebook had also issued a Security Advisory, yesterday, listing WhatsApp versions with security vulnerability issues, namely “WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.19.134, WhatsApp Business for Android prior to v2.19.44, WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.19.51, WhatsApp Business for iOS prior to v2.19.51, WhatsApp for Windows Phone prior to v2.18.348, and WhatsApp for Tizen prior to v2.18.15.” NSO Group describes itself as a developer of “technology that helps government agencies prevent and investigate terrorism and crime to save thousands of lives around the globe.” However, NSO’s Pegasus spyware was used to spy on several prominent dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists. In 2016, Emirati human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, reported being targeted with Pegasus spyware. In 2018, The New York Times published a report on NSO spyware allegedly being used by the Saudi government to spy on journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Facebook-owned application, WhatsApp, distinguishes itself for being a highly secure provider of end-to-end encrypted messages. Whether this security breach is going to affect over 1.5 billion users’ trust in the application remains unknown.

Rabat – 60-year-old pop culture icon, Madonna, is making headlines after wearing a niqab through JFK airport in New York, with speculation flying on social media as to why. The singer paired the niqab with a lace-trimmed New York Yankees jacket, black tracksuit bottoms, and designer sandals. She finished the outfit off with dark sunglasses to completely hide her face.   FFS. Madonna’s gone nuts.
I’ll have to do a column on this. pic.twitter.com/tCDyD1SfpF — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) May 9, 2019  As she reached a security checkpoint in the New York airport, Madonna removed the niqab to pass through, revealing her face and a grey T-shirt underneath. Some called speculated whether Madonna choosing to wear the burqa was simply a publicity stunt, with English journalist and television personality Piers Morgan, known for his controversial views, publishing a particularly scathing criticism in the Daily Mail.  Morgan claimed that the outfit choice did not spur “from any desire for anonymity but from a craven desire to be spotted.”  “It’s the same thing she’s been doing for 40 years: shameless attention-seeking,” the British critic added. Piers Morgan also called the act “grossly offensive,” asking why the artist was “mocking Muslims in this manner?” Some Twitter users speculated that Madonna used the outfit to cover up plastic surgery, due to “one botox too many” and was just “using other cultures for her convenience.” One botox too far — Craig Hutton (@Hutton34) May 9, 2019  Obviously had surgery and using other cultures for her convenience. — Andy P (@Lindsayboyce3) May 9, 2019  Madonna made headlines in Morocco in August 2018 when she decided to spend her 60th birthday in Marrakech.

Rabat – At the recent ordinary session of the City Council in Fez, a petition was submitted by the Association of Earth, Life, and Sciences Teachers (AELST) on the sorting of household waste at the source. In the petition, the AELST argue for a more modern approach to the sorting of waste at the dump in Fez.  The association executives have called for a revision to law number 28-00 on waste management and the legal redefinition of waste as a valuable commodity. The AELST pointed out that several consultation meetings and round tables have been organized to strengthen the arguments on improving waste management, with the participation of 20 schools in Fez and Tangier.  “Our objective is to create a force of proposal and to plead in favor of a change of conception and representation of the Moroccan citizens vis-à-vis the waste, which must be regarded as resources and not as garbage,” said AELST officials. Officials explained that this could be achieved by “strengthening work among associations and school environment clubs, and an analysis of the legal arsenal that governs waste management in Morocco.” The association’s project, “effective and efficient waste management in Morocco,” aims to ensure the awareness and training of associations involved in the field of waste management and propose several delegated management companies in each major city to encourage competitiveness in the field.  The association also suggested putting in place sanctions against citizens who do not respect collection schedules and creating applications to monitor delegated waste management. Created in 1994, AELST Morocco is a national non-profit association, made up of a network of 35 sections with more than 2,000 active members and 10,000 volunteers. It runs a network of 18 Environmental Education Centers (ECE).  AELST Morocco aims through its various programs and local and national projects to promote scientific culture in environmental education, health, and sustainable development.

Rabat – Representatives of medical, pharmacy and dentistry students, who have been staging protests over conditions in several Moroccan cities for the eighth consecutive week since March 25, will meet with deans, and the Ministries of Health and Higher Education.  In response to students’ calls for a meeting, the Ministry of Education along with a number of deans held a meeting in Rabat last week, May 11, with medical students’ representatives. Both parties agreed to convene another meeting on Tuesday, May 14. During the last meeting, the parties discussed the urgency of taking steps to ensure the smooth progress of studies, to make up for the  time lost by strikes, to make sure exams are taken in the most appropriate conditions, and most importantly to stave off a “blank” year which would have dire consequences for these students. The  medical students have been protesting a range of important issues including the privatization of medical education and services, the need for enhancing the training conditions for medical students to “live up to the expectations of Moroccan citizens,” and the need for necessary medical equipment in training spaces. The coordinator of medical and pharmacy students, Ayoub Aboubaigi, said in a joint statement made by the ministries of education and health issues on April 17, that despite the opening of this round of talks, medical students are still adamant that they will not return to their studies.  The government is still firmly maintaining its position, reiterating that what it laid down in the April 17 joint statement is “clear” and “responds” to medical students’ demands. Today’s meeting will decide whether the medical students’ file will be resolved and closed or may trigger further waves of protests that would disrupt not only medical education, but the health sector in general, considering the scores of public sector doctors, amounting to over 1,000, who have already resigned en masse.

Rabat – The two oil pumping stations at Yambu, on the west coast of Saudi Arabia were hit by explosive-laden drones this morning. The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) described the incident as a “terrorist attack.” It appears the attack was carried out by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi group. Earlier today, Masirah TV, a Houthi Yemeni television station, cited a military official saying that “seven drones carried out attacks on vital Saudi installations.” The targets and time of the attacks were not specified. The state oil giant Saudi Aramco has stopped pumping oil via the pipeline, while the site is being repaired, but has assured that oil and gas supplies to its clients had not been affected by terrorist attacks. Saudi Arabia condemned the drone attacks as “cowardly.” It also condemned the sabotage of four Saudi oil tankers two days ago near UAE territorial waters, and emphasized  “the importance of confronting the terrorists who are carrying out these subversive activities, including the Houthi militia backed by Iran in Yemen.” Tension in the Gulf Tensions are running high in the Gulf region. The pipeline drone attacks come just two days after four Saudi oil tankers were attacked near UAE territorial waters. On 12 May, the four Saudi oil tankers were attacked at Fujairah port near UAE territorial waters as part of a “sabotage operations,” suffering “significant damage,” reported Gulf News.  No state has claimed responsibility for the attack. Analysts told Gulf News that they suspected Iran of being behind the operation. “…[L]ooking closer at the timing and location of the incident shows that Iran is likely behind it,” said Mohammad Abbas Naji, an expert in Iranian affairs at the Cairo-based Al Ahram Strategic Studies Centre. “These sabotage incidents follow continuous Iranian threats to interrupt oil shipments from the region to the international markets.” The US responded promptly to the incident. It accused Iran of threatening its interests in the Gulf. “We’ll see what happens with Iran. If they do anything, it will be a very bad mistake,” U.S. President Donald Trump said, reports Forbes.

Rabat – According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 1.4 million Moroccans were undernourished over 2015-2017, compared to a slightly lower number of 1.3 million in 2014/2016. By “undernourished”, the FAO means that for at least one year, 1.4 million Moroccans were  in a state of inability to acquire enough food to meet their dietary energy requirements. The FAO released the figures last week in its annual report  “Near East and North Africa Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition,” which contains statistics up to 2017. According to the report, 52 million people in the Near East and North Africa region are undernourished, that is they are facing chronic food deprivation. These figures don’t include data from Bahrain, Libya, Qatar, Palestine and Syria, so the actual figures may in fact be much higher. 5.7% of Moroccans were affected by “severe food insecurity” over the 2015/2017 period, the report also found. The numbers have increased since 2014/2016, where 5.1% of Moroccans were affected. For the FAO, severe food insecurity means a lack of secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life. Food insecurity can exist because of unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate distribution or inadequate use of food at the household level. The rise in figures may be explained by the severe drought Morocco suffered from in 2016, the worst in 30 years, which significantly impacted on cereal production across the country. 120 000 people lost their jobs in the agriculture sector between 2015 and 2016, and the country experienced a 3.3% overall drop in GDP that year.

Rabat – The twenty-four suspects charged in connection with the Imlil murders will face trial on May 16.  The suspects will face different charges based on their involvement in the killing of two Scandinavian tourists in December 2018. The list of the defendants includes four main perpetrators, who posted a video pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi just a few days after the murder. Moroccan television channel 2M has listed the suspects of the charges will face for their direct connection to the double murder. The group of defendants on trial includes Younes Ouzayed, Rashid Afatti, Abderrahman El Khyali, and Abdessamad Al Joud. Al Joud is considered the leader of the group, and is facing charges of “forming a gang to commit terror crimes and intentionally assaulting the life of persons premeditatedly.” He will also be prosecuted for inciting people to commit terrorist acts, praising terrorism, and promoting extremism. Further charges include using weapons and attempting to manufacture explosives, and plotting activities to undermine national security. The suspect will also be charged for reoffending. Ouzayed will face the same charges as Al Joud although he is not a repeat offender. Ouzayed will face charges of forming a gang, and committing terror acts, as well as harming people’s lives intentionally. Like Al Joud, he will also be prosecuted for inciting people to commit terror crimes, and praising terrorism, as well as participating in unauthorized activities. Affati, who filmed the crime committed by Al Joud and Ouzayed, will be charged with forming a gang to commit terrorism, as well as committing violence. He will also face charges of attempting to manufacturer terror explosives to undermine the stability and security of the country. El Khyali, the fourth key defendant in the case, traveled with the other suspects to Imlil for the murder of the two Scandinavian tourists before returning to Marrakech to find a hideout. El Khayli will be prosecuted for committing terrorist crimes, forming a cell, murder, attempting to manufacture explosives to undermine the stability of the country. He also faces the same terrorism charges as the three other suspects.  Twenty more Defendants Prosecutors are charging the 20 other suspects with involvement in the murders of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland which caused national and international trauma in December of last year. The list of the suspects includes one Swiss-Spanish defendant. In April, Moroccan news agency Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that a Moroccan court sentenced another Swiss national on separate charges to 10 years in prison. The suspect was convicted of “setting up of a gang to prepare and committing terrorist acts aimed at seriously undermining public order, and defending, organizing and failing to report terrorist crimes and acts.” On December 17, 2018, Moroccan authorities found two bodies of Scandinavian tourists near Mount Toubkal in the Atlas Mountains. Moroccan police revealed that the two tourists were beheaded. A video showing two men decapitating a European woman went viral on social media days after authorities found the bodies of the two Scandinavian tourists. The timing of the post shocked international and local people, who linked the video with the murders. Moroccan police did not comment on whether the video depicted the crime, but Norwegian police said they had no reason to believe the video was not connected with the Imil murders. Suspects convicted of terror-related charges may be sentenced with  10 to 20 years in prison depending on the extent of their involvement in the crime.  The suspects appeared at court in Sale on May 2, but a decision was made to postpone the trial give the defence lawyers time to “prepare.” The twenty-four defendants will now appear in court on May 16.

By Bouchra Rafi Rabat  – A new Moroccan comedy duo named “Les Inqualifiables” recently produced and performed their own comedy tour in the United States.  The show, entitled “Si’a moi y’a toi” (If there’s me, there’s you), was first performed on April 4, 2019, in New York where the tour began and closed in Los Angeles on April 19.  Prior to coming to the US, Les Inqualifiables performed in Canada, where they met Simo Squalli, CEO of Agence Qenza, the co-producer of their North American tour. The two comedians performed for the Moroccan-American community in cities like Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Orlando, Houston, San Diego, and Los Angeles, as well as in states like Virginia and New York. “These two comedians are hilarious and I had a great and memorable time watching them. It was worth every penny and worth the two-hour drive. I cannot wait to see them again and I highly recommend them to all my Moroccan friends,” said Imane Sabahhi, who is an American of Moroccan descent. When they are not cracking jokes, the two comedians continue to work. Oubeid Allah Hlal is a resident physician of cardiology, practicing medicine, while Amine Belghazi, who holds a Masters degree in marketing management, manages the comedy team’s tours and production.  “Les Inqualifiables” is the product of their long friendship, which began in high school. When they started performing five years ago in their hometown of Rabat, the two comedians never imagined that their dream of performing in the US, especially in Los Angeles, would ever come true. “Amine and I were together driving in the car after our very first show. We said to each other that we really need to go to the USA. We need to go perform there. At that time, it seemed far…very far away,” Hlal recalled in an interview with MWN. Since those early days, the artists have developed their skills in different comedy genres like stand up, sketch, improvisational and anecdotal amongst others. They also collaborate with other Moroccans and invited guests of honor. Both Fehd Benchemsi and Mourad Zaoui were featured in the Los Angeles show. “Les Inqualifiables” can be seen at the 5th Annual Ramadan Festival ‘Aji T’hdm’ (Come Digest). The two comedians will perform on Friday, May 17, 2019, at the Mohammed V Theater, Rabat.

Rabat – Mawazine’s Nahda stage is dedicated solely to Arabic music annually, with artists from Lebanon, Egypt, Palestine, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates performing this year. Kicking off Mawazine’s opening festival this year on Friday, June 21, is Marrakech native Mohamed Reda, a singer representing the new generation of Moroccan music. The singer has 2 studio albums under his belt and has performed dozens of shows both in Morocco and abroad.  Following his performance is Lebanese singer Carole Samaha.

Taking over the stage next is Lebanese singer Assi El Hallani, commonly referred to as the “Knight of Arab music.” El Helani’s musical career started after winning Studio Al Fan, a TV program for young artists, at the age of 17. The prolific artist has since released over 25 albums. On Sunday, June 23, the evening will begin with a performance from Egyptian duo Oka Wi Ortega, composed of Mohamed Salah and Ahmed Metwali. The duo’s mix of Egyptian folk music with modern hip hop has gained them a large social media following.

The singer has made her name by combining different styles, mixing modern influences with traditional Arabic music. On Monday, June 24, Palestine will be represented by Mohammed Assaf. The singer made his name by winning “Arab Idol” in 2013 and has since released four successful albums and been appointed the Ambassador of Culture and Arts in Palestine. Warming up the crowd for him that night is Egyptian singer Saad El Soghayar, nicknamed the “the prince of chaabi” for his perfect fusion of oriental pop influences with traditional Egyptian styles. On Tuesday, June 25, Lebanese singer Elissa will take the Nahda stage. Elissa is considered one of the best Arab singers in the world, having sold more than 45 million albums to date. Elissa won Middle East’s Best Singer Award at the World Music Awards in 2005, 2006 and 2010. Just before she takes the stage, the audience will be treated to a performance from singer-songwriter Hamid Hadri, a Chefchaouen native. Hadri began his career as an actor before winning first place at the Star Academy Maghreb in 2007 and kicking off a successful music career. On Wednesday, June 26, one of Jordan’s most famous singers, Diana Karazon, will kick off the night. Karazon rose to fame after winning the first season of SuperStar in 2003 and has held the spotlight ever since. She combines Egyptian, Lebanese, Khaliji and Jordanian dialects in her music. After Karazon, Lebanese singer Walid Toufic is up next. Toufic has been in the public eye since his high-profile acting performances beginning in 1973. His musical career is just as prolific, with a repertoire of over 600 songs.  Another Lebanese singer will take the stage on Thursday, June 27, with a performance from singer Ramy Ayach. The pop star rose to fame in 1997 after winning the first prize in the talent show competition “Studio Al Fan.” Since then, he has become an icon of Arab pop music with many hit singles such as Albi Mal and Majnoun. Opening for Ayach that night is Moroccan star Hasna Zalagh, who released her debut album in 2009 and has since made a name for herself with her strong voice.  Mawazine’s closing weekend at the Nahda stage will begin on Friday, June 28,  with a performance from Egyptian composer and singer Abu.

The young pop star began her career in 2012 by winning the first prize in the singing competition of the Egyptian Opera House. She also participated in X-Factor (2013) and the 9th season of Arab Star Academy. The young star then went on to release numerous singles and video clips. Mawazine will finish with a bang at the Nahda stage with Emirati star Hussain Al Jassmi taking the stage. In 2008, he received the Golden Murex Award for Best Arab Singer and was nominated three times at the World Music Awards.

Rabat – Sixty-three years since its creation, the annual celebrations will pay tribute on Tuesday to the men and women of the Royal Armed Forces (FAR), and highlight their sacrifice and dedication to their country. Throughout Morocco, lavish events have been organized to celebrate all parts of the Moroccan armed forces – including its components on land, at sea, and in the air. 63 years after its creation in 1956, in a newly independent Morocco, the FAR embodies the national pride and unity of the Kingdom. The Moroccan army was first developed into a modern force by the late King Mohammed V, who decided it was a necessary symbol of Moroccan national sovereignty. It was left to his son and heir, the late King Hassan II, to further develop the military.  Since ascending to the throne, King Mohammed VI has continued development of the army, and has made it into the powerful organization it is today. It is Africa’s 7th strongest military, according to the Global Fire Power index. As Supreme Head and Chief of Staff of the Royal Armed Forces, King Mohammed has increased the army’s capabilities and the FAR has seen rapid development, including the addition of efficient artillery batteries and new models of powerful modern tanks.  In an address to FAR at last year’s celebrations, the 62nd anniversary of their creation, the King announced that “we made sure to guarantee all the means required and the material and human resources needed to upgrade military equipment and improve your expertise,” and highlighted the “modernization of its infrastructure and equipment”.  The FAR not only carries out a range of missions at a national level but also operates widely in the international community in order to maintain peace and security at home and abroad. At last year’s address, the King noted that “the fruits of this cooperation, bilateral and multilateral, are clearly manifested in what our country presents as facilities and aids to our African brothers, by welcoming the members… in all specialties on an equal footing with their Moroccan brothers.”

Rabat – The National Democratic Finance Union (SNDF) affiliated to the Moroccan national Union of Workers (UMT) has announced its decision to launch a petition to express solidarity with secretary general of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Zouhair Chorfi. Chorfi has recently accused Morocco’s private clinics of a “major underreporting” of their taxable income. UMT shared a statement after a meeting held on May 11 to announce its decision to support Chorfi, who is facing a complaint filed by the National Association of Private Clinics (ANCP) after his accusations. ANCP “strongly condemned” Chorfi’s accusation in a statement last week, saying that “it was lamentable” that high-profile public servant “formally accuses doctors,” of wrongdoing.  In response, UMT called on the Directorate General of Taxes to share data to show the name of private clinics and doctors who do not pay their taxes. The union will also organize a sit-in on May 21 in front of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to support Chorfi’s accusation against private sector doctors.  In addition, UMT also urged citizens to boycott private clinics and private sector doctors who do not pay their taxes. Chorfi’s accusation comes after Moroccan officials shared alarming data to warn of the challenges facing the tax system in Morocco. Government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said earlier this year that “many Moroccans, especially those working in the liberal professions, do not regularize their situation by not filing their tax declarations, whether in terms of income tax, value added, and corporate tax.” El Khalfi said that that 80% of the Value Added Tax (VAT) is paid by only 1.6% of taxpayers. The official added that only 33% of companies report their corporate gains, resulting in low tax compliance and many challenges, especially lack of fiscal neutrality.

Rabat – A video of a man at the wheel of a truck showing the Moroccan flag is circulating on Facebook. The man is making a spectacle on the streets of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by not only draping the flag outside his truck window but also holding a copy of the American-Moroccan Peace Treaty of 1787. The video shows at least four local police vehicles attending. The man, who appears to be an African-American speaks perfect colloquial American English. In the video, the man claims to be a moor (Amazigh or Berber). At one point in the video he yells to police, “this is my land…I’m a moor.” Considering that the Amazigh people do not own public streets in Penn., it is unclear what the man meant. His ethnicity is not confirmed, but the conviction with which he calls himself a moor is convincing enough to halt the police in action. While the police presence is enough backup to handle to the man’s public outburst, the officers appear to be hesitant and confused as the man yells, “I ain’t in none of y’all’s jurisdiction…[you’re] getting ready to get sued!” In other words, the man threatens a lawsuit and claims that the police do not have the power to disturb him. Why the police’s approached the individual in the first place is unclear. The three police officers simply huddle around the man’s white truck, tapping their feet, occasionally offering a pad with a citation for the man to sign. The man refuses, incoherently shouting what seems to be conspiracy ideas, “We don’t play their [obscene] games with these fake cops, fictitious entities, corporations. That’s what it’s there for. That’s why their women love us.” Behind the cellphone camera, a spectator comments on events with profanity, “My man is going [off]…This ain’t no [lie]..my man threw the flag out the [obsecenity] whip.” Though his comments are spirited, the person filming demonstrates no clear signs of understanding that the flag represents Morocco, nor any understanding of the intentions behind the man with the Moroccan flag. The cameraman seems to support the driver’s resistance against the police, as he cheers, “[this is] stuff you need to know, fellas, ladies…you see they ain’t touch him.” Even when the driver shouts, “Article six!” the person filming provides no insight, only enthusiasm for the rebellion. Article six of The Treaty of Peace and Friendship states: “If any Moor shall bring Citizens of the United States or their Effects to His Majesty, the Citizens shall immediately be set at Liberty and the Effects restored, and in like Manner, if any Moor not a Subject of these Dominions shall make Prize of any of the Citizens of America or their Effects and bring them into any of the Ports of His Majesty, they shall be immediately released, as they will then be considered as under His Majesty’s Protection.” One must then assume that the reason for the anonymous self-identified moor’s refusal to comply with the police is that he believes himself “protected” by the king of Morocco. There are several problems with this interpretation, though. The clause is about protecting American citizens should they appear before the king of Morocco. This man, however, is claiming to be a moor. Secondly, it is uncertain whether he has been in the presence of King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Another mystery is in the treaty itself: If one were set free by the king, does this entail the right to resist the American police? If not, what does the document actually mean by the word “Liberty.” In simplest terms, this video is of a man who believes he has legal immunity, all due to his misinterpretation of the Moroccan-American peace treaty, signed over two centuries ago. The bystander filming likely doesn’t understand what the man is saying but supports that his rhetoric does, indeed, protect him from the American police.

French Central Directorate of the Judicial Police launched the investigation in collaboration with Morocco’s security services and Spanish police, which provided “valuable elements for the investigation,” added the statement. The amount of the cannabis seized on Friday is a record since 1999; when police busted 23.5 tons of cannabis in Boulogne-sur-mer, in the north of France, added AFP. Morocco maintains strong diplomatic ties with France and Spain, with which the North African country share a counterterrorism collaboration. Throughout the year, Morocco’s police raided on several drug trafficking networks, seizing big amounts of multiple sorts of drugs, including cocaine, and cannabis.

Rabat – The former Salafi scholar Mohammed Abdelouahab Rafiqui, widely known as Abou Hafs, has raised a controversial issue with regard to whether cosmetics, perfumes, and toothpaste nullify a Muslim’s fasting in Ramadan. As usual, Rafiqi’s opinions do not always win the approval of many of his followers on social media, prompting hostilities and criticism of his arguments, which sometimes amount to death threats. Rafiqui posted on Facebook on Wednesday, May 8, questioning the link between fasting, that is abstaining from food, water and sexual intercourse from dawn to dusk, and wearing makeup. The next day, May 9, he wrote another post explaining his rejection of some of the practices Moroccans uphold during Ramadan. Rafiqui’s religious opinion seemingly runs counter to the wider religious narrative Muslims are accustomed to, which asserts that fasting is refraining from wearing all sorts of cosmetics, beauty products, as well as partaking of food, water, sexual activity, and immoral behavior, such as stealing. Rafiqui argues that doing away with beauty and sanitary products, which he considers instilled in the popular imagination of some, if not all, Muslims, is “one of the misconceptions” linked to observing Ramadan. Rafiqui frowned on the practice of not brushing one’s teeth or wearing anti-perspirants, saying these people “harm” others with their bad breath and pungent body odor. Rafiqui implicitly chastised religious opinions which prohibit especially women from wearing perfumes, which he regards an essential part of their day-to-day “beauty and elegance.” Rafiqui makes veiled references to some clerics who hold such religious opinions, which he said are promoting “ugliness” and “filth” during a holy month that should otherwise be symbolic of mercy and strong social ties, not on harming others. “Other than food, water, sexual activity, nothing invalidates one’s fasting,” he concluded, adding that there is no way we could engage in day-to-day socialization if we are disgusted by one another.  Rafiqui eventually called on Muslims to abandon such attitudes, recalling an excerpt from a hadith which says, “Allah is Beautiful, He loves beauty.” In this regard, Mohammed Fizazi, a reformed Moroccan Salafi-Jihadi figure, begged to differ, especially on the part concerning women, where he wondered whether Rafiqi is talking about women using beauty products inside or outside their homes.  Fizazi point-blank asserted that women should not at all go out spruced up with makeup and perfumes, let alone during Ramadan, simply because it is something he considered divinely prescribed.

Rabat – Contractual teachers broke their strike, resuming classes on Monday, April 29 after months on the picket lines. Nearly two weeks later the  Ministry of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research entered into talks on Friday, May 10, to negotiate a mutual agreement with representatives of teaching bodies, including trade unions and syndicates, in the hopes of ending the crisis. According to members of the teachers’ representatives, the outcomes of the meeting include setting  a second meeting on May 23, provided that both parties relinquish their high demands to facilitate“open dialogue.”  During the meeting, the Ministry of Education  promised that it will refer contractual teachers’ demands to the government amid a rising wave of week-long strikes. Cell 9 teachers, made up of 4700 teachers, are currently staging a demonstration at the Parliament building in the capital of Rabat. Previous Meetings During the heat of protests in Rabat and across a number of Moroccan cities, the two bodies held several meeting which did not reach a resolution, as both the education ministry and teachers’ representatives accused each other of going back on the promises made at the 13 April Meeting.  Despite returning back to work “for the sake of students,” contractual teachers, who are still threatening to hit the streets again, wore badges symbolic of ongoing protests. Teachers’ Demands Ever since the first strike broke out in Rabat in February 20, contractual teachers have been protesting employment under fixed-term contracts, which they regard “discriminatory” in that it does not guarantee them the same rights teachers on permanent contracts enjoy.  For teachers, calling for the abolition of fixed-term contracts meant enjoying social, financial, and psychological stability and no longer working “on the whims” of academy officials school directors, or inspectors, who can terminate the contract at any time under the current terms. Teachers resorted to all sorts of protesting measures to put pressure on the government to have their demands met. The education system is going through a period of turbulence not only at the level of staff, but also in terms of  pedagogical direction, where the language of instruction has divided opinion between pro-Arabic and Amazigh and pro-French. However, the possibility of cooperation between the Ministry of Education and the teachers’ unions brings some hope of an end to the crisis.

Rabat – A 25-year old Moroccan man was stabbed to death after a fight in the El Gerco de Reus neighborhood in Tarragona, Spain. Spanish news outlet El Caso reported that the incident took place on Sunday afternoon. The perpetrator has been arrested. The suspect, according to the Spanish news outlet,  is a 27-year old Guinean national. He fled the site of the incident after stabbing his victim. Police sources told the Spanish news outlet that the stabbing “could be the consequence of a fight that took place days ago,” suggesting that the stabbing was a “revenge.” Police arrived at the scene after the Moroccan victim had been stabbed and was battling for his life.

Nyirishema also added that “we can also work with other regulators across Africa and strengthen this field of radiation protection and nuclear security within Africa and have a bigger voice on the global level.”

By Taib Biygautane Rabat – The anti-Muslim overnight attacks on Muslim properties in Chilaw village, Sri Lanka, were allegedly triggered by a Muslim storekeeper’s post on Facebook, said Reuters sources. The attacks damaged “several mosques and Muslim homes,” reported Reuters. “There was glass everywhere at the Abrar mosque in the Muslim-majority town of Kiniyama that was attacked overnight. All the windows and doors of the soft-pink building were smashed and copies of the Quran were thrown onto the floor,” added the same source. In response to these attacks, Sri Lankan authorities temporarily suspended social media accounts, including WhatsApp and Facebook, in an attempt to curb online calls for violence.  “Social media blocked again as a temporary measure to maintain peace in the country,” said the director general of the government information department, Nalaka Kaluwewa. Police had also implemented a curfew during the attacks last night in order to “control the situation,” said Sri Lanki forces spokesperson, Sumith Atapattu. Police extended the curfew on Monday morning. Sri Lankan authorities have confirmed the arrest of Abdul Hameed Mohamed Hasmar, a shopkeeper whose Facebook post, “1 day u will cry,” is said to have been “interpreted as threatening violence,” reported Reuters. Since last month’s terror attacks on Sri Lanka, for which Daesh claimed responsibility, Muslim minorities reported frequent acts of harassment complaints. The Sri Lankan government has recently responded to these complaints by setting up a police hotline for Muslims to report any new acts of harassment. Over two thirds, 70%, of Sri Lankans are Buddhist, with the remaining 30% belong to Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity.

Rabat – A boat carrying a group of illegal migrants sank in the Mediterranean sea trying to reach Italy from Libya, killing at least 60, while 16 survivors, including 14 Bangladeshis, a Moroccan, and an Egyptian were rescued by a Tunisian fishing ship, on Saturday. After spending 8 hours in cold water, the fishing ship crew spotted the castaways 60 kilometers off the coastal Tunisian city of Sfax after their ship sunk on Friday night. The 16 survivors are being housed in a Red Crescent emergency shelter in Zarzis, southern Tunisia. One of the Bangladeshi survivors, Ahmed Bilal, told France Press Agency, AFP, about his journey starting from leaving Bangladesh to being in the Mediterranean. Originally from the region of Sylhet, northeastern Bangladesh, Bilal left his village along with four villagers six months ago. “My family has sold our land, where we harvested rice once per year. They hope becoming like other families who have someone of their own in Europe,” he stated. A Bangladeshi broker had promised them an easier life in Europe in exchange for $7,000. “People call him ‘Good Luck,’ he said that we will have a better life and we believed him,” Bilal explained. Bilal, who saw his cousin and step-brother die before his eyes, is convinced that most of the people the broker send to Europe ‘die on the way.’ The villagers flew from Dakka to Dubai, and then to Istanbul and finally to Tripoli. They ended up with a group of 80 Bangladeshis locked in a room in western Libya for three months. “I already thought that I was going to die in Libya, we had food once a day, sometimes less, there was one restroom for everyone and we could not shower, except teeth. We were crying, we were always asking for food all the time,” added Bilal. On Thursday evening, smugglers took around 75 to 80 people in a rubber boat heading to Italy. The majority of the migrants were Bangladeshi, there were also Egyptians, nine Moroccans, some Chadians, as well as other nationalities. “We started sinking almost immediately, around midnight,” said an Egyptian survivor, Manzour Mohammed Metwella, aged 21. “We swam all night,” he added. “They died one by one, every minute, we were losing someone,” Bilal told AFP. “I myself was giving up but god sent fishermen to save us, if they had arrived ten minutes later, I think I would have let go,” explained Bilal. A Red Crescent official in southern Tunisia, Mongi Slim, has said that if the Tunisian fishermen had not seen them, they would never have known about the shipwreck.  The shipwreck happened as a vessel from the EU’s anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling naval operation in the Mediterranean (Operation Sophia) withdrew from the eastern Mediterranean. The castaways have 60 days to decide whether they want to go home, seek asylum through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), or to stay in Tunisia. Bilal appeared determined to reach Europe but this time not by the sea. “We have lost so much, I have nothing left, we are still hoping to go to Europe to make enough money and come home,” explains Bilal. “I never want to go to sea again,” he added.

Rabat – In its report  “Sand and Sustainability,” the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has put the spotlight on Morocco’s illegal sand extraction activities. The report uses Morocco as a special case study on sand mafias, drawing attention to the problem of illegal sand mining on Moroccan beaches. Sand is crucial to development. It is used to make concrete, asphalt and glass, and therefore plays a key role in industrial and construction work. According to the UN report, crushed rock, sand, and gravel account for the largest volume of extracted solid material around the world.  The report reminds that global demand for sand is rising, with construction industries around the world rushing to meet the demands of a growing population and rapid infrastructure development projects. But sand is a finite resource and its uncontrolled extraction can have serious environmental and social impacts. The global sand industry is “fragmented and informal,” the UN report noted. And while some sand extraction is carried out by regulated multinational companies, it is also carried out illegally. In cases of illegal extraction, the impact is much harder to control. Illegal sand extraction in Morocco In Morocco, half of the sand extraction, around 10 million cubic meters a year, comes from illegal coastal sand extraction, according to the UNEP. The sand is often removed from beaches to build hotels, roads and other tourism-related infrastructure. Ironically, the extraction of sand has in turn caused the destruction of the main tourist attraction itself: the beach. The report particularly draws attention to the coastline between Safi and Essaouira, halfway up the Moroccan coastline, noting sand smugglers have transformed the beach into a rocky landscape. Asilah, a coastal town in Morocco’s far north, has also suffered from illegal sand extraction. A 2016 investigation by Middle East Eye revealed the scale of illegal sand mining in the town. During the tourism construction boom in 2012-2014, to lower costs, builders began extracting sand from the beach to mix their own cement. Moroccan men from the city who would come down to the beach with shovels and flour sacks, filling them up and taking them to nearby construction sites. “In areas where the digging was most extreme, the beach was left resembling the surface of the moon.” UNEP is now echoing similar concerns, noting that Assilah has suffered severe erosion of its beaches due to regulatory issues and tourism pressures. In March this year, dredging at Imsouane beach north of Agadir sparked debate after Moroccan NGO Surfrider Foundation Maroc posted a video online showing bulldozers digging up sand from the beach. Named one of the world’s most beautiful beaches in 2017 by Forbes, Imsouane is a popular spot for surfers. The National Port Agency (ANP), the Moroccan body responsible for the sand extraction, responded that the dredging was legal and regularly undertaken to maintain the port.

Since then, she has gone on a world tour and performed dozens of shows in India and internationally.  Iran will be featured next on Thursday, June 27, with a performance from dancer Shahrokh Moshkin Ghalam. Ghalam’s choreography is based on Persian classical music that brings myths, poetry, and dance together. The Iranian artist works with 5 musicians: the singer Aïda Nosrat, a virtuoso player of tar and musical director, Sogol Mirzaï, kanoun player Christine Zayed and the percussionist Saghar Khadem. On Friday, June 28, the Chellah stage will feature the sounds of Eastern Europe again with the Dan Gharibian Trio.

Mawazine will finish with a bang on Saturday, June 29, with a performance from Luis de la Carrasca, one of the icons of Spanish flamenco music. The self-taught Granada artist made his name in the 1990s thanks to his unique style and taste for stage production.  Mawazine, a festival in Rabat with six venues, will take place from June 21 to June 29, and is organized by Maroc Cultures under the patronage of King Mohammed VI. Having drawn over 2.5 million attendees in recent years, Mawazine is the second largest music festival in the world, after Donauinselfest in Vienna, and the largest festival in Africa. The festival brings in artists from countries all over the world as well as highlighting local Moroccan musicians. Last year, the festival saw major international acts perform such as Martin Garrix, Bruno Mars, Luis Fonsi, and The Weeknd. The festival lists the democratization of culture in Morocco as one of its initiatives and provides free access to 90 percent of its shows each year.

Rabat –  Irish police have managed to identify the suspect behind the killing of a Moroccan teenager, who was stabbed to death last Friday in Finsbury Park, Dundrum in Dublin. The Irish Times reported that the police identified a teenage suspect from south Dublin for the stabbing of Azzam Regragui. The news outlet quoted sources from Irish police, otherwise known as Gardai, who said that investigators are in contact with the suspect and his family. The Irish Times added that the suspect  is connected with a group of men from south Dublin, who have “engaged in serious violence in the past.” “On one occasion when a drug search was attempted on one of the men, serious violence ensued,” said the news outlet. The Independent reported that the suspect claimed he acted in “self-defence when he fatally stabbed” the Moroccan victim. No arrests have been made, but a witness has been assisting police in their investigation. The witness, who saw the fatal stabbing of the  18-year old Moroccan victim, went to the police station on Saturday. “Unprovoked attack” The Moroccan Community in Ireland has mourned the death of the 18-year old. In a Facebook post, the community  said that Azzam was known to be “so friendly, helpful and easy going.” “It is with a heavy heart we have to inform you that our young Moroccan Irish aged 18 was stabbed in Dundrum in an unprovoked attack and unfortunately he has died.,”  The Facebook page also expressed condolences to his family and the whole Moroccan Irish community for the “terrible tragedy.”  Although the police ruled out hate crime, Waterford Against Racism Facebook page said in a post that “those who are actively spreading  hatred through online channels must take some of the responsibility for the rise in attacks on Muslims.” Waterform Against Racism warned that “Islamophobia is racism.” The Moroccan victim was killed while walking to a breaking fast ceremony held in a local mosque. Emergency services called to the scene attempted to save the 18-year old after the stabbing. Despite medical intervention, the violent attack claimed the life of the Moroccan teenager shortly after he was transferred to the hospital.  A video showing his family and friends mourning went viral after the murder. The victim’s devout mother  asked people surrounding her son at the hospital to pray and to not feel sad because “God chose him in this holy month.”  “He died in this holy month and on Friday before Iftar.” She also asked that people remain calm, read the Quran, and pray for her son, reciting a dua or prayer.

Washington D.C. – According to the same source, in addition to money spent to lobby both branches of the US government (the Executive and both Houses of Congress), the Moroccan government signed a  contract of $480,000 per year with ThirdCircle to promote Morocco as a film destination as well as “world-class golf destination.”   Since January 2018, JPC Strategies has become Morocco’s main lobbying arm in the United States. According to FARA, JPC has been paid $75,000 a month to lobby in favor of Morocco. JPC has subcontracted three other lobbying firms: Iron Bridge Strategies, the Glover Park Group and SGR Government Relations &amp; Lobbying. They aim to promote Morocco-US relations, defend Morocco’s strategic interests, educate US officials and lawmakers about the depth of the strategic alliance between the two countries and promote American investments in Morocco. Though it is not included specifically in their lobbying contract, the Western Sahara is at the heart of these firms’ advocacy work in favor of Morocco. Algerian Lobbying For decades, Algeria has claimed that it has no vested interests in the Western Sahara conflict and only seeks to help the Saharawis to exercise their right to self-determination. Despite their claims,  $480,000 was spent in 2018 to block Morocco’s attempts to achieve any breakthrough in the conflict. For the past two decades, Foley Hoag has been Algeria’s main lobbying firm in Washington. The Washington-based firm has a $420,000 per year contract to Algeria. The registration form that Foley Hoag submitted to FARA shows that the lobbying firm has received $210,000 between October 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019. Foley Hoag held more than 40 meetings and exchanges with members of Congress, the State Department, as well as the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, a bipartisan caucus of the House of Representatives that includes 37 US representatives. The main topic of those meetings was “the promotion of Algeria-US relations and respect for human rights, including the rights to self-determination.” Foley Hoag executives had three exchanges with Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) and Patrick Lehay (D-VT), the most vocal supporters of the Polisario in the US Senate, as well as Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), one of the top rated US lawmakers in the defense of human rights. In a new push to prevent Morocco from swaying US officials and lawmakers into supporting its position on the conflict, Algeria signed a $360,000 per year contract with the Keene Consulting Services as of November 1, 2018.   Keene Consulting Services is owned by David Keene, a former head of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and a close friend of the US National Security Advisor John Bolton. According to the contract, Keene’s lobbying tasks included: mobilizing media and public support for Algeria, promoting Algeria’s peacemaking role in regional and global affairs, advancing Algeria’s trade and business interests with the US government, and enhancing Algeria’s image in the American public discourse. The overarching goal was to work with several branches of US policymaking to “facilitate a greater understanding of Algeria’s concerns and positions on various issues.” Keene’s statements suggest that the contract included aggressive anti-Moroccan public relations efforts on the Western Sahara issue. In opinion articles and other public statements, Keene repeatedly referenced Morocco’s “occupation” and “colonization” of Western Sahara. One notable example is a December 2010 op-ed from the Hill in which Keene accused “Moroccan forces” of disregarding the UN-imposed status quo in Western Sahara by resorting to police violence to threaten “our friends in the desert.” Keene claimed that Morocco twisted historical facts to convince the US and the international community of its “little more than fiction[al]” claims over Western Sahara. Morocco’s response Based on the latest developments in the Western Sahara, it appears that Algeria has failed in creating a setback for Morocco’s diplomatic efforts to garner wider international support to its position on the Western Sahara. While there is no way to measure whether Morocco’s lobbying firms have fulfilled their mandate to the fullest, the fact remains that Morocco’s diplomatic efforts have demonstrated to be successful. Morocco has succeeded in preventing any negative development that would have otherwise negatively impacted Morocco’s stance on the Western Sahara issue.   Morocco succeeded in maintaining its diplomatic achievements in recent years, despite Algeria’s counter-attempts to promote its position in the Trump administration through Bolton. Morocco succeeded in swinging the momentum in its favor in the second half of 2018 through increases of lobbying budgets and relentless efforts in the realm of public relations. The success of Morocco’s response to Algerian lobbying is most visible in the UN Security Council’s latest resolutions, which upheld Morocco’s frequent requests to regard Algeria as a party in the Western Sahara conflict.    In Resolution 2440 of October 2018, the UN referred to Algeria 3 times, suggesting a gradual shift to considering Algiers as a full-fledged party in the Western Sahara conflict, rather than a neighbor or observer state as it has claimed to be in the past. Resolution 2468, the latest UN resolution on Western Sahara, is perhaps the most Morocco-friendly UN document in decades.   In addition to further acknowledging Algeria’s primary role in the conflict and the settlement process, Resolution 2468 adopted almost the same language as Moroccan diplomacy, pointing out that pragmatism, realism, and compromise are the only way to achieve a long, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution to the conflict. Because it emphasizes a compromise-based solution, many analysts have suggested, Resolution 2468 is also a validation—albeit diplomatically articulated—of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. For all the pro-Morocco discussion currently surrounding the Western Sahara dossier, it remains to be seen whether Algeria, which Morocco reportedly outworked due to a raging domestic crisis, will easily surrender to the current momentum in the UN-led process.

Rabat – In a video published just days before the final games of the CAF Confederation Cup, Mortada Mansour, the president of Al Zamalek sports club, addressed a message to Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of the the president of both the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) and the Moroccan football club Nahdat Berkane (RS Berkane).  Assuming that Lekjaa cherry-picked referees to oversee his clubs’ games, Mansour said in a warning tone that Lekjaa should equally treat the Egyptian football club Al Zamalek if he wanted his club treated the same way in Egypt. “If you respected our team and stuff and our country,” said Mansour, “we would reciprocate the same respect to yours.” The Egyptian was referring to the sounding of of alarm bells to wake up the Tunisian Sfax club at 5 a.m on the day of the semi-final away game in Morocco. Mansour warned Lekjaa against distorting the Moroccan-Egyptian relations through such attitude, which he said is not characteristic of Moroccans.  Zamalek and RS Berkane will face each other in the African Confederation final in a two-leg confrontation in late May. The first leg is scheduled for May 19 in Morocco, with Zamalek hosting the second leg a week later.

Despite medical intervention at the scene, the fatal stabbing claimed the life of the Moroccan teenager who succumbed to his wounds at the St James’s Hospital, a short time after he was transferred. No arrest has been reported in connection with the murder. A video has gone viral, showing the victim’s mother crying after the death of her son. “Thanks God, please pray for him. He was killed as a martyr,” said the devout mother. With emotional words, the mother asked people surrounding her son at the hospital to pray and to not feel sad because “God chose him in this holy month.” “He died in this holy month and on Friday before Iftar.” She also asked that people remain calm, read the Quran, and pray for her son, reciting a dua or prayer.

Rabat – German football club Borussia Dortmund announced that its Moroccan international footballer Achraf Hakimi will remain playing in the Bundesliga for another season. The director of the club Michael Zorc told the press that Achraf Hakimi “will not return to Real Madrid this summer; I can rule that out.” He said that the club spoke with Hakimi’s agent, adding, “I read what the players told the press, but he will stay at Dortmund, and we all know this.” Earlier this month, Hakimi said that it “would be a dream” for him to return to Real Madrid. Quoted by Vamos, the footballer said that “it would be a dream for me to return to Real Madrid as soon as possible. I would be lying if I said otherwise.” Hakimi is now recovering from an injury he received during a football game against Wolfsburg in March. The footballer, however, is expected to appear soon with the Atlas Lions in the 2019 African Cup of Nations (CAN). The 20-year-old footballer has been making an important impact in the German league since joining Dortmund in the summer transfer window of 2018. Achraf Hakimi joined Borussia in July 2018 on loan from Real Madrid. Dortmund, however, hoped to secure a permanent contract with the Atlas Lion. In February 2018, the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) ranked the Moroccan star among Europe’s 50 Most Promising Under-20 footballers. That December, Hakimi won a second Bundesliga Rookie of the Month Award.

Rabat – Spanish law enforcement announced today that 52 undocumented sub-Saharan migrants climbed the fence separating the north-eastern locality of Ouled M’hammed in the province of Nador from the Spanish enclave of Melilla. Police were able to arrest 40 individuals, while 52 others managed to climb the guarded fence to reach the Spanish enclave. Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported that seven security members and two sub-Saharans were injured during the attempt. The injured people were taken to Nador’s provincial hospital to receive immediate medical care. The incident comes after a recent interview with Morocco’s migration and border control chief Khalid Zerouali, who at the time of the interview claimed that there had been a notable decrease of irregular migration attempts at the border fences of the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla thanks to Morocco’s efforts to curb the migration issue. Other irregular migration crossings via sea routes and the security fences of the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla have been stopped jointly by Moroccan and Spanish security.  In October 2018, 300 sub-Saharans stormed the Melilla border fence. The incident caused the injury of 12 Moroccan soldiers. Police managed to arrest 141 migrants during the operation. That irregular migration attempt claimed the life of one migrant who fell from the fence while 22 other sub-Saharans were injured by barbed wire.

Rabat – Morocco’s migration and border control chief Khalid Zerouali discussed Morocco’s efforts to curb irregular migration, emphasizing that Morocco’s crackdowns on undocumented migration networks helped reduce pressure on Spain. Zerouali added that 7,202 people managed to reach Spain from Morocco in 2019, “around 2,000 more than in the same period in 2018.” The new statistics were shared with Reuters on Friday, emphasizing that despite the arrival of the irregular migrants in Spain, the number of arrivals decreased sharply over the following three months. The border control chief said that Morocco’s strategy to curb undocumented migration proved to be effective, as Moroccan law enforcement stopped 25,000 irregular migration attempts, up 30% compared to the same period in 2018. He also recognized the decrease of irregular migration attempts at the border fences of the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. In the statement, Zerouali denied rumors of an agreement reached between Spain and Morocco to repatriate migrants rescued at sea. Zerouali added that Moroccan authorities cracked down on 50 irregular migrant trafficking networks active at both the local and international levels in 2019, “up 63 percent compared with a year earlier.” The Spanish government expressed satisfaction with the Rabat-Madrid collaboration during several events and symposiums. In April, Spanish news outlet ABC reported that the Spanish Ministry of the Interior found that the number of irregular migrants in Spain dropped by 52% from April 2018 to April 2019. ABC added that the significant decline is mainly due to Morocco’s success in dismantling irregular migration networks and the security cooperation and information exchange between Morocco and Spain. The collaboration has been recently lauded by Spanish Minister of Defense Margarita Robles, who said that her county has “full confidence in the collaboration” with Morocco. Maintaining strong diplomatic ties, Spain and Morocco reiterated their determination to reinforce their collaboration during several official meetings, especially after the Spanish royal visit to Morocco in mid-February. In a recent interview, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez emphasized the significance of the ties between his country and Morocco, saying that Morocco is a “special ally” for Spain. “Progress and prosperity in Morocco are determining for stability in the Mediterranean and in Spain,” he said.

Rabat – Although Rabat is the political and administrative hub of Morocco, it is often overlooked by tourists and forgotten from itineraries. However, if one wants to escape the bustle and crowds in Marrakech or Fez, Rabat is the perfect place and has no shortage of attractions worth visiting. Its location also makes it a perfect stop for a night between Casablanca and Fez. Hassan Tower (Tour de Hassan) is one of the oldest historical monuments Rabat has to offer. Construction of the mosque began in 1195, after being commissioned by Yaqub al-Mansur, the third caliph of the Almohad Caliphate. He dreamed of the mosque being the largest in the world with the tallest minaret. However, when al-Mansur died 4 years later in 1199, his dream died with him and construction came to a halt.  Although the tower only reached half of its intended height at 40 meters, it is incredibly well preserved and is still a beautiful sight to see 820 years later. The 200 unfinished columns are also striking.      2.  Mohammed V Mausoleum Directly next to Hassan Tower, this mausoleum contains the tombs of King Mohammed V and his sons King Hassan II and Prince Abdallah. The mausoleum took approximately 400 men and almost a decade to build before it was finished in 1971. Its white floors and walls are made from granite and marble, and the roof is tiled in a distinctive green, the color of Islam. The tombs themselves are carved from white onyx.  The sheer craftsmanship and historical significance make this site a must-see. This kasbah dates back to the Almohad Dynasty in the 12th century and is still well preserved. The ancient kasbah gets its name from an Arab tribe, the Oudayas, hired by Sultan Yaqub al-Mansur to defend its wall and build more fortifications.  Having been home to many groups of peoples who all left their mark on the suburb, the history of this neighborhood is deep and fascinating. For example, the winding steps from the kasbah down to the shore were added in the 17th century by Muslims fleeing Catholic Spain, who also gave the nearby Andalusian garden its name.  The winding blue and white streets of this neighborhood leading to ocean views make it a beautiful place to spend the day meandering. Inside the kasbah, one can find Rabat’s oldest mosque, built in the 10th century and restored by an English pirate in the 18th, although it is not open to non-Muslim tourists. The lush Andalusian garden is filled with well-fed cats and a Moorish cafe overlooking the Bouregreg river that serves traditional Moroccan cakes and mint tea. These walled ruins on a site originally settled by the Phoenicians and then controlled by the Romans beginning in A.D. 40, are Rabat’s oldest site. Beautiful enscripted marble pillars and the remains of the Roman forum can still be seen today.  The city became a hub for Christianity in the 2nd century, and although the Romans withdrew in the 5th century it remained a city of Christian Imazighen (Berbers) until they surrendered to Arab Muslims in the 7th century. In 1174, the Almohad Caliphate began turning the site into a necropolis to bury their royals. A minaret was built in 1284 and still stands today, along with much of the necropolis.  In the green gardens behind the ancient tombs, you will see the charming site of a woman surrounded by the dozen of cats she cares for. There is also an eel pond filled with coins at the bottom, where women traditionally go to wish for fertility.

Rabat – On May 10, the self-described Islamic State (IS) declared a new “Wilayat al-Hind” (“Province of India” in Arabic) in Indian territory, reported Reuters.  The announcement came after a reported violent clash between Indian security forces and allegedly IS affiliated members in Shopian, a village in Indian-controlled Kashmir territories.  The alleged IS announcement was released in Amaq News Agency, an IS-affiliated news agency.  The declaration also claimed to have “inflicted casualties on Indian army soldiers,” said Reuters.  IS’s Friday statement coincided with the Indian news reports on the killing of an IS-affiliated militant, Ishfaq Ahmad Sofi, in a violent clash with Indian security forces in Shopian. Reports showed that Sofi had ties with the Islamic State of Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK). The declaration of new territory in India appears to be an attempt to bring life to the Islamic State’s geographical expansion endeavors under the “Caliphate” title, after recently having lost control over significant parts of Syria and Iraq to the Syrian and Iraqi armies.
